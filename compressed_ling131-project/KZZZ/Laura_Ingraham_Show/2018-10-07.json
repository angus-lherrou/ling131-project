long taxed yum to two four six eight ten\nExcuse me as far as the basic uh a technology itself wouldn't change it for the world\nUh this is Paul I'm it might be useful to to clarify something here um we're actually dealing with a couple of different approaches to remote viewing uh Joe uses a one approach a linen I use another\nWe learned or ... or ... essentially for single swan nah it's called controlled remote viewing I used to be called coordinate remote viewing\nJoe uses another a technique which I I don't know what he calls it we tended to call it back in the unit the E R B or extended remote viewing or the goal of both approaches is to essentially control the process\nIn fact I I call it the ... century remote viewing yeah in a very kind of flip was saying is is discipline club once in a way\nThat you have a set of protocols as as a Joe's expressed which help\nOr exclude mental noise a health director of focus your attention\nSo that you you have a a far better\nSo that you you have a a far better chance that you would otherwise have getting specific information that is related to the target and you're trying to address\nAll right I take it in Stargate\nAll the targets were of a military or national security on nature\nAll of the ... ah this is Len all of the real world targets and the tasked targets where now we also had practice targets are that we use just to keep up proficiency and to um\nTo try out new things and uh make sure that we didn't get rusty\nOkay kind of kind of like ah the military out flying a out of following a a seven twenty seven ... seven forty sevens or over the Atlantic\nWell yeah you could say that actually the best thing we found to ever worked with was a pictures cut out of National Geographic magazine's a sealed unarmed elopes and you describe what's what's in the picture describe what's at the site\nSo practice alright sure just one on one of the things uh this is Joe I wanted to add something so that there's no confusion and the the listener's mind uh when we were discussing or when Paul and Lenin I were\nExplaining what it is we do or be your beer or whatever you want to call it\nThose are the the methodologies that each one of his shoes to process the information which may may be different or who the thing I wanted to underscores the fact that for any of those methodologies to be considered valid for remote do they have to be done within a specified protocol\nWhich is this different from the methodology sort of use\nRight in fact this is Paul again I'm I'm almost might make the analogy with a different email programs or you can use your door you can use pagan says to download your email and um they're just different ways of organizing the the data so to speak\nBut the email is the same no matter and you know the content of the same no matter which particular program you used to sort it out with\nNo right well it would be helpful for the audience to really understand what it is you can and can't do can you read minds\nWell [laughter] that's what I call 'em or at least in my experience you can't do it in this in the way that people think of it normally like they see from the science fiction movie or something on TV\nYou cans or obtain impressions are emotions\nOr you can actually obtain information but it's not the same sense has actually knowing what they're thinking instantaneously instantaneously in the same words they might be thinking those thoughts in or whatever you get the information uh but it's not nearly as liberal as a as people conceive that has been\nOkay for example Saddam Hussein could you I'm a target Saddam Hussein and come up with his mood he's intentions or he is a ... in other words what could you come up with\nRegarding Saddam Hussein um oh that would apply to anybody but he certainly a typical target\nRight this is a land oh we did in fact do exactly that to come up with plans and intentions are to come up with a background psychological information such as moods a logical\nAbility uh is is outlook on life philosophy and so forth mainly plans and intentions are ... and this can be done however like Paul says it's not a ah it's not a thing where you you know put the envelope to your head and say the answer is it's a a\nR but use that procedure let me interrupt you said plans or that that would really imply a fairly direct reading somebody's a a a mind do rather than than mood up plans imply we're going to attack Kuwait you know on a certain date\nThat's right mhm and it can be done but it's it's a very it's an advanced level and it's not a light pole says it's not something you just sit down and scribble off\nMay maybe I can add something here that will clarify this is Joe I'm One of the things that you have to understand is that in the function of remote viewing it's not the attenuated a protocol that you might that might exist per se studying pull up at the\nUh what happens in remote doing is you're actually opening to\nAll of the possible delivery systems everything from Claire audience to clear sending arms were once oh up with the re sentiment all those things are delivering bits of information so\nThere's an entire ... Rome or wealth of information that's available depending on how you set up the uh the specific party mechanism\nOh what is the three of you agree that it is the end of secrets as we have known them\nAnd it is the end of secrets as we have known them\nA call here um I I wouldn't say it quite so precisely I'm One of the factors almost let's go back to the mind reading thing one of the things you have for college\nHow confusing everyone's thoughts are anyway I mean we can we can think about one thing while we end up doing something else altogether or if we were reading Saddam Hussein's mind uh you know again not literally like that but if we were doing that\nOr we might pick up in the morning when he's in a bad mood and he intends to invade Kuwait tomorrow and then later on in the afternoon he's already changed his mind decided to do some other time you know [laughter] so are you running every new things like that precise\nOh boy uh that that would be it must be very difficult for the remote bureau when you're dealing with a human target a which would choose as you point out changed its mind\nWhether there's this is Joe there there's inherent problems in remote doing as well it doesn't work all the time\nSo uh if you're operating with a a sixty or Seventy percent file chance of actually uh making contact with a target than you have to also look at the fact that there are times when you're going to be wrong now did you\nMake do say that this is not one hundred percent correct [laughter]\nThat's what I was about to ask never has\nBeen looked to be nice if uh if you can find someone who can do it one hundred percent of the time I Will believe that the aliens around the earth because they're not human\n[laughter] ... ... or ...\nWhat was the three of you say with regard to percentage of a obviously a lot of people I suppose could approach fifty fifty on certain things are how far above that does remote viewing go\nAre actually let me jump in here and say oh this is Len\nOr say that the fifty fifty thing is right or wrong if you have to select until the color of a card for instance you can say red or black you have a fifty fifty chance why don't you have to predict the color of a traffic light then you have a thirty three percent chance right\nIf you have to predict the condition of a certain spot in the desert how many percent\nDo you have chance um\nThe a good point and and also when you when people ask for accuracy they have noted many times that a different\nPeople have reported different amounts of accuracy for a remote view a quote remote viewing which is a general term actually [noise] uh\nWhat would you if you compare your accuracy or if let us say we take a white or black piece of something and put it in an envelope right and compare your accuracy doing remote viewing compared to uh the average Joe's gas how do you do\nI Am glad you ask it that\nWay because I've been doing a new extended experiment on this here lately with a red and black cards and right now I'm at sixty eight point three percent\nAs compared to the average Joe's fifty percent\nFifty percent All right gentlemen old type we're at the bottom of the hour\nThree former Stargate Project Stargate remote viewers men Buchanan draw mechanical and Paul Smith\nRight here the trip back in time continue with art bell host the coast to coast am more somewhere in time coming up\nAnd out of the information they provide a the the accuracy of the information or run anywhere from thirty five to eighty eight percent no there there are times when the grid remote your will get a hundred percent or near a hundred percent quality remote viewing but those are extremely rare\nWhen someone establishes they're they're sort of history over a long period of time so they tend to ah Nineteen years ah that that's the kind of percentage as you can expect\nAre those percentages increased with a team\nNo I'm from a research standpoint uh everything that we have in the database that we've looked at it the kind of science lab\nWould indicate that if you had turned very expert remote yours all looking at the same part as an example and an eight say one thing to say another that it's just as likely to be correct than the won't be\nAll right um our government at least according to the Nightline program that ran a finance Stargate over Twenty years with\nAnd uh financed Stargate over Twenty years with twenty million dollars or something like that at the end of which are they more or less declared it to be a failure and stop the program um so you all three were in it was it a failure\nWell this is Paul ... no it was far from being a failure um\nIn fact uh I back last on active duty I wrote a review of the CIA report on that which I discussed many of the problems with that report ah\nIt ... you know I it's hard to say for sure but it almost looked like it was consciously intended to to prove that the uh the program was faulty\nAnd yet they did not consider anywhere near all of the evidence available to to make that determination\nUh from my own experience and I think the other tool agree a while there were times when we fell flat on our faces they're\nUm there were times when we were unbelievably successful as well or that kind of post true of any of the various intelligence disciplines or none of them are a hundred percent\nUh none of them are even close to a hundred percent sometimes a very successful and sometimes they're not so I Would I Would say we were at least as successful as into the other intelligence disciplines and sometimes perhaps more so\nWell if that's true then uh the declaration that it was a failure was wasn't intentional piece of disinformation or otherwise known as a lie\nWell\nPerhaps you could say it that way you have to remember there's a lot more involved than just a bottom line as to whether it works or doesn't work there are a lot of a\nPolitical engenders involved there are a lot of a personal belief systems or you know we live in in of course in the in the scientific in a scientific paradigm that doesn't want to accept the fact that there's things that happened that they can't explain and cause effect relationship\nSo far no one's been able to explain what it is that makes a remote viewing work and so there are a lot of people who have a real problems without\nYeah most of the military people for example I was in the air force than I can imagine what the attitude toward what you gentlemen did was and I'm sure it was not fully positive in the ranks\nOf what this is Joe I'm One of the ... is a very very good example of that uh since you brought up the military uh there there are multi billion dollar programs\nWhich are dependent upon um in in essence a plans are constructs that may be very vulnerable to a a psychic functioning there may be very targeted will and um if\nIf uh some performances a developed the show's vulnerability based on psychic applications then that can be very ... very damaging to getting approval for a multibillion dollar plan so they'll give you an idea of sort of the politics that might become involved\nWell at least publicly uh now they suggested they stopped the remote viewing program altogether and Stargate indeed has been disbanded\nA however do all of you agree that the government is now doing absolutely no remote viewing work whatsoever what do you believe that\nThis is Joe I I Would agree with that um I I have no knowledge whatsoever anything that the government's not doing are you from a researcher collection standpoint um\nAnd and that's okay I I happen to think that this belongs in the private sector belongs in the in the uh in the public sector where many labs and many individuals can be participating in research\nUh only I probably would have to add that I think if any of that research is being gone publicly than it needs to be open to peer review and evaluation criticism discussion that sort of thing\nCan huge oh tell me whether the stock market's going to go up or down tomorrow\nWith about the same percentage of accuracy that I discussed earlier yes\nMine\nMine mine um I've got to facts here from a listener art up please ask these gentlemen to speak about the episode\nThey experienced when they were still active within their military unit the episode involved eight objects entering the U.S airspace followed by one more type of an open air ship us this story is both amazing an amusing dawn in Peoria, Illinois\n[laughter] ah this was a call the the great Christmas attack\nA [laughter] a\nAt one point we uh got\nA uh uh someone called up to the eye and had the I called asking to us I'm a dangerous monitor on this and uh\nOr it dangerous monitor on this and a one by one we remote viewed ah everyone was in on this except kid who uh is is very prone to lead the viewers and uh we were we were sort of doing it just just\nTo to you know show what can happen or the first year went in we got all of this on tape by the way or the first year went in\nAnd started given just simple or you know there are are live being shared their eight objects or in front of a a\nA an open air vehicle and so forth oh by the last few or by the time the last year which was made a I was describing a runner's\nInstead of wheels and drawing a thing you know drawing the slave runners\nEr I was describing bells ...\nAnd the the uh highland hospital uniform was read with white fuzzy tram [laughter] and uh when I went into the session and sat\nDown a had told me that uh you know all the viewer is supposed to get his numbers are he told me that uh\nWe are experiencing a and attack from over the north pole open aired helicopters hawk which are coming down over the northern cannon Canadian border and what we're trying to do here is to find out their exact location and exactly what their targets are [laughter]\nAnd and so forth and uh\nFinally at one point I just ah said something about the uh the pilot is speaking into his radio saying whoa whoa\nWhoa whoa [laughter] and uh\nThat's about the time and I think when I said that everyone else who was in the ah monitor room where the TV monitor was\nYeah laugh so loud that uh could hear him through the walls and that's about the time that uh had caught on to to the to the great Christmas attack [laughter]\nSo uh all moments I'm a ... in Stargate oh we're not a serious dire moments you guys have some fun\nThat's right sure I actually\nIs a pro actually had a lot of fun or a limb particularly a when things got a little while he he'd put out a a a pseudo newsletter called the adventures of the five for five\nYeah I was on which were very a hilarious actually\nHow many of you were there in totality\nWell Paul here I'm just like any unit or any organization that's in functional flux with people moving in and out or at any one time the answer would be different\nUm I think the ... the most number of viewers we had any organization any one time was about seven and then of course with support personnel you know you had a uh uh the operations officer the branch chief uh secretarial\nUm and uh you know a couple of foot monitor analysts types you know so it may be roughly ten to a dozen who would probably be a large size was\nRight even given what you said about the politics of remote viewing and you know religious paradigms and all the rest of it being challenged in the nature of the military people factor you\nHere in ... she talks to me last week she asked for Chinese ... ... showed up like match humans have cool to

that he he doesn't except the current scientific controls that had been verified proven and used to cross a nine to eleven labs and the world\nAnd so he's not hardly going to come on your show or in in establishing a valid or reasonable protocol and allow someone to attempt to do the remote doing so I have the support it in in a in this because\nHe he really hasn't been proper the opportunity to demonstrate under an appropriate protocol\nWell basically uh the amazing Randy wrote back to me and said I'm come on your program because I Can't be in the studio with you well either is it deems he's on the phone he said further CNN has made yourself in myself a an offer to\nDo a weekly program is true CNN has approached me and his approach Rand needs to do a kind of\nPoint counterpoint program

all the rules um that in itself a of a validation of a a truly scientific test\nA these things have to be open for discussion and bantering in an argument or in and they are so within a normal science so he he's actually violating the very rules that he says the U.S is that what\nIs it possible gentleman to view or into the future or the past\nBut this is Paul uh yes as a matter of fact uh ... uh the past is easier to do a futures a little bit harder but it it it it is it can be done it has been done a lot and and uh continues to be done and I suspect\nUm many of the training sites or we had that the old unit involved passed a retro cognition and if you will uh doing uh events in the past and ah it worked very well and it worked as well as real time wow\nWhat one of the problem this is Joe one of the problems you might you might run into and remote in the future if you go out to many years you may you may in fact the one hundred percent correct remote viewing\nBut a sense to it involves some something that might pertain to technology or something that we don't yet know about ah there's no conceptual conceptualization or that you can put it in no order that will make sense\nSo you you run into some tech technical problems when you remove the pastors and even more interesting problem a history of sort of mobile and a history seems to be written to support whatever the political or social requirements\nFor the president are that's right\nSo you open a bucket of worms where you you have to be willing to than to go on and defend whatever you set against the anthropologist theologians\nAnd religion is exactly mhm I'm\nEd deems has said that and I wish to ask you about this that there is a in the next few years appoint past which he really cannot see uh he sees some large event which he can't quite discern which he describes as possibly spiritual event\nOf some sort of massive spiritual event have any have you seen or sense this\n[noise] this is Paul I'm of course being as close as we are to the turn of the millennium are just like the last time a lame came around there's a lot of ah\nHistory almost anything in fact they use the word hysteria when they talk about a historically are about ... and all that sort of thing\nI'm I'm not saying it has fallen prey to that but it's certainly something to be concerned about\nA a lot of people are talking about in times and uh you know a book of revelations and you don't have all kinds of things that people seem to be seeing happening now\nI'm not going to say those things aren't going to happen but we have to be especially cautious when we deal first of all in the future because uh there there are a lot of a technical problem with remote doing the future\nAnd second of all dealing with a very emotional Laden issues such as you know in times kept coming quite cataclysmic things like that\n[noise] uh\nI'm not I'm not sure that's an answer to the question is there a point past which\nOh well okay I'm Sorry [laughter] I have not experienced that around and and nobody I've talked to is has had that experience that that is claiming a dozen he's wrong but uh I myself am rather dubious\nUh this is Lynn I I'm a\nHeard that you know by the year two thousand ah the entire British Isles will be wiped clean of life and so forth and that sort of surprised me because I had done a session for um a series of sessions for a company\nAnd ah it involved looking into the year twenty zero five mhm and at that time uh it was generally\nLife as usual and the British Isles\n[noise] All right there are some real world things going on a limb that I Would like to ask you in or the other two about um frogs indicator species are beginning\nTo or a girl a extra ah\nLimbs they're becoming deformed or they're becoming a multi colored in various ways\nUm all kinds of things uh uh deformed fish are we are beginning to see changes in our ecology or do any of you that have been able to look into the future it's see where this ecological problem is going ...\n... this is Joe I'd like to respond a with a comment and then I'll I'll answer it directly [noise] um that these are not new phenomena uh deformed frogs fish that's\nPlus history or the media's attitude towards reporting those things has changed drastically in the in the last uh probably ten to Fifteen Years as a result of the public's interest in those banks\nUm in terms of\nWhat we may be seeing in the future there's no doubt my mind just based on what you read in Scientific American or any other\nYou know valid or our research are reporting document that there probably are effects from uh the ozone depletion and uh chemicals in the air and the ... city that we've put indoor water that we're now going to be paying dearly for for some time\nOkay but that's oh that that's you reading the headlines the way I Do I I was I guess I was asking more about what might have been actually remote viewed or what you might have sensed\nA let me jump in here if I might oh it was some time last year that uh the prediction was made about the frogs mutating and so forth yes\nHowever uh I have right here on the computer a copy of New York times from may\nA march of Nineteen Ninety four\nTalking about a frog mutations and another one from the Associated Press on Ninety five talking about it well uh you know I can remote view things they've already happened to anybody can do that uh that's easy\n[laughter] oh right oh\nI can you know it's easy to predict things that have already happened oh\nAll right let me let me pull away from this are you guys are going to have too much have already having too much fun with this [laughter] um let's talk about the past for a second one obvious target in the past of immense interest to people worldwide\nIs whether there was really a man who walked the earth\nWho was the son of God called Christ or it must have been a for you at some time and in evidently tempting target [noise]\nUm but this is land a I had done a series of ah of sessions on oh Colombian drug lords uh Hussein cut off and so forth and uh was\nTalking about when I interrupted you because we're the bottom of the hour and I like cliffhanger so will come directly back to this Lynn ... Joe methodical and Paul Smith all members of projects Stargate the U.S military's remote viewing project harm I guess\nIt is a gathering of eagles and it's kind of rare so stick with this interesting stuff and you just heard what's coming a\nTrip back in time continue with our grill hosting coast to coast am\nMore somewhere in time coming up [noise]\nTrue for all goes the coast am was visit coast to coast am dot coms who signed up today\nNow we take you back to the past on art bell somewhere in time [noise]\n[noise]\nRight back down to ... Joe ... model and Paul Smith a gentleman uh we left off at an interesting point I had asked whether whether anybody had remote viewed Jesus wants to be on this earth was he the son of God what are you know if anything\nI'm this is Len yes Lynn a I had\nStarted a a at a war story here uh I had been doing the bad guys for for weeks and weeks and I went into the director and I said look\nJust watch give my Mother Teresa are those are the clown or something they use these targets are killing me and the answer was a your soldiers suck it up to your job\nHowever a couple of days later I went in and uh the monitor took the seal down below up and said the target is a person\nUh I started the session and my first comment was whatever you think this guy did he didn't do it and uh uh as the session went on\nI just uh\nThis below from from uh being in contact with this person and uh at the end of the session the monitor open up the envelope and uh there was one word in the middle of the page and it said Jesus oh I didn't establish in that session whether or not\nWas the son of God or or whatever but and the way I feel honored to have met the most holy person I've ever met in my entire life and one um\nEver met in my entire life and one of the meeting of whom I think I think change parts of my life um oh that that one session I think was was a turning point for certain parts of my life\n[noise] wow that's very significant um so\nYou must stop ... that there was such a person would you say not much\nOh yes uh-huh\nOh this is Joe I I Would support woodland just said oh I I have had the experience of a\nIf you could call a Jesus a target [laughter] ... I have that experience of of doing some information that regard\nAnd likewise I have also had the experience with uh the other great profits as well uh Mohammed a Buddha um some of the other great religious leaders and there's a a great deal of similarity and most of them\nAnd a great deal of similarity in the original uh the original constructs that they deliver a I Do find that over history however my information are shown that mankind has altered considerably some of those messages\nAre do you see all of the ones that you mentioned a as being from the same creative source\nAbsolutely I this is Joe I I Would say absolutely a there but if you could refer to a refer to this being as an energy you would have to say it all comes\nFrom the same source the same as a man comes from a ... oh\nThis is land people quite often asked me if in a in doing the remote viewing I have a\nChange my you know have become disenchanted with religion and my answer is always know if anything I have become more\nReligious and more dedicated to the spiritual side o' my views have changed against the church about the church\nI understand that uh you know the organized church\nBut if anything you you you would also you become more spiritual and I literally\nThis this is Joe I I Would have to underscore what was said and agree with him a hundred percent\nLong [noise] yeah I I'm I'm\nI'm actually I'm a Mormon and uh some people ask why has this affected your beliefs seen negatively and in fact has done just the opposite I'm I'm\nIt strengthened my beliefs and and a lot of the uh the principles that I've learned growing up and uh uh it it's amazing how it all those tales with things that you've you've learned at all or always knew somehow you know\nAids eerie listening to the three of you agree like this\nI'm All right it happens so seldom [laughter] I'm a ... degree now that\nAnybody know why it was called operation Stargate in the first place I've always wondered [noise]\nAh yes ah they went around the office of\nTaking names they said that are on that when they said that oh we would have the opportunity to pick her on names and the ah oh cool we got together I think the best name that came up from it was Stargate oh that was the only time we had the chance to pick our own name\nWhen was that oh that\nWas and uh [noise]\nI'm horrible the date that was in uh Ninety eighty\nSix eighty hold on hold on a second [laughter] you know it was horrible with dates I really am yeah I'm\nStargate it actually in the program actually started out in Seventy eight to ... as a uh it's it's name then was gone to a wish I'm On the military has a way of picking code names were these kind of randomly select two names and put them together\nIn a way the program has named after the first trial a gun do wish and then it turns a center lane in the early ... next fall I'm ... well we'll do flame actually it was kind of the umbrella name or the ... yeah well the job was right it it didn't have a new girlfriend for a while\nUm and then center lane and then uh some streak was it's a his name in eighty six I went went from a Armenians calm to D I F\n... sorry let me apologize here son streak is the one where we chose or a name\nYou know writing how's your team about [laughter] it happened that happened in in uh probably Ninety three after all of us were gone\nAll right well in the interest of the vote stopping this the reason I asked is because there was a movie as you all well know called Stargate and I was wondering if your name might have been the genesis for that\nI seriously doubt\nYour name might have been the genesis for that\nI seriously doubt it\nActually there was a a a science this is Paul getting science fiction novel written by Andrea Norton how probably Thirty years ago maybe called Stargate but it had to do with a device that you could walk through and and put you on another planet\nAnd and I suspect they may have got the name from that that's what I thought All right\nSo this is Joe can I just throwing a comment I I don't want you know people read detail out of this and in a lot of misconceptions girlfriend and\nAh I ... I was a member of the project um until it's a termination in November ah all did I was working on the science and research side of it\nWere you surprised addicts termination\nUh this is Joe again um yes I was um in fact the a A R report a supports the the realization that uh they're probably has something to remote doing it probably the psyche functioning does exist in it and it is probably some value\nThe rational comment or with regard to the unit\nWas that they found that there was not sufficient evidence or that it was supporting intelligence\nHowever historically a that's not a reality uh the actual project was literally approved on a year to year basis are based on what it was doing in terms of support intelligence the intelligence community at large and are based on\nThose findings by oversight committees during that entire Nineteen year period or Eighteen year period it was approved based on the effect in the\n... a year to year on the effectiveness so um and then after Twenty years of approvals or how did they suddenly decided it was a failure\nWell they they essentially they reviewed the last year\nOnly are they were directed to review the entire Twenty years which was an impossibility and a three month period that they were going to do the review a secondary to that um the people actually doing review did not have the\nAppropriate clearances for accessing the\nThe grand a numbers of files of probably Ninety Ninety five percent of the project was never review that were never allowed access to it\nAh also there was a some very specific marching orders given to the scientists but initially on what they would review so it was a staff that was a bogus reports are well\nAll right I'm must ask this and so I Will ah from Arkansas aren't ask your guests outright\nAre there aliens are they're ETs here on earth or in our vicinity or at all it's still wearing who knows about it I Believe you'd be surprised at the answer or if they are on us [laughter] that was that awful right what about uh guys", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "07"}
