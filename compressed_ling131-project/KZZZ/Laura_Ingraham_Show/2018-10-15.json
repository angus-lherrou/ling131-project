you are truly living walking breathing American patriot a hero in and I think everybody's eyes I don't consider myself a hero do we argue those guys never came home but we do and we consider all of your heroes\nAnd I I Know it's hard to accept that you know that's what makes you so humble and I hear that from a lot of people that I talked to a lot of veterans combat veterans will say the same thing that's\nWhat's so awesome about you guys and girls it's what the what is what makes you guys a cut above the rest of them in my eyes in my estimation that very humble ...\nAfter what you've gone

asked them idiots could you just say thank you to these families on their day\nYou know given more than they give the ground hogs you know and they don't even at this stage though we're at a point now where\nHistory I thought I have a Thirteen year old son he's fourteen now just are forcing September thirtieth my daughter will be sixteen\nNovember second and these kids I I'm finding that I'm having to teach them things that I learned in school that they're not being taught from my perspective it's entirely different\nIn today's schools but there were dying for I don't even know your kids I'm telling you right now they're worth dying for their that import so let's say than\n... three or four percent of the world's population\nSo they had a Ninety seven percent chance of being born someplace else and they were God put them in this nation and that comes with a ... that comes with the responsibility the whole freedom up to stand up for God and country and they don't they need to be taught that it's not they don't get everything for nothing\nWhy is why we're sitting here what segue this because this was a short segment unfortunately but why is what we're talking about now\nWhat makes where we are today\nAnd they don't they need to be taught that it's not they don't get everything for nothing\nWhy is why we're sitting here what segue this because this is a short segment unfortunately but why is what we're talking about now\nWhat makes where we are today such a vital part of where we're why are you a member of Arizona systems defensively and why are you wearing a gun on your hip and fighting for our right to keep and bear arms right now with disabled\nBecause the more people that carry the bad guys are more wary\nTrying to do anything they're not going to invade a house in Arizona because everybody carries most people have guns you go to New Jersey most people don't and so the bad guys now they're good they can they going to cost a woman\nBecause the chance of having a gun or zero compared to the how many how many women carrying Arizona forget about it so just the fact that you carry isn't isn't it isn't about that you're going to use the fact that it's there\nAnd it was ... ... is the freedom and the right this is the state whose history I Love\nI'll be broadcasting from Tucson, Arizona live on the Daily Show Monday and Tuesday following this program tomorrow in the day after\nAnd I love it I get out there once a year this is just the history of the state to state was built on the gun it was built on fundamental individual isn't as Americans move West is was this was a rocket place even today right I mean this is\nAmerica here and wild wild west you know any ... Bloomberg knows that he's spending tons of money he's got he's got a big giant sticker right on Arizona and he doesn't understand of course he doesn't but what we understand that\nWe understand that he wants to take that right from us and easy CDLs at the tip of the spear in fighting for that he thinks that if he could take all the guns away and nobody went to war there wouldn't be in a\nWhile he or she wants to go and he wants to keep his own guns oh sure he ended up buying guards have guns isn't it ironic that he stands there and talk to you you're shaking your head laughing and I've never met you before jak you understand there is a joke he let her see here yeah it's\nNot so ridiculous if he spent that\nTime and energy on even helping kids instead of screaming that he's going to take our guns away [noise] work on and helping young people\nWere kind of helping young people imagine the good he could do with tens and hundreds of millions of dollars that he's spending and trying to take away American writer kid\nA healthy breakfast every morning and that kid got up and could go to school and learn\nThe constitution and the bill of rights and how great America's freedom is and how many people are living in good very good condition he could do far more good\nBut then you know at least he's on a path that he wants to thank our guns away of his mind I Can't stand the guy I make no bones about that every year I think I I find the irony and Michael Bloomberg to be absolutely hilarious if it weren't so dangerous because of the money that is capable of spending I use the analogy [noise]\nThis is a guy who wants to take away sugar sodas wants to keep eating bad foods right you're shaking your head also is to actually control you know he's running as a Democrat he was America Republican now he's an independent see this as a guy that has no conviction\nBut don't you find it ironic he stands up on the podium at the New York hot dog eating contest every year while he wants to take away oh you know things that cause obesity while he's introducing when he was mayor anyway well he's introducing folks are going to stop the shutdown sixty five hotdogs in ten minutes\nYou know the whole irony of this thing gets me and so with logistical ... guy or gal it's a typical rich guy who thinks because he made so much money he's so much smarter than everybody else all he did was smarter he was smart enough to make more money that will at was little he live up there done that surround him when he won\nLet's not never he won't give up anything that security I bet you is it is out as far greater than most people\nHe's got an army it is out there they can afford it but he thinks because these that smart Martin and everybody we've got about a fallacy of the ... the left we've got about a valley so you're a Democrat we've got about a minute Saudi or actually to armed American radio listeners and tell them why it's so important that they stand up and be heard and fight for these rights\nCarry a weapon and when you can carry it in an open area carrying an open area so that everybody can see\nDoes guns around then that the bad guys can see you it's not about the good guys seeing you and it's about the bad guys seeing how many guns are out there and they got to rethink how they're going to\nBe um he's trying they're evil and that's the deal the guns in the way and it's supposed to be because good people need to carry them more and more good people\nOn my job it was a real pleasure meeting you\nI was planning on doing I'm Glad I had the opportunity God works in mysterious ways the reason you were across the table oh yeah when we were going to the segment so I had planned on going directly to minister got me even opening this program but guess what where I couldn't I Can't think of a better way to start at at where we bring somebody in here who are you know I can say\nMr got even open English program but guess what we're I couldn't I Can't think of a better way to start or to where we bring somebody in here who you know I can say you got a real ... you got in this game\nOh I'm the I'm excited about where you take a lot of pictures that I'm going to go ahead and put some social media ones out what to eat and everything else if you want to follow Alan and myself into don't make sure to hook up with me on Twitter at a our mark now I'm going to tell you right now I'm going to go step further when we get there and I'm Steve we can't get the town marshal you've got to have the Marshall\nThe tunes don't city Marshall has to be on the show was wearing try to make that work\nI've been through a couple marshals down there I Know a couple of deputies very well so when we get there we're going to check with deputy rattler CFO rattlesnake can get into town marshal how 'bout that\nI bet you pull it off [laughter] I'm certainly going to try so that's going to be a tremendous amount of ... okay so here we find ourselves in a Z CDL this is an important meeting\nFor well for reasons let's start with the fact that you gave them the grass roots organization of the year why\nWell if you look at the room here and you see what they are pulling off and the number of of you know supporters and members they've got\n... attending turning out and working for gun rights in Arizona you can see why they deserved it aren't very many grass roots groups in the country they can ... full of people if they've got sitting behind us uh their their grassroots were there you know I'm\nYou know they're they're the elbow grease they put it but then on the pedal to the metal these guys really deserve the award that their their their track record last year was phenomenal and of course they got their work cut out for them this year with the election cycle coming up in ... Arizona\n... maybe the key battleground states okay who controls the Senate\nBut let's talk about the it is it's it's control it gets battleground it's ground zero in a couple of different areas number one that control the Senate why\nWell obviously this is the Republican held seat right now ah and if they ... it it's a it's intense battle polls showing\nShowing your cat it within the margin of error is the polling data this is one of the two seats the Republicans ... could possibly lose\nA and of course they lose both of them they lose control the Senate and gun rights and we're in big trouble in the Senate that happens all the nominees for the courts you know go down the tubes are this is ... this is critical so we're really in in the ... probably the key battleground state I'm going to Arizona Nevada the two big ones\nTouching each other on the map or this is where it is part of the country is that the Republicans cannot afford to lose if they want to keep control the Senate\n... there's a lot I could go into here because Arizona when we think of Arizona we think of deep red conservative state we think of gun owning gun loving I'm just goes hand in hand\nWe also know battleground from another angle and that is Michael Bloomberg wants to take this state down this organization that we're sitting out here and all of which I'm pro life member of\nHas been working diligently behind the scenes for the last couple of years to put up a preemptive strike if you will across the bow to stop this ballot initiative and they've been pretty successful here legislatively would if we you know I'm going to ask you to are you telling me that they could turn blue\nYet could I mean not\nTo be honest about their ... at each other's throats in disarray internal struggles battles see McCain flake and other members of the party or I mean they pretty much ... in in a lot of cases shot themselves in the foot uh it's it's a really tough state right now for looking at the demographics are changing as well\nWhen you look at the demographic changes as you look at a Republican in fighting a it's a very easy to keep costs to see that it'd be it'd be a horrible off the gun owners nationwide we would\nBe a terrible loss because you're go you would then start to see Arizona senators voting in favor of gun control or not supporting\nPro pro rights movement you know in the Senate or they come up and say for example if a concealed carry reciprocity which is now showing it to the table to the Senate\nWell it goes it goes beyond that you have the you know you're a Republican Senate candidate here supports gun rights Democrat ... would ban assault rifles ... she I mean there's a a Bloomberg proposal that she wouldn't vote for\nAnd Bloomberg is spending a ton of money in this state yes so this this organization in here which won the award at the grassroots organization of the year how many times now\nI don't know or they may once or twice a this they they definitely want it this year right now I think they want at once in the past\nYear I I in fact I Know they have I just don't ... recall when let's put it this way they've got their work cut out for them they've obviously got a very dedicated group of people here this is not my first rodeo here I've spoke here with this organization is drunk three separate occasions\nAnd the room gets for and for every year and it's going to have to be in order to win this fight you agree\nOh most definitely a you know uh I'm really proud to have them as as a graduate of the nation of the year\nWell I'll tell you what I couldn't be prouder to be here armed American radios monster cash live from the floor here at the Arizona systems defense league meeting in beautiful Phoenix, Arizona we will be right back after this don't go away great program lined up for tonight [noise]\nGun lover listen up did you entered when you're a brand new gun from the U.S ... yet if not what are you waiting for Europe optimistic that might have gone to give away and do you could get up to twenty four chances when you're on daily but only if you act very fast twenty four cameras twenty four twenty four things even twenty four a are Fifteen\nSuspects harm to the number eight seven\nThey even twenty four a are Fifteen just actually arm to the number eight seven to two two and radio which you could be taking home today and for a few days guns disappears at midnight tonight that means there's just a few hours left you leave and you have to be a civil even ... hey R.

because it's just too darn long and I thank you so much for being here it's a pleasure to be sitting face to face with you always a pleasure to be with you mark your long history you have a long story around I'm\nSecond generation a gun rights activist advocate a and to\nMy father was Neal knocks he was a gun writer and then was one of the moving forces behind the Cincinnati revolt in Nineteen Seventy so about the national Rifle Association listen or just for your information right that that turned the national Rifle Association into a lobbying\nJuggernaut um then he\nFounded the firearms coalition which I now run 'em and\nEventually dad was elected on to the board of directors of the n._r._a. and became the\nVice president a\nVan within line to be the president the following year but he worried some people and so they recruited\nJohn Garret hasn't he scares some people you didn't worry I'm your dad scared\nSome people that are not right they they went out and they recruited Charlton Heston specifically to run against dad so that they could bumping out of the chairs and keep him from becoming the president of the n._r._a. that's pretty hardcore company when that's how important your father was that they actually did that with ... and it's quite the soil yes we had more time for it I honestly [noise]\nBut now uh I uh I ... dad died in two thousand and five I'm I was helping him for the last two years of his life keeping the organization running and\nAnd helping with the day to day riding I have a regular articles on ah ah ... dot com and in firearms news magazine\nAnd ah the website and all of that firearms coalition dot org\nUse it firearms coalition dot org correct that's right firearms coalition dot org we've had some issues we actually had\nSomebody who claims to be a terrorist group hacked our website a few years ago\nAnd we never quite recovered from that my IT guy is a guy named Chris knocks or any relation yeah okay just checking my my brother and uh he uh he's cheap but he's not really great so [laughter]\nBut anyway we've we've revamp the website and it's looking really good\nBut for the last year\nI've been really focused on election politics rather than gun politics and\nAn election politics rather than gun politics and I've I've kind of let the firearms coalition\nA sort of slide a little bit um and I apologize to any of our readers and and followers for that but the election\nThis year is so important and I am working full time to get good pro writes a candidate's elected to office this year\nRight let let me stop you because you've moved into election politics let's let's go there briefly absolutely I have spoken so far to some great heavy hitters today Alan Gottlieb Alan Cohen and others are\nIn the election is dominating of course we're now you're talking about midterms national you're also talking about state you're talking about Arizona centric fill me on because this is a vital places just ground zero right now\nWell I moved the coalition back to Arizona I'm\nAbout six years ago\nAnd when I did I started getting much more involved in local Arizona politics and uh I actually have teamed up with a local a campaign consultant\nWho work strictly with conservative candidates and um it turns out that conservative candidates are also pro writes candidates and so I have no\nUh problems are working with these campaigns and ads supporting these guys in primarily in local politics we had a couple of congressional candidates unfortunately our candidates didn't get through the primary [noise]\nUm so now I'm focused on making sure that the Arizona house is as pro rights as it\nCan possibly ... and and how close are we in your estimation to that happening because an outlet to segue ... depending on your answer I'm gonna do it anyway but I Want to segue over to the federal election as well where are we where are we here locally now\nHere in Arizona we're in very good shape um we've got a few districts that to that lean Democrat and we're making some inroads into those districts\nBut uh as far as our state legislature they understand that gun voters are very important to them and we are are in good shape to get those people elected and ah I'm feeling good about the way our local elections are going here in Arizona\nAlthough I I lost a city council raised by eleven votes are in in the primary election one of my candidates so it can be really heartbreaking\nTo no question or no no let's use the state and how you feel comfortable about the state\nI'm pretty comfortable about the state yeah we've got a good solid Republican majority I Believe that the governor is going to win again I I'm not a big fan of governor do see but he's ... better than the alternative\nYou know you would have nobody was a big fan of a lot of people weren't big fans of Donald Trump but he was way way better than the alternative absolute I'm a big fan of Donald Trump loved it and called the election the night of the election on on my radio program I said\nGo to bed tonight knowing Trump plus three hundred electoral votes will see in the morning three hundred to ... I still have people that I'm proud of this asking me to pick their lottery numbers warms All right let's go now let me segue to the to the federal election I I've talked with my previous guests over the last hour an hour and a half\nYear in the Arizona is in a strange place very when you're talking about the U.S Senate Arizona is actually look I mean it's a one point race right now today as we sit here at the at the studio meeting and we'll meeting someone who would have ever found that\nIn bright red gun toting gun loving history of the gun states Arizona [noise]\nHere since ... who is the Democrat running for the Senate\nUm has painted herself as a moderate Democrat and she's done a pretty good job of it uh although a lot of her history is now finally coming out and people are realizing that she was a a a\nDemocratic socialist green extreme\nRadical leftist before she started moderating in order to be able to be elected to office she's like Mike Bloomberg becoming a Republican he didn't become a Republican because he believed in Republican values he became a Republican because they already had a Democrat candidate right and he wanted to spend enough money to get elected in\nOne vote now it looks like Heidi Heitkamp is buried I think she's about to and I'm hopeful Jon Tester right now is it about a one point raised Montana you're listening right now in every major city in Montana please go to the polls what are you doing\nMontana I've been kind of hard on you on the daytime show but my gosh ... when I think of Montana I think a lot about what I think of Arizona rugged outdoors\nRugged individual as a state built on the gun I think of the west I think a ... butts kicked okay by a bunch of bunch of guys that could shoot better with Winchester model Ninety four is okay the but the fact of the matter is for eighty four wherever they were but the fact of the matter is\nWhy do we have to worry about that out here we shouldn't even be having this conversation here\nWhy do we have to worry about that out here we shouldn't even be having this conversation here in the great state of Arizona Jeff this concerns me and there's a couple\nOf reasons why we have this problem and one of them one of the biggest is that the Republican Party here in Arizona is rather torn it's dysfunctional we've got crazy right wing radicals we've got\nRight wing not so crazy and then we've got moderate Mickey ma she John McCain Republicans and we're always fighting with each other\nBecause we're used to fighting with each other within the party and the party can't get its act together and um that means that we can't unify behind a good candidate and and stick with it that there's a big wing of the Republican Party in Arizona that thinks that\nThe base isn't enough and they they they want to run for the middle in order to win and they hold up John McCain Jon Kyl Jeff Flake as examples of seed that's what the Arizona people want\nWhat I'm hearing from you right now I'm picturing in my mind radio to me is the editor of the mind and I've I've just trained and doing that when I'm listening to you I'm visualizing a puzzle\nOkay and I'm seeing three or four pieces in the state of Arizona in Arizona put together in three or four pieces based on what I'm hearing from you that it had it seems like Arizona is now searching for a new identity\nBased on that base that you're you're talking about several different bases here right or John McCain voter would never vote for him is Sally\nSally voter would never vote for a cinema I I'm seeing three or four different McCain voter would vote for him ... whatever they want to have to\nBut but a a um [noise] but they're not alone in order to do it or I'm a graph of Goldwater voter back in the day would never vote for either of them McCain why\nWell this was the here's what I'm Talking about [noise]\nI'm very concerned about what I'm seeing in this day and I'm going to be honest it upsets me it really does because this is\nThis just Arizona to me it's a free state in the country it is to me it's why I live here okay and I don't like what I'm seeing here and we had our core when talking about bringing the California's bringing in California\nValues that there is demographic change happening here is what's happening in Montana as well gets happening in Montana's was also happening in a ... did in Idaho what's been happening in Colorado for a long time\nAnd what amazes me as you get these goofy left his moves that leave what they don't like to go somewhere they like and bring their goofy leftist ...

D. to eight seven to two Jew I Won that cold beer at the stadium never did get it\nBut nonetheless it was cool because I wanted on attacks by taxing something very similar at a Braves game by the way how 'bout that game last night I lacked yesterday there was a lot going on when I got off the air yesterday yesterday was a fun Sunday I was up rather late\nBecause I had to finish watching the Braves in ethics fashion I had to watch the game that my wife and my daughter were at\nYesterday while I was on the air\nAds they won in while it was quite it was quite an exciting ballgame nationally division series game three they want it and what was had me scared to death as a Braves fan and a season ticket holder\nFreddie Freeman's home run ... me to sixty five and they held on it was a lot of fun to watch then of course after that the walking dead was back on so I had to watch that fell asleep a couple of times watching that got up nonetheless wound up seeing it great to be the walking dead back on\nThere was a lot going on yesterday Dover was being run NASCAR races Dover was being run yesterday during the day football couldn't care less I don't know who played don't give a crap about him don't care\nBut there was that you got baseball but it's just a fun time of year if you enjoy watching baseball show and yeah the Braves are playing right now\n... outcome I'm not there that's a great question freedom never takes a break freedom ever take a break or does it couldn't be\nTechnology you just never know [laughter]\nAll right so let me welcome back let's have some fun with Colin Powell left picked this guy apart shall we and have some fun doing it again what does this have to do with your guns what doesn't irrelevant Colin Powell has to do with your it has everything to do with your guy\nHe is making himself for trying to make himself\nAgain by by no I Know by appearing on CNN with freed the car you that's relevant well yeah\nIt is for some reason he's out there CNN reached out to him or his publicist is making the rounds in I get a lot of that stuff I haven't seen anything from those publishers Colin Powell was available like to talk about so and so I haven't seen anything I'll keep my eyes if you are but I get a lot of that stuff\nBut I Wanna go back and talk about some of these things has everything to do with your gun because Paulos it like your guns ... abandoned the Republican Party and supported Obama if you recall yeah that's what Republicans do you know would support Obama\nNamed me would you what does that make you if you support Obama does that make you a Republican\nHell no it doesn't make you a Republican makes you\nHell no it doesn't make you a Republican makes you think about a Republican\nThese are the kind of people Republicans tablets from the guy that Trump is clearing out and making your oh these are bygone era guy and girls that Josh cannot accept that they are bygone era guys and girls now\nAnd they are seeking to reestablish themselves\nAnd imagine if the Republican Party has a guy like Colin Powell at the helm someday a guy who says it's OK to register your stuff and you don't need certain thing but he claims that support the rights of Iran before and I say\nHe's the forces right to bear are and to protect himself and he supports\nYour right to have a weapon they shoot okay for you this has everything to do with guns and I want you to you what we're going to talk about and pick apart from him right now through that way\nHe did he doesn't know that crime can be the moral leader for the world because right now that is not the way he acted\nLet me tell Cohen ... he's not supposed to be the moral leader for the world prompted acting to fix things that everybody before him that tried to be the moral leader of the world screwed up\nThat's what Trump is fixing today\nAmerica for because how and his cronies he's un global lovers who ruin everything up and shipped millions of jobs over this is what prompted say\nThat's why you acting the way he's acting to use house terms\nRecently it became me the president as opposed to the people that's not true we that people are the American people not we the people of the global world are\nWe the people Powell means us America\nPow says and you see things that should not be happening how can a president of the United states get up and say that the media is the enemy of American enemy of Americans call and I like to hear that\nI didn't see you know I Wonder if Trump got that for me yeah ride bowls gold question huh I've been calling the ... the ... the the grave threat to Americans for years on armed American radio\nAnd it's great to see from rip them apart because they are a threat\nThese metaphorical skiing how not an enemy on a battlefield on a battlefield of ideas metaphorically speaking to understand that\nBecause they are the enemy of half of this country probably more than half\n\nBecause of their left wing propaganda their gun grabbing gun Haiti for example for the purposes of this show I can immediately point to that as an example\n\nFor their propagandize again weaponize in\n\nWhatever topic it is that they chose to use again or whether it's Christianity whether it's done right I could go on and on but again for the purpose of this Bronx is armed American radio would it be difficult for me to point out you how much the press you want me to go I don't have enough time in a year\n\nHe's insulted our best friends around the world I don't know who you're talking about there but I Would suggest\nThat he hasn't that what he has done is reaffirm\nPosition of strength\nBy not being beaten down anymore by the very people who hold you in previous administrations into the ground for decades and walked on us and cost us billions\nBy the way what does this have to do with guns everything you know the United nations\nAttempting to beat Americans guns into the ground of which I'm sure how we sit and have a conversation with those people Donald Trump would tell them to go out and solve Sharry how would look at that as an insult because he didn't talk to them because he's looking out for you\nAnd he says he insulted all of his fellow candidates up on the stage during the debates yeah politics is rough and tumble and\nEvery single one of 'em deserve it\nAnd every single one of 'em deserved it and none of them could effectively fight back Donald Trump buried them by the way Mr ... who's the president\nExactly\nAnd the power says I don't think that's what should be coming out of the president of the United states\nReally\nShow he doesn't think providing black Americans lowest unemployment the history of the country or providing women the lowest unemployment among many other things for these groups of people if you want to separate them into groups\nThe lowest unemployment for women in history that's a problem for me doesn't think that's what should be coming out of a president of the United states\n\nHe wants to the president of the United states to play nicely nice with people coming across our borders illegally harming American citizens bringing drugs galore cross the border and crime with them\nThat's OK Colin Powell wants to sit down and talk to those people and play nice he would probably sit down with Dianne Feinstein and play nice with her during the Kavanaugh hearings as well\n\nAnd Colin Powell says but I don't see anything that's changed in the last two years I just told you what's changed\nColin Powell doesn't see that if he does he's ignoring it intentionally and that would be intellectually dishonest\n\nAlbright additive Trump's rhetoric about America being a victim is so not true well of course she would argue that she's the one that put us there one of many who put us there she's one who had a hand in putting us there\nWe have been a victim we've been sucked dry by European nations and our quote unquote friends for years including our enemies China comes to mind for decades they have been sucking\nBillions of dollars out of this country that is a victim\nOf the world is watching Powell said they cannot believe we're doing things like separating mothers and children who are trying to get across the border from South of our border\n\nThey are separating criminals just as they do if someone's caught on a traffic stop they send the child the child welfare services while they put the parents in jail\n\nWhole empowers reciting the lives of the left are you following me here the lives of the left\nHe didn't say that when Barack Obama was doing the exact same thing Colin Powell is not talking to you about the fact that many of these so called parents aren't parents at all\nWhat are faring kids across the country across the border ended attempt to get here illegally than they are the ones in fact exploiting children for their own game\nHouses they can't believe we're making such an effort to speech immigration coming into the country we're not it's called ceasing illegal immigration which for Powell\nFactor stubborn things sure what they can't be made up you are not if you are not entitled to your own set of facts\nPolice on the
