Texas Oklahoma LSU Florida\nMy Kentucky Wildcats against a and M. and Notre Dame against Virginia Tech just to name a few\nWe were talking about this during the commercial break it's one of my pet peeves and of course I have my own school to sports casting now so I have to teach the students about this and that's when you have somebody on the question and it's not even a question when somebody says talk about\nSo at a press conference a lot of times you'll hear somebody say could you talk about and then whatever the topic is so you didn't come up with the question you just you just want somebody to kind of ramble of can you make my job a little bit easier that's really what they should should say could you make my job a little bit easier talking about the Yankees\nHere's a question that was asked to crush sale the red Sox star not really a question it's my pet peeve\n[laughter] I Can't tell you a sense I guess the Yankees [noise]\nUh no [laughter] that did that was it that was the answer shut him down\nYeah see 'cause what are you expecting him to say about it is a success against the will just talk about it yeah it's been so far it's worked out well for me I just go and talk about the elaborate Chris yeah frantic\nYou could have at least gives given a short vague bowling air so he could have got to show up to embarrass somebody in front of the rest of your colleagues I don't know why that's necessary\nOkay but what is he supposed to talk about\nPeople that didn't say you know I'm not sure I'm not sure what you're asking me you would you give them a second chance but you know ... what does that I'm Glad somebody\nFinally said no because I've been in these press conferences I've been around is where somebody says talk about do you do that at home like you said your wife talk about your day\nOh never I never get out of the room [laughter] oh wow\nThe hour by hour a day when I'm sure your wife doesn't say Christie have talk about your day up ... it'll be two o'clock in the morning and I was halfway through Amazon and\nYour wife goes a stop talking about your day there and she just goes in another room and puts headphones on\nTalk about the phones on talking about I saw this on the website to a big lead\nA coyote Koester I Hope I got that right had a column on this in defense of talk about the two dirtiest words in sports reporting actually wrote a column on this and he knows that we talk about this all the time it's a pet peeve\nTalk about is not the best option perhaps not even a good one\nThere is no substitute for direct insightful questioning the person serving up talk about is not painting with the black and white Ninety seven miles per hour fastball talk about can turn into a waste pitch\nThat said think of all the softball questions the questions asking what did you think when acts and how did you feel about why or those basically inquire about the same topics as talk about but I have a question mark at the end are they all superior or perhaps more to the point\nAre they any different athletes and coaches are prompted to respond to a topic open ended this is valued talk about for its faults is limitless in its scope\nThe interview easy we can expand in any direction explore any avenue it's better in a poster pre game less in long form also think about all the cliche call and response that we see in sports each and every day talk about is railed against as a scourge\nWhile the bloated fatty and entirely uses portion of the program escapes largely without scrutiny\nQuestions and non questions like should be judged by the answers talk about so often performs on par with occasionally better vantage differently punctuated cousins we've made a mountain out of a molehill\nAll stand on either talk about is fine [noise]\nTalking about is lazy is what it is and if you're in a press conference if I'm an athlete and you want something specific out of me then ask for something specific but to say talk about your success against the Yankees I Would give you a vague answered there\nWhy do you think you're successful against the Yankees what are you doing differently against the Yankees so\nTalk about might elicit a good response and I will say this about the column the column does hit this and it's important and I teach students are at my broadcasting school it's about you the answer you get\nHow do you get to the answer what is the good answer because a lot of guys in my industry were insecure and we want to have an elaborate question\nWe want to give you a question answer will answer it and then we'll ask the question because we want to make it seem like we know what we're talking about hate when people do you think of ... but there are times when you can just say why or how\nAnd those are the best questions you can ask but talk about you gave no thought to it yeah see\nI think sometimes the especially if you're younger and getting into the business you think talk about is what you're supposed to say\nYou know because you are on up hearing people say that all the time where you hear it you know there's tons of a journalist and radio hosts that'll say hey talk about the game this weekend or whatever and you kind of feel like when you're coming up and seeing how the professionals do it that's a question you're supposed to ask is a good question but it's really not make sure that\nYou don't ask answer and ask a question that there is the worst thing that you can do because it's horrible radio or TV and I always felt that I Want to give you less time to reload with your answers because if you give me an answer and there are times when I go\nWait why what how\nThen you're gonna get something that is you give them more time to think about how to not answer the question when you load up like that when you go let me ask answer and ask a question and I always feel like get to the question you know all\nThe other things I've noticed a lot of radio as people move onto the next question and not listen to the first answer we had the raft carrying McCauley on the other day and you ask them something about the play clock\nAnd he goes well and I said talk about the play but he he said something like um well rest are told to not call it too tight to play clocks kind of a loose recommendations for how many calls and he goes in you know what I mean we've got and that's how about you go what will wait a second here because the first answer has still not been explored\n[noise] I think being a good listener is the most important trait you can have as an interviewer because there are times when somebody will ask a question and they get an answer and it just cries out to claim it did you just hear that\nBut and that's why it's rare in this show an undeniable on audience that I took over for Joe Buck I don't have questions in front of me\n... in front of me because it's about a conversation and it's an hour long conversation but I have to prepare but the best prep work you can do is just make sure you listen to what somebody says\nWhen we hear about people dying of curable and preventable diseases we might find ourselves saying someone should do something

with your class Fox Sports college football analyst handicapping the weekend with Jane Ian Thompson NFL Network we recap what we saw last night hopes patriots here patriots you're going to be far\nOff instantly they're going to be fine I still have\nQuestions about that ... you have guys you can put pressure on the quarterback to have guys who could create turnovers that's really going to be the key for the state because it might be just reminiscent of last year is gene where you have a good office here in brain evil figure it out and use all those weapons Josh Gordon last night touchdown reception\nSeventy one different players have one I have a hot at least one touchdown pass from Tom Brady in this group that the all time record now\nFive hundred touchdown passes but you start to look at these numbers\nAnd what a what do they mean\nIf you don't throw for three hundred yards it feels like he had a bad gang member jak Prescott had that runway Geneva troll for two hundred yards so obviously you start questioning well wait a minute deck Prescott don't have any weapons is the bad good he can throw for two hundred yards\nLong three hundred yards now they're drawing for four hundred yards Andrew Luck is averaging forty nine pounds attempts per game through five games that's the most in NFL history where we're going with all this yeah the glove it\nYou know I'm not a single guy with a huge already numbers are not winning game so in fact quite the opposite like a mat Ryan having a monster year or ... cousin just having a monster year big band and having him like crazy that year lock has big numbers all the way to do and they're all not waiting I think\nYou know my own isn't really throwing for that many yards each just being super effective when he's ...\nWell he had three hundred yards in sub par performance for right lines Alaska\nHe'd been in the three hundred ranger all these other guys are on the four hundred yeah you're right says Patrick look at uh we've had yeah crazy numbers so I don't know if your team in I guess I'm gay and your team do you do still run the ball even if they can throw the ball sixty times just for fun have to run the ball\nUsed to be that the run set up the house now feels like the pound sets up the wrong because you want to establish like action when when you establish the running game then all of a sudden the line backers you hold them for a little longer the free safety or whatever it might be but you know now just feels like you're running back can be one of your best wide receivers\nYou know your best running back and maybe your best wide receiver in Carolina with Christian McCaffrey\nA useful James White last night like it's one of those on watching change why not go oh that's right James White Superbowl star probably should have been the MVP gotta catch eighty balls sheer\nElements back drunk if he stays healthy you throw in Josh Gordon and all this ... you know you have another punch bowl with Brady you know serving up the drinks here yes on\nBase out that one of them was saying about uh the path to much don't win which team is is leading the league in a rush attacks\nThere's basically three or four teams that are right up at the top\nTennessee okay Cleveland and the New England patriots\n...\nKinda surprised with the patriots yeah I understand the browns Brown's got a couple of good running backs there and I need that running game to take a little pressure on bigger may feel junior the third but apparently listening to the defensive coordinator for the Baltimore Ravens who faced the browns next a Baker Mayfield is the second coming of John Elway and bread far\nSo maybe I just the hype train it left the station a long time ago with these guys never used to be you had to wait a little while before you jumped on the hype train\nNow you don't\n'cause you're looking at an animal homes will have these moments where he doesn't play well it happens to every single quarterback my curiosity is what is the weakness that he has and how do these defenses capitalize on that because that's what I'm going to want to know\nAnd I'm sure defenses are going to want to know that too yes make a lot of\nI heard an interesting piece of analysis that you actually might agree with but no one else would you know the NFL Films guy Greg hotel you had on tape guy now he says Josh frozen has been as impressive as any rookie quarterback super smooth looks like a future star\nI didn't I didn't notice that at all I mean I watch a lot of cardinals but no one is saying that except for him\nI Would like to see and I trust Greg ... so I Would like to see the cardinals just say to Josh Rosen go out and make your mistakes and go out in and let's just have some fun we're not going to win anything so go out and have 'em you know have fun sounds trite or go out and express yourself\nDon't worry about being demoted don't worry about anything just go out played smart don't get hurt but\nLet's let's push things let's let's let's see what we can do a little bit here because that was my issue with Michel Trybulski at some point the bears have to say we trade it for a little back because we think you're ready to win right now\nOtherwise you don't make a deal that's why I thought the Packers were going to get ...
