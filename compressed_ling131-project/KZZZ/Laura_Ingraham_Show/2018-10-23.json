now\nMaybe it's Cody Kessler who's going to come in or with eight days till the trade deadline does Jacksonville do something dramatic would they make a move for calling ... he lived many\nWould they maybe make a phone call to Oakland and say to John rude and hey John I hear you got a tag sale going on\nUh what do you think about their car what would it cost Panthers comeback to beat the eagles and they were down Seventeen and Doug Peterson was a very strange quote about the eagles now the pressure is off\nI Would think the pressure is on unless you're saying to Philadelphia hey I Hope you enjoy the Superbowl don't expect that much of this year come on you can't go back to back you know said\nWhich is kind of strange because Doug Peterson also said you know we get everybody's best shot you know every week we can and week out like this is their Super Bowl kind of thing because we're the defending champ so that would mean that the pressure is still on I think\nThat's what I Would think would Philadelphia I mean there's still a very good team in in that division up for grabs\nJust like Jacksonville that divisions up for grabs there there are other divisions that are really tough those divisions aren't so Jacksonville can get this together but now you have in fighting here are jailing Ramsey\nI'd say in it even though he has no problem saying about other quarterbacks here's jailing Ramsey talking about the elephant in the room\nWhere you see how it is and here you see a we've I wouldn't advise\nTied or just as good as it is but you're either going to say it or don't said\nDon't hint at it and it's quarterback karma ...\nMaybe needs to do another interview a Jew a GQ and then he'll be open about his quarterback that was the only problem I had with him he's a great player I liked that he talks I like to use that he's colorful charismatic but I said at the John\nIf you're going to rip these other quarterbacks you gotta be willing to rip your quarterback because you don't have a great quarterback and he didn't have anything ... negative to say about Blake bulldoze their now he's sort of has something negative to say but\nI'm not going to say it because I can be apple\nRemembered by the way on a side note member all those years we waited for Debbie and cloudy and change a lot to be great at the same time together I think we're here cloudy was

then after that Baltimore Pittsburgh the chargers Vikings saints and then here's your top three Kansas City\nNew England and the rams\nRams that plus three hundred there the the big favorites here but

their their foreign to a lot of big way I mean they've been a little inconsistent but they feel like a little bit like the team that went to the Superbowl\nWell you know Philadelphia should have put them away you're up Seventeen are but you know Caroline it comes to Caroline is just they're always going to be inconsistent I think that they show flashes of brilliance on often but then there are times when they're just dormant and that's what happened for the first three quarters and then came and company a lead to come back\nA ... a scape getting uh when\nI'm In Baltimore is still a formidable team you know I Know the saints beat them but I mean Baltimore is\nThere not exciting but man they're good they're really good\nUh Drew Brees I did I Believe is now defeated every team in

I thought Raj on Ron do if he did spit on cruise Paul in the video that I saw a and there's been a lot of video I did see one piece of video where I thought Rondo spit on\nUh I thought because of that that you're going to get five games I thought Brandon Ingram because he came in and was swinging at somebody from behind I thought he was going to get more than four games\nOr Chris Paul reacting to I mean once you throw a punch then you know you're going to be suspended but Chris Paul somebody's which in your face and it's Chris Paul so he's not going to back down from anybody but the fact that ... Rondo and Paul don't like each other\nAnd it didn't take much for them to go toe to toe but this started with rented a room and James Harden yeah see\nSo we've probably watch these videos of the fight ten thousand times and every time I pick out one thing that is the most amusing thing to me they're like every time you watch it you find something else that's really funny and watching Carmelo who's right there as it starts and he's like [laughter]\nIt just kind of watches and in slow motion you see when it's almost like he puts his hands up like I'm not doing anything somehow LeBron gets in there before he does it he's right there like among breaking that out here's Carmelo talking about the speeding incident\nJust to clarify officer for the incident\nThat's the only ... you don't do that you don't you don't do that nobody [noise]\nFor someone history [noise]\nHad already seen an MBA he [noise]\nI mean you don't even see that history [noise]\nTo much Carmelo Anthony here Jeb and in New York on the Lakers rockets\nYeah but\nIt was your week out great buddy what do you have for me so I'm I have to a point I'll Try and make a quick because I actually think it's a class in five minutes but I'm a basically a the first\nI Want to make is that I don't understand why people are having an issue with law from oil way Chris all that if you put yourself in that situation and it's the game is the game is not taking place at that point if you put yourself in that situation you see your best friend in a confrontation you're going to do whatever you can pull them out of that situation\nAnd the second point I Want to make and Fritz ... brought this up and now it's one of the best place I've heard I made this point to my friend yesterday is that not only is he taking Chris Paul out of harm's way but he's also taking regime Rondo out of harm's way too which also eliminates the whole\nPoint where you know it's disrespectful of all Chris Paul away and not worry about round up um I got hit the class but thanks for taking my call at\nAll right thank you yeah I agree I mean I I used the closest guy to his friend in people's him away\nThen you know maybe Rondo is not going to go after him because the broad is holding cruise Paul Butler people go out of their way to criticize LeBron James if he had grabbed Raj Enron do then why didn't you grab your body it didn't matter you know they're just people who are going to hate on LeBron no matter what he does\nYou know no matter what they see this season ends without a playoff then LeBron is going to be blind if they make the playoffs\nThen they're going to be credited goes probably elsewhere then LeBron James and to be the younger players or the mix the veteran players with a young players he knows that going in and you know not that this was a charitable case here but\nThis was just one of those isolated incidents that no matter what the brawn did he was going to be wrong I think he did the right thing grabbed his body and you're more likely to get Chris Paul to not respond if LeBron is holding him\nAnd then it doesn't escalate anybody who knows and has been there and it's seen as when it's in person when it's real and it happened so quickly\nYou know rather than ... you know that's a cheap shot man that's a really cheap shot by him and you know he's a kid and he made a stupid stupid\nMistake there you want to protect your teammates but you come from behind and you hit somebody that's when somebody really gets hurt I mean these are grown men big men and you can do some damage there\nThree tours

makers so I only have a best of butter up most of the week that obviously Purdue crushed at Ohio State and just like there is in the second half and Federer was seeing produced off for Tyler trend is going through cancer for the third time I've done what we call the wind would be able to be there and see it happen\nYeah that was a great story Tom run all the uh doing a great job with that thank you Pete I'm being able to be there for the game they interviewed him during the game a pretty cool moment there uh drew in Wisconsin joined just drew\nHey Dan how you doing good so what do you have for me\nA case to obviously the topic is Patrick ... homes I'm\nJust a ridiculous dark but uh\nYou see this more as um the stars ally so to speak with the chiefs are with and you read what he's done with them um Kelsey hill everyone kind of kind of going down to the same time um or do you see this carry over a for years and years to come to as far as a superstar in the ...\nI I think it's going to be something for years to come uh everybody cools off defenses figure you out and Kurt Warner cooled off and he ... you know the greatest show on tour if they had all the weapons there you have to have weapons and you got the leading Russia and the league you\nGot maybe the best tight end in the league and you got the fastest wide receiver and the league may be the best receiver and so if I put those three in there and I have a good often should wine then you have something and you've got a guy who control the ball as far as anybody but he also has great touch any high football IQ\nThose are things that you don't get usually that combination there and homes have shown that you know he'll have those days when he started playing great\nBut when he is they're playing great they're going to put up they're going to put up a forty burger on you and that's what happened last night with the bangles it didn't matter what the bagels do you know can't city had an answer for that and they played a tough schedule you know they played you know they they beat the chargers already they went toe to toe with the patriots here\nYou know that's what I Want to see when you're going against these teams in the a C because if you're a cheese fan to be able to host that's the case it's like the rams\nYou don't it's not you're going to win your division is make sure you get home field advantage there because then you know that's where a championship routes usually begin\nNow when you have that that advantage there now we've seen teams that go on the road\nA deep and it's always travels things they say\nUh the ravens were able to go to New England they weren't afraid to do that there are certain teams that aren't afraid to travel and um you know but if you had that home field advantage in Kansas City Kansas City the fence is not great but I Do think if I'm if there's one gene that meet needs to make a deal at the trade deadline is Kansas City if you can help shore up your defense\nYou know you get Eric Barry back man of Patrick Peterson would be available then that would be something where you just go to swoop in and say All right we'll take the hit here and give up a couple of pigs

you\nDan I'm doing great side actually made that the full switch my friend to athletic all at this point the u._s._a. today was great for me but I appreciate jabbing\nAn already hum tell me what happened before the fight between the rockets Lakers\nSo while I mean it depends on honestly how far back we want to go we can do all show talking about\nRace on Rhonda and Chris Paul and and you know the more you pull the onion the letters back on the on the on that relationship the more you get reminded that these are two guys who just have not liked each other for a long time or you know you have stuff for team usa\nI Believe in two thousand eight where\nChris Paul is getting a spot on the team that Ronda thought he deserved you have to stick cops in two thousand nine or at least you know tension in New Orleans Boston game where after the game came to an end you know they got into it a little bit and so you have two guys who have served at each other for a long time and you hear things about how\nA centrally Rondo would get under ... skin by a by it by going down the road of like I have a championship the type of thing you want and you're never going to get any would get in his head and that way and then critics would say you know I mean listen he's the far superior point guard and\nThen we'll kind of have an air about him of you know I'm I'm the king of the point guard mountain so to speak so these guys didn't like each other and you know that day\nOr in the game if I had to highlight one play more than any other it was the one or in the first half where Chris\nShocks Rondo as he's driving from the right side Ronald was flying\nAnd uh you know it was a strong play on Christmas part and after he you know round or does it get the word so Chris gets the bucket Chris flex is twice to the crowd and kind of plays that up a little bit from what I heard rod though from that point on would not stop talking to Chris and and then you know the sparks kind of started flying at that point\nDo you think Ron does spin on it\nI I Do I mean listen it's technologies an incredible thing and yesterday when\nI get that video of that situation or you know we've seen a ton of money on Twitter and social media already obviously but you know when you don't have a two hundred megabyte video that we got our hands on at the athletic and I'm looking at a higher as laptop screen\nAll of a
