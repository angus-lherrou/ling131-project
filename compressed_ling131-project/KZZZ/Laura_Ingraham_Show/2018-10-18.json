I Know he's punching bag right now a lot of guys\nI don't know if he help the situation here first of all if you have something to say about oh deal Beckham how 'bout you say to oh do back of your boss you don't want to say it to the media you know there's there's not media availability every week with John Barrow he doesn't have to say anything\nHow about you just say something to ... and then if the media ask hey have you talked to oh Dale yes and I I'll keep quiet you know I Love you know his spirit a passion but what I say to him will stay private you know\nI kind of appreciate them doing it publicly though like that because it feels like it might not be ... could be the wrong thing to do for sure and uh but it feels like go back and junior can just do whatever you want and that there is no control there is no\nAnd that the giants organization is just sitting by and letting all of this happened whereas at least now the owner and said no no no no we're not cool with it and he needs to play better\nBut I think it would be more impactful for oh Dale\nUnderstand who you are in what we are and therefore if I'm John Marron I sit down with a live back them and I said look I Need you to just play hard All right I don't need you to be commenting publicly about this it doesn't help us in any way you may be frustrated so am I\nBut I don't have public comments when you don't live up to your contract or you don't produce you know I keep my I keep my comments private so I'm not worried about placate in the media like oh they're letting him go willy nilly and\nIt marrow wants to say you know what I talk to him we have a we have a good understanding I Know he's frustrated we're all frustrated you know but we're in an together something like that you don't need to be public about that and with the lines of punching bag yeah it's been a punching bag for quite some time\nAnd rightfully so with some of this but it's not all on ... but you know the whenever I see these topic bars with these shows and they go to the giants move on from Eli\nWhat does that mean like who you're bringing in right now here you can't move on from Eli right now\nUnless you're bringing in calling capitalistic than stock with the topic bars is should the giants move on from like they're moving on from Eli folks miss just in\nIn April\nBut to it so disingenuous should they move on from the Lyman okay it keeps you Fifteen minutes to talk about something but it it's not being fair to the situation the giants can't move on from him right now\nBut will say yeah can't fathom\nThat he ... on this team or starting for this team next year not at that price and that lack of production not going to happen eight seven seven three D.

I Know it's one game try not to overreact with Jason Tatum did a little but one on one work where he took the ball crippled ... took ... control the often which is Kyrie Irving sports hey I'm curious how this plays out in April and may when they need a last shot or someone to take over again because I feel they have two people to do it now\nWell they may have more than that but it's a great luxury to have as opposed to only having one guy to take the shot if you have two or three and they want to take the shot that's another thing\nThere are a lot of guys who wants to take the shot they're not a lot of guys who you know do take the shot oh I was opener I wanted to know you got some guys here but I still think hate him\nAt some point Tatum is going to go you know I might be the best player on this team\nAnd do they acquiesced to him do they set him up to succeed because Gordon Hayward is coming back and wants to prove that he can play again hiring coming back from injury\nBut I did that would be interesting to watch here's Charles Barkley talking about the Lakers that she's\nA she's a great player is a great man but the Lakers don't have a good team there in October of two years and we try to make the contenders what\nOne concern you the most about the Lakers that she's\nYou take a jumps out at the Y.

brewers\nLast night it's fascinating game and the fact that goes to one and Thirteen innings what stood out what's the one play moment that stood out to you\nWhat stood out once the one plane moment to down to you\n[noise] oh wow uh there was a lot and I know or you know the many Machado stuff ends up being sidebar I I think probably in the thirteenth any and it's tough to really um\nYou know get on managerial moves especially when you're running out of pitching but I my you know I think the ... council decision when many Machado got on with the base hit\nAnd uh there were two out see the other was a wild pitch he moved to second base you got Ballenger he got grand dollar deck and then he ran out of players so you would have had had a picture\nOf hit um so I I think the scenario I Know counseling and post game\nPress conference basically said that they were looking to expand and throw balls and throw it out so you know it was a long night two or three hundred eighty one pitch is a thrown on what Bruce\nBoth teams sixteen pitchers used but I think if you isolate there especially with the open base with Machado the second day to wonder what gain terrific and both sides both the all the pictures that came in the game were terrific I may have probably done the or just put 'em on Grand Isle who has been struggling\nYou know either you decide to pitch them or not and I think council made it that if if if ... got on there they were going to pitch a they were going to walk around all the pets to the pitcher yeah I think that really stands out in the two to one game\nHere's melons you're talking about being surprised that they pitch to him\nAh honestly I was surprised that there are there going to try and pin around me\nAnd they were attacking me I was just a kind of grime loaded\nWith a ... a friend and\nI and you mentioned Manny Machado here I Am going to play this a question and answer here about the play at first base and here's Machado and being asked about or was he purposely trying to step on it and get a large a leg\nMany from your vantage what happened on the point where you are [noise]\nHuh what happened why did you collide with value are there why

trying to get to the back and it was not a bang bang player oh\nNo no less than I I don't know whether he was thrown back by you know somebody who's going to actually ask them\nQuestions [noise] um no not when you watch it clearly\nI for one I wasn't sure what I was doing because it wasn't a bang bang and he stayed on they're pretty long normally you you know you've got a guy trucking down to what you want to get out of the way just accidentally guys have over the years stepped on the back of a ... so he was on the base that was a little awkward\nBut clearly ... you saw many you know drag his left foot after his right foot got off the back you know to\nHit into Aguilar I mean it was really the bench lead looked rather benign but it definitely um [noise] looked intentional so I don't I'm not sure what many saying\nWould you throw at him if you were starting today\nFor the brewers [noise] even though it's playoffs ah\nYeah see now that's my concern then I I think during the regular season without question you're he's gonna he's gonna he has to do that there are pictures on my team that's going to protect my players we thought that it was a dirty play and you can't do that\nSo you know that's the way baseball polices it I I Would be a little reluctant based on you know where the series is in the magnitude of what it means to get to the ... around the world series so [noise]\nI I'm not sure I thought I Would have to be a directive from the manager and she was if it was that adamant and my guess is I think you just put it in the memory bank at some point you know
