Patrick show glad to have you on board spent a lot of time talking football and the first hour\nWe were talking to Terry McCauley used the N. B. C. NFL rules analyst she's a former NFL official and he said and this the first time I've heard this that be legal office tells the officials with the play clock\nDon't enforce it it's it's loosely loosely enforced because we had the moment with the Kansas City chiefs and the Denver Broncos where the chief has got away with a play where clearly they play clock at expires shall we talk to Terry and Terry let us behind the curtain to say that they're told\nHey you're getting downgraded if you actually enforce the rule\nHow strangers ... make it a little loose there okay\nI thought everything with the NFL they had it all down to you know they had it down to earth science what you're allowed to do and say and where\nYou know how they make calls and then you have something as simple as the plague all I Would still have now I'd had people say hey it's really a difficult job I got it I get it was only like a you know how many people in America can do this job\nI got it but when it comes to the play clock\nWhy can't I have something on vibrate that's on your hip just like you do when your phone when you go into a meeting and you put it on vibrate there why don't you just have something that'll let you know\nYou can look at the clock five seconds ... seconds three seconds if it gets down to zero in buses and then if it ... and the play has not started and it's a violation that shit so I can help you because you can't have your eyes in two spots with the play clock and the actual play itself apparently in spurts\nWe got an interesting tweet from me Philip Murphy moments ago said how 'bout NFL rest that you have a Google Glass where the clock projected so they can see two things at once you got the clock in your view with the glasses and you can watch the snapping at a ball all the same time\nAnd it just loosely enforced and I thought was interesting I don't know if there is a big call for this but it feels like every ... there's at least one moment every game where the bullet stamped right after it's gone to double zero yeah see\n... or the other example that Paul mentioned before about twelve players on the field right on the fence you know how are the officials able to see that guy when he actually gets off the field and when the ball it's not that the same time those are two completely different place how are they able to manage that\nThey're all looking at it I Know I have no idea and twelve is approximately Eleven's what is it even matter than the Lebanese ... loosely enforced\nThat if you have twelve on you know there are certain times\nDenver should have been allowed to have had twelve guys on the field you know with a Patrick mom close enough to them uh we've been telling you about the BP show up for the iPhone and Android for a while now and it's without a doubt best way to listen to the show and then live audio stream you'll send the podcast there we have tons of show an apple a video everyday download the deep you show up today at\nThe edge doors and while you're there on Dan Patrick dot com you can look at the Patrick\nMy home's T shirt what's up more homes and it's available all of our T shirts or available there as well yes\nMy daughter ... she's wearing it to school to name it's going to be that the ... in school\nAnd she's not even against that he changed now she has a she she's a she's caught up on the moms hype and just like any on yeah everybody is and she's also six foot one eighty yeah she can slinging but I you\nKnow this whole Patrick moms thing how everybody has just gone overboard with Patrick moms like I'm listening to guys who have been who played in the league who are endless now who say they've never seen anything like this before\n[laughter] he almost lost the other night\nHe had one touchdown Heathrow parents left handed I get it I Know he controllable Ninety yards with ease but just slow down here a little bit of\nThese are the same people who had no idea how good Patrick ... homes was going to be how is it that everybody was missing that Patrick my homes have this ability to be one of the great shoveled he's the MVP do realize last year at this time you know who is the leading MVP candidate\nAlex Smith they started out five and\nAlex Smith is using his weapons they open up the playboy luggage different\nThen they don't do it for Patrick bombs\nBut ... says a lot of talent that great arm strength I don't know what's gonna happen the second time around he's got weapons and a lotta times you get the younger quarterbacks on a team and they don't have weapons\nHe has a veteran team he has Andy Reid there and he's got weapons that is really a benefit of being big benefit for him unlike Baker may feel junior the third you know he's in a losing culture or he's got a coach who probably won't be there next year and he doesn't have a lot of weapons there\nIt's amazing how much better that can make you by having some weapons they're jak Prescott had weapons last year all of a sudden doesn't have the same weapons this year ... got to French Quarter back it changes that quickly do I think more homes is the real deal yeah so I Do but only because an NFL scouting told me\nKeep an eye on I loved watching it I did not know he would be great\nI thought he would make an NFL roster thought he would play in the NFL I had no idea but until a professional said to me you better have more homes on he's the one climbing up the draft board he's the one climbing up the first round and I wasn't really\nHe said he him in the Sean launched an are the ones that are climbing\nAnd meanwhile we got caught up in Mitchell true best ski and you realize that more homes was there for everybody Kansas City realize that that's the difference we need we need somebody who's stretches the field and they got that guy but the fact that you have professional saying never seen anything like this before they could\nReally how long have you been around the NFL I ... ...\nAll of a sudden you go oh my gosh now I haven't seen visibility or this where with all this early in a career I think I I wouldn't grant people that because watching al way when he made his debut or Peyton Manning when he's made his debut like you saw guys who struggled a little bit\nBut he said for a year and\nYou're able to learn with Alex Smith and also Andy Reid and those are two good guys to learn from certainly Andy Reid and you have these weapons cream hunt great traffic Travis Kelsey tiring kill but you know the homes is twenty three\nHe's not Twenty one like Sam Donald ... you know he's got a little more experience and member of the not a big twelve ... anybody could make them up\nTrue but you had to see something different and that's what the NFL's count told me this guy has something a little different\nThan the other guys\nWe're seeing that right now but to go overboard and all of a sudden you know that we've never seen this before we do this every year with the quarter back next year we're going to do it with the quarterback probably apple\n... or you can Google Alex Smith MVP chiefs are the first two weeks of October he was by far the front runner than BP a\n... a year ago just about a year ago today\nSmith has eleven TD pass as the season tied for the most of the interception by any player in five games\nWhat do you let other people order for
