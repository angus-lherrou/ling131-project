good\nYeah apple\nYou anytime you want a good laugh go back and look and Jerry Rice is numbers at age twenty five in Nineteen eighty seven he had sixty five catches no big deal twenty two of them were touchdowns yeah\n[noise] I was at the playoff game in the niners played the giants at the Meadowlands and I think the final score was forty nine to ten\nSomething like that giants crushed and writes dropped a touchdown and I remember\nIt was early I Believe I remember asking Lawrence Taylor\nYou know Jerry Rice scores that touchdown what do you think what do you think the story is final score\nAnd he goes I'm\nForty nine to Seventeen he was just adding seven boys it wasn't going to change the outcome at all the giants were so good back then but uh I Believe rice dropped a or a

opposed to of Montana young and the niners are running the west coast off inch now what kind of numbers is Jerry Rice said we often talk about Dan Marino what with Dan Marino due in today's game but he's going to throw fifty touchdown passes but he threw forty eight back in Nineteen eighty four\nOr ... you know could Heathrow fifty five like painting and Brady yes she could or is it going to throw for five thousand years I think ... only true for four thousand you were once in his career but\nIt feels like Marino was the one guy said boy I'd love to see them in today's game I Wonder what

to your phone calls eight hundred six five five Mike John we'll start with you hey John welcome to Philadelphia you're up on the gallery show\nOn God's going good how are you John [laughter]\nNot too bad I'm kind of in a dilemma what's the dilemma let me straighten yeah uh well I'm trying to figure out specifically which Democrats are running on open borders because all I care a lot of talk about it\nBut you I only hear about it from a counterpoint or which ones are running on that let me show I'm trying to figure out what's going to exactly or like saying you\nKnow let 'em run free let them on the border one another and ... with us yeah let me let me ask you\nBecause there was an analysis I was just reading from the Associated Press and it ran on Fox News\nHeadlines Democrats are remaining silent on the caravan of thousands of immigrants on the march from Central America and unwilling to get into any kind of a debate with President Trump the terms are just weeks away the the answer\nEither way on him to step up then they're waiting on him to step\nThe the answer John is that the Democrats are saying a word of condemnation of the thousands and thousands of illegals you're heading towards the border the answer is they don't condemn that because it's it's\nPlus at least reported find me a Democrat and you know maybe the easiest things to answer your question with a question which Democrat\nIs expressing concern and fear and worry anxiety\nUm over the thousands of illegal short headed towards our border name one they want because they are in favor of open borders they've all set it in various ways and and sometimes you say something by your refusal to step up\nYou're talking about stepping up John how about a Democrat stepping up\nAgainst the kind of violence we've seen directed towards um Mitch McConnell in restaurants and the mob mentality Boulder thrown through a\nHouse majority leader Kevin McCarthy's office in Bakersfield, California how about some condemnation now what we've heard is getting Republicans faces go after them create a sheen create a crowd that's that's your answer they are not\nUm uh expressing the will of the people in concerns and and and frustrations over this uh this angry band of people heading our way\nEight hundred six five five Mike will your next how you doing well\nNow do all night and good thing that I haven't heard a lot about it and it's a little bit frustrating is where does it say it in our constitution and our laws or whatever\nThat we have to pay benefits to people who are here illegally [laughter] I mean well it's just it's almost like people assume that well when they get here it doesn't matter if they're here illegally and I were given benefits or why don't\nWe just you wait a minute what's wrong with you you mean you don't want to give in state tuition benefits to illegal you mean you don't want to give drivers licenses to illegal you mean you don't want to give free health care to a legal what are you a racist well\nWhat are you I'm honest to goodness you're right where where in the world does it say we should be given folks who come to this country illegally and tried to steal residency and that's literally what illegals or doing\nAny kind of benefits whatsoever that's the kind of reasonable question that you don't hear too often from the Democrats thank you will portions
