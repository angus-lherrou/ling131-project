you\nWas spot on but very kind of very short so let me just mentioned this again you are no stranger\nTo radio let's go through some of these things you've been on thousands of radio programs you've been in the public eye doing this stuff for a lot a lot a lot of years and I used to love watching on TV and we'll go there and just admitted man oh man give me some background how'd you get started and radio and all this stuff\nWell I appreciate market appreciate being home with your day because these are important times for us as gun owners they're dangerous times for our country they're dangerous time for those of us who care about freedom care about\nBeing able to take care of our families a lot I think it is absolutely essential the job you're doing a ... this was really really an\n... program and sort of ... we're going to promote your program at every opportunity I'm a you know I'm from the country\nOr they're in northwest Louisiana grew up a shooting guns that riding horses are riding motorcycles you know what I'm saying I have a couple of ... along the way and actually I began an entertainment career in\nMusic and we we continue to do that and and and thank you for mentioning we did have talked to in record by two thousand Thirteen and I've had several things but back in the early Nineteen nineties Nineteen Ninety nine to not want a we decided\nTo uh put guns on TV because there weren't any\nAnd we I and some other people that that were enthusiastic about projects that way but you know we need to show people how to shoot guns how to how to properly handled goes how to do the place of the gun in our society our culture\nAnd that was the original shooting show and it shows used to say and what do we ...\nShow and the shows used at six and where you where you were up on satellite we were free to cable companies everywhere it wound up helping to build a\nA couple of TV networks loan way of radio network or two as well\nAnd and it's just been a real privilege you know a couple of days ago I was at a veterans are gathering them jail a down into solved and\nMet some people used to watch the shows you know so ... we're so thankful for over the years the people that are really hung in there with us because we need more media pro gun media on TV ... comment\nWell you brought your show was really the precursor to it when we talk let's talk about a mutual friend of ours somebody that you haven't talked to in a while but it's a very very close friend of mine we spoke about off air over the last few days and that's for example Mr Rob painted you remember watching rock show\nOn uh from ... out there in Colorado a number of years ago su I\nYou know you gave birth to this stuff into that genre of television a long time ago and I want people to understand who it is we're talking to hear because it was you who who who are a lot of people look at as the the godfather of that genre of television on outdoor channel and everything else correct\nWhere it where it was due due humility I'm a ... yeah probably yeah oh\nYeah and yeah you can only bought you got you got to be careful if you take all the credit you might get all the blame you know what I'm saying you know what I I think I've played with that because when you look at quality of\nProgramming that you put out in the quality of programming that followed you I'd be more than happy to say that I can take credit for that if it were me and also to take some of that blame because you were very instrumental\nIn creating that type of television programming in it of course in a splintered off and we now have a number of other different TV shows from that but now now things are changing we're going to get well we've got about another three minutes in in this segment maybe two and a half so let's say that your movie you did I mean how many how many radio shows you know thousands thousands\nAnd thousands radio shows where you are done trust your radio visual radio that's true of a new music goes motor sports we've had a good old time at a you know as you and I discussed it is so important what we're doing and we will talk about this for combat sure you have something really exciting that you're going to be order\nAnd all it is going to just add to mix you know you talked about the other us photo shows came after us because it's so\nCritical that we have pro gun images because a lot of people are saying hey\nYou know we're surrounded we can find them in a way we go we got it right where we want to McCain right this time with that\nYou know that's that's true that's very true statement we're surrounded we've got it right where we wanted we know right\nWhere they are ... you know and and that's and that's pretty much how I think a lot of people feel\nAbout where we are right now at least if you watch the mainstream lane string lying propaganda media\nYou know they're they're they hate us and they surrounded us and all that stuff but we're fighting our way out of this no doubt about it we are going to win because I Know you feel like I Do Johnny read I'm always prevail it might be one hell of a battle or a number of battles and it always is a number of battle but nonetheless uh\nYou know I I think freedom always prevail so some of the things I Want to cover with you when we come back we've got a lot of ground to cover fortunately my next two segments are are fairly good size segments so we'll be able to spend some time there\nBut you know a real I Want to I Want to cover some of your your shows with you what we're talking about doing down the road want to talk about what tombstones doing down the road very important coming out of tune with the freedom day's coming up in June again I guess that'll be the says but before I go there are you in business today are un tombstone\nOh actually I'm looking over in the Mexico's ... come down on the border\nTo them about how when they were\nWell but we're actually based out of tombstone\nAnd it is like you said more of the most unique places in the world so a historically significant in the development of the Old West to in fact are the the Old West image around the world tombstone is actually bigger than life and it's all did a lot of uh\nYou know a much to talk about there and and so really it was just such a pleasure to meet you to see you and Allen there oh this past week\nYou know that was a lot of fun and to row into town with Alan Gottlieb was you know\nUh there there's that just added a whole new sense of fun you know as you know I've been going through so for you know a quarter of a century because of that has drawn to it and to roll into town with Mr Gottlieb responding to know that he sat over there in the wider room at the Larry a motel pending op read an op ed that was a running\nWell yeah I think it's great to see you there and to be able to be bringing some of what you're going to be bringing from that area that as you mentioned it's so rich in history and its captivated me for a number of years\nYou know you mentioned the movie's really fun stuff you know the original the tombstone movie in Nineteen Ninety three I Believe in Ninety four with Val Kilmer and Kurt Russell a little bit more vulnerable than the others that you know Val Kilmer played a a version of doc holiday and then you go over to the wire DARPA Dennis Quaid played a little bit more I I think the wider movie it was a little bit more historically accurate because it covered\nIn that area that comes alive when you get there and as you know you came to the Larry and when we were the right before we were ready to go to the airwaves on Monday This bomb and uh I don't know if the mayor was there when you got there and not the boy that segment with him was just off the hook who I could've kept him for an hours\nAnd talked about that we have on you know\nHe's he's fine dust that definitely fun guy he's got to tell a friend of mine a dusty and gold and for that matter and and you're exactly right and you know what I was so proud this past year and now I'm looking forward you folks get out here for the next freedom days but a dusty stood up\nFor for Arizona and certainly tombstone stood up for the second amendment or in America\nBut look we're for climbing the second amendment ... yes go ahead\nNo no ... that he he absolutely did when he read that and we read the proclamation on the show I Believe you're going to hear your I think we're going to hear\nGordon read it in the third our as I as a replay that amazing find our from Tucson but you know that made global news that wasn't did make news until that made news all over the world\nWhen when uh when Dustin stood up for the second amendment and choose because to stone people come there you got this little town of about two thousand people out in the middle of Arizona\nIn what most people say how they even find this place and people from all over the world make the pilgrimage there because of its rich history\nPeople go and show up and that's very very cool now let's talk about the freedom day's coming up in June I'll be there you'll be there Allen will hopefully be they're dependent on his schedule we never know but I'm the freedom days is what\nA ... and the first ... first of July\nAnd the end of June July and it is celebrating what we have\nHere in our country the so unique and and you know what you're talking about freedom days and that's because that's the name of muscle my name is freedom the one that has done best for us but but the the point is the American gun or\nActually stands and the way we the American gun stand and the way of the global as police state\nIt is that is literally the armed American citizen you know our country is supposed to be governed from the bottom up from the people to top rather than from the top down and we the\nPeople that are armed we are absolutely the the line of defense for the concept\nOf liberty in war and that's what we're celebrating here and\nI'm hopeful that there'll be some other cities got a quick story take\nSo many years just to let you know we got about a minute I think coming up in the segment so go ahead\nOh hurt or you know we had some some folks from up from around the country people come from all over and there was a lady from North of the U.S border I won't do

in four sixty cartridge I had some audio queued up for you that\nI I just decided you know what I'd rather hear it from you but I've watched a number of videos on your car to just I don't think a lot of people know a whole lot about it I mean a lot of people do a lot of shooters do put a lot of lot of folks out there now who just have a gun at home because they want a gun at home that might not be an enthusiast might not know about\nThis incredible cartridge the four sixty a hard hit her man tell us about how did you come up with it and what where where can we get it and where did where where do we shoot it\nWell I'll tell you it's up there there's kind of fun story there about how it happened or realize that out in the country where I'm originally from ... what's your day care gone all the time\nOr like you I mean this is is you know a one time of the great legendary build Jordan I heard some also build you have to go and he said do I have my pants on well yeah I Do\nAnyway I'm In Louisiana oh we live in a rural area and a way out in the woods and I have a cougar come up over a month\nAnd you know a A R a I said you know\nA cougar you can take a cougar\nOne of the twenty two magnum if you're getting the whole state of the trick is\nGetting in the whole state and we're talking a hundred and Seventy five pounds of of team thing closes brings the your muscle if they'll all be wrestling with the Cooper and and uh unfortunately ... like in in the movies and on on some of these programs are accuracy\nUnder stress is much quieter yourself or as easy as a folk\nYou didn't have what we call stopping a war and I carried a large cortical magnum revolver for a long time but you know it's hard to get into trouble with it and it was just and then when you call from the forty four magnum mogul Blass pretty horrendous well\nUh I kept thinking if there'd be some way that I could somehow equal pay forty four magnum revolver but do it in the soil and relatively lightweight certainly portable Nineteen low level but\nRelatively a lightweight certainly portable Nineteen low level platform and uh we're good friends Tim Clark senior the great postal Smith was a mental for my great friends and\nAnd I began to talk with him about it and\nSo he gave me some parts of the game to them I had some friends of our companies and all and I I hear a ballistic combination that no one knew existed including late\nAnd so uh I wound up with a compensated to a viral from originally from ... guns and we wound up getting I I felt like\nA ... with our level that I wanted I couldn't do it in a regular uh forty five I see the case because somebody might put it in a\nIn an own modified forty five I think they are it's truly a four fifty one dime and a ... it's like a forty five magnum but I called it the four sixty to give it some people would understand that was a different cartridge so we actually\nAre a link and the chamber slightly succeeding from age actually so um you can you can shoot the forty five\nAn hour ... heads like salt extract or any way you can shoot the forty five and our most of the time [noise] but you can't shoot a four sixty an hour forty five sort of like a thirty a revolver\nSee where the three fifty seven magnum cartridge you the three fifty seven magna while she was thirty eight when he walks you a A R T H ... she's just so so\nUh we're using components that are common that you just come bother inexpensive and\nIt does get forty four magnum performance a revolver performance but it goes with much less no was much less recall were run on about a ... foot towns the mobile energy model eighty five grind bullet going on about this thing a hundred and Seventy five feet per second Alvaro easy too\nStrict and it and plus we we gain an advantage inaccuracy I always thought that\nThe twist ratio and um and with a little technical here we won't last long ... was a little bit slow and realized the twist right in a forty five I see people don't bite from Nineteen level will technologies come alone will uh the manufacturers\nHave stayed with that stress right when you give them velocity\nIt increases stable is like the bullets and we have we got a shooting on a two inch groups that a hundred yards five shot groups and that's not terribly don't use\nIt but it's easy to carry and we've we've got some law enforcement carrying

put you on the spot over there while we have Gordon here at the at the great Larry a motel ... let's talk a little bit about the mayor said that to my son was made\nThe second amendment city and obviously the gun into the marriage that play the title part I'm Sorry America America Second Amendment city and that made national new health may global news\nAnd you notified me of that and I was reading about it on the news when you saw that one I mean tombstone Arizona when you saw that America's Second Amendment she went through your head\nI think from memory I may have had known about ... just before it happens taint Gordon and emailed me and contacted me about it ahead of time and we put at a news release of battles as well for the second amendment foundation or\nComplimenting things done on becoming a ... for a Second Amendment city says they and then urging other cities to adopt resolution like this to and which many other cities around the country did the tombstone was the leader\nTo tone leading as America's Second Amendment city the first one I'm going to talk with you in really good detail about that because there's history behind that and how it all came about and what you're doing with moving in the future\nI Will say this but I've had the benefit of being here many times since Nineteen Ninety six this is your first time here as I told them what the heck of a job out here this place looks better than I've ever seen that look before I'll go there with you to know other cities did this what is it what does it mean that that a city says I'm going to be\nAn American Second Amendment city does it make your life easier is the founder of Second Amendment foundation well I'll tell you what\nDid it came about some did this it was coming at a time we had a lot of cities came up on the rights of gun owners passing all kinds of ordinance is in gun control statutes and their cities attacking kind of rights and it was really great to see a city in particular\nAttacking kind of rice and it was really great city to which don't come along in and say hey there is the second amendment we get a circuit board it in a mock nation the mayor side was just tremendous and it helps as the as a push back\nAnd anything I can get pushback helps us fight the second Amendment rights so loyal to the stone a debt of gratitude\nAnd you know what I think it's cool about what you\nCan only be a very small place but it is widely recognized when you hear the name too so people know they know to them so it might be ... twenty six hundred residency somewhere around like Fifteen Fifteen hundred so it yeah Fifteen hundred there's not a lot of residence or small town but it's got up\nThe may well mainly an Fifteen hundred residents but how many tourists a year\nA lot more than Fifteen hundred now Eldorado days is coming up you will be gone at that time worker right at the Colorado as America that is\nDesigned to design too but what does it celebrates the value of the history of folk worthwhile to think about all the color for characters came through you talk today that said I don't even remember like when he was shot at Frank Frank Leslie was one of the Tories gunfighter really Old West\nAnd I would guess you're probably more of those on names up there probably wasn't Craig's on the victim I\nProbably not going to create jobs are amazing
