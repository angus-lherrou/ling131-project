nine and the NBC Sports network and our Twitter handle ... show Meg loving the poll questions so far\nSo I put up which three one team will not make the playoffs the choices are the dolphins the

options to hey who do you want to see\nWhen the world series who do I want to see when the world's yes now he just think about the choices for a second you have the Cleveland Indians you know I've been waiting a long time then you have the Milwaukee Brewers who are now the darling team I Would say possibly remember we had breweries day last week a you've got the Rockies\nOr that I don't know maybe the Yankees Red Sox if you're that kind of or the age there's some lovable underdogs there anyone that take America's Team\nI Would think the Indians just because they'd come close the brewers are cool story and they have a home field advantage throughout um and you know they have a closer you don't have anybody who has that weapon internationally and hater Josh is\nThe difference maker for Milwaukee yelling she was a lot of fun to watch when he's obviously very talented or you came close to the triple crown but you know it feels like there's still a crap shoot the national league\nOf who could win it and go to the world series he's American League you know it feels like it's the red Sox but I I I'm surprised that we still we look past the Astros I mean the Astros are defending champ\nThat pitching staff has great they still have a great nucleus of hitters we just sort of ... you know we moved on to another store that's how it doesn't we don't stay on the story too long like that's last year store like two years ago the cubs like we moved on from that and now you're like okay what's the next door it's like the way we do with quarterbacks\nWhen you think about it like we fall in love with a quarterback like oh man this guy's unbelievable and then all of a sudden you go\nYou know who's the next quarter back every week one Sam don't mean that feels like it was well weeks ago\nSeemed to Arnold oh my gosh show the giants are kicking themselves they get the judge stolen and then it was Baker may feel junior the third\nAnd then the other performance against the raiders now yeah Patrick homes where the homes feels like he's going to be there for a little while\nUh but it feels like every year fall in love with the quarter back and look you know the affair does it lasts an entire season feels like it's almost weak the weak member Sean Watson like oh my God if you're going to invest in a quarterback and you know the Texans but that was that was so ten months ago yeah the club\nI'm kind of worry that people are going to forget about the two thousand sixteen cubs because\nYou know in Chicago a few in a title people just forget I mean did you know

a couple of T shirts there to a mom's house a couple of stories here\nOh first of all I told you about the players association and like they one clarification on these rules the rule changes in the off season that's all they're asking for the competition committee as well they're just trying to find out this robbing the pastoral has caused so much controversy\nAnd the competition committee is saying and now they said there's privately now they're saying it publicly that they believe the roughing penalties will decrease in the uh second half of the season [noise]\nSo uh there was a conference call this according to Ian Rapaport the expectation on this conference call or this week with the competition committee\nA now they've chosen not to push for any changes in the rough independence rule that it's caused so much controversy no changes were proposed regarding defenders putting their body weight on a quarterback when making a hitter shocked but according to several people on the conference call\nThe expectation is forward the league is emphasizing to officials they need to be sure a player applied all or most of his body weight when making a hit before throwing the flack\nMany of the competition committee members felt they hit by clay Matthews on Kirk the cousins in week two was not a felon according to sources it was a of the scoop and poll variety\nYeah there's that just typical NFL they make it more complicated yeah McCullough\nIt's so weird that they changed four hundred and twelve rules every offseason the officials have trouble in September ... do you think they could just stick with the rule book [noise] why do they do this every year\nI don't know lawsuits and you say that every year like why are they changing so many rules yeah but I I've said before for years now but I don't think it's fair that you have a deep friendship player who can just sort of pick you up and then pile drive you like I don't think you could you should be able to do that and uh because your ear defenseless I got you in the air\nYou know you're you're not going to be involved in the play anymore unless you have the ball but even then I Can't I Can't let somebody just apply all their way to you but clay Matthews never should have been flag never you know apple\nYeah or else thinks is that any incidental hand contact the quarterbacks helmet is roughing

seven million dollars something like that but uh he's going to be back during the by week for the Steelers here Rockies cubs elimination game coming up later on ... question make love and what do we have today\nOkay which three in one team does it make the playoffs and there is a runaway leader\nDon't gangs or the titans it's a dolphin okay\nWhich I guess it's fair but then tightened their second then bangles bears ravens and no one has the same two jaguars\nYeah I don't see that happening jags against Kansas City for a Patrick bombs but I I I've said this before and I truly believe it's the litmus test for young quarterbacks let me see what you do when you're not playing well\nAnd more homes did throw for over three hundred yards at one touchdown pass no interceptions any ... add a couple of highlights there but really Denver should have won the game in case Cain of connects with them areas Thomas\nAnd I thought Thomas it didn't feel like he was running full speed eat eat it felt like he stopped a little bit on that route but if they connect then we have a different story today then you know what we're talking about Kansas City is like a defense I Believe\nA but Denver you got to have that when we give credit to Kansas City and I got Jacksonville coming in and that'll be another nice test here it feels like we keep waiting like each week it'd be like well let me see what he does on the road in a hostile environment but let's see what he goes against the great defense\nAlright oh moans bull session at the end of the season I think he's proven to be a whole lot better than anybody thought he would be remember he was a system quarterback in college\nTexas Tech famous for having system quarterback Senator Graham herrell\nIf they've had it like you know five of the four or five these guys probably had ten thousand yards in their career you know see\nThat's a pretty fair though I mean the big twelve right that everybody there does throw for a billion yards and there is no defense but the difference\nIn ... if you're looking at my homes yet you have to separate that with the system and saying you know I can put a lot of quarterbacks in the system and they can be successful in the system can you be different in that system in motor homes is different than these other Texas Tech quarterbacks who is it sunny\nCombee we'll see another one in there how many of those\nTroll for a lot of yards you know Mike Leach was brilliant but if you look at my home's he's got arm strength and there's this feeling of keeping a play alive more I it feels like it's

Wednesday night hockey begins Wednesday on NBC and it's an update the poll results there michelob\nOkay which three in one team will not make the playoffs the only thing that we're changing that oh well what do you want to change it to I had a question and he's passing too easy in the NFL right now yes there are no doubt about\nSeniors who he's in college football right now you got guys who are on record setting pace as your completing Seventy percent of their parents used to be a few completed over fifty percent you're considered a pretty good quarterback and then I remember when Steve Young completed Seventy Seventy one percent of his parents who is with the niners one year\nAnd I think he was up there completion percentage leader like five times in his nine or days but it feels like now these college kids they're they're complaining sixty five Seventy percent of their parents as you know because\nI saw that the other day four quarterbacks are paid to set the single season record and they're not even having great years big band Jared Goff Kirk Cousins and Garrett car\nWhat goes back to that stat that I told Troy Aikman about the number of four hundred yards passing games in the NFL it's not a big deal anymore you've had more already through four weeks then you have entire seasons in the NFL\nThe four hundred yards is just not a big deal and used to be like somebody had a four hundred yard pouncing game three hundred used to be big now four hundred alright yep all\nAccording to a sports Business Journal week four in the NFL was up on all networks combined all windows up football of twelve twelve percent\nFrom last year ratings and the big ratings jumper last year now\nAnd nobody's talking about the ratings when the ratings are good nobody talks about the ratings for their bad it's like well I Know why they're bad\nI saw were Kanye West reached out to Colin Kaepernick to arrange a meeting at the White House you're going to see this\nOf course follow up on you or is he then he changed his name now it's ... but he prances he lets his new name I think ... yeah but it's\nGone yeah like coach ... but it's it is yeah yeah [laughter] [noise] why do they call you coach tubes it should be coached the UBS [laughter] yeah All right uh Marty in Georgia for we get to a ... of the Pittsburgh Post Gazette Hi Marty ... for me today\nAre just a quick question oh sorry six five to ten [noise]\nUm so you're talking about the what if they brought in shock clock violation a as a ... game like you have a big horn like that the Troy um wings like the big clog foreign goes off\nI'm\nLike that way that was that was yeah that was our soul that way there's no argument as to whether or not there to the lake it\nYeah I they missed it last night with achieves they got away with one but it just feels like thanks for the phone call their Marty that if you have an official whose job is to look at the plate clock\nAnd and so he's going to look at the clock it gets to zero and then he must have been shipped in size over that quick turn over to the quarter back to see if he's gotten the playoff there\nSo you do get the benefit of the doubt if it does get down to zero and you know the you somehow ... by the time the official I don't can't the official do two things at once can't you frame the shock where you look at the plate\nPaint the official do two things at once can't you frame the shot where you look at the uh play clock and the quarterback and if you see any movement there or after the you know zero comes up then you call a penalty I guess it doesn't seem that difficult you know\nA lot on ... on the Internet on Twitter that people are slowing it down and out last night they put in slow motion you look at the plain clocks been gone for a second and a half now slow pitch forever they\nMissed that one ... of the Pittsburgh Post Gazette Steelers beat writer and and joins us now of course we have news with a lady on bell he's coming back and among so everybody's rejoicing and I'm I'm assuming is that right in\n[laughter] there's so much mixed emotion here and that's assuming we believe he's coming back and among stand because he's made all kinds of statements but for a that he was going to start the season that who's going to hold out the whole season that he was going to have is best season and so this is the latest this sounds more\nReasonable all these sounds committed a from a what I read of him talking to a Germany following the so uh\nIt sounds like he's coming back yes the ... the weaker that buys for them\nOkay why do you think he's coming back now or in a minute\nI [noise] I tell them no you know if it's because\nWe thought it was going to come in and they did to a before the start of the season he didn't do that so the longer he stayed out this quote unquote save himself from all his carries that everything he was going to get I I figured he's just why not just stay out the whole season because he would still be a free agent next year\nI'm why lose all this money up till now\nWhy now that the only thing I can think of Dan is last year he came in Monday before the first game and they used to ride away he could use the pie week and the next week that would give him two weeks of practice before the first game that's the only thing I can think of why he's coming in that\nIf you're the Steelers how do you think do you do\n[noise] um [noise] you know is this that and then around with a bunch of guys\nI think they would get the two week roster exemption first of all and practice in that first week see how we do and then then the second week determine\nIf he's writing a play or not if he's ready or you just you you know it's just lift that roster exemption the news now they they could do the two weeks saying and not pay him for those two weeks as well\nAnd my guess is why would you pay him for the by week when there's no game but if he's just practice and so they could lose that week 'cause of pay too but the pay at this point doesn't seem to be the big sticking point\nHow is that ravens last playing locally\nGod well [laughter] they went from a beating camp on Monday Night to 'em and and there have been some um\nUh uh uh optimism around town to now his team is not going to even make the playoffs or maybe not even have a winning season that's that's we have a we have a saying here when\nSuperbowl lose no Super Bowl that's weak the weak um so it's it's very pessimistic here this week because of\nHolly walked on the fence a specifically and um [noise] you know the schedule they have a brutal schedule they've lost both of their games at home so far\nHe had just trying to figure this out and and even when I saw the news would levy on bill coming back I still wonder what's what's the likelihood of the trade before he even comes back when you think that as\nWell [noise] ... ... ... ... you know in baseball they they do a trade for rental players than a week and we see that all the time and um that's what bell would be because they can't give them a new contract this year\nUm they'd have to wait until after the season so it does it ... want to give is there a chain out there that has the capital room it feels it's a running back away from you know making Iran at the playoffs\nAnd as you wanted to get a you know that one of the report said second round in a player um I think they'd pick a third round her I really do\nBecause of the ... that that they're not going to get a third round called pick if he leaves a free agent killed twenty twenty and it would be at the end it around if somebody's willing to give a third round there will be next year it would be you know higher\nBut um well see I I mean there might be a team out there willing to give up a third writer but then with the Steelers it depends where they are too they lose these next two games and he comes back there one for one or what do you plan for\nIn

now the left trying to desperately figure out how to stop Brett Kavanaugh fears the\nPoll numbers senator Heidi Heitkamp who it has been measuring could be a crucial vote in the Kavanaugh\nNomination confirmation\nShe is now considered one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats she now trails for Republican challenger by ten points fifty one percent of voters say thereby back are backing a representative Kevin Cramer the Republican forty one percent they support high camp\nNow that could be enough to motivate her to say you know what I got to pull something out of my hat maybe across the island vote yes on Brett Kavanaugh\nOr if I don't know how to predict dish it out it's a jump ball still it's a I don't know where it's gonna go here's my production Jeff Flake is a no\nI think Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski maybe a yes Heidi Heitkamp\n\nMight be a gash Joe Manchin might be a yes I'm confident I'm optimistic and I am prayer for we're going to need to pray pray pray Jim you're on the Mike Gallagher show at eight hundred six five five Mike hey Jim welcome ed how are you sure\nVery well thank you Mr Gallagher good question I hear a lot of negativity about judge Kavanaugh but no one has ever said anything about the other side Dr port what happened to me I find that his country this up what recourse this society have should be prosecuted shall be fair there do you think\nSo the FBI won't they won't conclude that because all the FBI is going to be able to do is take her statement that's the role of evidence they that's what we've been saying all along\nThey don't even that's not even their process there's no federal crime here\nThere's no police agency like the Maryland police department investigating all they can do is take her report at present the findings to the Senate that's all they'll do there's not going to be a conclusion from the FBI they're not going to say aha we found out she lied or aha we found out he's while he's line they they're not going to find that they're going to find witnesses\nWho are potential corroborating\nWitnesses to the accusers and they're going to\nPotential corroborating witnesses to the accusers and they're going to present that information\nTo the Senate for their review and their assessment it's all going to happen eight hundred six five five Mike one open line Jesse your next door Jesse Jesse you there\nI like to hear me a loud and clear sure welcome to the show and thank you uh the suicide all does this kind of off subject to Kavanaugh discussion have you\nBeen having a but I just it it struck me as all day out my wife and I play a little game a week we channel surf in the morning before work and and the game would play is is we flip between box which we normally watch to get the truth about things\nAnd then suddenly see and CNN and and we see how often it is just that\nYou know random times when we turn it on the other two channels that they're saying something disparaging about Trump and right now they're they're at about ... eighty percent average the average pay that a little bit you know we had the bad weather and everything because it was you know lost some time to criticized Trump them\nBut this morning they had a uh some gifts song and they were criticizing him over way he treats the L recorders\nAnd it struck me as ironic that one of the gifts that they chose to have on\nWas this guy Brian ... and he's the White House correspondent for playboy magazine\nI Need you to I Need you to read it I needed a bottom line for me and my friend 'cause I'm up against the clock I Love your tell give me your point well\nThe point is is that you know it seems as though it's ironic that a magazine that that got its start exploiting women\nAre being anti feminist right up as a White House correspondent that CNN saw no problem at all with to put on there and get time to to\nThere's been a lot of the ironies Jesse you're so right lots of ironies including up to and including the richest one of all\nWhere Richard Blumenthal\nThis was the one that I Can't get to\nHave the audacity last week and and I forgot to point this out her way to use the Latin phrase about jury instructions to cap it on Kavanaugh very smartly said well maybe you should read that\nThe Latin phrase the jury instruction had to do with if you lie about one thing you lie about\nWho Lied about his service in Vietnam had the you know what\nSo does that mean Richard Blumenthal lives about other things because he lied about surfing his country in the Vietnam War\nThis stuff on these guys are like
