Prescott who doesn't have a great off into one inch banged up is ... is still very good he just doesn't have a number one wide receiver\nUnder contract for one more year and then all of a sudden you're going to have to decide is he a hundred million dollar way why is it always have to be a hundred million dollars\nLike you know that franchise tiger I know it just feels like hey you're going to make six hundred thousand dollars now next year you make a hundred million dollar contract again there are somewhere in between there for the is there somewhere in between salary for these quarterbacks\nRemember Mike Lennon you didn't do anything and all of a sudden he's going to make sixteen million\nWhy Sam ... got twenty million why shouldn't there be\nThan we don't want to give you twenty because then there's going to be all this expectation and pressure on you\nHow about we give you a nine you know people might be a little bit easier on you if we gave you a nine million yes Big Love it\nYeah but a backup shooting guard in the Brooklyn that's getting Seventeen and no one's blinking\nOh we are yeah oh yeah I'm blanking when I go out and grabs contracts like Allen crab\nWhere Alan crab we always bring up Alan crab whole middle sap\nWhile he's actually a mold and then I although I Know hey who will be the coach for uh whoever is making his decision next year is that a part of the equation\nGarrett will not be the coach next year hot no I don't think so\nAnd uh when it with the current regime there you're just not what the current system you're not going to do it yes you do you want that job no I Do not\n... yeah because I liked his job right here\nOkay imagine if you weren't doing this oh you are a head coach of another team and then the cowboys job opened up would you want that job\n[noise] no no\nBecause it it always feels like there's somebody who is looming over you and that is Jerry Jones and I I just think that would be insufferable\nNow I think Jason Garrett it's an all offensive coordinator I don't think he's a head coach but even off into coordinator you know that that part of what we expect out of him has been great not this season and this is where you really have to tap into that and say we got to come up with some things here\nWe don't have a number one wide receiver you drafted a linebacker and you could have drafted a wide receiver and you chose not to\nI'm ... and you know I joked about this that the the team that needed does Bryant the most they felt like was that was because nobody else wanted ... Bryant or at least they you know some you know kick the tires here\nBut member desk Saudi at eleven teams that might be interested he was going to go to an NFC team and come back to haunt the cowboys you know ... not the answer\nA but it feels like they should have been somebody that they could have gone and gotten or drafted and said we gotta we gotta number one target here for jak Prescott because we're seeing that there are holes in his game\nAs there are with all of these quarterbacks if you don't have you know a couple of elements here where you have a good often should wind or good running back and you have it go too wide receiver he had all of those you check the box on all of those\nSo it's hard to not succeed when you have all of those elements great often should line a couple of go to big ... big targets and I got ... el it and they had all of that\nBecause then you respect play action and all of a sudden everybody's looking like an old pro amounts not now those defenses or just go on let me see if you can vetoes apple\nCan we be the first two phone make up the uh next David ... is a candidate and always job rumor it'd be great to be first to make that up he would never take that job right but oh so you're already discussing [laughter] there you go\nBecause it's not real but it would be really aren't real and uh I there's no way next saving control freak would go in there and all of a sudden jury's going to be right there with him what if he let him have control of the way on and so now Jerry can't help himself\nHe can't cannot help himself what about Lincoln Riley Oklahoma coasts you do it if you're an\nYeah really yeah it's a big jump for him\nYou know it'd be a big jump you know the Sean Payton woody entertain something like that would you leave New Orleans with a team that could be Superbowl caliber team to go to the Dallas Cowboys I don't know\nWhy don't they just why didn't Jerry just Sam coach you know share is why not just say All right Jerry there you go you're going to run the whole thing and then he would have press conferences where he'd be blaming himself\nHe'd be blink blaming the older and then he'd be blaming the ... when the owner comes in for the he'd have three different press conferences the owner comes in\nThen the GM comes in and then the coach comes in and it just Jerry in his words different outfits there a Web or we're going to have the coach a coach showed Jones going to come in here in a moment you know see\nDuring the world cup I forget which country it was but the uh the culture the manager of the team was they were like hey uh he basically said I have never been out coached\nThe guy the people who lose the game right on the patch and they're it's I've never been out coached runs in my career that those guys are the ones that lose the game the guys that are actually planning this might be the first time that you actually get that kind of if Jerry ... out there and he's the owner GM coach\nHere's some numbers though to keep in mind with the cowboys and ... got his pastor rating in his first season when he went Thirteen and three one oh four point nine\nIn the Twenty one game since then they've gone to Lebanon Chan his quarterback rating is eighty five point for\n... somewhere in between is he\nIf he has all the talent they're around him is he more like the first that or is this going to be status quo for the next couple of years and he's going to be more like the second step there\nThat's that's gonna be a really interesting decision with jak Prescott and nobody would you would have ... to him in and said hey they got their quarterback for the next ten years\nThey got him and I don't think you can say that now you know after what we've seen so far I really do I'd a seven seven ...

realistic plan um so I I'm so these past couple of years or this past year has hurt\n'em and I honestly don't think that uh you know with a lot of the pieces around that even back I don't think that he's the quarterback I just don't I don't think he's consistent up and\nUm I don't think uh Jason Garrett will be the coach next year but however I mean it's it really doesn't matter I mean because where else comes in I mean we're not going to get out of line coach I mean we're already I think those days are already done you know somebody you know our coach ourselves and then we're all Jimmy Johnson\nWell any thank you Frank anybody who comes in wants to have autonomy and you're not going to get that unless Jerry Jones\nJerry I you know if he doesn't realize now he's not going to realize that that he's the one in beating the process here\nUm you know you could say the jury the GM hurts them or Jerry the owner herds them but in some form you know one of the other is hurting this process here and chasing Garrett\nI feels like he's a place holder here but he's been a police older there you go Thirteen and three and the expectation levels really high now all of a sudden they came back to earth and maybe this is where they are right now there are an average football to\nThey'd been an average football team since that Thirteen and three seasons now the question is what is your future is changing your future is jak Prescott your future can you get a number one wide receiver do trade do sign a free agent can you draft\nWhat is it you know they they do have some stars on defense I think that's what's lost in a lot of businesses they do have the impact players on defense\nIt's just they're lacking in ... impact players on office\nNow Yemen replace Jason with which

has been reluctant at times to deal butler hoping to force his way back onto the team [noise] um\nWe've heard that quaint Taylor wants to get a deal done and so this whole kind of messy situation came

good question um the NBA players league or and and so\nI think ultimately the players\nHave the letter in the situation if she butler wants to try to pull a ... a claim that his surgically repaired risk to the bothering and he can sit out a potentially is to get paid wall to wall tried to work out a deal for him I Do think that that he has the leverage I I don't think the walls have\nA ton of leverage in trade talks with other teams that looked like they were making some progress on that front what Miami last week\nOr so we'll see if those talks were ... they were called off or over the weekend but Miami's trying to get back and kept those started again so we'll see what happens here um but I I Do think that ultimately if Jimmy Butler doesn't want to be here he will not be
