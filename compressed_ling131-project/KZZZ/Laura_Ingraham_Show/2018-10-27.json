out the roster so the alarmist are out there hey we can get some clinics time to panic Lakers question\nI don't know what the spin is today but um once again give me a around Christmas Time get a better feel this roster you know or is it time to panic when Oklahoma City\nThey blew lead last night national TV here they are their own for the call up a sixteen point halftime lead they lost to the Celtics were start since the franchise moved to Oklahoma City in two thousand eight\nI'm\nI'm sure that everybody's going to be fine with this Russell Westbrook junior the third said we'll be All right no need to panic obviously not starting the way we wanted to but we'll be okay I Will make sure that\nOK apple\nBy the way the Lakers are at San Antonio at Minnesota ... home against al three winnable games\nYeah fair you know\nWhat three at all just for that compared to what happened to we can afford anything yeah\nWell no then the spin will be a legitimate title contenders question\nSo it's either one or the other\nBecause this is when you're when you're flipping through the dial whether you're listening on radio show or you're going to watch TV this is what you're going to get today spin is or the Lakers legitimate titled contenders\nYou know you know maybe two more wins you know that that's how this works here just to let you guys behind the curtain because it was a panic\nOh my God I'm going to listen to what they're saying it's all disingenuous\nThere's nobody who said all the time to panic after three games and there's nobody nobody who's going to go now because they beat Denver or they're legitimate titled\nContenders yes but isn't that ultimately what you want to know\nIf they're panicking or their ... but I but you don't you can't know now\nRight right\nBut but ... they're going to tease you with this bed you know Hey Ryan fitzpatrick was league MVP a month ago\nYou know I Know he's not even playing it's just it's in the moment and how to capitalize on that there can't be any you can't teach something by saying hey a known no need to panic for the Lakers you're probably not going to read the column or tune into that show but if I say I'm to panic question mark oh\nThen you get all the people who don't like LeBron and want there to fail\nThat they're doing well the people who liked liberal on you know they want to hear all the nice things here and so that sort of how this works a Minnesota\nAre they going to send Jimmy Butler to Houston for for for drone picked I thought that butler would end up in Houston I said that from the outset when we didn't even know if he was going to report to Minnesota I thought that that they were number one on the list and met a guy down fell apart and now there's a chance you know I think PG ...\nDied down fell apart and now there's a chance you know I think PG Tucker was what was holding it up they didn't want to give up PJ Tucker so now it's for first drone picks and if I'm Houston do it you got to win now\nNo you're not you're not waiting to see what happens with the Golden State because Lakers are going to you know they're gonna add another player so Houston's moment is now Houston's moment may have been last season that's how quickly it closes and if you get Jimmy bother you give up for first round pick so what we're gonna be picks in the late twenties right no big deal\nIf I'm Minnesota\nDo I really want to do that do I really want to get rid of butler\nCan I keep butler do we have a chance to have a special season here that's what you're gonna have to ask and\nIf I'm Minnesota it sounds like that owner Glenn Taylor is willing to part what you mean butler at least he was the bundled up to a good start but you know for for ... wouldn't scare me if I'm used to you know ...\nIf you ran that Tim rules the gym in the world do you take that trade no ...

a restaurant with my wife and kids and to date with over ... sitting the woman who's running for state representative and my state of Indiana\nOh wow accountable if we knew each other over there like she saw that Trump at I saw her stickers later she was with my wife suggested hey why don't you go ask her if you can take a picture with her and um put it on Facebook and show everybody that we can get along I thought about it and I went over there and I and I asked her if she said as soon as I saw you I was thinking the same thing\nAnd we actually had a conversation for about Fifteen minutes\nAnd we actually had a conversation for about Fifteen minutes it kinda ended with me telling her that I think she's a wonderful person I Wish she was a little Democrat\nBut because of what they did the cabin all I just can't vote for it she said was that she thought that was lucky to have a supporter like me and we both came to the conclusion that this has a style we got a quick ripping each other's throats out we were still ... al ... just because we disagreed on and we have to hate each other all out\nAnd I wish that people could start talking to each other instead of looking at each other as saying that the Democrat I hate the word that is a Republican I hate them I Can't take it anymore it's driving me crazy and I just wanted to share that because I\nWell I I and I also believe and I appreciate your sharing that because frankly I you're you're reflecting the way I think millions and millions of people feel uh it's it's getting out of hand and it's got it's got to

guy was cussing image in his face and you take that had often how dare you wear that had in this place\nAnd the guy said I'm not taking the hat off so the big bulky dumb old for the human being knocked the hat off this guy\nJust knocked it right off his head his crime was wearing a red baseball cap the fish that this jerk didn't agree with you know something this is ... you want to talk
