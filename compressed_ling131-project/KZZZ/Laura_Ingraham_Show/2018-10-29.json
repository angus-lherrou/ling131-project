Wahlberg\nIndeed and any time because we've\nOnly got out for this next short segment we're going to go right to him out I'm Sorry we got cut off by that break I wasn't watching the clock so I Do apologize for having to do that let's go back to that poll that's very very important right now go ahead and repeat what you were saying about the latest poll\nOn poll came out showing that an all time low America as one of the ban so called salt rifles\nAnd that's after of course we've had a year of unbelievable attacks on assault rifles so the snake ever since the shooting in Florida and the school uh despite all that all the billions and billions of dollars that anti gun groups spent\nA demonizing those particular firearms along with a you know all the media that that is the free media that ... that's been attacking them of the cold to come out with a like a giant jumping our favorite shows the American people are starting to get it\nThere is a U.S news and World Report\nOut on the twenty six article us gun control groups outspending pro gun forces on election let me give some numbers you and I know you know these numbers Alan but I really wanted to comment on this\nA lot of people will hear this and be very very concerned us gun control advocates of outspent by more than forty percent gun rights groups on next month's congressional elections\nReversing the are a long standing dominance in spending on gun politics boosted largely by the personal fortune of billionaire Michael Bloomberg is who this was referring to of course\nThe dumber he was benefiting entirely Democrats according to this ... gun control groups including Giffords in every town for gun safety of spent twenty point two million on the elections well over the fourteen point once spent on pro gun by pro gun group led by the n._r._a. that's according\nFriday this past friday I went to the federal elections commission now Peter ... executive director of Giffords' says there's definitely a shift it was just a few years ago when people considered ... gun safety\nTo be one of politics is third rail now the opposite is true of course gun safety is mess\nFor gun control these people are so dishonest intellectually they can't even tell the truth about what they do less people find out and decided hey I don't want that asked that poll Mr ... leave just told us about reveal Allen\nShould we be concerned about these numbers\n[noise] yeah we definitely need to be concerned about these numbers are numbers mean number of dollars that the uh opponents of gun rights are spending because it's going to impact ballot measures candidates for public office\nAnd you know overall it it has impact public opinion as well when you have more anti commercials running on TV or in at an ad sorry then you'd have program was running for the first time in history over time that there is taken advertising told\nA so the bottom line is is that you know we need to worry about that and it's very hard not to have to wait for us to compete with it because they're getting money from several billionaires a year where they write a hundred thousand dollars for a thousand dollars a million dollar checks and I just don't have anybody like that and I needed to be in our area really I mean this is Colleen\nHere to be the billionaire that helps I'm working on that I'll let you know how I may go take a listen this this statement from the un already spokesperson Jennifer Baker concerned me a little bit\nWhile the gun lobby control is funded by a blank check from uh New York city anti gun billionaire the n._r._a. relies on millions of small donations from working men and women his money is no match for our grassroots organization and the\nThe the lead up to that wasn't NRA spokeswoman said Bloomberg's money would not overturned public support for the second amendment of the U.S constitution which protects the right to keep and bear arms Alan I'm I'm not so sure about that statement\nBecause when you have people you just said coming up behind me younger generation seeing nothing but anti gun crap all day long it begins in the media knows it's why they do it why Bloomberg's knowing it begins to drive that narrative that guns are bad doesn't it\nYeah and I don't really agree with that statement at all that's why we're seeing here like in Washington state on the addition of sixteen thirty nine and I get an issue on the ballot here\nAre grassroots you know you know working with the n._r._a. and set of skills right keep and bear arms has pretty cold for a while when we pulled up and all of us can even with polling data\nOn descent I get an issue if only to find this week three billionaires one day Michael Bloomberg dumped in six hundred thousand dollars for last minute media by ... to help quote unquote put them over the top\nAnd I don't have sex with thousand dollars but in the media bias compete with it\nSo all we do have the grass roots and we can't tell you have more grassroots side that is those advertising dollars Seventy sixty second TV and radio spots have an impact is particularly on need it the more uninformed voter or the casual voter out here and that's ... that's a concern so this does have an impact I Can't agree with you on that\nI Wish we had the money to compete and I feel a whole lot said about winning I I'm hoping I graduated is can be strong enough to win on that particular ballot measure but if we dealt with it is approved is putting its dollars at both the election\nWhat concerns me about that I agree with you on that statement I'm not real I wasn't that statement concern me someone else I mentioned but here's really why because I didn't I don't want it to create complacency I think the statement like that can create some apathy on our side with what we've got the grassroots look what the interests that they're not really worried about it my five boxes enough\nOr well I I just I'll just renew my membership next year and not worry about it I that's what concerns me about that and I know the honor he wants to keep that happy face on we all do but there comes a time when you got to say look guys\nOkay these people are out spend enough now three to one and we need to get off our duff we've got to get active yes we have grass roots but we need assistance here let's go now to sixteen thirty nine you covered enough of it but I just want to ask you one question as we're coming up to this ballot initiative\nThat six hundred thousand I'm just going to say this from what I just heard you say you felt better last week than you did this week is that first statement\nOh yeah I had the money to compete with that certainly thousand dollars I I I feel as good as they did last week I don't feel it with that last minute money coming in from three big donors Bloomberg being one of those\nAnd you know one of the policy have is we want to put a good spin on everything but you sometimes you can't believe your own rhetoric ah and sometimes that it it's better to let people know who they are in the battle you know I always say that our ... election away from extinction and it's really true\nThat it absolutely is true and it's true every single election cycle it every single election cycle All right let me move to another topic with your quick we've got just a couple of minutes and say F. joins California group suing riverside county sheriff overseas you W policies\nThis is not the first rodeo with the second amendment foundation supporting the rights of a legal American rather than tell us about this one real quick\nListen to the sheriff has decided 'cause California against this may issue says chairs get discretion and what they want to do you say that if you're a legal you know resident who holds a gun you know in in Sacramento a lo and behold you you you can't you know in reverse I can actually say you you can't get a permit to carry it for self protection\nOr we once it's like this all across the country will win this suit as well and the sheriff or he pretends to be a pro gun but he he hardly get permits out in this county and uh he's he's in the right to free elections battle right now\nSo let's go probably happen that you eat good chance to lose the election and the new sheriff comedian will move to suit for us and we'll win or start issuing these permits or we'll go to ... will tell you finish the court battle and loves that the court overturned it\nSheriff family Smith of Smith is actually pro gun he's pro his gun he's just not pro\nYour gun

R. G. Love to read your emails All right let's go back to a W. R. Hawkins AWOL Hawkins\n[noise] I I got to go back to Chris Murphy for just a second okay\nBecause here's what Trump said and you pointed in there you pointed out in your ... if they have protection inside the result would have been far better this is a dispute there will always exist I suspect\nBut if they had protection inside the synagogue maybe it could have been a very different situation okay what's what's wrong with that what did Chris Murphy take exception to win that statement come again keeping in mind listener that he is a man that is protected by guns everywhere he goes in DC what what's up\nWith what he said it she goes Trump's position is\nYou know uh\nTo counter dangerous people with on creek or at least that are opposite she used to just be sure dangerous people never get done well\nThat's fair sale because that's a fairy tale\nHe goes on to say Trump's position works in the movies opposition to real life that's all I\nSee well maybe we'll get in real life wouldn't it\nIs in real life it would work Sunday right because this guy has numerous background checks chips past one is you know just conceal carry permit a and so we get a guy who's been ... been vetted\nAnd it's to your point that you were actually making when you start your show a background check let's backward if there's no criminal history than a person who plans to most evil date in the world to log into a gun stores small I'm by no problem\nBecause there's no criminal history to be found in the background check\nAnd uh so Murphy doesn't understand his background checks don't work at ... they work in the movies gun free zones don't work in real life\nThey work in the movies having a large congregation of elderly congregants who are defenseless setting together on a Saturday morning that doesn't work in real life that works in the movies you've got to have someone there with a gun who can take out a bad guy to come to you Chris Murphy is a lunatic\nMove Chris Murphy is also a liar he knows better he's also a hypocrite because he is protected by guns with the capital he understands that he knows that he's just intellectually dishonest and the rest of the socialist party is in today's day and age who speaks particularly on this topic\nSocialist party is in today's day and age who speaks particularly on this topic\nFor they know not what they say now interestingly and I don't I'm not trying to catch off guard has has nothing to do with what you wrote a over the past week or today by any stretch but I heard the nine one one calls coming in right where I heard the police chatter\nThe radio chatter when one of the officers were responding saying there's automatic weapons fire\nAnd that went out over the call you know to the rest of the officers ten thirty eight automatic weapons fire a was their automatic weapons fire there am I missing something\nNot unless you're going to hit a yeah they are Fifteen and then what I understand they are Fifteen a couple of blocks eaten at three o'clock so I'm not sure but yeah you're dealing with small might have found out about 'em though this happens all the time in ... and what that officer\nProbably wasn't on purpose but with the gun control the Louis you know Hillary Clinton when she finds it you'll remember Hillary Clinton used to say that one of the reasons\nYou need a vote her will stop people from coming schools with automatic weapons fire at my mind out of my mind I don't want to make an relatives that had\nNever happened so\nYou know but the they want to use just just like Murphy talking about semi automatic rifles they want to use the phrase olive tree to sound ominous scared of the few people who they can scare with their language and uh you know again\nI Am not trying to say that police officer did that but uh it's just where we are society you know people used the wrong terminology\nYeah and I guess we're all guilty of it from time to time you know I had the interview with the dopey McGuire over there and I can't get home and do the guy you know he's entitled to his opinion and we have fought on the radio we go back and forth and we don't like each other and that's what makes it fun so\nBut you know I I catch myself to you know it's impossible not going to sit here and try to correct the guy on the phrase out your the terminology when I've got four minutes on a radio interview because then it turns into a Piers Morgan deal\nAnd it just disintegration I Want people to hear what we're trying to say and what you know I Know somebody out there right now is screaming at me AWOL if it's not an assault rifle make sure you call it that and we do we attempt to do that all the time sometimes there are even bigger points that we have to get out without turning the argument away which is what sometimes that would do\nAll right you know what's let's move on from Chris Murphy he's just to sell it in a lunatic\nAnd he's a hypocrite and he's also very he's very dishonest man is what he is\nBut we already talked about you have another piece law enforcement synagogue attacker legally owned his guns I think this is important for one reason\nBecause doesn't that go that headline alone says it all I W are that's what goes to the heart of why we have a right to defend ourselves because we understand the evil exists evil chooses the time and place could become evil\nNot us but and we have a right to defend ourselves from it because we are powerless to even identify it aren't we\n[laughter] true true you know there's there's something I'm trying to call upon the turn as hard as I think what I write\nI I Know what I Do I write news but also on in my heart to educate people\nAnd I and there was a corner I'm trying to turn where I can somehow get people to think about the fact that there is no substitute for freedom and I'm not trying to be ... uh it's very simple gun control is not a viable substitute for freedom and if you think it is that he didn't pay attention Saturday or you didn't pay attention to Parkland\nOr you didn't pay attention to Santa Fe high school a cake twenty Eighteen or you didn't pay attention at the church in Texas November fifth twenty Seventeen I keep going but a gun control is not\nA valid substitute for freedom the cause gun control pre suppose is that if we limit everybody's freedoms\nAnd certain crimes will go away it does not work that way what happens is we limit my ability to exercise my God given rights you put me in an unnatural position\nOr had I've been a member of that congregation on Saturday I Would have come under fire and the senseless and somehow we have to realize that\nLesson that we can't do it every time we embrace gun control where we need to or not we're saying this sucker substitute for freedom folks there is no good substitute for freedom there is not one that works\nAnd that's why a framer went out of their way to hit you in second ...\nI Am eight six six sixty and a number of others throughout the state right now on my monitor in this cross ... Capitol Hill one American news network I paused it Senator Bill Nelson on gun control calls for universal background checks on gun sales Bill Nelson is in the\nNow you take that right to the bank why can I make that statement because the individual in Pittsburgh as we have pointed out for you for the last half hour now heading into forty minutes\nPast his background checks so ask yourself this question Florida what the hell is Bill Nelson talking about and if you get a chance to ask him yourself and ask him what\nTo ask him to tell you\nYour cell and ask him what to ask him to tell you what gun control will work he kept they'll do what Kevin McGuire did in Great Britain he will pack up his toys and leave the sand box because he can't play with the adult\nHey W are sorry I had to go off on that when I saw that and I passed it on my monitor it let me get that off my monitor so I don't go into angry mark well All right\nWe also now this doesn't surprise me either California Democrats will use and New York Democrats will use anything they\nCan a W. R. Hawkins won't pay to push more gun control in\nTheir state isn't that true\nRight that's true how many California Democrats running for office right now are using the Pittsburgh shooting push more gun control and if I'm In California listening to this show here's what you got to think about these people are running for office they're not in office\nIf he'll campaign like this for gun control what do you think they're going to do once they're you know you don't need that you're that California is already in the time it's already over the edge of gun control it's ridiculous and if if there's somebody who thinks one more gun laws gonna matter\nI mean they're a they're not bright or be there an audio law which means there is the fact that like just having the gender and I think by and large that's ... that's the case for gun control\nWhat you know you you asked if you actually you pointed out in a statement and I ask a question and that is in your piece about Democrat Bill Nelson on this very topic I felt that was interesting when I saw that headline and I saw him on the television I just decided to snap on it for a moment\nBut here's what you point out in your opening statement your your piece is titled Democrat Bill Nelson wants to implement gun controls already in place California as a W are just pointed out you can't\nDo any more ... you just can't you just simply can't\nBill Nelson wants to implement gun control already in place that's the key and here's what I W are says to open up the open up the column\nBill Nelson Democrats course in Florida wants to implement gun controls that are all ready in place and are almost always the means by which mass public attackers get their guns what do you mean by that\n[noise] now I mean if you go back to go back far as ruled that say go back to Columbine a or a if you want to stay in the twenty first century just stay in the twenty first century I Can't think\nOf a high profile public attack where the attacker Carter's guns in some way other than background checks\nLiterally the the two exceptions the two exceptions are the ah mall she mall shooting in Washington state and Newtown and there except just because of those cases the individual Stoller which\nHad murdered outside wanted to take a take hold of them too I wanted to make that very clear but out of there [noise] people\nWho people who shoot up places they go pass background checks get there and so these these these checks their worthless the only thing they accomplish is what the Democrats\nAnd that is they make the process of buying a gun just a little more bird some and it does cause some law abiding citizens just not to bother because they don't want to go through the house that's what the Democrats really want they want to slow down to\nBuying firearms they don't want them in anyone's hands when they say they're just to get criminals owning them they're not telling the truth they don't want anyone to have a gun\nYou better than you better believe that you better believe that they also point a lot of anger at hunters\nAnd hunters who face death threats for shooting animals legally on hunch will go there to cover it all back right after that when they do if you are on the right market\n[noise]\nMm\nHi aren't good American radio like if you were looking for a lack of sleep all dumped went to check out the gays or pulling

concealed handgun up so that the killers don't know who it is it might be able to go and stop\nThe guy today said that they could not afford year round security that it was just too fast\nThey can only have it at high holiday well oh I Want people to carry permit he'll have that's one way an inexpensive way to go and solve that problem\nPeople need to understand the dangers of these gun free zones these gun free zones make it attractive for people to be the killer to attack and it makes it easier for them to go and kill people\nJohn straight up common sense to me and I've known you a long time and I can hear the frustration in your voice when you were taping that am I right were you you sounded frustrated and you sounded kind of angry am I right\nI mean I I Want to try to do something to stop these attacks\nAnd I don't know how anybody can look at how these killings keep on time after time picking targets were victims aren't able to defend themselves\nYou know just a couple of days ago last week it was a mass public shooting or what could have been a mass public shooting at a Kroger grocery store you can talk\nAnd everybody from meet the press to Jake Tapper on CNN brought that up today a but what they failed to know in any of those discussions is that it ended because a concealed carry permit holders stop the attack are there\nAnd so you know these guys are they ... they use the quotes on the shows about\nYou know don't shoot me I'm a white guy white guys don't shoot white guys but they don't put the don't shoot me part there they they don't put obviously the killer who was out there killing Black Sea was stopped by a white concealed carry permit holder\nOr when he saw the permit holders was pointing his gun at him and ordering them to stop he uh he made those comments but his first comments were you know don't shoot me and and you know I I guess you it is amazing fires\nThat these guys could bring up this case today multiple times and no one wouldn't mention that it ended because there was a permanent holder you know at the same time they're attacking Trump on these shows for somehow believing that letting somebody\nOn these shows for somehow believing weddings somebody handled how many concealed handgun into synagogue I couldn't say why [noise]\nAnd you know I still have realized that they brought it up and contacts so it'd be hard for them to go and criticized Trump at the same time during these shows\nI guess the other hand for just for him in New York Times or from today or earlier and they talk about from scratch about gun control laws as an assertion [noise]\nOkay they use the word assertion they don't do that for the Democrats were talking about the need for gun control laws will say more\nAnd you know these guys have such blinders are with regards to you know as you say it's common sense I mean I was chief columnist for the United states sentencing commission on my way through thousands trial transcript [noise]\nAnd I have to tell you one can lead to all those criminal cases and come away with a view these criminals\nEasy targets\nYou know they may be cookie or um or whatever but they're not so stupid that they do try to take an easier time it's the same thing is true with these mass public sure\nThey made me crazy in some sense what they're not stupid they want to try to kill us like people are so they want to go to a a venue where they know victims aren't going to be able to defend themselves because they know the longer it takes\nFor somebody I seem to live with a gun no more people they're going to be able to kill\nSo yeah I guess I Am frustrated but I'm frustrated because on one side they seem to think that they have all the moral authority that they are they called for laws either had no beneficial effect or actually cause harm\nYou know these kind of a freeze on wanting samples and yet when ah when these attacks occur they want to pass on people who are willing to do something on line responses yeah you're willing to do something but it was something that actually looks like something\nThat actually matters it wouldn't make people said you know\nThere's so much media and what you just said I could take the rest of the power went out and quickly I'll go to a point out the media when you were talking about the media\nThey won't because it doesn't fit their narrative that's why they leave out that portion of course you know this was from talking to you what you were John Say about the ... and we're going to be talking about that on our marriage and radios daily defects tomorrow in fact you know probably on Tuesday as well but as John Locke pointed out on his Twitter page you can follow him\nAt John are locked junior on Twitter by the way to get all this information real time and she puts out it's just great great Twitter page\nWhat he points out stuff when I was doing the same thing she I mean you you women dating the fact that a white concealed carry permit holders ended the attack and he goes on to tell you when the tweets and it was a column and you went through with it and then he wrote about how the headline could be totally different\nHow it could be white concealed carry permit holders stages wax function I mean at the the media narrative your listener is what drives as we talked about this together for so many years and then just very dangerous the way the game that they are playing and the way the media handles this for a lot of different reasons when we come back I\nThat sees this guy telling me the guns aren't the answer is surrounded by armed guards I you know I\nI don't know I I put it right up there with Leonardo DiCaprio flying on a jet telling me that I've I've got a problem with my carbon footprint I mean the whole thing to me is just absolutely laughable and sickening All right let's go back to if we could some of the homicide numbers and statistics I find this fascinating\nBecause we see lots of different numbers people spend them out all the time oh the u._s. ranks number one you guys have the worst mass shooting right in the world the homicide rate in America's if more people die by gun violence in America than anywhere else in the world you lead the world and it's disgusting you just need to repeal the second amendment and get over that was for months gets\nBut that's not true and I've seen everywhere from us ranks anywhere from first to Ninety second when it comes to this where do the numbers actually fall\nRight well I mean I have a very long discussion about this in my book the war and guns are basically give you a rough idea about this stuff\nLook um when you look at the data for all countries around the world or the United states in terms of homicides ranks below the average and it ranks below what we'd say is the media which is kind of the halfway point half the countries are above and below\nIt we like rank even low or if we knew the truth data some of the worst countries don't report a homicide rate data and even some many of the ones that do report it why you know it's not just Chicago and Philadelphia which ... hits\nSo I just Chicago and Philadelphia which had histories of of tampering with a murder data you know there are many countries around the world Venezuela others that we could name a which have you know taking it to even much greater extremes\nAnd um and the other thing is uh most people think that homicides and murders of the same or not a most countries don't or almost no other countries outside the United states and a couple of the places report murder rate\nA big difference between murder or homicide is that homicide include justifiable homicides United States has relatively more justifiable homicides than most countries\nBut it seems to me you shouldn't be including though there's a big difference between\nSomebody killing a victim and let's say a civilian who is trying to stop this up for being raped or a police officer who is trying to stop the cry\nFrom occurring or uses their gun to go and kill a criminal those are two different cases and I'm not sure I really want to like the two together but putting that aside\nMost of the comparisons that people may around the world in both firearm homicides and appeal that firearm homicides way higher or much well well above the media were pretty close to the average\nUm but there's a reason for that and that is not is that in that is\n... about half the countries in the world don't report firearm homicide data they just report total homicide did\nSo the reason why we look so bad when it comes to firearm homicides has just you've removed all the top countries from the rains there that's one reason why gun control advocates like to always put the discussion in terms of firearm homicide rates across country and uh [noise]\nUm so are you know it's\nYou know there are other issues I can go into but ah you\nKnow that's a good that's a good place to stop because the clock is ticking down on us on this break here we've got one more segment but it's interesting to me too because I Want to ask you about something else when we come back and then we always hear the term\nOut of developed nations ... of all the developed nations in the world and I get to thinking well what about Brazil developed nation is Mexico developed nation wire\nThat actually in those races to me what about all those that don't their lives matter why don't those statistics count a country as a country as a country and those numbers are numbers are number so I Want to ask you about that when we come back to and then I just\nKind of want to get some predictions from you if we can in the last remaining segment less humid if that we have back with John Locke right after this don't go away\nImagine you're walking through a parking lot at dusk your with your children as you approach your car you see a large ma'am closing in something seems wrong something is
