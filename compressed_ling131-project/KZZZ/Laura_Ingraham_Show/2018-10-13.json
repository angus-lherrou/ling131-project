Thirteen and it wasn't even that close nationally championship series game on tonight\nDodgers and the brewers we spend a lot of time in the first hour dissecting the giants and also the eagles a little bit because\nI thought that that's what that was sort of lost in all of this that the giants aren't a good team\nI don't know how good the eagles are but I don't know how good you have to be to win that division and maybe nine wins wins that division the eagles aren't healthy I still think that they got to bring in another running back to that they can count on they have some guys that you know they have three different running backs to sort of do different things there\nBut you got to bring in ... you know at least an every down back or he's going to be able to be in there for two of those three downs so uh\nThe eagles pick up the wind and that's what you want to do you just want to get out survive those Thursday night games and uh\nYou know the rest of that division got Dallas with a tough game against Jacksonville coming up this week a couple of other things that are still doubt we talked about this with the economy Gregor fight with Habib what somebody going to\nThey were going to be suspended they both been temporarily suspended which doesn't mean anything and it doesn't mean anything could be doesn't get to put on his belt um they're holding the money back I Believe with both fighters here but let's say you suspend them for six months\nThey're not going to be fighting for six months\nAnd I don't know why Conor McGregor is suspended um unless you know he didn't get out of the ring but I I can ... you know be is a likely receiving a sanction for starting the posed by brawl um but I don't know why McGregor is in trouble here\nIf you were going to suspend him or find them you would have done it for all the antics prior to the fight and here's another thing\nI was with a Adam Corolla on his a hog cash yesterday a big fan of ... and I was talking to him about this fight would encounter McGregor do to deserve a rematch\nHe he didn't distinguish himself he wasn't it wasn't close it wasn't one of those you know like tripled G and Alvarez it you know wasn't controversial\nAnd I'm thinking you know why not have somebody who deserves the opportunity\nOr is it just to show and it goes back to Dana White it's just a show you're just making money and your Vince McMahon it's all this is now granted they are hitting people hurting people but you're just doing the show you\nCan't sit there and we got integrity here and we got morals and we got standard that's why I find is really funny but we're not going to come and we're not putting up build on you\nWere going to hold back your money I thought to be was going to be find two million dollars and I was told that that's probably what it's going to be but I have a rematch year\nMcGregor didn't do anything to deserve a rematch here other than just this is a money grab for Dana White then company that's all that is but uh those guys are going to be suspended I guess I don't know how long they're suspended and I don't think it really matters but I thought it was it that I got it amusing that they were going to be suspended\nI a Sunday night it's the chiefs and the patriots and what's the over under on that\nOr it's huge it's like fifty nine okay\nSunday night time and a half fifty nine and a half by the way if you took the ... or you one last night by ... points unbelievable that Paul he said go under ... hold my breath all under yeah giants can't score and the red zone

guys played six games yeah\nA guy who was struggled even oh okay I'm not a big quarterback rating guy so if the if the if you factor that in Patrick moms hasn't played great the last couple of games here\nI I I like my track record with Tom Brady now that shiny new object is awesome and Patrick bombs but you know there's one thing and being a very good regular season quarterback Brady gives you that but he also gives you that postseason pedigree so I I Would say the odds are in my favor\nThat the patriots and Brady okay who goes farther this year patriots chiefs\nHow 'bout that\nSo you're saying is chief team it starts out five and a major down here that are out there that we need a down payment down this road before what if you had a bad off into line which of those two ... which one\nI Want the homes yeah he's very very slippery yeah extremely slippery yeah he's got some athleticism\nAnd if you have some you have more than Tom Brady do simple\nI kinda disagree on that one

S. C. and I think there's a very ... an interesting similarity between could be even Conor McGregor and that thrill in manila fight between Frasier and Ali\nLike the fact that I prepped for that fight Alief rally it was a game Riley was bringing people out he was calling Joe Frazier the gorilla he was making fun of the black and instead of his skin and for him it was just like if I make Frasier mad and a half I polarized people it's going to bring more eyeballs to the fight but for Joe Frazier it was not a joke\nFor Joe Frasier he was willing to die in manila because he was so deeply offended by Ali\nAnd I could make that about Connor and could lead and be like for Conor it's a joke it's eyeballs he's going to make fun of could be religion he's going to make fun of his family is going to make fun of his country and for it could be but then it becomes life and death\nHow would only be treated now in his in his prime [noise]\nI mean it it's interesting because I Would have social media so in some respects Hollywood social media before social media and that he was able to get out his message despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of the media in the mid Nineteen sixties was against the kind of things he was saying and what he was standing for\nBut I think that if I was around today he'd be able to leverage social media to a degree that no athlete could even\nCompare like it it wouldn't even because LeBron James would be taking lessons from Ahmed Ali in terms of how to leverage social media and get his message out and I think that would be different and that would create I'm an army of followers in a way that the media would have to respond to and not be so overwhelmingly negative\nTowards in which they were in the Nineteen sixty you have to wait till the Nineteen seventies before a new generation of writers or like hey this guy is not only good copy he had something to say and maybe he was right about Vietnam and the rest of the country was moving in that direction to say it was a mistake and maybe we should pay him respect for the courage that he displayed a during those difficult times but why is that\nSome of the most seminal moment in our history have to do with African Americans would Jesse Owens Nineteen thirty six you got Jackie Robinson what Mohammed Ali is doing I don't know how history is going to look at ...\nI I don't like the comparisons to Ali ... um I think it's different with Ali uh but we're trying to lump him in there and and I know he's been treated as a hero in in some sections but how do you think history looks back because history has been very kind Ali\nYes but it took a long time or how well how would we look at polling capita can Twenty years\nI'll say similarly history has been very kind to John Carlos and Tommie Smith are and we're about to hit the fiftieth anniversary of Mexico City in Nineteen sixty eight\nAnd explain that to those Sports Illustrated had a wonderful ... a ... minute look back on the fifty years and you know who these two athletes were Nineteen sixty eight Olympic should Mexico should\nYeah it was John Carlos and Tommie Smith and Peter Norman silver medalists Australia yeah who didn't solidarity with them\nOr they they were athletes who in the lead up to the Olympics were talking about a boycott as a protest against racism in a protest or human rights\nThey were talking about a boycott of the Nineteen sixty eight Olympic just not going and the boycott fell through that they decided that they still needed to make some kind of statements so after the two hundred meter race a John Carlos and Tommie Smith rate their fist on the medal stand and Peter Norman or a button that said Olympic project for human rights I'm inside\nIf I gave you a chance to interview any athlete history just one\nA particular time I mean this is gonna sound very basic but I ... I'll I'll go with to them so I'm not so basic because the basic answer would be Mohammed Ali ...\nI'll I'll go to that so I'm not so basic 'cause the basic answer would be Mohammed Ali in Nineteen sixty eight when he was banned from boxing when he's doing a series of lectures on the college circuit\nAnd I would love just to speak to them about how he was feeling a being that alone but also immersed in the world and then the other person I'd like to talk to is Paul robes and in the Nineteen twenties\nOr when he was an absolute football star and started her\nFirst black star in the NFL or the first black player in the NFL\nYeah no the the it's it's interesting because the NFL um it had players like Paul robes and and uh Charles full listen and Fritz Pollard yeah the great Fritz Pollard in the Nineteen twenties\nAnd it was an integrated league and it doesn't segregate until like Nineteen thirty three at the behest of George pressed in Marshall ah the owner of the Washington football team and the last team to integrate in the NFL and then it it integrates again on Nineteen forty six Nineteen forty seven with players like woody strode and Kenny Washington\nUm and uh the great Marian motley and bill will is with Paul Brown in Cleveland and so there's this uh\nBy the way I'm teaching my students that stuff in their eyes just like they loved it I'm Sorry I just I Love that stuff so I think\nThey love this stuff to 'em but Paul robes and what was such a star and he um helped integrate the team at Rutgers and he was a terrific player and he was abused by his own teammates until he proved himself physically is that the modern Rogers was good I out of re rights I mean\nWe got out of a [laughter] couple shot at Rutgers is that the New Jersey get enough lack I Swear [laughter] you got Springsteen and Bon Jovi what more do you want yeah that that that that's not what you guys have ... [laughter] yeah [laughter] um yeah so so I I Would talk to pot roast and what about you is and who would you interview any athlete in history\nI think a Babe Ruth\nAllow to understand the magnitude of because it was word of mouth that it was a he was he was this larger than life figure [noise]\nUm did he know it or how big a celebrity was he was he like off the field that his teammates like him I'm just you know told background where\nAre you know a where he came from was in ... you know he was an orphan like ... there was a lot that went into who he was what he was all about but to be that great in that time when you're reading newspapers and the power of reading about\nThis mythological figure like Babe Ruth I thought Babe Ruth was six for you know two thirty\nYeah I I Believe rich are really a of a giants was the same size as Babe Ruth so five eleven to Fifteen was went wow was\nWow but but you know you think could be he's got like Jack Nicklaus first time I met jak I went\nOh my God it's like five ten yeah because you know you grow up listening or reading and then you see and then I thought oh my God he's got to be a huge and then you realize he wasn't so baby you know sort of the same way I'd love to know just that impact in and how big of a celebrity he really was\n... the great book is just came out by Jane Leavy yeah like ... yeah yeah gotta be high started it if it's terrific as she wrote the great Mickey Mantle a biography as well um\nI wrote a ... to ... they All right well the great chain leaving and well done at the babe Ruth\nWhen it's fascinating 'cause then you also look at people like rambling right and how they created that myth and that that generation of sports writers and what it was about route that was so charismatic to them\nWhat you were able to do it and you know to gain access you had to be nice like where the writers were your friends and they weren't that you know there wasn't mean vague couldn't survive now now that social ...

the first time ever saw Iraq complain about not running the route you never see them and you can anyone\n... like ... which owns the outcomes of style I mean you're close to the water you do on so it's just\nA ...\nWhat are you doing so it's just again guys and this of assignments not really sure ambition to short week they had a bad bad bad game\nWe knew the language bad last year you bring in Nate shoulder and they were still expecting our flowers to act like a professional tackle um ... you know nobody can be surprised that the line is bad or are you surprised at that age this man\nI was hoping for his new through [laughter] so I think\nI was hoping a lot less than an eagle eyes over the last hope them tremendously but he is you know God Bless his soul uh he's thirty seven it might be selected for serving as many hits as he started getting that but it's pretty it's pretty bad guys or read them like in\nGreece to drop started them in the ... freestyle drop a running backs or get in touch the bacterial twice\nOr just depends on who's the high value on it or if they're like pick and choose an intimate through it's it's tough I mean they're having a hard time but it's it's really tough\nSo we're six games in each ban how much worse kinda get\nIt's not going to get worse they just got to figure out ways to sue or improve little bits here now I don't expect them to have like the stellar season I'd start from the house if they want four or five grand daughter been impressed you know when you're when you have that much turnover on your too and it's just\nI I Know people think that you can patch it'll pass while holes and make it work but if you don't have the core dies it's just very tough for them I think you know if you think about the giants draft over the last few years the first floor for a second or third round pitch for about two thousand eleven on I don't think any of those ...\nSake one Barclay feels like a there's a Barry Sanders quality and and I mean mostly positive with that but it feels like there's one yard three yards you know five yards forty five yards then very used to do that\nI don't know how much that is sacred Barclays running style or the office of mine because we could go back to bury Sanders that Detroit line wasn't very good either\nUm do you see similarities between these two\nOh totally you know I'm Sorry go on and Barry Barry Tillman same year I came in and watch them play with you know and they're tuned to didn't really have a title and to to help protect them on the edges she took chips and the bad guys or good afternoon and all of a sudden\nA valid missed and it's like where do you like a swing and miss ... sixty I was down to feel safe cause basically doing the same thing and it's it's pretty amazing to watch um guys or if the funny thing is dies or trying to tackle any super low energy of jumps all of them and keep drawn into which I'm like you were always taught never the job but\nHe's doing it mentioned cuts and spin on a dime and shows the Russian and when he gets out in the open the failure to it's almost like he's gone\nHe's a lot of fun to watch and and I think that that is you know and validating taking him number two overall and uh you know I think they're they're always going to be second guessed depending on how well Darnell plays or Josh Rosen plays or John ... plays a moving forward and do you think he liked the quarter back next year\nI don't know it depends on how high they draft and others in the dress\nAnd that's really really it if they if they have like you know top five and one of those guys looks like a franchise guy ... built they report like me I have like a ... year old his contract so that that would be their only catch I don't think they're going to extend the past year you know uh but\nYou know I Would think the question is going to be or they're going to be like two or three ... we can patch up the line even more than make sure we're just dumb enough to go to the go get a quarterback and trade up and get a guy\nUm if they do it and make sure and they took the guy I'm assuming the kid out of the Oregon as big as the big picture that everybody's looking at but\nThere are a few guys out there that that I think but honestly guys that are like lighten it up you know um there are a couple of younger guys to lighten up you know and I want to to Alabama's harm to to a ... incredible but he won't be coming up this ... this year so it's going to be one of those things together see if the guy that they should have had\nFour or five guys more

you need to be aware of if you listen to be in some of these states that CNN lists you gotta pay close attention\nCNN is\nPredicting that the house is going to go to the Democrats that the Republicans are going to lose control of the house to the Democrats but Republicans are going to not only keep control of the Senate but gain a seat or two\nIn the U.S Senate here's what he said well here's what CNN the same or about where Democrats are they say poised to when\nThey say their forecast when a number of seats in the northeast Pennsylvania is expected to be a bonanza for Democrats to listen carefully if you listen to me in in the state of Pennsylvania\nCNN says the fifth sixth seventh and seventeenth districts are all for cash to flip to the Democrats my five percentage points or more not not not a lot\nSo they're but they're giving the flip the coin to the Democrats in Pennsylvania's fifth sixth seventh and seventeenth districts you listen to me in those areas please pay attention\nGo vote they say the Democrats also have a shot to pick up numerous house seats in the mid west\nIn Iowa Democrat ... and Amy Finkenauer is predicted to when I was first district Democrats are favored to win Kansas is second and third districts\nIn the south they said Democrats have a lot of opportunities there within two points a long time Republican incumbents in Texas is seventh and thirty second districts\nThey're slightly ahead or tied in Kentucky use sixth district and Florida is twenty seventh district and then she an end says in the west Democrats are in good shape\nI Love how don't you let how CNN crows about Democrats winning they're no bias over CNN in the west though they say Democrats are in good shape and California alone they are up even if just barely and attempt is three twenty fifth district thirty ninth district forty fifth and forty nights\nDemocrats probably won't won't win every single one of those but it is possible\nThere maybe some surprises two house races can break late the district pulling from them isn't always reliable and then they go on to the Senate map and they say unlike the house only thirty five of the one hundred Senate seats are up for election\nDemocrats have limited ground to pick up the net to they need for control chances are they will not well a CNN says\nThere could be some surprises on November ... yeah that's
