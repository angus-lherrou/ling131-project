OK but who had demoted Brooks Robinson of the most of the gloves\nSo Greg Maddox was Nineteen Brooks Robinson according to start with sixteen oh okay I'm not sure ... long enough to yeah we have a shorter than most\nGold goes by position and Brooks Robinson of the position players has okay I can picture of what's a picture of old growth that's ridiculous that anyway well when you can feel your\nPosition me Maddox encourage you to hit the ball\nSo to manage it and they you know back then they use to bond\nBut Maddox was really good at ... he wanted you to put the ball and play therefore he was always ready to field\nA Johnny Bench or had tangled gloves I think he's the greatest defensive catcher of all time but maybe on a little biased and know Johnny send us a tweet saying this is how he displays his she's got a symbol gloves in his home town of being or Oklahoma and a Johnny Bench joining us now by Johnny how are you today\nThat's what I find that I'm ... I'm In the Senate or something serious or you know sort of a thing of the server that it ... football and bring your Oklahoma but I was thinking about quarterbacks that are ... it's one that's over and over ... ...\nAnd I think complete ... when they first down and then why and I worked for ...\nOh okay All right I got at Massey than their message out as you say you're a ...\n[noise] a lot more than that I'm going to have a thing up and you're pro protests there I mean there was a ...\nUh I don't have the Academy Awards I Do have some a broadcasting awards but those are down in the\nBasement 'cause the and the well the sports enemy so I just put in demand cave just elected in and see and touch greatness but um you know I I don't want to rub it in the bottom\nOf the sport or they're not on this work I Do know is to provoke frivolous thing I mean I wrote an article on her lap number or something for your\nYou know you're worth but at the same time I really feel like you know hey as a symbol of what you do I mean you know what her name ... trophy so ends in the last ... that you know what is it let's spray painted or whatever\n[laughter] [laughter] okay good but John ... when you saw those goals gloves and all it is is a catcher's Mitt they spray painted gold might get\nLost a little bit of the well that's a gold glove it feels like your kids could have made that for you\nWhat are the worst thing of all there is one of those problems are free for all the all male baseball and bread or\nVery hard because [laughter] I mean you can follow them through\nThe ... oil or if we have any problems in our area that's hard about it ... where's your own ... where's your in BP\nAnd Bangor Oklahoma and everything is there such as soon there yeah ...

Will Ferrell be seeing it at my funeral home already planning it so many people plan your funeral\nRight it just happens and then you know somebody goes oh we got to scramble here for two and then we had the music\nBring them over here for ... and then we had the music then enter an apple\nYeah that that that would be my my ... I'd be flat lining is that what am I on Thanksgiving Day yes both\nPricey candy corn I have like a traumatic experience in my arms and candy corn over rated Vassar candy corn vastly overrated giving out colored wax because\nI was also a though these guys brought up my daughter when she was around six\nShe she came home and she said hey I'm I Want to be a ham sandwich for Halloween\nAnd you know you can't go out and buy ham sandwich ... so my wife had to make a ham sandwich for my daughter and she kept thinking meal made my daughter of forget about it\nAnd then she'd say Molly what what do you want to be for Halloween I had a hamster [laughter] much so she kept saying it so my wife is making a ham sandwich costume with a pickle and aid truth pick as the hat\nAnd my daughter went trick or treating as like six or seven years old and a a ham sandwich\nYou're never going to run into somebody who's got a ham sandwich you sound like oh you got the same costume you've got a ham sandwich there I more phone calls coming up let's get to re route of NBC Sports bay area senior insider and I wanted to talk to read about what's going on with my Oakland Raiders good morning Renee how are you\nKnow let's talk about your daughters need to be food [noise] okay that's the did he do you ever take her to get\nGet seen by somebody [laughter] that's not healthy on any level\nWell you know she loves to just go watch the butcher work so I don't know there's there's something unique about her but a ... say you want to be a ham sandwich\nNo no I wouldn't say she she likes to feel pretty much [laughter] but uh oh thunder hurt\nYeah yeah and my wife is a great costume alright uh tell me what's going on here with a behind the scenes where the raiders any possibility of blood is Derek car on this team\nA next Tuesday next Tuesday yes a divided in\nNext July now I I don't think so that that the salary cap implications of moving him now are two considerable uh but if they wait until after June first ah they they have a a boatload of money on that kept class\nYou know if if you really want it is that your finger in the eye of a fan base that you're already abandoning that would be the way because as radical as car has been he basically it is now the only thing left\nFor this fan base to cling to a Martian Lynch is probably not going to play again they share\nA mark Cooper is gone even though you know he was sort of problematic in ... gone so really you know you create your quarterback or basically you weren't so we're not closed for business going come around for a little more or not you know\nThat that's that's the place where it where Mark Mark Davis probably tells John calm down [laughter] I'm kidding hammered here so no he he'll get it they trade him at the level of insanity that I think John Gurdon is capable of but he'll pay for it for years to come\nAll right but if the raiders weren't moving to Vegas would they be making all of these moves\n[noise] probably because look John Gurdon lives and they put all only vacuum and one of the reasons why I think he was surprised that it has played that this rebuild has played so poorly\nBecause he's not on the same timeline everybody else is he's the coach or the raiders he's not necessarily the coach for the Oakland Raiders and I think that was the disconnect and Peggy referenced it yesterday in his sort of\nCasual mid week pressure you know he said I Want to do the best we want to do the best we can for for the Oakland Raiders and for the raiders\nYou know it's like they're two separate entities to him and you know\nThat's an insane way to live but it's the the whole he cook for the hundred million dollars\nAnd he sort of compartmentalize listen to Oakland they can't be my problem\nSo yeah I think he would have blown up the way he blew it up\nBut I think the backlash would not have been nearly as great there would've been a class because the raiders steak complete rebuild six years ago after al Davis died and now they're doing another one\nBut I don't know if it was Mickey Mantle might have been er Willie Mays when somebody said uh you know uh\nBut I didn't know forty forty forty or thirty thirty season was that big if I Would have done it probably would have thought that I Would have done it every year like they didn't think of\nWere so numbers driven now everybody's conscious of their numbers they're touches you know no matter what sport it is my numbers compared to somebody else's and that means more money that's not the way you know players played I'm sure\nThat's not the way you know players played I'm sure of Larry Bird wanted average a triple double your average a triple double or magic wanted out average a triple double he would average a triple double it's just that wasn't really in in the binocular like you guys just played\nYou know you came out of a game you didn't say wait do I need what do I need further tripled up one more shit like that it just didn't happen that way now these guys have agents who are basing their salaries their negotiations off\nYou know his numbers you know the Greek freaks numbers compared to throw out a name a hall of famer he's better than him while he's better than him a hall of famer then he's worth this that's how you negotiate now so it is fun to be able to compare and contrast but I I don't\nMean van gundy you know can be they get off the long guy sometimes\nAnd have fun with it I think sometimes just mentioning it even a name like Elgin Baylor who to me was a transformative talent but nobody ever saw him on the big shaped by the time the Lakers became world champs you know Elgin was hurt and didn't get a chance to show people just John Grady was\nIf we're mentioning older players I think it's great if I'm comparing the Greek freak to George Durban do I think George urban was a better score yeah as a Greek Freak a better player yes I mean it's not the end of the world\nYou know and plus what you can get away with now you couldn't get away with watch old time NBA you may not love the athleticism but you're going to be a shock to the physicality of that yeah\nI think and I know you'll know this better than anybody the the the players in the old time and they had a more variety of shot like not just threes and driving home yeah but like Larry Bird had twenty different shots and its arsenal\nAnd when you want her three point lead back then\nYou just didn't it was on a high percentage shot officers weren't geared that way and then all of a sudden you know you had the influx of\nTeams trying to create temple and you get those three point shooters Golden State happens upon two of the greatest shooters in history and clay Thompson chef curry\nAnd so I'm playing to their strengths not everybody can do that you played of their strengths and you know that's what's happening now in the NBA everybody's looking for those kinds of shooters and we're developing those kind of shooters\nIf you would have said back in the seventies or when they first had the three point shot hey this is really valuable integrate weapon you would've had people developing players to be able to shoot and have that kind of ran she on the globe\nIt in a different too big men shoot outside out like I'm like joellen beat loves the three point line stuff like that that never used to have to wonder Devinsky would be a guy with his back to the basket if he played back in the sixties and seventies oh it's amazing when you when you think of big men who could shoot like ...\nBob Lynn near a Patrick Ewing\nBob Rule like there were certain guys that could take it out Fifteen feet below lame beer can take it out even further than that and they were big man and you would always share this\n... hid under the basket or you should be under the basket you're the big man but if if if that's your weapon and I can take you I can shake your big men out and I'm shooting on the perimeter I could open up the game\nBut dirt Devinsky would be a big man with his back to the basket on the low post\nThat's how that's how the games change individuality help change the game there's seven footer who can shoot as well as a six foot her\nThat's amazing I we're back uh I got an update I asked Pauli if I could get an update on the ceremonial first pitch last night with numbers from the two thousand four Boston Red Sox and I wanted to know why Curt shilling was not there\nI Hope we got an answer because I was really surprised of all the other players and Curt Schilling lives locally why wasn't he there for the ceremonial first pitch last time more phone calls coming up as well then Patrick show [noise]\n\n\n\nWe all love the tailgate at the stadium for the big games right but the one
