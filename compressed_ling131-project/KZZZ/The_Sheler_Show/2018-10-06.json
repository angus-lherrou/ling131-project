you got two choices it's built into the tire you look at the tire and that you know it's time to change it or you get the uh the book\nYou say\nThat when there was an additional ... tonight that what after that it'll it'll come on your ...\nYour\n... you know this is the time of year\nThat you need to really consider having really hire or that a few that wonderful weather coming up and I'm not going to mention what the ah we end result is that it's not well they're all in open minded keep in mind you do not have to have\nTigers that are balder are almost to the end of the useful life as much as the fact that it's called each cycling you can still have a lot of travel left on the tire but it becomes darling oh yeah not\nSeven years now at all and he comes harden and when it becomes harder the greasy yeah\nKnow what you sound like he was the great state I as they were All right well you've you've terrify me to the ...\nAnd if it was All right well you've you've terrify me to the point where I Will be walking home later what stops your car\nHuh what's the other car had on me [laughter] I thought you know I don't remember we had a Grinch and every one time when we did Cindy yeah yeah yeah that's right oh we don't remember Steve are some things we were just talking about yeah\nLady is well her partner brought in a Grinch a Grinch for Christmas when we were doing like the music when we bring out the amount you know ... we had yeah oh\nOh yeah yeah yeah\nYeah that would scare it's like a clown that scared me right I could live an hour that was one guy I won't sleep tonight now All right thanks very much I was curious if let's say hey can I buy all insurance on\nThe no okay let's move on one eight hundred eight five nine zero nine five seven we now go to Frank and Frank has an eighty four Porsche to nine forty four Frank how many miles on your Porsche\nSeventy two thousand All right very nice you must keep very good care of that car that must be a good weather only cars that right\nWell it's a friend of mine's car and he inherited it oh and I try to get it run it\nAll right so you say it turns over but there is no spark right okay so you have a two point five is that correct leader four cylinder engine\nYeah tried engine with a trans acts on the air\nRight now tell me a little bit about it because I have to Ninety four that's that those or eighty four those are the years that they had all sorts of different um a ignition systems as well as fuel system so help me out remind me is this a fuel injected mechanical or not\nYeah it's it's fuel injected and uh it's one of those weird ones the fuel pumps outside the tank I've been replaced okay I got fuel\nOr replace both reference sensors in the quiet child saying okay I put out a new fuel pump relay or re manufacture\nWhich I said you're not getting any spark\nRight and what it's got a new car lot and I'm getting voltage on both primary terminals with the ignition on I'm also getting full\nVoltage at an injector\nConnector on both sides of the connector\nI got voltage are going into the injector but there's no voltage on the secondary\nGoing into the distributor\nOkay we'll keep in mind you're always going to have a voltage at the injector and then the computer turns around on and off in order to\nPhase Ian Jack now when you first turn the key on you hear the fuel pumps run yes\nOkay so we're fine there on where I always like this to start this especially on vehicles like this had been setting a round is you need to get a a can of electrical connector cleaner\nOr you can go to like to an all Riley auto parts store or wherever and there's a couple of companies like ... and some others that manufacture this and start off with every connection first okay that's most important thing now you said you've changed the reference sensors okay which is good I'm normally they do fail because they're nothing more than magnets\nNow the other issue would be after you do this cleaning you also want to check grounds checked the ground from the battery you know to the blockers frame or wherever the ground is at a in many cases when we have a no spark condition like you're experiencing it's just because of the lost ground\nAnd if you're familiar with how to use a digital photo meter and do a voltage dropped test that that sometimes is going to be able to help you find what's wrong\nAgain you know it's been sitting probably for a while and we always have to go back to the basics and the basics would be to do that cleaning first are so important fact you you sometimes won't even see what forums this white type corrosion that conform over the connector and all it has to be is just\nYou just need to do a little cleaning and in many cases just you know you spray the or the cleaner and both ends plug it in plug unplugged plug it in and unplug it and go about everything you can find now\nAnd then in the last thing of course in a lot of guys don't like changing and then that would be the model that controls all that you could ever possibly a bad solder joints or maybe an inside many cases you could probably take the unit apart or the module I Believe it's called the DMV macho taken apart look inside\nSee if there's any colds solder joints and so you know you can have that repaired but again go back to the basics it probably ran when it was parked\nAnd just by setting around it's you know my my\nArea would be as bad a bad connection\nOkay uh [noise]\nI'll tell you [noise]\nIt's it's got me stumped\nWell that's why and you're going to be stumped but the you know but they have the weather packed conductors in other words they're supposed to not it's a absorbs moisture\nUh over the years they get harder and but just disconnect spray sprayed both the female and mail and do that and then connect and connect and connect them a couple of times that'll clean 'em and believe it or not you're going to one connector at a time to find out exactly which one was\nBad right and then the other issue as to don't forget that even though many ignition wires are not actual wire their carbon filled in a raft you could even have a spark\nTheir carbon filled in Iraq you could even have a spark plug wire you'll say for example like an ignition coil wire that could be dead that that's another issue you also want to\nTake a look at that make sure that the coil I wouldn't eat I'll check on my replace the because of the age yeah All right though very good Frank thanks for your call here on the charge a one eight hundred eight by nine zero nine five seven we now go to Michael has two thousand twelve dodge charger and ah Michael you want to store this for the winter\nYou know like oh\nThis is Michael Michael going what Michael going to a Michael this is Michael go ahead\nAnd twelve dodge charger and I'd like to Stuart in Cleveland I'm just wondering how I Would do well how would you I thought it might be like hey [noise]\nBags that phone [noise]\nHey Michael with that charger kinds of games on a bigger it out on it and now you don't hang up on the cars are just as an avid um\nDo we just hung up on him that's ... that we can hang up on anybody we ain't gonna we flew in up online and gone Eighteenth you will get a call like a one eight hundred eight five nine\nZero died five seven called a few dear All right let's see let's go to let's go to Ken Ken has a few thousand seven jeep wrangler how many miles on the Jupiter cats\nUm the units that can replace\nAll right so you have a missed fire you know that for a fact right\nYeah yeah it's a coat on the on the came up to our hearts are they are are are split sorry chew a song\nWhat cylinder numbers you know I don't remember which one of ... it and that's really that which which the owners are\nOkay next question then do you have a four cylinder six on her on her okay and you know that on that engine it should have one large long coil back\nOkay replaced that you replace coil pack okay and then did you check before you did that it doesn't necessarily have to be\nA not uncommon for injector problems so you know there's like five different things that can create a miss fire it can be a ban clock it can be a bad coil or you could have an intake leak backing link\n'em an injector which is pretty common with that kind of miles and that you're easy easy enough access you know ... we don't care what they read just as long as you read the same you can unplug all the electrical can actors off the inspectors and use a digital photo meter and if you go to want\nTo check it out of reach three homes in the national ... and all the way across and you got to want to reach while you found your band so check the injector snacks ice are very good are they really can't one eight hundred eighty five nine zero five seven we are in the car show\nWe will be back in a moment with more of your home because\nThis age of gear spotlight is brought to you by Walker products are leading manufacturer quality fuel system components an engine sensors vehicles are being pushed to new heights with increased fuel economy and fewer tailpipe emissions\nThis has created the need for a smarter and more sophisticated exhaust after treatment system featuring an array of sensors designed to monitor and control the different aspects of your cooperation and help me GT or exhaust gas temperature sensor plays a major role and with multiple processes affected by the CGI it's crucial\nYeah but in your case if you have an external antenna that's you're probably attention to that don't worry about the other okay\nVery good luck and thanks for the call Randy you have a a wonderful day All right now let's go to van because we warned have been all the way up the ban has a two thousand ten\nFor tourists men how many miles on your tourists why just one fifty\nAll right very good and uh you have a rear privacy curtain sun\nShade yup and it's not working\nIt it works too much it it's it every time we go into reverse it it goes up\nAnd we call self halfway oh and get stuck it makes it all out you know like eight something sounds from ... ...\nWell at at one time and ... it could have been down in someone could've tossed something on the screen in the back anything could I jump to it at that time so what you have is you have little plastic gears that may be damage or shared because of a an obstruction at one time\nOkay what I what I Would like to do is make it just go away I I never used\nOkay well that's a little bit of work because you'll have that plastic casing that goes around it you'll remove that and then of course we know what's motorized will just do one simple thing and plug it and if you don't know if you don't know what you're doing you may want to stop in a body shop or whoever does your automotive repair work and you know they can disable that for you too so you\nHave to I'm part of his nephews it no\nFor you too so you have to I'm part of his nephews it\nNo no no you want to talk I Believe a problem with the fuses you're going to end it ... it's probably used to two or three different things and wants to write a couple of other items so if you just go in there and and do it right and actually it's not the right way to do it but if you I Know [laughter]\nAnyhow and then make sure if you're going to do it yourself that you tape it off don't let it open because then you're going to a year from now have some other problem you know and also keep in mind or there's a lot of lot of vehicles out in Shelby jars and it's not uncommon to if you wanted to buy a huge component and if I remember correctly even to replace that\nUh it's not real expensive so\nOh if you refer to get a little over a grand how I was really well that's something I didn't use\nWell if you want to close to that I'm disconnecting it I'm with you make sure it down and and just disconnected and you're done and over ...\nCity access it from the package area out from underneath and the truck it\nNormally normally it's from the package area so okay\nAll right well great ... I Will take it to the shop ...\nAll right to a very good to appreciate your call as a always and nothing more annoying than having the the shade or not function properly but I get why it goes up obviously when you're in reverse as it should so you can see on the back window\nRight didn't know what it is it is that kind of the factory optioned is really an cheat on the back yeah some of the some of the high line vehicle will think about it is your bank up no get well hey you have ... I don't sit in the backseat looking at the back when I Do I go All right never mind one eight hundred eight five nine\nZero nine cycles that will keep in mind that mesh so it it's still allows you only as an astronaut compared to think about it if you have your ... but I think about when thinking about is headed windows at night how nasty that is you know you can't see through okay this is an alternative okay where do we have a\nHundred eight five nine zero nine five seven are let's go to a Jeff and Jeff has nine Pontiac gee six Seventy miles Jeff\nUh I don't I don't know the mile okay how many what's going on with headlights\nA cheap they burn it out a request clubs I replaced the pig tails ...

California residential purchase agreements on months before we close bashful I received an email from the real estate agent along with the ... to the purchase agreement we have a reach for a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars he sent me an email says hey you know what I discussed a I had a conversation with the city inspector\nAbout the many issues this property has its worst so then I

think that it was the original\nGame offers because nobody has our power I hear you let me first of all a that inspectors conflicted all over the place that is for starters I Would do a complaint
