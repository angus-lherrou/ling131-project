every year and it costs four point three billion dollars in taxpayer dollars to educate them and to give other federal benefits healthcare and so forth people are just like to watch\nAnd I get outrageous most people\nIncluding in one of the most hotly contested Senate races in the United states which is and the beautiful state of Montana Jon Tester\nIs in the political fight of his life Matt Rosendale is with us\nOr this race is very close a record amount of outside money coming in to this race just over the past week another six million and outside money poured into the contest just

Matt this is a Montana obviously is a massive state it's a lot of ground to cover so you have\nTo have to pick your pick your places where you go but\nIt would seem to me that the way the American

southern border and reducing regulation and getting these trade agreements in place\nUm has been very very good for the state of Montana and and the people embrace those policies and they would like to send someone to Washington to help the president accomplished more I mean if we can get this much done\nAnd the last ah twenty months with with a Congress that has not always been cooperative and certainly the Democrats have been as much of a ... ... they possibly can goodness what can we accomplish in the next couple of years\nUh how much in a way of of lobbyists um money ... test or taking him during his time in the Senate\n... this is this is one of the things that demonstrate just how for from Montana Jon Tester is gone he is the number one recipient of contributions from lobbyists in the country\nFive hundred and thirty five members of Congress we have one million people here and he has received more contributions from lobbyists than any other a member over one million dollars over one million dollars and why is that he stood on stage twelve years ago and said he wouldn't be in ...\nBy special interests and now he's the number one recipient he literally bought a house\nA million dollar high in the Washington DC and left Montana and his rearview mirror\nWell again Montanans are very smart pragmatic no nonsense people and I think Jon Tester talked a good game when he ran and kind of looks like a burly\nGuy and he has put a plaid shirt on and then he comes to Washington and it just becomes one of the ... monsters in Washington DC and he wants to he wants to

for clients clients that care with us up so it ... right now the Europeans are there there's there's a developing and persistence\nSplitting opinion on what to do with this Iranian minutes where is Germany today given the fact that Merkel is out as a party a leader she's in her last term clearly opposition forces in Germany more populist uh anti migration political\nOn lower so far the German government has not changed his position that still wants to stay inside of the J CPA away\nBut nearly every German company folks with real money at risk made the opposite decision they have fled they have left they decided they are not going to run through the Iranian sanctions that President Trump will put back in place on Monday\nAnd there are other countries in Europe who are with us um and I'm convinced that over time all of the European countries will come to see the around that is indeed the uh the force creating instability in the middle east and that we must apply all possible pressure to push back against to fix it\nSo the sanctions going place on Monday correct\nYes ma'am Monday and they'll feel them immediately or let's take a little time to settle and\nSo there are already feeling with him but a mess the days go on the pressure will increase we will substantially drop the amount of crude oil their primary revenue source that they could ships\nIt was substantially dropped the amount of crude all their primary revenue source that they could ship around the world a treasury will put back in place sanctions on financial institutions there [noise]\nAnd we hope that the sanctions were put on individuals and in other places will convince the leadership and we we walk the rating people to be successful we want this to be a successful country wants to restore democracy that we we think the Iranian people want that same thing\nAs our aim is uh not hardly renting people but to change the behavior the malign activity of this regime\nAre just going back to Germany a boy have a Merkel's fortunes changed obviously she'll be finishing up her last term but she's been there for Thirteen Years or so\nUh and uh she's leaving ahead of her party will how will that change our dealings with Germany in the in the near term and what do you see as the political climate in Europe with the rise of solving any and the challenges that you use facing\nSo we have many places where the Europeans work alongside us we clearly have some were um we don't share the same view of the president\nHas been direct with respect to the Europeans taking increased responsibility for their own security that makes perfect sense most European countries understand that the primary folks who need to defend against the risk that Russia creates hum a reside in Europe and America\nAnd so I'm hopeful as each of these governments evaluate system sees that America is with them were happy to assist them but they have the primary responsibility we hope that each of these governments will come to see that and the way that President Trump is so clearly laid out\nA CNBC reported yesterday Mr Secretary that North Korea is reportedly preparing nuclear and missile sites\nFor international inspectors are what can you tell us about\nI Know you're going to go meet with your not North Korean counterpart just a matter of days but what's the latest from ah North Korea\nSo I Can't say much about what's taking place on the ground but I can make clear that what I was with chairman Kim now or three weeks three and a half weeks ago [noise] um he committed to allowing American inspectors to come look at a two significant sites\nAnd we hope to get them there before too long it's one of the things I'll speak with my counterpart next week about and then we do have the attention of a President Trump or German Kim getting together before too long hopefully early next year where we can make\nA substantial breakthrough in taking down the nuclear threat from North Korea um we're we're still a happy that they have conducted a nuclear test in an awfully long time they have launched a missile in an awfully long time but there's a lot of work which were maids\nAnd chairman Kim has made clear to me are just as plain as a I was speaking to lower the he has the attention to the nuclear rise and we do everything we can to system in following through on that commitment\nI Want to move to China and the secretary because\nUh we seen in in recent weeks nothing that's surprising to see you or me because we've been following this issue of Chinese\nOr stealing our intellectual property and bribing attempting to bribe foreign officials including here and different times in the United states I'm a business officials excuse me to uh gain access to technology a critical technology and manufacturing aviation\nUh and so forth and now we have the chip maker ban\nAre in play on that ... garner and a lot of um attention on it's trying to I guess we're trying to target that stayed on a chip maker in China over national security concerns\nUh how how is that going to fit into our overall a aggressive stance against this expansive on Chinese or the ...\nThe lure of a China is probably over the long term the biggest challenge that scared a challenge that faces our country you saw the indictments of a pen Chinese versus for the\nUh the alleged theft of intellectual property aviation related intellectual property this is a story that's been going on for years this was the first administration that has been prepared to push back against China\nWere doing so on all fronts so where the semi conductor peace that it is it's it's part of a mosaic of our strategic effort to push back against this continued Chinese effort [noise]\nAh you know it begins with trait we want president has demanded fair reciprocal trade with China we've demanded that they not steal our intellectual property\nWe talk with some frequency above the enormous violation of religious freedom a this taking place against the leaders in China ah were very worried that China will put the people in many countries around the world and African Central America Latin America\nOr in a death trap or that will cause those countries decades of pain a as a multi pronged effort\nA pain is a multi pronged effort on behalf of all of the United states government at the president's direction to convince China to behave like a normal nation on commerce and with respect to the rules of international law\nNow I mean I Know you have to go to Mr Secretary but just as some people understand that our\nOur trade policy or with China has had real effect inside China they already have structural a weaknesses within a China that large but they had the weakest manufacturing growth and more than two years in China\nOr in the the one has a a flood a manufacturing stalls are and they and their ambitions as a result of been affected but they're still lofty a and we ... we do
