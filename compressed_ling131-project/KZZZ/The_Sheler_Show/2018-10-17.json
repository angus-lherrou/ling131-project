just bunch of hey seeds how they treat the blue collar people this is why Trump got elected I Can't stand this kind of thing and it but at the tip of this is why I don't watch any TV I literally watch the news and sports I watch nothing\nAnd there were tons of not passive aggressive shots at her you know a John Goodman character who is Roseanne husbands saying you know she never would have taken advice from a she never did anything you're told her to do you know that ... those kinds of like Cy swipes from the writing room there were tons of those throughout this episode and I I just\nI just think when you have a beloved character that's been removed for a reason other than something to do with the show I it it's not helpful to kind of poke your finger in the eye of that audience and

the gas masks or anything else so they needed to crush her in in in order to make 'em Valerie Jarrett higher\nWhen it comes to I'm looking at second I have watched each and every episode okay in the reruns all my say look get started and one thing that was the last week when it was completely the opposite\nOkay so why worst way to do it and take all of that power from her than putting this stigma of drug addiction on or not that I'm\nNow kicking kicking the fate yeah kicking the fish aren't I'm Sorry we're out of time a well Raymond I think that is the way a lot of people think Hollywood thinks of them though a lot of kind of middle America feel condescending and look down to\nYou know they had to beat her down not only make or a drug addict but part of a drug ring in the neighborhood pathetic and out of character\nOr you're listening to your healthy radio addiction pack canals him to join us the blue wave or more of a trickle down cover\n\n\nIf you suffer from Dee Dee and you've

getting ripped off of the big pharma companies with four hymns dot com you can bypass the doctor's office pharmacy visit and the huge money in your prescription eating is just go to\nYou could see that there were voters who are quite concerned with the issue of what I call when you when you talk to voters about the potential\nYou you're talking about is one of the big three I Believe um that worries immigration you have you know a large majority so she would go\nWhoa whoa sanctuary city who um are in favor of 'em I mean we'll pose I'm a I'm\nA what's happening at the border who who are worried or you have a belief that the I'm a huge huge majorities Oregon abolishing ice which has become kind of a overnight in democratic\nParty um doctrine I'm and I'm In and who believe I'm ... and above twenty twenty margin and people who believe that you know Democrats are\nMore likely basically to favor the rights of the illegal aliens when they are the rights of citizens it's a theme that Trump is put on this is a big issue and it's across the board um ... and um it change moves\nTo cost the board um ... and um it change moves votes as does the another issue which is important because I Believe\nUm in light of the Kavanaugh stop the summer's probably already been more important which is the\nWhen the argument that the Democrats if they take the house are already many of them play and we now have their chairman hum of there\nTo be chairman ate today when they sure committee I'm sharing that are saying well we're gonna we're gonna impeach cabinet and we're going to impeach Trump we always investigations are a great belief that this will disrupt the economy and I'm a sense that um this is\nGoing to be cake chaotic and that it is\nGoing to weaponize the constitution for the purpose of going after unpopular presence whatever they say you know that's their agenda\nSome had had a couple of days later said just to recap so you know some issues that would drive Republican turnout and maybe maybe even win over some Democrats\nDr ... yes but we'll move was the number of Democrats and many independents civil moving the third big issue of course is what the Democrats are doing the Democratic socialism or someone said to me ah you know the Dems as they now refer to them the Democratic impeachment mob\nI'm a party um uh and you know the repeal they promise to repeal every piece of a or reject every piece of the president's economic policies\nUm which are booming for most people are at least\nMuch more positive than they haven't been in years um these issues in the sense of the Democrats are opting to out of the middle one democratic socialism but Hubbard all with the idea of chaos you know whether to bang on windows they are going to disrupt\nA country in a way that it for two years would be awful for the most people see\nYou know some of the loan on her own not influence level now hold on let me just again law and order safety law and order ... the respect\nUm respect yes those are really good terms and then there's the answer is is that they are so far out they are now with their projections of what they want to do or what they're saying saying\nThat this really bothers voters and that is what has been we've been seeing the closing up it is imperative that seems to me that those through what I call that prior to ...\nUm the Democrats have health care and we're not going to take that away from its to light 'em but um except for the fact that both the cost is because that goes again\nYou have a third of more Democrats who oppose the idea of the Democratic party trying to Institute they ... the Democratic socialism of that bothers people ... does\nOkay this is yeah hold on this is what Nate Silver of course the\nWhole you know he's the he's the ... this statistical on journal and he practiced statistical journalism um and he you know he didn't get the prediction right and twenty sixteen uh but this time and he's saying\nPeople should not be that surprised by a Democratic Senate or a Republican House we're in dangerous territory from a productive\nAssumption standpoint he sent a four and five chance may sound like a done deal but it's simply isn't a and he said it's it just because someone thinks something is a high probability might be but it doesn't mean it's an inevitable\nSack so when people think it's inevitable that Republicans lose the house and no one isn't high enough about it maybe it's likely historically but it's not inevitable and I think that's what a lot of Republicans have to get through their hands\nYes this is why it's still hanging 'em I leave it there and it's very hard to be predicted business environment because you don't know what's going to drive\nThis thing at the end we have a the selection that there are many many things that are under law in this election most of all by the way is one like the Trump and sixteen a fear of returning the country to the hands of the political class\nA elites and the sense of of losing what progress that the the maid and the the that anti Washington anti elitism still exist very great with\nThe issue has been from the Republican nationalize the election I still don't think I still think there's more they could do they could run national advertising with these things right\nStop it and by the way it's cheaper to do and it's more effective because guess what when you buy\nTo do and it's more effective because guess what when you buy network advertise you to be inside of shows rather than crammed into local three minutes five minutes to do with them in the states with these commercials\nYou get to stand on Europe but they need to nationalize because then Harris laid off year elections are\nAre off year elections are um tend to be for people who are in the party that the ... the I'm happy to disgruntled people who don't like Trump's trade tweets either\nBut when you put the big issues in front of people are consequences then something happened and I think the Republican and all the candidates are doing a better job of frankly the patch and the ... they have not gotten together\nTo do what they could do 'em to national Berger national\n... now have not and not just local X amount is\nIs it a national election and people need to understand the choices\nBecause there are concerns are very great again Kavanaugh hearings beginning of the Supreme Court the driving people out of restaurants this incivility arguments rescues and had some numbers yesterday that showed overwhelming rejection of the Hillary Clinton proposition\n... even split among Democrats\nOr whether or not you know this notion that you can't be civil so you when I'm there is and the things at the end they believe by the way by a large variety that if the Democrats win civility will get worse\nThings will become worse than they are now\nI Want to play a Nancy Pelosi for you or this is below sea uh discussing Trump's desire for a long especially given what we're seeing these new migrants let's listen\nIssue\nA manhood issue that ties into what and let's see the last question they pitch people say the year the woman you have a lot of these interesting women running for office a lot of them former veterans and some of them doing really well so they are the woman you're the one it could also be the year of the man\nAh because well are saying man and masculinity being attacked in the cabin off and all\nYeah so I think there's a backlash I think that there is certainly a gender gap that goes both ways and the men are and and again I come back to it's not just rubbing up the Republican base there are huge numbers of independents remembered with Trump carried\nIn twenty sixteen and a large share of Democrats who are not happy with the way things these these the prospects are going and it is and heritage really that those voters as well as the base\nBe exposed to a larger consequences of what happens if you will while the Democrats to take over and what will happen to them\nBut I think as a central simple formulation simple formulation mobs versus jobs resistance versus results\nForward or backward\nWe're going forward we're going up not down they want to kick they want to kick you when you're down they want to kick you and you hit hard okay we're going up we're not ... not looking back
