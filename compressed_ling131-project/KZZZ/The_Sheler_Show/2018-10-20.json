eight hundred and eight by nine zero nine five seven if you've got a question about your vehicle let's go to Tim\nTim as a two thousand four Ford F. one fifty Tim how many miles on your a\nPickup truck Seventy five thousand fight and today you're calling about oil what can we do for you\nThis is a follow up to a conversation we had last weekend that I saw driving on free way last oil pressure shut the engines down and uh realize that there was no oil and the angel got off the side wrote so got her home the engine was locked up by pull all the spark plug\nAnd are still couldn't get a turn over\nAll the soccer team belt and they did start turning over so when\nI had all the plugs out I wanted to make sure that all the soldiers a head or re lubricate it so I put about a cup cup and a half oil on each shoulder\nSpun the engine was plucked out got his watch the oil hours I could with that than I sprayed it with a sprayed each so under with her cleaner and a compressed air\nSprayed each soldier with her ... and a compressed air and then you guys recommended I changed ... which I did\nMy problem now is that\nI Can't uh there was a question you recommended that I Do a ... test on each so under\nTo find out which if any at last compression ... one of my problems is this is a very unique our clock twelve twelve bucks on these things take some night sixteenth Clark socket mhm and I have been unable to locate a crushing engaged that will read into goes\nA ... threat into the spark plug holes so if I'm Still unable after this conversation to find one\nHow much oil should Iran checked into each so under a to make sure that uh to to re engage the pressure on the compression rings\nWhen ... once the rings are stuck in the Lancet the pistons you don't re engage anything they're stuck a okay at this point\nUh because of possibly overheating or even because of where there are companies out there but it's your major tool manufacturers for professional use that make a compression that's not the gauge the adaptor it'll be a long flexible hose with the end that will be able to screw in what we were concerned about is not necessarily you putting oil and to do a wet compression test\nYou're going to pull all the spark plugs disabled the ignition system in the field system and what we're going to look for is what compression there is when it's dry\nAnd that's going to be that's going to be the the dead giveaway there and then of course you take the dry test regular numbers down then you put a couple of squirts oil and that's similar to then take another test again and if that compression increases considerably than we know that the rings are are most likely she used within the pistons\nAnd if I remember correctly this is the vehicle that\nCame from an airport in idle dog yeah and then of course running an olive oil low on oil is not a good thing\nUm and keep in mind that was of course when you know the the it was locked up are tied up a and see if we don't know if it was on the main bearings in ... or I doubt very much if it did anything in the uh in the in the cylinders except for the fact the heat itself caused the ring lands for the pistons disease\nSo damn you shouldn't have a problem getting a compression adapter which you want like like Dan said just a small extension hose that goes right to the compression\nTester or the gauge and ah it shouldn't be a problem and in fact you might check your local part stores\nThey a lot of times we'll let you use that adapter or the compression gauge and if you buy your parts from them so it it can be done as little as no charge at all so that's why I Would recommend that\nI understand that and I tried that with two different gauges that has to fourteen millimeter extension what I'll be doggone I spent two hours trying to spend those things in it I cannot seem to get it\nTo to act arts drew in yeah\nWell veterans in for that is because of the threads in the block don't start if you take a look at your spark plug\nAnd look at the length of the plug in ... you're going to find out your diner while while there's there's no threats there but so they like I said the major tool manufacturers offer that where it's basically looks like the end of the spark plug a and it's going to have Schrader and that and so it it's just it's a service tool I mean it's definitely a service to\nForget and you're gonna have to get on line and get that specific adapter but that holds is gonna be necessary as well because the present make any sense do I mean if your hand you can take a spark but when did the old spark plugs\nAnd and they cut the shell and use that but it's probably are going to take you a long time unless you own the ... machine right on\nWriting keep in mind that the proper compression test or any adapters are going to have a small a small Schrader valve inside because what you want is you're going to have the accelerator held down you know the fuel system disabled the ignition system disabled\nAnd you're going to crank it about five or six times and you have to have a wave for that compression as it pumps to seal off that gauge if not it's going to be an invalid test so it has to be the one that has a little Schrader valve at the ... of the adaptor alright the Tim there you go thanks for the\nCall good luck on the continuing with getting that the engine in order one eight hundred and eighty five nine zero nine five seven that is our number we go now to fill fill has a craftsman one tractor and uh how how long have you had this line tractor there fill\nA judge is a a last season or an oil change okay so what can we do for\nOr what or how much\nDoes it is an Eighteen worse ... single\nOr a\nFish sail on lower oil everywhere you look what's so special about well wait ...\nYeah normally in you know in in where you live in your climate you know some of the manufacturers recommend that you use at ten thirty way to oil in other words if\nThe manufacturers will recommend that you use ten thirty weight oil in other words if if you're going to be using and then like if your tracker would have like a snow plow attachment\nThey would recommend that uh because of the type that use you're going to be using a air cool single cylinder\nYou're going to want to go with a straight white oil or you're going to want to make sure it's a D. church in oil there's two different like oils detergent and non to church and overall you'll probably have the best of luck with the straight thirty weight because again it's it's air cooled and not water cooled a traditionally that size is going to hold anywhere between two to three quirks oil\nOr other issue is when you purchase the long run they may even gave you a a kid where you have a rubber hoses extension\nOr to put in on top of the frame so you can easily drain the oil without the oil drilling on the chassis on the lawn\nIt's got like a like a like a ... or something like ... or ... or ...\nYes that's a very simple procedure some of the long wars like apple even have a spin on oil filter\nIt is\nVery straightforward\nOr whenever you have a question and that's not necessarily just for you so much for anyone\nThe owner's manual skill you specifically what do you use and what do you use it because of like a dance that if you're going to use this as a plow during the winter than we which suggests not use the thirty way oil during the winter we would suggest you use the multi this comedy which would be a W thirty\nThat's all right very good thanks for the ... so we're going to take a break when we come back we're going to talk about a Chevy\nWe have bill also with a Chevy and your calls to one eight hundred eight five nine zero nine five Seventy cars show you in

and soaking getting your car repair\nOur friends that car star have provided a comprehensive list of either you should consider\nTorture your vehicle was repair correctly that spending at least thirty minutes to complete the process is your parents can be complex review the vehicle with the person who wrote the stomach or were delivered to repair ask questions and take the time necessary to examine the repair it's also a good idea to compare the original was about what the final bill\nBy some work maybe you don't maybe it'll be fine we've seen that before where a an Asian runs without oil for short time\nAnd what's it's tied up then you're done I mean once you sign up then yeah you absolutely have to but I Would at least see if there's enough oil and they're now run the vehicle see if the noises all went away if the if the noises all went away\nThen I wouldn't take a long trip with it but I Would drive it around the town to see if it came back to life but let's let's assume for a second you do need an image and\nIf you need an inch and the question now is what condition is the rest of the car before you decide to put an engine in it you want to check everything else out\nTires breaks you know what's the condition of the body um ... you know take a take a look at it this way you have a ten year old vehicle was that many miles on it\nOr in will say this repair if they go maybe with a salvage yard engine or if he goes every man you know you could have a five or six thousand dollar repair you could have a three thousand dollar repair\nSo your way back and you look at now say for example you're going to use a low mileage salvage yard engine there's nothing wrong with buying an engine from the salvage yard they're normally and they're not because the engines are worn out is because they were involved in an accident and you're going to use that good component because of the fact the of cost\nSo if you wave that all out and say well it's going to cost me three thousand dollars knowing that the rest of the vehicles find that doesn't need tires or whatever you sit back and you look now can I buy a car this nice for three thousand dollars that'll possibly be able to get another hundred thousand miles out of so that's ... it's it's a finance\nTo be able to get another hundred thousand miles out of so that's ... it's it's a financial thing and it's also a condition thing you don't want to my thing is step over a ten dollar bill to save a buck also\nRight yeah so you keep in mind if you bought a thirty thousand dollar car ah I think your taxes somewhere around seven and a quarter percent sales tax and so you're going to be spending almost that much money and sales tax if you bought a new car\nNow she bought a used car course it's going to be much less uh I'm In favor of putting an engine in there as long as the rest of the the vehicles in great condition plus right now that car the value that car is probably worth a hundred hundred and fifty dollars at a junk yard if it doesn't run\nIf you put an engine in it all of a sudden now you could probably get your money right back\nUh out of it once you use it for a while so the investment is not a bad deal\nOkay I I really appreciate that it they\nAnd the other question as you're saying where does the oil go well when we have older vehicles that have a lot of miles and people neglect the time that they change oil will say that you had five thousand miles from the last oil change when the oil began to dirty the oil is slowly consumed by the engine breaks down it breaks down and it's using the oil so if\nIt went without an oil change for a while and no one actually physically checked at a disadvantage\nAdjusted it ... it actually ingested the oil went out the exhaust very slowly your daughter or anyone would have never noticed it by the way it does your daughter go to hell state\nI Know she's that physicians she graduated from right state I tend to do I say\nOkay I I saw that you're from and it is it the car she drives\nYes yeah and it was she might not have been right at border for medical school and she might be a great doctor but when it comes to changing the oil she may be a little off on you know I got to say I actually heard that takes care of itself has been so well maintained that's why we're such pride about but you know what\nCathy and this is something that's happened in our family just this week\nWhen when we give our children a vehicle or grandchildren a vehicle the first thing we should be telling them is we open the hood and show them where everything is checked\nA the ... the oil especially and then once a month they should be checking the oil because chances are had she'd done that or have someone done that right found out that they

Internet search 'cause he's real public documents\nAnd then you contact the owner now you hope it's the bank because if it's still\nIn the name of the previous owner\nI they're going to tell you the go pounds than they don't care I mean they're losing everything anyway I mean the worst that happens if you get a judgment against them let's say three hundred dollars okay just get in line because we've lost our house but he didn't got credit is like already\n[noise] their their distaste and their son took off\nA ... then you have to find out who owns a property 'cause that's where you going to go or you just paid for it and just suck it up I mean the people that are squatting next door or they don't have any responsibility on how bad is your problem with this\nWell it it to the point I haven't done I hadn't said anything about it 'cause I don't see anybody coming in and out but it it is a hanging over at least half\nIraqi are it's a lot how much do you think is going to cost to clean that up\nWell I think it's quite large and the pine needles are about ... inches wrong\nAll yeah All right so you got an issue I saw I get a bad and I don't know how well how you doing for money are you living tape for oh\nGood All right because then the next question was going to be I like are you living in a dumpster and is it\nNice and clean and so that's not the case I Would just pay for it and just have it done and then find out who own the property and just send the bill oh okay that's and then uh it's right in the same small claims court as I said if a bank owned that they'll clean it up because that's just what they do I mean they're\nTrying to sell the house and they don't want any liability and ah [noise] they're they're pretty good about that especially if you're talking

recognized under the law so they couldn't have what laws that what you got you\nKnow I don't like the way you can't remember which hotel I don't have it here in front of me uh when I'm sure it's they're not the point is is that let's say there was a horrible experience and you're a disparaging the hotel if it's true but\nAh you know what there is no defense there is no such thing as defamation to the truth is an absolute defense by the way they're not going to go after you if you say OK their bed bugs and the people were horrible and if you're talking about a non disparaging
