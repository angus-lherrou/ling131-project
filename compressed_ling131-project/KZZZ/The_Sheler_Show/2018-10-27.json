mean you have to be doing something right to go that far along how often how often was oil changed\nMy life for five thousand six thousand at the\nOkay so you put a lot of miles on a year then basically is what it comes down to what happens is you have items on called camp ... and you have chain guides and then you have these campaigns are nothing more than a than hydraulic\nA ... waiters at will tightened the chain and you have a ... valve timing engine so what's happening is these days are moving back and forth and it never gets adjusting timing according to load so the issue here is\nIf you're at the beginning stage you're at the beginning stage of of yes maybe having the ... and the chains replace because the change or probably stretching and the guys are wearing but I Would I Would try out and be a little bit conservative even though you changed oil all the time you can use\nAnd an additive an oil additive that sometimes we'll take and help these camps ... loosen up a little bit ah and do that along with an oil change and by doing that with an oil change and I don't know\nIt right now with the oil you use you should maybe start considering using an oil if you don't do it now a high mileage type oil which will have all the proper ingredients for additives and everything that you need\nThat you know four engines with more miles so you may use\nYou know you could
