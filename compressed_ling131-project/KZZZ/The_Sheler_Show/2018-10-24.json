he had a text message we now learn\nFrom a lobbyist friend who said Mike Miller and the crew had tickets for us for Hamilton tonight at eight PM awesome news Gillum responded now he's trying to shave and shape the story to make it seem as if oh I thought he only reserve the tickets and my brother paid for them and just handed them to me well\nThat this story is starting to slip and slide\nAll over the place of critical race for Donald Trump that is probably of all the races across the country it's the most important or the governorship of the great state of Florida because of its effect on the twenty twenty campaign\nAnd of course that Florida is a bellwether state for where the rest of the country's going that CNN is even hitting at the FBI probes centers on whether developers successfully influence city projects at one point in the program undercover agents successfully infiltrated\nGillum inner circle no one's been charged with any wrongdoing\nAnd killings repeatedly said he's not the focus of the investigation but his attendance at a Broadway show with lobbyists and longtime friend Adam Corey along with his brother and a federal agent who went by the name Mike Miller has been used by political opponents to suggest Gillum and potentially under more\nDirect scrutiny you want to elect somebody who could very well be down the road indicted by the federal government given this given this story this is getting worse he he could be under even even more criminal trouble let's check in first with chip Roy\nA there's an interesting piece in Politico meet the next Ted Cruz in November chip is likely to be elected to Congress top House Republicans worry\nThat he'll be to the rights of the Freedom Caucus that's music to my ears a chip of courses are running in the text is uh twenty first congressional district against Democrat Joseph Kopser he's a former chief of staff to cruise\nAnd he joins us now chip without would check and you're a you're up in the polls but you never want

are frustrated with the status quo Washington out lately insane Senate Democrats on they know that if you want to go up to what the house will look like\nLook no further going to be settled issue committees ... a lost art\nOh well you see this the situation in Texas where moral Latino and we end Raman array of found this out when he went to the Trump rally this week are a special correspondent there there are so many Latino voters Latino Americans legal immigrants into the United states has said what are we doing\nSo many Latino voters Latino Americans legal immigrants into the United states has said what are we doing this is just ridiculous they're all for\nTrump to offer crews and obviously there are going to be voting for you are a lot of them are going to be voting for you why do they want to turn this country and to the countries they left\nWell there's no question really tell you that the strongest advocates that I meet on the campaign trail that I talk to you dropped this district and all the taxes the strongest advocates for border security are those immigrants who come here whether or not a particularly bad acts in Texas\nOr come here legally they know what they've got to know to walk separate\nFrom places like Mexico and Central America and there beside themselves to see what the Democrat Party particular frankly some Republican sure she's\nA supplement to their their beside themselves what they want to do to this country and so what the message of order security strong immigration standing up for our country is selling well and by the way\nIt is much better for immigrants that we have a secure border I'm tired of watching this girl was going to slow the sex industry riding on the top at train car bombs dying and does your base of the sovereign ...\nShip a we know you're going to do really well ah and we know that uh you will be a force for law and order less government a smart fiscal policy deregulatory efforts where we need to deregulate and we can\nNever let Texas ever let Texas go blue\nBecause Texas just like Florida I'm Talking about this Andrew Gillum isn't here isn't here isn't he has a story to tell jokes ah but yeah we were both states are critical I mean all states are important but the the left has taken over California and we see what the result\nCannot let that happen cannot let this happen on Texas or Florida\nThat's absolutely right as Texas goes so goes who goes America ... right in Florida for the buck better state it and it really I Need to get that election rock right and I'm quite sure hook will they will but also said this I Can't thank you for having Christian Vargas on your show the other night uh on on Fox\nAnd for being a champion for that family oh what a wonderful family who obviously lost a crust allows her nephew I'm already Vargas lost her son Jared ... in June they live ah in around my desk or it's on the oil but working harder than ever happen\nThere that's a great family and a thank you for highlighting that in just standing up and will of the arc or to say that they weren't married me strong border security and the rule of law being reestablished on a ...\nAnd they said the Vargas family told us that you were really the the one politician who came out and really gave them support they heard nothing\nUh from the Castro brothers zippo from them including walking Castro who's a congressman from that district her nothing from so chip thank you so much I Know you're going to do fantastically well and we can't wait to interview and you become a the next congressman from the twenty first district of Texas so we've come on come on the show after your when\nI'd be delighted to I really appreciate everything you do and we can commiserate I'm also in her ...\nAh\nBut I Know you went to law school there so we can we could talk about our great Charlottesville is\nBut I alright well who are you All right we're going to take a break on the lower income show a lot more to get to a caring housing up next\nIt's your last week to get the Gen you sell sunspot correct or for free for sunspots age thoughts and even read inflame passions Renee from Boulder, Colorado raving about the brand new Gen yourself sunspot director she said the ... go to product every day she had sun spots in eight spots can definitely see a difference in her skin since using it\nThat the Democrat is up I'm about six percent and I think that it's within striking distance no doubt about it a car and it's good to have you with us how are things going on the trail\nI it's gone just great Laura thank you so much for having me and yeah we have closed the gap in the polls\nThat when you're speaking out was done by our our Minneapolis Star Tribune which we sometimes called the red star a and that one had the damage it fixed and then the one before that and other Democrats have down three so it is going really well we are getting throughout the state and meeting ... folks and that had a big debate the other night at our\nOnly state wide televised debate and my opponent I chose not to show up the\nOnly Democrat who didn't show up for the debate\nWell how how would that be even possible I mean the Democrats have made some fairly significant headway in in a\nBoth the Senate seat since Norm Coleman and uh since uh you know we've lost the governorship plenty and then\nHe tried to run again and he he got a defeated obviously I'm In his bid for the Senate\nAh but where where are we now\nI'm In his bid for the Senate ah but where where are we now and trying to and trying to rebuild the Republican Party in that state Minnesota economy has been doing so well and the Trump era of just two years we've seen a massive ah uptick\nIn the states productivity this is all positive why would people want to vote against them now\n[noise] well they don't out we have on or Minnesota is turning Red Cross the whole state people are feeling it they're happy with the way the economy is going and I think ... that didn't show up with a debate the other night because she didn't have any answer to this and where she stands on the issue she's so far\nLeft and so extreme and and part of that resistance and obstructing everything good that is happening on the ground\nA and then she's also a for open borders and she wants Minnesota to be a sanctuary state and she is directly tied to Keith Ellison still continuing to campaign with him\nYet uh being hypocritical as as they are she's again you know wanting to impeach uh Brett Kavanaugh justice cabin on called for another investigation so\nMinnesotans are are some of the most well educated people when they go to the polls we don't have to register Democrat or Republican were free to move without the cattle when we go vote and they do their research and and that we have some of the ... we have the highest turn out\nIn the country when it comes to voting and so we go educated so it was really disappointing that Tina Smith did want to debate may or at least tell the people of Minnesota where she stands on things because she knows that's not what's resonating on the ground\nWell a Speaker Ryan Paul Ryan was in Minnesota uh yesterday and warned or the day before yesterday was warning of a\nGreen wave of democratic fund raising in a visit to drum up support for uh some of the house candidates Erik Paulsen and Jason Lewis and there are there are two of them more vulnerable in our house candidates on But Ryan says there's an enormous amount of Democrat money's flooding the state\nOf last week Gabby Giffords came and did a a star turn there for some of the Democratic congressional candidates are and they they believe that if they can fully turn Minnesota blue then that will be another blockade for a Trump and twenty twenty\n[noise] uh and and it's not happening I'm not feeling it anywhere even in the primary what happened to your ... so we go for it happened we could have told you what was going to happen\nOn Minnesota is definitely turning red we flipped our state house in two thousand and fourteen to Republican our state Senate in two thousand and sixteen oh we got up on the iron range which has voted\nDemocrat for more than sixty years is now going to flip the Republican we've got a great candidate up there and he's plus Fifteen\nOr all of the rural areas are farmers are really on board with what the president is doing finally somebody it's fighting for our farmers and putting their issues at the forefront of a campaign so it's all\nAll the the uh of fake media and their rhetoric and talking about the blue wave and it's I'm not feeling it anyway and that's just me not just me as a candidate I really am not when I'm traveling throughout the state there's a lot of energy behind a the president and and even when he came for the two rallies you've already done to rally this cycle here in Minnesota\nThere's a lot of excitement for my campaign and for the rest of the candidates throughout the state\nOur current housley it is a fantastic to have you on a ... everybody needs to get out there and vote because the woman who was appointed Tina Smith\nOr even worse than Al Franken if you can believe that and she you know she uh obviously\nYou know things that she'll be able to just snuck or the Minnesotan voters for more liberal policies in open borders forget it ... the last thing the Minnesotans need our politicians in the state\nOr in a a senators representing the state who believe that they need more regulations on the small business owners and more problems for the medical device manufacturers who have done such a great job\nTo route to reinvigorate the Minnesota economy after the uh the great recession so ... current housley has got to win the seat\nThat would be phenomenal news as we march or even after this election toward twenty twenty I think Donald Trump can win twenty twenty and twenty twenty Minnesota He he he didn't win it last time around but he made a Mitt valiant attempt at the very end to try to pull out a victory a car and thank you so much best of luck\nIn that race or for that Senate seat that was vacated by um the Grover Al Franken\nAll right we'll take a break eight five five forty Laura we have a lot more to get to\nA this Andrew Gillum Rhonda Santas debate tonight is going to be critical of by the way oh by the way there's a story I forgot I was going to mention the current Mexican man admits faking his own kidnapping\nThat kind of mentioned the current Mexican man admits faking his own kidnapping and St Paul Minnesota to gain a visa\nAuthorities say a Mexican immigrant in the United states illegally was bound with duct tape and less near Randolph avenue\nAnd as part of his own kidnapping roost in front of
