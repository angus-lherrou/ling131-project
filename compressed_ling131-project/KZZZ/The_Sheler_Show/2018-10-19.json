numbers this or we figured it scripted you know real writing to us because like construction is going you know home improvement windows dishwashers remodeling kitchens barefoot when we're rolling then you know the economy is really rolling right or is that right\nNow it's a ... I think there are some industry is lagging Steve and um I thank you and appreciate the call I ... and here's the thing that I Would say\nAnd you're right now is the time for the president to back off the the bruise or if you will and start being the the the salesman Trump and selling the great things he's delivered on and that are already underway\nUh we do have great economic news the the industrial output the manufacturing output the the the unemployment but at the same time the there are people like you who aren't feeling the full effects of this and\nNeed to know that the aid he's doing everything he can be the president is not a wizard or a magician he doesn't fix everybody every aspect of every life the only things as I mentioned to pack the can and the two things that that people want from a precedent\nOur security and prosperity\nAnd prosperity is best gained by having an even playing field where you're not owners sleep tax to regulate it out of business and where you can you can grow a business and grow a family that's what the president should be about I think that is what he's about but that's a very limited his powers are limited\nAnd I think the media and everybody else I mean why are we focusing on a journalist that may have been brutalized by Saudi Arabia now I understand he wrote for the post\nUp but\nCan't control Saudi Arabia there are rogue regimes all over the damn world Cuba China North Korea or some of our allies including Saudi Arabia when you get into the middle east it is a crap shoot and let me tell ya they don't they don't you're talking about due process\nThen no due process their due process is well let's see what side do you want to be roasted all well and from my understanding as well\nAs the bedrooms wasn't even a U.S citizen of course he was resigning here but yeah he's our domestic Saudi Arabia in politics problems I Know would be best advised us to those not have any interest in Milwaukee and these are metrics\nYeah well it certainly there that's beyond the president's ah of capabilities and frankly beyond his purview he did what he could and what he did was he sent Mike Pompeo to question them we should be concerned and I have been concerned about four years about human rights religious rights abroad\nWe have to protect those and use the might of America to push these regimes toward greater freedom and liberty for their people but that said we're not we don't have dominion over those countries all you can do suggest push agitate and that's what the president did enough\nEnough but I the ... I can prove it to\nMSNBC and CNN all last night and the night before ran on this or a ... story okay the journalists that may have been mutilated dismembered in a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey okay we've got two problems here turkey and Saudi Arabia\nOkay neither of them have particularly great human rights records in fact they don't\nBut we can only hold them out MSNBC and CNN to live with this for two nights they lost the ratings by double digits Fox had more viewers than both of them combined\nNo one is interested in the short and it doesn't change one American Life and it doesn't affect our policy or presidency in the lead and it'll have no impact on the midterms so to push that narrative\nAnd to drive it to try to hit Trump it's stupid it doesn't work we're going to take a quick break when we return all of your cold what's driving to the polls\nEight five five forty Laura Raymond ... sitting in for lore Ingram we have lots of cultural news to share with you soon\nI'm On Twitter at Raymond Oreo she sat Ingram angle and be sure to watch the anger mangled tonight ten pm eastern live Trump rally from NASA Arizona State Laura Ingraham show\n\nOnly two weeks left to get the Jenny sunspot correct or for free for sunspots age spots and even read inflame patches or any from Boulder, Colorado raving about the brand new Gen yourself sunspot correct her\nShe says it's or go to product every day she had sun spots and some aid spots and can definitely see a difference in her skin since using it love to hear it\nAnd so the next two weeks only you get this sunspot miracle for free but time is running out to try this wonderful special watchers sunspots vanished and your bags and puffy that's diminished and for fast result\nThe Ginia fell immediate effect is also yours for free to go to Jenny fell dot com right now are called eight hundred for eight zero fifty two zero six still thinking order this we can receive chimneys luxury micro generation also free rejuvenate and uncalled ports for instantly radiant baby skin\n... two weeks shipping is also free so called him an eight hundred and forty zero fifty two zero six eight hundred for eight zero fifty two zero six or go to Jim you sell dot com\nAmish\nDiaz Arizona State prison in ... it's now hiring for the following to this and do what they will do for substance abuse counselor and got a job that G.

contrast it with my beloved NYU [noise]\nYou know you won't find Irish college football it rarely saw well you're the fighting Irish and we're the pansies I think they have little violets survive the bobcat so I think they were they had bobcat but all the ... and all the posters that um are you there were all these ... these little violence ... violence so\nWe we drove recently called them the pansies anyway um tell me where we stand in these midterms mad\nOr when you look at the polling data a real clear politics has the the generic ballot Republicans down seven points does that mean anything when we're this close at this late date\nYeah it does a great question um you know basically that air ballot has been as high as fourteen Fifteen points a CNN had a poll\nTen days ago or ... or so that show that that wide so what you're seeing is that in almost all the polling that it's there and that's a that's a common trend that a generic pouch start off very bad for Republicans because there are a lot of big cities and quite frankly they're calling a lot of people who aren't at work which don't tend to be Republicans\nAre and as you get close election they got a better idea of actually in a boat or grab a rabid mid term it's like you know roughly twenty five percent of the vote so determined he actually going to vote is that's\nThe real tricky question\nYup well here's here's the thing I'm there is this other CBS battleground poll that has Democrats up three in the toss up\nDistricts now if you're only up three in the ... district that's within the margin of error and in the Trump total era I I I have to look at that and say this could go anyway this this is yeah I like to call right\nI was in Florida for a speech this week I had a woman about to be in the lobby the hotel I've noticed is clean story don't worry as you said um she said\nHey I I just want you to do I never voted in the mid term I'm so bad about the angry opposite street capping off I'm voting for the first time it it it it ... this is this this is the silent vote are not going to get picked up and all I think it's absolutely a dynamic and that's an Eighteen\nSimilar to how it was it two thousand six teams there's a lot of Democrats who are looking at their own party\nYou know a Gallup poll came out rented that fifty seven percent of Democrats are comfortable with the idea of being a socialist party the Democratic party is shifting becoming much more radicalized and that means that in the swing districts that you're talking about\nThat um you know the the that this whole question about electing socialists people like Ocasio Cortez et cetera uh it's really waking a lot of people up a normal folks in the country just say hey baby out oh\nYeah and I I also think when you see these explosions as we just played from uh NYU last night attacking a of of a statesman like Henry Kissinger he's Ninety five years old\nAnd when you see people yeah quite mental that's what I thought you were going to tell me about the woman who came up to you in Florida matter I thought she was accused of being a war criminal um you know when you see that kind of crazy explosive behavior toward people\nA that's a big journals in middle America and really anywhere in America I think I think it's a huge turnout tell me about the Trump effect he\nIs he is dumping all over the country including in Arizona tonight we're going to be covering that live at ten pm on Fox um\nWhat is the Trump effect has he nationalized what was a local race a few weeks ago\nWell first of all its historic better president would stand by a nominee like Kavanaugh end its historic that our president\nWould basically go all over the country just aggressively in a nonstop fashion to campaign for all these candidates and I do agree with you I think it's nationalize that they can they ...\nEverything is about Trump even if they try to make it about truck he's too big of a personality he's too big of a player in our politics so yes it's about chocolate Republicans run from it because they don't like a portion of what he does or baking the state\nOf voters that difference that Donald Trump is a one of a kind of guy they don't think that every Republican his truck they know how Trump is and I don't know why some of these Republicans have so much trouble just be yourself be who you are\nAnd promotes chaos that was at the heart of what he ran on so this cuts\nI think uh his weight as these midterms heat up and they get they are very close now most of the polling still shows democratic victory in the house but there is a path\nFor the Republicans to hold the house it would be extraordinary very rare for president after his first you know middle of his first term they usually lose seats it just the natural political pendulum but\nTrump has beaten expectations in the past David South Carolina he wanted to say well\nFor reasons I'm voting Republican Maxine Waters Pelosi Feinstein and Schumer I'm a registered Democrat and let me tell you I've never been more embarrassed for the hatred that comes out of their mouths\nAnd I'm not alone down here in South Carolina there are a lot of people because of those poor people and the vitriol that comes out of their mouths were voting for Republican down here\n[laughter]\nFascinating thank you David that's that's insightful and I'm going to be down in Texas in Houston on Monday with a camera crew for Fox and um we're going to be chronicling what people there are saying\nAbout these midterm elections I think there are there are veins running through this election that uh I think the the polling is not picking up on and certainly\nThe people reporting news have no concept of I live in New Orleans I sit and coffee houses I go to lunch spots and let me tell you that is a swath of America\n... where in New Orleans we're kinda shoulder to shoulder with everybody we don't have these lily white enclaves or old black enclaves they're all Hispanic enclaves like I'd found in northern Virginia when we lived here frankly\nYou're there are parts of places you you you know I I ... you could go and never see a black person\nNever see Hispanic face in some of these restaurants that it it ... northern Virginia for whatever reason it carbs up that way\nIt it it's a very wealthy place and people are very divided live separate lives not in New Orleans we are side by side we share a music we share food we enjoy each other's company would drink together we have fun together Mardi Gras together um\nAnd you hear a lot when you were in places like that because the voices you're hearing on all sides are not your own not an echo chamber and let me tell you\nI think there's a lot of disgruntled men out there with you\nYou hear a lot when you were in places like that because the voices you're hearing on all sides are not your own not an echo chamber and let me tell you I think there's a lot of disgruntlement out there with not only the mob stuff but the tone\nAnd the lack of results from Democrats Democrats should have it seems to me come up with a governing\nAgenda I don't know why they didn't take Newt Gingrich's playbook and run with it they should have had their own contract with America saying look the Trump years we can't stand what he's doing but we're going to do X Y and Z they didn't do that they have no what are you going to do you're going to run against joblessness\nYou're gonna run against high wages you're going to run against hide benefits business is growing small businesses regulations coming all what are you going to do well I'll tell you what Kamala Harris was announcing a five hundred dollar tax credit\nShe called Trump's fever\nSo when Democrats are coming around through your way of thinking even though they tried to dress it up you once you've won and that's why I think Trump is nationalizing this election and trying to keep his agenda and his voice at the center of cherry Alabama does that work for you and what are you focus on\nDuring these midterms exactly exactly right I think the Democrats not look like they're evil\nYou look at what it again I Can't do a great read capping off a judge Kavanaugh report what because you know what kind of ... that they\n... who wrote in that group and we can go back that say for a while and it [laughter]\nOh we lost you there I think we're losing your there Terry but I got a point and I think you know\nTo to to too many\nThe Supreme Court has become the holy of Hillary's you just almost a high church too to some on the left\nWhere they see that as the ultimate instrument of control and social change\nAnd deprived of it they feel that somehow lost something this era treatable so this was a major blow even though\nA Brett Kavanaugh is a down the middle of the road straight down the middle jurists she's not a radical he's not he's not\nThe next battle is going to beat the battle royale you want to see blood on the floor come to Washington for the next round of confirmation hearings when Ruth Bader Ginsburg gives a perceived\nAnd Trump appoints maybe a woman a conservative woman to that seat or more a rich restrictive jurists one who reads the law and interpret it appropriately and doesn't make it up\nIf you get a let's say Amy Coney Barrett\nGod help us all I'm leaving I'm going back to New Orleans I mean it it it it will be what we saw from Kavanaugh will be a cheap warm up but what a weight that nominee\nThanks for the call Terry or we're gonna take it very quick break we'll be back in moments floor Ingram show continues what are you focused on this mid term and and\nJust do these mob tactics started all you\nHave they changed the way you've looked at politics
