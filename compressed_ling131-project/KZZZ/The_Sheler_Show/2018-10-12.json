influence or now you and I may not be listening to ... but their millions of people who are and the young African American men who were watching him\nAnd that is in part\nIt legitimize Donald Trump among that community and there are some in the political class that find that offensive\nThat Kanye West would do this and that this phenomena is happening this is why Donald Trump in that recent Rasmussen poll was it thirty six percent and my bet if I had to do so today is that that's only going to go up thank you ready for the call or let's go to Gerald in Florida I Know you've been holding Gerald you wanted to say\nThank you for having me I I Am a patriotic American assertive will turn off my country and I know Kanye West as an American he loves his country I respect that\nI may not be

it I\nKnow the machinations of the human side being in Washington on Capitol Hill at lobbyists offices watching how the sausages made with legislation it's ugly so I don't have blinders on when I talk about politics but\nI sometimes think my friends and I had friends in Hollywood writers and directors and producers and actors and singers\nI think they flip through a newspaper or read a magazine article and because they knew some politicos assume they have insider knowledge or understanding that includes the audience I Would argue they don't\nAnd sometimes there because they have a louder and larger platform their voices are heard more than others and that can obscure reality for them and for the people listening to them so with Kanye West here's what I say take it with a grain of easy salt\nListen watch it it was quite a show yesterday I got to say but I don't think no matter what you think of Kanye West I don't think it was an assault on the White House he sat at the resolute desk

Don lemons point CNN was running the event live to just like everybody else they were desperate for every moment they were not going to miss Kanye West meeting with Donald Trump\nIt was a big moment it was a big moment\nSo to say take the cameras away spare me okay then you you go back to talking about you know the trade surplus in Indonesia on CNN International and we'll watch ratings continue to crater lower than they are no\nBut I you know I see I Want more cameras I Want to see more I Want to see the other side of crazy I Want to see the cameras on Capitol Hill and the lobbyists shaping our our our every bill and pushing legislation that the American people don't want let's see that\nYou want to public service let's show that crazy\nSee we ... we hype but we also hyper focus I think all things like this this is important to the African American vote as a bloc it's very important because a major influential a agent of influence in the middle of that community\nHas decided to come out and say you know what I think differently from what I'm supposed to think\nI'm gonna right outside the lines here and that is dangerous tall\nDangerous jobs but the needed was something else there was a cultural critique about something happening in the black community about father listening about what it means to be a man and not only in the black community in the wider community as well thank you for that call um I Know I wanted to talk to catch in Kansas my cat you're in the mid west\nOr the Roseanne show was originally designed to appeal to people like you and that is where the heart of the viewership for that show came from and I think returned when it re booted some of the highest ratings of last year without Roseanne will you watch the Connors and why not\nFor now I Will not I I Can't say that daughter\nWell I Will not I I Can't say that daughter ours all I'd like John Goodman and I don't mind her sister that I without ... she was the center of the whole show with Walter that show is walking\nAnd I felt bad for jobs that no just stand there I feel like he's got all of a old lives up there are I I Will watch it basically because of how they get Roseanne and they I don't I Can't stand ... bought our first\n[laughter] well I think you know John Goodman in in um\nInterview said you know I think my character is going to spend most of the season moping around or you know feeling sorry because he lost his wife and I think that's probably right\nThat look there's no reason for the show to go on without Roseanne that's the reality\nThe only reason is ABC was already out of pocket so they were either going to do some show with these people or they were just going to be right paychecks for these folks to go off and have a vacation but they were on the hook so that's why the Conner says going forward but\nIs it going to die you bet I think it'll be canceled after a few shows\nThat's my production will see thank your cat for the call mark Florida you wanted to say what then we'll go to a breaking among\n[noise] yeah right I mean if you recall back er during Katrina Conway kind of in West spoke out against trial or I'm Sorry can so shy and that he had a ... black people\nAnd now it's just amazing a ... million out that he's a a for crop all of a sudden our mental illness and also the believable\nNo no well this is the again that because as as one of the caller said earlier it's almost like stromboli and input okay ill when the puppet is doing what you wanted to do yes yes this is great when the puppet cuts the strings then it's a problem\nLook I ... and this is why I'm not saying Kanye West is you know a a ... there's he's not Lincoln here let's not get ahead of ourselves\nI think there are people on the right who want to suddenly crown Kanye West is the leader of you know African Americans in in Republican circles well look to somebody like Clarence Thomas or a you know Walter Williams was somebody who really has a\nFull flashed philosophy\nOn politics and race that is informed impassioned and thoughtful I think that's where you look for that kind of leadership so let's not get ahead of our skis here an annoying Kanye West is somehow the you know sum total of a black conservative thought\nAt the same time he shouldn't be ridiculed now for saying something that the media considers crazier outlandish because he's going to meet with Donald Trump", "show_name": "The Sheler Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "12"}
