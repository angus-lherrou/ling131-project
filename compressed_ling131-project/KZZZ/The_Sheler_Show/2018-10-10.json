cannot be complacent because the left is banking on your complacency\nHow many of you've already voted early voting is starting already how many of you've already voted or plan to vote early I don't like like voting on election I don't like early voting is is is is designed to help the left because they're more lazy and they don't want to go to the poll\nWell but but think about this if tomorrow something today something ruin this happens where I don't know uh your candidate opens fire into a crowd or at a baseball game\nYou have no way of turning your vote that you can't reclaim your vote I think you vote up until the election that you vote on election day so you have all the data not this early but I Know people who they vote the a month before the election two months it's

tonight\nI'm hungry that's the gray gray is out there right at five five forty whatever anytime James very quickly I Can't hear you saying\nThat right then and a five five forty Laura are coming up congressman Jim Jordan I bet he wants to document redacted or to do new things don't go away\n\n\nYou guys heard me talk about a product for months that has changed my sleeping habits for ever it's called my pillow guys I used to wake up with a sore head I often have one of those critics in my neck you know it's like you can't turn your head when when your neck hurts forget about it I don't have\nAny more I didn't believe that my pillow was going to be so great until I tried it and guess what I\n... um I mean I unlike you I Love Senator Grassley a and you know he's\nBeen on this whole Russian if the court to you but that was funny just to\nKeep it at one that's ... that's the goal which I like when he was upset it's like one level it was like me [laughter]\nI Love him he did a fantastic job when I talk about it now I I've always really liked it All right congressman what is going on that we had\nYou had a truck flying with all Rosenstein or the other day down to where the heck with this line of Florida yeah and I saw a rod at the White House at the cabinet thing and I said what do you think of some pick the dust on the president what did you know he's on some of your best friends what what what the theory there congressman\nUh I I don't know but I don't know the facts as a fat and then you have to give it in the case that most that we subpoenaed\nThere are all these stories out earlier this week that talk about how serious they took the alleged comments Mr Rosenstein made about actually recording the present in the oval office wearing a wire or tape recording in whatever they are a phone recording wherever they want to do\nUm and the fact that it now looks like Mr ... not going to show up tomorrow so we don't do that for sure but we're starting to get rumors that he's not\nOr if it's not going to show up tomorrow so we don't do that for sure if it were starting to hear rumors that he's not coming to talk to Congress like he was supposed to uh tomorrow or in I'm In the Judiciary Committee so\nI think that because he has a good relationship with the president now he doesn't have to\n... well maybe maybe or maybe it has something to do with the stories that were written that said you know what you said if you are or is that the stories that said he said just in case and this page and then went and talked to Mr Baker so\nA book will or will hopefully he'll hopefully he'll take change his mind that will be there tomorrow so we can asking the questions that I think American people deserve to have the answers to\nCongressman Jordan explain James Baker the uh the man who is the attorney at the FBI and why\nHis involvement in all of this and his contacts are so important to the narrative of how this whole Russian investigation was started\n'cause he's the chief counsel when you're the chief counsel the FBI and you're the guy in the middle of the two biggest investigations run by all these key players struck page and they have called me a\nThat is important and when it's now now being recorded that uh he was he talked to both McCain and paid shortly after this meeting took place with Mr Rosenstein now and that he understood it to be a serious comment made in that meeting that's why we need to talk to Mr Rosenstein I never forget the fundamental fast\nWhen have you ever seen this happen at any federal agency James Comey fire director former direct FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe light three times under oath fire Jim Baker chief counsel first demoted then left the FBI we used to page FBI council demoted that left and of course Peter ...\nThe counter intelligence devoted than fire top people the FBI demoted or fired all the people who ran the Clinton investigation and then now as we know launched and ran the Russia investigation until the ...\nName Mr Mahler to take that investigation over her back why this is important that's on the road that needs to be in front of us so we can ask you questions about all that\nYeah he's not going to shop there's no way I don't think I asked my for either no no he's he's not he's not going to come I I just\nI felt like I say I don't understand why that he they claimed it was a joke and maybe I just don't have the sense of humor I really thought I had but I don't think that was all that funny like I'm going to wire myself we get wired go and take the president and then get the twenty Fifth Amendment going I don't understand why is that funny\nI agree with you I agree with you completely Laura you shouldn't be joking about it about matters like that in front of supporting it mean that is that this was the guy who in effect is running the Justice Department and whether it's sarcasm or joke or what it should not be set\nUp particularly remember the time that this was done this was when the whole stinking town was all spun out this is between may ninth twenty Seventeen and may seventeenth twenty Seventeen may ninth as a date Rosenstein writes the memo that the president uses to fire calling me may seventeenth is when Rosenstein names\nAre lower as the special counsel sometime in between her and it looks like it happened on may sixteenth is one this alleged conversation took place so even joking about something in that timeframe when that whole city was all spun up about all the special counsel and obstruction of justice and all those issues that all the more reason why you should not be saying something even if it was a joke\nAnd\nAgain the the main question that is on the table I think 'cause her mother's gonna do among there's going to do but the main question on the table is why did you serve email an American citizen\nBased on information you received from and paid for from the opponent of Donald Trump ... now you can you can start surveilling someone because they traveled to Russia and\nSaid hello to a a government official at some point and years ago you he was questioned and Carter Page where where does he go to get you know his reputation back and where does he go to get here legal fees paid I mean he just twist into in for years\nNow I'm a I'm a ... it's good you brought that up because we sometimes it's important is that go back to the basics the Clinton campaign the DNC paid Perkins carried off or who paid fusion GPS who hired a foreigner\nTo go talk to Russians and put together a document that was completely false totally bogus totally uncle operated in that document became the basis we're going to a secret court to get a warrant to spy on Mr page because he was associated with the other party can paint\nThat is what happens here and ... and they used the press\nTo get all kinds of information flooding the FBI so so fusion GPS is knowing what works for them she get information to her husband's in front of it to the FBI so she gives information to resort shop Justice Department official so you've got all these sources sending the lie\nTo the FBI which gives it more credibility I always say the more people talking about the live either allies to believe and that's exactly what took place you are but it's still a lie\nAnd they use that to go spy on the other campaign it's\nYou're wrong and um what's your what's your sense about um the mid term elections I mean do you think", "show_name": "The Sheler Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Bullhead
