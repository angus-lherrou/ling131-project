the Democrats who have worked to discredit and this is their lighted tall I close to the election to to try to get the\nYeah I went to I I I think there's that is the same possible that's why this piece this morning and thank you very much Janice for the call 'em you know we've got the situation MSNBC has been Collins a suggestion that the mail bomb suspect reads the Drudge Report and Fox News Sunday about one of the earlier callers which was hinting at\nWhich is sort of these false flag operations I I'm Sorry I'm not going to call\nMe step back I don't mean that in what I mean is that you have Democrats who will\nPerpetrate these kinds of crimes as a way of raising the stink you know I'm a there was a a feminist activists\nIn Wyoming or who had claimed that she was being threatened to turn that she was sending threatening emails to herself or the same thing happened just recently was another democratic activist a on a college campus or you know at this issue of folks who who claimed to put up I'm the founder of anti Semitic graffiti\nBefore [noise] so that's why I tend to discount of the things I Love to go to a let's go to Mike in Texas Mike welcome to the war in from show\nThank you a question that should be at the one that we heard many times over and it got five weeks ago I liberal under our during the cabin on hearing that why who credited on how to work or couldn't possibly\nI testify against have it so I Would act even though I disagree with that on it completely that going back to their own ... who benefits from the delivery of the ...\nAre you anti Trump people of course it's the lack of course it is and I agree with the last caller there was never any attempt to hurt anybody ... it was obviously a question has to be asked\nIf it's a lot and it's a lot in question in ... in in in the law cui bono who who who to whom is there a benefit to this and I think you are you are correct in that regard I mean this is the again if it fits in with ... razor here\nI'm In a you know the the simplest explanation is usually the correct one and I know I I've said that a couple of different times but I Want to make sure that a hammer that point home sort of we talk about these things um but that's also why I I Do think that we cannot discounts\nWe cannot discount or that the Russians might be involved here in some way shape or form such as you want to have this conversation uh yesterday with a a Russia expert who would you tell me he did not think\nDid not think that the FSB the Russian foreign intelligence service was involved in this he did nevertheless say but on the other hand there's strong evidence to indicate\nThat those are not yet and it's you know the cameraman and his brother up in your car up in Boston that they may very well have been trained than influenced by the Russians\nThat they are all sorts of weird things that were going on with their radicalization and and that the way that they built this they're bomb the pressure cooker bomb is not something that would have been readily available on the Internet and so that that I found fascinating there is a real benefit\nA real benefit a continuing benefit to a lot of foreign powers or by this continued a discontent in a in the United states affect somebody tweeted it I don't have it in front of me you know or that the Russians would very much like Democrats in power that's true to an extent\nBut the what the Russians really watch is they want chaos or my thank you very much for the call was when we come back\nOut because I Do want to talk a little bit about the primaries in a couple of folks of Aspen to talk about the caravan and the chairman situation we are going to talk about that in the last hour the show are going to be joined by Steve Cortez because it it all fits into what's going on here\nAbout we're going to be joined by state representative Katie Arrington uh she's from South Carolina she's running in the south Carolina's first congressional district I Want to talk a little bit about what I call the fly over effect\nOr how we cannot discount what is happening on the ground in these states in a whole host of areas\nAre and so she was going to be joining us we're going to be talking about the mid term elections when are we talking about what she is seeing and hearing on the ground there but in the meantime you can get you didn't it's we I mean at Andrew underscores anger on Twitter you can call in eight five five forty Laura I'm Andrew ... sitting in for Ingram here on the lower income show\n\n\nAre you worried your identity could be held hostage you should be because ransomware does exactly that loses Tom Kelly studio of my id care making every American safer from the effect of R D served as a tall order but that's my goal so here's a tip the best thing you can do to help protect yourself from ransomware the tobacco up your computer often\nAnd and live with and we got this uh on on the Twitter line here I'm at Andrew underscore linger on Twitter from an imaginary Adam on Twitter Avi only bombs we should be talking about is the caravan Bob here's here's one reality right\nAnd again the the thing that makes America great one of the things that make makes America exceptional is it anybody can come here legally and become an American it is the beauty of who we are as a nation that being said\nBorder security is an essential aspect of sovereignty if you don't protect your borders you lose the Stanley McChrystal General Stanley McChrystal not some\nDoes your constituents get that why is it that but what does your polling about this I won't get away our power how would the Democrats and it's just ridiculous\nSo my opponent Joe Cunningham route the mayor of Los Angeles are SETI\nHere to campaign wow who I Need to go any further\nYour what you really don't I mean that that seems like you know it it's one of those things I I often talk about you know when you do public speaking you have to know who your audience is I Can't imagine that a guard said he from LA played well in the first congressional district of South Carolina\nIt's just that because it let's be brutally honest with everybody on on the right yeah Democrats don't have a platform this year\nNot to say in the past Democrats haven't had something good but they don't have anything to talk about we should be focusing on the fact that we had the ... economy we have had in generation ... the lowest them climate\nAnd Burr and if people don't see that they I I just can't put my arms around it but I Believe that Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters are toxic to this country\nThey are toxic air all about the rhetoric is all about the negativity they embody the exact opposite of what an American should be\nShould stand proud and strong to gather as a country\nMy ... my dose of South Carolina state representative Katie Arrington choose the Republican candidate for Congress from the first congressional district on and on that point you know nobody will it's obviously off the front pages today\nBut this was we got a the the third quarter GDP a measurements today we knew we were going to be getting those obviously nobody is talking about them because of um ah ah because of the other things that are in the news is fake bombs story\nA and and we now have a a GPA of three point five percent of the third quarter\nA President Obama when he was an officer we were never going to the GDP above two percent of the Trump economy is turning that around obviously this is very important to other folks you're talking to the leaders in terms of jobs and more money in their pockets\nAre how are they on the sort of the Trump tax and regulatory agenda what are the same to you about that\nA lot more money in our pockets of Trump you know tax agenda is positive it's up to Congress to get tax judo path we need to ensure that small businesses and the middle class\nGet permanent tax relief absolutely paramount we have to do that that is that's going to be a huge focused on going in that fashion but other than that when you know we're looking at the regulatory you know I have some big manufacturers in my area of Boeing being one of them shore and they just four hundred new people [noise]\nThe terrorists no one likes that terrorists no one likes the terrorists\nBut President Trump is standing firm and putting America First and that it's imperative we need to remember that this is the the world's best negotiator let them and do his job\nYou don't regulate it get no no go ahead go ahead please reduce organizations\nAnd the thing ... to let businesses thrive is what we need to do I mean we do from in the fundamental belief and I'll get Senator Tom Davis and the state of South Carolina credit because he told it to me and it's been part of my ... a\nDemocrat fundamentally believe government is to set up problem and Republican believe government is the problem and that is what Trump is doing the government's the problem is getting rid of it finally with Congress working with him on that and we have to keep the momentum going at paramount as my ... like far\nAs my colleague at the Competitive Enterprise Institute Wayne proves says you don't have to teach the grass how to grow you just have to remove Ron marijuana and and he's already been ... that sort of my one of my other barely works is is the is this issue of regulations\nBut but you know it's interesting because you talk about this issue of negotiation and and and Trump [noise]\nUm I I have a I had formulated a theory on what I call Trump's rules of acquisition I'm a star trek Duke uh this is a for a new thing for a new rules that acquisition and rule number one is always be willing to walk away from the table\nRight rule number two is sometimes in order to demonstrate your opponent\nThat you're willing to walk away from the table you have to walk away from the table and will number three is don't pre negotiate with yourself I mean this is this is the great folly of a of a you know democratic negotiators trade negotiators over the years\nIs that they've always pretty negotiated and eventually inevitably sold out American interests\nAnd so we are you understand probably Boeing is unhappy about a tariff on let's say aluminum or steal or what have you but nevertheless it is and negotiating tactic to take the strongest position don't you think\nOh absolutely and we need to remind ourselves that that you know I look at what we're going through right now it's like a child getting inoculated we know they're going to have a fever for a day\nIt's like a child getting inoculated we know they're going to have a fever for a day is going to be a little bit cranky for a minute they're going to live a lifetime and never get sick\nWe have to prepare ourselves I mean this is it it it really is\nOur country group we are the greatest nation on this planet because of hard work severe and and the guts to stand tall and we need to do that right now China is not our friend they're never going to be our friends that you know that we have a president is going to stand tall against\nThem I just you know I was gonna ask you about about how your constituencies are looking at this this foreign policy but I really want to focus more on substance here\nI mean what about what is your what does your sort of your opponents response when when he talked about I mean he literally I'm assuming he's you know for the rest of the Democratic playbook which is to undo all of the great games here what how does he proposed to housing opposed to the death the economy jump started\nOn it not that smart [laughter]\nThe only thing he's running it on the only thing he runs on is watching it and he says I'm for offshore drilling in South Carolina well yeah no one is 'cause there's no oil out there [laughter]\nOnly thing he\nHe is running on a platform I'm going to stop offshore drilling from South Carolina wow and I said yeah and well number one he doesn't understand the job of Congress that's not their job that the president ...\nBut that aside and then he comes out what he's the only one who's had bipartisan experience well the only thing he has experience in doing is lying to some people without offshore oil getting them to endorse him otherwise there is no platform\nHe has nothing I get dated him\nIt was it ever get to a point in your

care for over ... stamp\nShore show\nFor the fact that they're not canceled there's not that unusual\nWell let me ask you this and ... and we were running short on time here but real quick so it without it being cancelled how would they be able to track them back from New York to Florida\n[noise] [noise] well I think that's probably a they're basing it on the fact that one of them was mailed and then ended up with a ... being returned to Florida I'm I'm I'm not exactly sure how they got FBI's a lot more clever than I Will say\nWell this was on some of those I appreciate that that is that

taking your car for an oil change in your mechanic find something wrong and surprised you're here with a huge repair bill and what happens when you're not covered by the manufacturers warranty\nYou're paying out of pocket to fix it that's why I recommend extended vehicle service protection from my friends that car shield if your car has five thousand to one hundred and fifty thousand miles car she'll can save you from paying for high repair bills replacing your engine or even a simple sensor can cost thousands\nBut if you're not from a continuous country shore in Central America that's not the case it's a crazy loophole that needs to be fixed um but in the meantime what can we do then to repatriate them if they actually do get across a through executive order I think that that makes a lot of sense to effectively make it an extension of the travel ban but I think and here's the bigger point I don't want to have that confrontation\nLess incentivized Mexico and find somebody else may ... threatened Mexico to take care of this problem because they should for two on Mexico has not been acting\nLook Mexico's a friend and ally but they're not acting like it on this issue and they had gladly pass the buck and allowed in facilitated these care of it has to go north and become our problem well they've got to do their part\nWell this is part of it we have leverage on them particularly a trade\nThen what happened I'm Sorry no no but this is what's happening in Europe I mean let's not forget that a lot of our friends in Europe are struggling to sort of the same issues of mass migration and you have a situation in which you'll have migrants refugees\nPart of it we have leverage on them particularly a trade\nAs what happened I'm Sorry no no but this is what's happening in Europe I mean let's not forget that a lot of our friends and Europe are struggling to sort of the same issues of mass migration\nAnd you have a situation in which you'll have migrants refugees from the middle east coming in arriving in Greece and they will be facilitated in crossing certain countries so that those countries can get them out of their their ... ... it's interesting you talk about this\nHe talking about the issues of national security\nAnd I've been down to the southern border and I urge anybody in every one if you've never been down to the border go down to the border in in uh in Arizona and California\nAnd watch you know there's high winds that the travel right along the border I Want to say five five I don't remember I Know in San Francisco's north south I think it's I tend to just say ten goes right along the border there\nAnd I've watched people cross the border they scary prospect even if people are not coming you know into commit harm but the idea that something like I said we walk across this patch of land and and my great that that is a frightening prospect to me then I'm thinking as he was ...\nOf course and by the way you know people want to make us seem like we're a phobic\nA you know paranoid people because we talk about uh the the danger of a lawless for of course border here's the reality the president was far off by the way when he said that you know there could be middle Easterners or for example we have no idea it was causing here's what we do know\nAnd this is a conspiracy theory nonsense citizen from some far right a website the Laredo station of the border patrol tells us that this year they have already arrested six hundred Bangladeshis are crossing illegally not why do I mentioned that because obviously Mexico's a very long way from what I'm saying that that also happens to be a country that has a\nReal problem with Islamic terrorists so there are reasons for us to to fully that anyone coming here from Bangladesh you know even coming legally but the fact that they're coming illegally through Mexico I think is very I\nSure and tells us you know that that we don't know who's kind would be caught six hundred comedy had we not caught um so it doesn't make sense for economic security it doesn't make sense for our national security it's not fair\nTo legal immigrants there are just so many reasons why we have to stop it and I think we need to get Mexico\nTo do their part we need to use trade as the leverage and say we're going to start trade restrictions and by the way it it that doesn't work if it comes to it we will seal the border there will be no trade from Mexico I Hope you don't have to get better ... but I think that option has to at least be on the table so that we don't have the crisis of them actually\nCrossing the border walking across as happens too often as you mentioned\nAnd by the way the interstate and I was looking for the interstate eight hours south of interstate panic goes right along the border in Arizona and California and my guest is Steve Cortez and we're talking about this it it's funny because I I come back to you something to think about the phobia and I I Want to also make it very clear I've said this a little bit earlier on on the show\nBut the one of the one of the great things about America the thing that makes America the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth\nIs affected anybody can come to America and become an American right that that is that is in a central element of who we are it's a wonderful thing it's something you can't find anywhere else so you go just about anywhere you go in the world but I can move to France today\nI could live in ... in France for another Thirty years I Will never be considered French Japan in the same thing Korea the same thing\nBut anybody can come to America and and become an American it's the beauty of who we are we're just saying that you have to do it within the process you have to do it legally you and you cannot expect is you're going to come up here on moss and and do something about it so the president's talking about deploying troops down to the southern border\nUm there is a lot of discussion as to whether or not this violates posse ... I don't believe that it does having read the various statutes that are out there where do you come down on this\nRight now I don't think so because it's it's a clear danger to our orders external danger so you know I don't think it done by the way I'm so glad you made that point two of you know look the mainstream media you played that Joe Scarborough and he was just\nRidiculous morning yes totally insulting to America trying to make us a racial issue they often do that by the way when they don't want to talk policy what are they do they just call this race of course and and tried to dismiss us but here's here's the reality ah America's not a race or you know as you point out right and if you believe in our values and our constitution\nAnd if you're going to bring work ethic and skills that we need a than we want you to become a legal immigrant and you're so like the second you are you're an American no questions asked that doesn't happen in the rest of the world oh so this is not about race remotely a it is about citizenship\nAnd it is about borders and it's largely by the way I pointed out to the Joe Scarborough is largely about protecting\nAmerican citizens many of whom happened to be minorities a black and Hispanic American I Believe sucker more than anyone from tolerating illegal immigration\nA why because many of them are working class people who have to compete in the labor market\nAgainst illegal immigrant labor so it actually harms black and brown Americans perhaps the most of all to tolerate porous borders\nAnd brown Americans perhaps the most of all to tolerate porous border\nYou know my my my my colleague seat motley less government dot dot org has talked to a great deal about that issue about sort of the economics of this as well in the end for me it comes down to issues of national security it comes down to issues of sovereignty\nIf we don't control who is migrating here on them in any nation any nation that doesn't control who's coming in is pretty soon finds itself without a nation and we certainly don't want that seat court says how do we find out more about what you were up to\nYou know I'm On CNN most nights beyond their anger that tonight and on Twitter ... courts as the C O R G E S C\nI Will listen I appreciate that will put up points on the underlying or show page I'm sure we have one more anger in pitch thank you so much for joining us today\nThanks for having me it was and it's interesting to see was talking about the issues of of people of color in America\nA and one of the things that I wanted to get to today I really get a chance to get to was this issue of\nUh the president speaking tonight at a gathering of conservative African Americans are they're going to be posted at the White House today and then they're doing the gala event tonight here in Washington DC uh you know president is really doing what he can because\nRight it's funny or the American dream is about everybody\nIt is about every but it's about bringing everybody in and the only way you can do that is by creating the conditions whereby everybody can succeed\nWe've talked about this about sort of good economic news today uh the the we have the GDP out a GDP is that a third quarter GDP a three point five percent of of a\nTenth of a percentage point above aware of what the expected that as a immeasurably good news and yet and yet we're not talking about this by the way I Am taking your tweets and to get them as as I said I Do read the critical tweets here\nKevin tweets and Andrew playing something ah every two seconds of when I get excited to fix up eight when I get excited I I tend to speak over myself and I get a little closer to my speech be when I'm looking at breaking news on the TV sometimes I get a little distracted by that so I Do apologize\nSometimes I Do try to work very hard on my on my verbal textbook Kevin thank you so very much for listening so intimately does that\n[noise] ah Patty writes in on Twitter by the way you can tweet at me at angel underscores anger\nPatty writes I found you a good job filling in for Laura we need evidence confirmed is this is a liberal sending bombs I must be what idiot we keep sending the bombs with so much attention didn't Brennan have\nRice them come from something um I got to go back and look about I don't remember a friend and got it I Know a bunch of conservatives did certainly it was to folks at the Pentagon a Bible certainly double check on that\nWe got a couple of more minutes here on the show\nBefore recalls out for the day I'll continue to take your tweets\nAt Andrew underscore Langer continue to take your phone calls eight five five forty ... is the number eight five five four zero L.
