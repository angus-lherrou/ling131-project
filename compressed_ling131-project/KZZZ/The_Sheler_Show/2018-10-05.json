Anthony List\nAnd ginger ... Republican National committee one of Georgia and so we get a nice sampling of ladies from across the fruit to play like you all for being your capital to start with you your reaction to this what are you hearing and is this turning women off watching this play out\nWomen are very engaged conservative women are very engaged women are outraged by this whole notion that believe lemon and a woman could accuse any man and their sexual assault and that limited to the police the guard lists of whether there's any ... um crap ready evidence\nEt cetera that the women that I keep hearing from my end by my Facebook page it is full of women taken from Kavanaugh\nAnd certainly sensitivity toward women that have been victims of sexual thought that that this has just gotten to be on the plate plate of being absurd and ridiculous\nA melody I Wonder are you hearing the same thing you know in West Virginia the from from conservative women there are some polls I've seen where the engagement among women and I'll share this with you a ... a poll released yesterday\nEighty three percent of Republican women claim the midterms ... the term elections are very important that is a twelve percent increase of the same poll conducted in July so they're up a Seventy nine percent of a democratic women are saying that it's very important so the Republican women seem to have an edge here what are you hearing military\nI'm hearing a lot from our men and women as well and the women haired our state and there's also have been a couple of polls down here just recently\nThat there was one that said there were sixty four percent of West Virginians that want Kavanaugh confirmed and then there's another one that says there's fifty three percent\nThat well Kevin all come from so overwhelmingly for cap and all\nOf our people say that the party of JFK has turned into Marlboro and that's exactly what's happened people are really livid over this and this is really about the Democrats trying to uh go back to the twenty sixteen election and try to cancel the election of Donald Trump and it's about roe versus Wade as well\nWhere military you also have Joe mansion as your senator in West Virginia or what do you make of his coming out and voting for cloture which indicates but doesn't always mean that he might support the Kavanaugh's nomination\nWell let me just sum up senator Manchin like this if you like to play football you see somebody that that makes a taco well Joe Manchin doesn't have enough leadership on that courage to make the taco Joe mansion powerful after taco\n... that that's just exactly the way he's doing this he string and everybody along\nOkay well we'll see how he votes but this is um do you ginger how would I Want to go to you you're the Republican National committee woman from Georgia\nI'm ... are women at old seeing this as we heard Amy Schumer tried to frame this as we've heard so many Democratic senators or try to frame this as a vote for Kevin ... is a vote against women vote against women who suffered some kind of abuse is that what your people are telling\nThe quite the opposite I invite people and not just melody stated not just women that men to that name like when I have had more women come up to me and say I was in the Carter that babies toward the other day and the checkout lady with so upset about it\nWomen are saying that this is my concern is that we played the politics at gender and women against men and all and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI worry that my daughter is getting a message from Congress that her experiences that hurts safety is not important but is it about abortion say a word your daughter or not going to get an I'm also worried that my daughter and not have the right to control her okay okay I just I just wanted to or town hall thank God I'm worried about\nYour reaction to that Jody Smith the of the Susan B up and he loves the Indiana State director\nWell first and foremost I'm the mother of five children and three daughters and I certainly would be a lot more I'm also the mother of funds and I would be I'm very concerned about ah my daughter or sons I'm telling the truth and making certain that they have\nOr sons I'm telling the truth\nAnd making certain that they have the the right to express themselves we hold certainly no ill feelings towards um towards a Christine Christine but for it but at the same time we've got to know that the truth matters and an Indiana votes have consequences\nYou know we have a very tight Senate race here as well and when people choose\nTo initially say they're going to vote for somebody because they are qualified are not qualified and then every five minutes the parameters changes to what we're utilizing to determine our vote people remember that and one of the the biggest things in Indiana that we're saying is\nMothers are concerned about their children that are going to be the next generation leaders ever being willing to run for anything I've talked to so many\nMillennials boys and girls are young men and young women that are saying I never want to put my family or myself in that position\nYou know how in the world is judge Kavanaugh holding up underneath all of this especially for his own family so it's really it's a fascinating to me that the women are making it about race when everybody involved in this particular incident as white\nEducated and and upper income so it's a doesn't make much sense to me that that's\nIt's become about color it's become about um women it really is as much about a judge Kavanaugh having the right to um have his innocence presumed it before and they've proven guilty so that's\nGoing to love Indiana I think that's where a lot of voters and Americans come down there they they feel\n... that they didn't have a real strong feeling about Brecht coming on the same way the president said a ... up until we can go to knew he was but watching this play out watching the dramatic testimony seeing the accusations and the lack of evidence I think they come down to what you just mentioned\nIt seems a presumption of guilt and something else politics politics is overwhelming all of this this ideological blood sport\nAnd a man's reputation whose family be damned we're going to take this nomination don't becomes the marching orders no matter what adult calls\nAnd I think the American people now are about to have a referendum on that idea that you can take down the political opponents at any cost with no evidence and shame destroy use reputation for all time in public and even force of a of a woman who's going through some sort of distress\nInto the open to be used as your political weapon that I think is is\nThe Americans look at that and go man this concerns me junior I Want to ask you um you you have a big governor's race a hotly contested one in Georgia between ... and Brian Kemp he's up the Republican brand company two points\nDo you believe female conservatives are going to rally there in that governors\nYes I did and I think is having a hearing is going to really play into that because it's making women are\nReally upset that people are playing that the women against man card and I'm Stacey Abrams is a woman\nBut Brian count is at a conservative man who stands for our conservative principles personal responsibility limited government and lower taxes all the things that we\nAre that's our party is all about so I really do think and I have seen just in the last week or so across the state people are more motivated than ever now\nTo get out get out and vote and not only that that volunteer that I was at the camp campaign the other day people were coming in to get yard signs and the topic of the conversation was exactly what we're talking about the Kavanaugh hearings and\nHow we see this politics being played out and they'll they they are really playing dirty the left is playing dirty and people don't want to see this\nThey really are discouraged\nNo I I you know as I look out and watches it it does have all the markings of the last presidential election where we saw a lot of drama for the cameras celebrities coming out now we've had walk out some protests and signs in confrontations with senators and these dramatic moments\nAt the same time in coffee shops in factories in the school on to pick up the kids if you listen closely you're hearing something very different this same dynamics I think is what propelled jumped into office and it was kind of well he calls it the silent majority\nI'm my sense is just working Americans and Americans would not by nature political activists they don't get out in March the working there working the privately have their views about politics that they spread over the dinner table or to their families and occasionally\nPolitics that they spread over the dinner table or to their families occasionally to their friends but it's not something you go to war over and today in Washington I have to tell you I've seen friendship shattered people simply do don't talk to each other\nAnd it's all about politics it's because they they disagree politically and it's become an ugly violent things were once was dialogue to try to convince the other person to your point of view today's slash smashing destroyed and I don't think\nAmericans particularly women really want that now their core group I think who do and we've seen them in the streets\nBut moms wives working women I I I don't think it's where they live I'm going to give a quick round Robin we're going to go through every body again a starting with military Potter uh from the Virginia Republican Party in West Virginia of your thoughts on we're we might be headed here in these midterms\n[noise] I think that uh due to the situation with this nomination of a\nA very very qualified a judge the Supreme Court I think that the Republicans are energized to get out and vote\nFor Republicans conservative Republicans that will support President Trump's agenda and I think the Democrats were also get out and vote the right way to for people because West Virginia's counties there's fifty five of them\nAnd all fifty five went for Trump and the election\nSo that meant and twenty sixteen so that means that we'd had Democrat votes as well and I believe that the Democrats also are or we're going to get out and vote for Republicans this time\nSo I think that the everything's looking good and we love our country and we want to protect our country so and I'm going to spend every last minute I can uh if it's my last breath\nTrying to stand up for what's right for our country\nOkay well I don't want you to do that for military we now we need you in December so hang in Haiti my last breath I'm so busy [laughter] well you keep going great to talk to you know junior high powered last where do you um you're you're the you're in Georgia\nRepublican Party in Georgia or given this ... years and we're seeing given the Kavanaugh fight in the in the way it's being processed by voters what impact will end up in the mid ...\nI ... I think in ... and I also think that people that were kind of neutral and on the fence that were energized about net terms because a lot of times people don't get excited about them in terms I think we're going to see where you've heard a lot about the blue wave I Believe the red light is going to come and people are\nSick and tired of being bullied around and they're going to stand up for their freedom so we love our country we care about our country and those people are going to come out of the woodwork and I think it's going to be a ... not just going to be a way it's going to be a ... and people are going to a shot shock and awe is what I predict\n... a Judy Smith I'm I'm going to end with you you know Republicans are really bad at telling their story I always protect them so there's they they can't tell a story to save their lives\nIn this instance the Democrats gave them a dramatic story that ended up breaking their way how we'll display the drama the intimacy and the projection I think many voters are engaged in as they project themselves on the cabinet and his family and what they've been through\nWhile I agree with what the other gal said in Indiana we love our country we were first on the board for Trump remember that Mike Pence's as loved in Indiana\nAnd we are here to say that we support U.S Supreme court justices supports the constitution of the United states living breathing document and for that reason because we are so strong we also will support a senator\nThat will actually be the incumbent because he is an outsider because he is conservative and because he will stand for the values that Hoosiers believe and\nSo we believe that we also are going to see a red wave red sooner army in our state of voters that come out that never have before justice we saw during the Trump race where people voted for the very first time in their lives", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sheler Show", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "05"}
