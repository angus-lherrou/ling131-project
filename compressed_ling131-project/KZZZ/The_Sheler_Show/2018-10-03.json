O. Y. which is I'm In the D. O. J. and FBI in a robust beach Delaware apparently both of them are there at the same time that she wrote her a letter to Dianne Feinstein\nA Ford and ... McLean her best friend or the best friend she actually coached on lie detector testing were together for the four days leading up to the actual writing of the letter from the twenty sixth of the thirtieth\nIt would appear this is the conservative a tree house they would appear that Ford was with McLean again the retired FBI agent and former former New York field office spokesperson at the time she wrote the letter to Feinstein\nThat would certainly begin to explain quite a bit about who exactly was handling Mrs Ford and how there would be an intentional effort from a subject matter expert on how to best position the attack against Kavanaugh\nWho better described the Internet history and know what process sees and people to enlist in such preparatory work than a retired lawyer who were deeply inside the FBI a lot of people are saying deep state was involved in all this not only did ms McLean possess a particular set of skills to says ... system is forward\nBut ms McLean would also have a network of the OJ an FBI resources to assist in this endeavor\nA former friendly FBI agent to do the polygraph a network of politically motivated allies\nDoes the appearance of FBI insider and deputy FBI Director or to Andrew Andrew McCabe Michael Brown which begin now to make more sense\nI think about it I remember the lawyer she ultimately got withdrawn which\nBrown which was as Andy McCabe lawyer Andy McCabe former deputy director the FBI\nAnd we know that uh\nWell flight called McCabe before on ... the um Rosen science gives me before\nThey he decided to ask for that extra week and that's that doesn't really bother me because they want to know what you can get done in a week an FBI background but this FBI connection with the woman she was now reportedly within ... beach it's fascinating\nSo again if you want to examine whether she misled the committee put this country through a nightmare you need all her text messages all her emails all of those that have been deleted which are recoverable\nAnd that is for Powell McLean anyone who is ... was talking to her at the time including anyone from Feinstein's office all of that needs to be out\nAll of it\nDo you agree with me that you cannot allow people to get away from this get away with us excuse me\nOr at the time including anyone from find science office all of that needs to be out all of it do you agree with me that you cannot allow people to get away from this get away with us excuse me\nTeam thing with Julie sweat neck if you're\nSubmitting statements to the Senate Judiciary committee that are false knowingly false you should be prosecuted for that I don't care how long it takes I Would prosecute for that\n... and I I bet that text messaging trail to Christine Ford tells a fascinating story about what really went down\nAnd I'd subpoena that therapist if a therapist even exists I'd subpoena that therapist they look there is no patient a doctor privilege here patently she was releasing notes and showing them to at least showing to the Washington Post she references them in her testimony gone no privilege\nLock to uncover here so they want to go through other Brett Kavanaugh use the word drunk in a handwritten note to friends or whether he threw ice and Nineteen eighty five I\nI'm not in July what happened that do you what would you\nBe curious to know that I Would I Want to know if a former FBI agent uh\nWho has an enormous amount of institutional knowledge about how to scrub Internet history and other people in the FBI who would know how to do that\nDr Ford knew how to do that on her own someone helped turned this process eight\nFive five forty Laura stay there your reaction up next [laughter]\nPlease don't just come here today and then go home goes to the hill\nPlease
