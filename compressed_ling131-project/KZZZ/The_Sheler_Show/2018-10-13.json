Nineteen twenty nine yeah OK would have said thirty two that's why I saw the middle of it has an ... thirty nine thirty two but I said thirty two I mean these deadly said thirty two because something happened to ... to okay\nNow we're born oh yeah\nSo did you is the difficult economic conditions okay I got this right\nSo look at Bryan yes and I go\nAre you sure about that and they searched flag and toward the computer I said I go well I guess if it's on the Internet if he had a history of couldn't be any goes history that come out of high [laughter] ... Brian\nAgain no more coffee for Roger ask it way too high for others were supposed to be entertaining and informative and I was trying to be in formative or because they're not doing much of the [laughter]\nOne eight hundred eight five nine zero nine Charles yeah even as I Would never tell you to be entertained\nZero nine or ... I Would ever Joe you to be entertaining okay nice try to weigh in has another seven Buick Ron Dave how many miles on your ... there can\nI tell us about the clock uh\n[noise]\nUh they did everything there is no shavings now [noise] now a light on the cars for me I'm waiting for like\nA lot of I get like [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nYeah well it could be or either or a let me ask you about the clock when you take your phone off the break 'em and you hear this song do you feel anything within the vehicle itself\nOkay so you actually feel the clocks where do you feel the long and if you if you could try to two twenty I Know it's difficult like OK\nOkay so here's what you need to do then let's go back to the basics makes sure the vehicle and you're not running he's on the mission you're going to have the HUD race and it may take you or another person you're going to want to take and rock the vehicle Atkins worse or you're going to want to listen to see if you can duplicate that noise\nAnd if you can there's a good possibility that you may have an end in Mount or transmission amount that is broken okay natural create a clock like that where you can share it and also see that that's going to be the starting point now the other issue could be and you mentioned that you had the transmission service\nWas it the first time you had the transmission service and all these miles or have you had a service jobs in prior years\nAgo and it was like the first time\nOkay so here's another issue inside the transmission we have little kids that are called accumulate or XY calm shock observers within the transmission\nThere could be a possibility that when you're celebrating the transmission is in a year and by celebrating what you're doing is you're building up the hydraulic pressure the transmission pushing on on this accumulate around these shows and then it gets slams and the gear so\nWhat you may want to do is you can go to your friendly O'Reilly O'Reilly auto parts store and you can purchase a supplement an additive to add to that try try and help to solve some of the tonic shit as foreign\nWithin about three to five hundred miles or driving but I guess the first step is to rock the vehicles she is you hear the clock and that's not the end of it in a in\nA three to five hundred miles\nI can thanks for your call when we come back we've got a dog with like we've got away with a\nMotor scooter guy with a trailblazer your calls to eight hundred five nine zero nine science that we are the one the only the original we are in the car show\nGear spotlight it draws you buy Walker products manufacturer system components an engine sensors are pretty close to new heights with increased fuel economy if you were tailpipe emissions\nThis is created the need for a partner and more sophisticated exhaust after treatment system featuring an array of sensors designed to monitor and control the different aspects\nAnyway as I celebrate everything is fine as soon as I he's my foot off the the calorie eater\nOr try and hold it at one set speed I Will watch the tack drop all the way down no matter what speed ongoing dropped down to his lowest hundred and then it's got to rev itself back up again\nOkay as if I'm completely off the pedal okay does not know when I have heard\nCase so here's a good possibility because of the miles on the vehicle and what you described you have a drive by wire vehicle in other words you don't have an accelerator cable you having a little electric motor that opens and closes throttle body\nThere is a great possibility in fact I'm almost positive that the throttle body is going to be all carbon ... so what has to be done on this Ronald body needs to be removed from the engine that's held on with four balls and if you're going to do this on yourself and do a cleaning you do not want to push on that plate you want to thoroughly clean it\nFront side and backside you can use a little Riley auto parts buy yourself a nice\n... body cleaner a pickup and nice soft a brush a so you don't scratch anything and just flush and wash all that out and then re install it and you're going to find out that is that\nIt's all that out and then re install it and you're going to find out that this that doesn't eliminate it it's going to be about Ninety percent corrected or other concern would be then to after you do this cleaning there's also what they call it a I'm going to call it the throttle body reset up but that normally has to be done with someone that has a automotive scanned tool that can do that procedure but\nYou know go back to the basics let's do the cleaning first it's not going to cost you any more than a can of robotic cleaner and of course the the brush to do the job was\nAll right very good proceed call one eight hundred eight five nine\nZero nine five seven speaking of a performance the car shows brought to you by super chips the new flashback s side performance tuner and horse power in minutes without even turning a wrench drive to super chip dot com for more information All right let's go now to Roy\nRoy has a a I'm a little motor scooter to two thousand nine and what's going on with a motor scooter there Roy\nYeah uh it's a question to choke got electric choke and I got all the a carburetor stuff I mean air cleaner stuff off the back of it not rich and and it looks like a plunger and I'm Wondering that's to choke\nYes it is\nOkay now if if it's taught and if it's working right when you turn the key on should you should that activate\nWell it's it's only when cranking as when you're going to see that move now how many wires how many wires go to that show one two three\nA true I think two wires okay so what you're going to have that as you're going to have a habit to the point where it's set up that now here before and let's go backwards against them jump around too much can you move it freely with your finger up and down right you can is that correct\nYeah I Do that and I can kick brought it but it it starts starts installs\nAll the time but if I reached my finger in our lives right here on\nOkay so what's happening then it's selling what you want to do is you're going to want to make sure that you have power are going to get a vote meter and check to see if you have any any voltage it should be on that system should be twelve volts because it's a selling point\nAnd if ... if it does then that's indication that that is bad that components bad if you don't have power you're going to have to go back to the source and figure out why were to go why did you lose that power or ground or ground or can\nI add something else or were in left field and we have a carburetor problem\nAnd by ... by physically choking it manually choking and like you're like you're doing\nUm what you're doing is you're you're forcing feel through it and then of course it's running so don't discount the fact that you have a carburetor problem too if the

insurance company three years down the road to just go to your own insurance company and say here\nAt this point forget the other driver your insurance company will go after the other driver under age
