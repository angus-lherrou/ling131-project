Service and the ad council\n[noise] my name is Joe Thompson I'm twenty nine and thanks to my college degree I'm a systems analyst and the college me would tell you\nI wouldn't be here without big

donate money or time you're helping big brothers big sisters help a child starts something to be big brothers big sisters that was brought to you by big brothers big sisters and the guns and all\nThat much wrong on now tell me they're not few shot their ship on I specifically said no ship on and then what\nGives me\nGreat I'm not going to know whether guys checking me out are just looking for the number of a good mechanic\nThere's a better way to recycle your outdated ... all one eight seven seven to ... dot com to find out how\nWe only recycle half the aluminum we use the rest ends up in landfills or his litter can we change that make bad puns and recycle through the fifty Cain's campaign would do something dot org you could win a five thousand dollar scholarship just tax came to three eight three eight three\n... we've got it on the shy one news on radio network\nAnd no one asked them to find them now before going on\n[noise]\nI'm Glad that for me one of the most I opening things and I think there\nWas the same for you then you had to ask me something about why had I said the things that I said about President Obama in it and it wasn't the inflammatory stuff it was why did you think he was so bad or why did you think that administration so bad\nAnd I I gave you several stories and I I remember going with the chalk board and I said there was the story yeah you know about this story is never heard\nOf any of that you'd never heard of any of its own any of them and that that was the beginning of my awareness of how loud and separate the echo chambers are and that was the moment I was like oh no people we think they know thing right we think thing here saying they don't they don't\nAnd you know what because of that moment I read doubled my efforts to read there are many times that I hear people say well you'll find that in the times actually yes that's exactly where I found out you know what I mean\nAnd so when we talk about the problem we we have those in common that whether it's keeping our children face whether it's drugs whether it's the weaponization of information and those are big problems that we need to discuss the aim person quality of it has to happen because\nEven though it's hosting the awkward awkward thing even though it got hot\nIt's difficult to come up with a solution where one side doesn't want to talk about guns\nAt all and I'm sure I knew I think that's all we want to talk about it I Want to come take away are gone and that's not the K\nImpediment number two we can't hear all the options potential solutions may already be on the table but we aren't even jeering each other this exchange between Anna are prevented mother and shot a libertarian father showed that phenomenon\nAll we're trying to think if\nReasonable measures are you are you are willing to green chair and you can help solve this problem and to really solve this pen and what's that saying willing to take\nBut I'm not a little sign on to the ... project I saw which has worked very well in Virginia\nSo what was ... to project exile what\nKnow from our own committing you commit a gun crime mandatory sentencing you're going to the top of the rocket doctors for prosecution\nA practical tangible illusion already on the table never heard of it would wait this wasn't a one way phenomenon soon after mono or a mother of three teenage boys was explaining our sons and their ... can sense when a classmate may pose a threat\nAnd they're called school shooters oh yeah he was closer to Russia they they've got that label because everybody knows who is capable of doing that I think that's what you know when when I mentioned earlier the red flag laws I had it that's the purpose of those\nWhere you can go in and out like they can travel\nAnd that enables you to go in and remove the guns and the response from ... teacher\nLiterally just been talking about kids exhibiting red flags had this to say about the idea\nI had never heard that term red flag law\nHow was that even possible on my side I hear the term red flag laws almost daily in campaigning but at least she lives in a different state and gets different not\nAgain it's not about whether you think I Do with the ideas are good ones are bad ones it's about the fact the other side had never even heard of them\nWhen we're talking about trying to protect our kids shouldn't every idea would be considered\nEmbedded with number three either or thinking this is another exchange that I made a deal between Anna are progressive mother and Mona who identifies as a Christian conservative about what each of us can do now to help keep our children safer\nI Know from my side is you know reaching out to my legislators and I think this is what I Want and if the legislators are here to take action and helping to elect people will or more in line with that thought and perhaps on your side you can do the same but we all have a part to plant and first in\nMaking our voices heard it might they see a child but that's one set me kind of okay\nBut we started events once that\nI Can't find the right word\nOne heck one step back and started a community level and set up relying on our legislators to fix this problem that you go into the schools and you say the price of all I'm a retired Marine\nAnd my kids go to school and I really want to help keep the buildings secure I did it all I can do I can only work within the confines of my life and my time but I don't parents here I have expertise I Want to do something how can we gather the parents in his school\nTo help for to find a bill I think they're probably they're selling a restriction than issues again I mean I don't know all the other or down but\nTo approach it who felt valid and worthwhile to me but in that moment it felt very either or into little dismissive and this happened to lunch jumping back\nAnd forth between opposing ideas as opposed to spending time discussing integrating them or combining the approaches and I just hope that the divide over the first approach the constant ... date doesn't demonize them so much\nThat we aren't able to work together on the second community level approach we need books not only the ruler so those three impediment opinions up numbering people not hearing all the options and either or thinking we're our biggest obstacles as we search together for my list\nAnd as we talk we I guess as the they have to be there to help getting about health and ... [noise] yeah I got it after I got to get out of ...\nWe just kept running up against them but then also you can also ... the child\nAnd never got around them there\nThat he could then use to act that got all of a nice time of the kitchen to and then in the car and I guarantee it asked him if\nIn the ... hour after hour tens defensive and hot the air conditioning was working at my premise wasn't working\nI feel I feel like that's what happened was both sides every every time somebody gave an example of why that examines my son works for them to physically and then\nThey turn to for different conversation [noise] stupid lift was only making us more frustrated the more we couldn't find it because although there were so many moments of connection it was a moment of disconnect that controlled the mood of the room\nWe already have laws on the way that we do not we cannot there are only five thousand of them I Would run again let all of those going just for your\nThe moment I had been fearing\nWe reached it\nNow are you willing to put some words no doubt that that last candy that accurate anti because you're not even willing\nTo let them know the impasse\nSoon after an of summed up how a lot of us were feeling\nComing in hair I I thought our chances of getting sick either what was I was more optimistic and I said why would we are where we are today\nAnd if that's the sort of you know\nAnd for the right to her son was ...\nAnd afterwards they started talking specifically again but there was a willingness to work together and limit the number of opinions to their own\nIt's like OK rather than you and I mean and the ... thing that got our wherever but it'll I run a fashionable me make sure you know\nI'm not selling item injured or violence and and\nAre not selling item injured or violence and trust and then just handed down on\nThe ... you know or\nOr or ... or ... cents ...

Peter come out to the range of the age of ... here in the world of another person and and understanding it actually getting into the it we're not a problem in\nWeeks later Denise can I spoke about her perspective on America after our time together\nJust a very combative [noise] uh you know very argumentative environment that doesn't have to say that from happening in a can agree to disagree on things but you know like what you're trying it if I don't think things you're three island I don't think that it is that hard\nThere isn't that hard so the question remains\n... how did we get to this point of connection and optimism\n... when it happened in the room during the conversation with the seven\nBut it prompted me to want to reach out to enter an invite her to the gun range and the first point\nOf view will be okay\nFire for giving\nThem thank you I Know there were others are not here to either side and it was just I Know what ... what did\nThat's why I started again in\nNow are you willing to put some words no doubt that can't be that accurate ads had been because you're not even willing to let them know [noise]\nRemember when I said there was more in that moment than I had realized there's Denise defending and I'm like saying you can't do that\nTo her hair that after\nWhat happened in that moment I asked Denise later\nI just felt very angry that someone that was supposed to be sharing my point of view and my perspective was named blatantly disrespectful I'm completely shut off in human beings sitting next to me\nI honestly just like I needed to defend her um whether she was on my side there by it it doesn't matter\nIn that moment the moment of impact the enemy lines that actually shifted someone on the complete opposite end of the issue became an ally to the nice when there was a greater obstacle to overcome [noise]\nWant greater obstacle so we went back to the audio around the moon\nTo take a shot and they don't ever get any of my rivalry reasonable fickle general black and there was one one\nAgain and again the to go to a consensus so many of the times was the same person written\nNow are you willing to put somewhere you know the one thing you know the the majority of the room shared his idea of them will pretty much everything it was his approached the conversation\nShe became the greater optical many times\nWe would all agree to an idea but I'm going around the room for consensus we should have long hair for every one round but the problem is I I Can't plug cheer I Am an hour to anticipating his last\nWell I came here I Am an hour\nTo anticipating his block to a new idea a rule I think he knew he was playing\nAbout that before [laughter] you know we're three here I Am again asking you specifically because you're the you're in your mind is right now and then this happened\nNow are you willing to put cameras no\nIt wasn't the content of what he was saying it was the way she was saying the intention behind it and that was because of his number the number he had\nAids for six three ten ... or ... what [noise]\nRemember those numbers and the sound guy was setting up and people were sitting down and sipping their water nervously I'm Wondering how could only measure the degree of hope that they were bringing to this round table how can I gauge their commitments to finding might lead to Johnson audio started recording you hear me asked\nThem how do you think is likely one can find some sort of from some going no no I'm ... [noise] what do you honestly believe in them and then to me [noise]\nNumbers were privately talked to me at the beginning of the conversation and never referred to again until it was time to leave three hours and forty six minutes later he was the actual moment to the conversation ended and the numbers are revealed you'll hear Rick at the end\nStuff it's a tough one\nCan't wait to see where I never can I\nAh it was\nFake three\nTen to ... or what what was the one that they're already you know there was a very slight is already one of the\nRick when the one\nWe never had a chance\nIn fact the next day he sent me an email saying quote we honestly think this was a good cause but the impact is far too wide a cab them to be quote unquote\nA one will always diminished hope in any given ... just the way that negativity lately overwhelms whatever true hope there is out\nThere we've all been Rick for whatever reason or whatever mood we've all been that person but a new one is a very powerful thing especially in a very divided America [noise]\nSo to me the answer for how do we move forward and work together to keep our children safer [noise]\nUsed to be any number greater than one\nRecent Denise at the end of all round table\nDenise who went on to open up her world to show a fellow American\nThat she is in eighth them\nIs eight idle loving sitting here like my heart and going out to each one and have for a day or you know your ears and points and I understand that and it may not be one that that I you know finally get on board but I Believe me when I Know where you're coming from that and I appreciate that [noise]\nWhat's interesting is Denise has been invited by added to attend to a progressive groups and and he's taking progressive moms to the shooting range the array to learn more love it so the bridge is there to bridge starts with just sitting in the same room\nSo we as the one I think about coming to a solution in Washington I'm a zero [noise] when I think about the American people [noise]\nI'm a ... eight nine [noise]\nIt's funny because the only thing I think we never got my lips I didn't say there was nothing we didn't agree on the only thing we all agreed on was that we have no faith in the government system that exists that with the only thing the seven of us all agree on so\nI think that is part of the problem [noise] and I think

questions about your races and we'll talk about that but um I was just saying the next minute that Regina Cobb and\nSunny but really and I'm sure in the future we'll be teaching that I I Know the records of Virginia a cop in Saudi burly and I don't think there has been better representation for our district that needs to 'em and it's been two of them basically going alone at out they're representing us\nWe don't we cannot move forward with it the other thing is is I don't remember ever electing Tom ... as a legislator for our state he comes out to California He's using his Californian style a politics in trying to persuade his movement into Arizona I\nThink his business the solar business yeah no it's to profit and benefit himself and it's it's a constitution so again we're back to that\nWe're in we're in the constitution does it say that we have to force people to do things economically that they don't want to do it's back to the Obamacare the essential part that we were again\nAnd and ... is is just not the way we do any kind of changes to the constitution\nI you know we we've been working towards solar and alternative fuels for a long long time\nAnd we're always always working towards making our uh our environment better and for someone from out of state I Am and I am all for initiatives and I know a son\nI Am and I am all for initiatives and I know a senator Braley and ... are also but if we're going to have an initiative I wanted to come from the citizens of the state of Arizona\nOr would you say that the current path that we're taking towards improving our renewable energy resources in Arizona is as it's been for the last several years and I quit or would you suggest remind me of it's\nMoving the way it should be what the industry because the industry has to be able to move as far as fast as the technology evolves and represented called nailed it we don't have and they or they don't have the\nStorage capacity for that excess energy of the sun makes and not only that but it doesn't if it doesn't address the baseline base load when the sun goes down so\nIt's very problematic to have a an outside entity that stands to make billions of dollars off the backs of Arizona's taxpayers\nAnd by the way this is a mandate on on on these businesses are going to pass that cost on to all of us so it's not just mandating that you have to get a solar panels on top of your house\nThis is making the industry go solar and it really is going to hamstring and not only that it now it's bound in in the constitution which we're not going to be able to men very much if or when things need to be fixed later on down the\nRoad and isn't that always a problem with the citizen initiatives I'm just like the marijuana won several years ago the people who are going to benefit where the people who do that and that should not be there is something you know basically wrong with that system\nWhere is some of value in having people that know the industry weigh in on it but\nWhen they do it through lobbying their elected officials are representative\nWell sure I'd like to address the medical marijuana industry in a minute here but I Want to also finish up with us this this fellow on the air or what his uh his other question about Mexicali\nOr Mexicali right she's a she's a veteran fighter pilot or she sits right up there at the conference table she's a ... on a committee for border security and even ... trying to take care of the ... problem that the president said Congress fix that so she's at the table with the president but not at odds with each other\nUm and you know what she's going to have a lot more conservative than cinema\nCinema if you noticed none of her ads that say that she's a Democrat she's trying to citizenship independent she's the ... the I'm Sorry the communist chameleon so I and I said that right here and you can pass me for all I Want but that's that's that's the way it is\nAnd if anyone wants to know you know I had I had I'm Kelly Ward on several times it shows a big supporter but you know what I'm behind a hundred percent that\nI'm Nick Sally she's Republican we need her we shot over the weekend how crucial those votes are still on it and there's no being on the fence right you're going to vote for ... Republican\nAnd he'll say one more thing about the solar an incentive really touched on it as well saying that you know the the technology isn't there yet to where it's completely affordable so what's gonna happen it's as if this initiative goes through your now forcing these companies a PS the co-op to say you have to go solar twenty thirty so what's going to happen\nThey're gonna have to do the research that got the infrastructure upgrades and when that happens who gets charged for that the people right when you look at places like San Diego that have really mentioned that there there are electricity rated what Fifteen hundred a month almost\nEleven hundred dollars and Fifteen hundred a month right and they don't need her conditioning of San Diego\nExactly so that's the part that concerns me the most is now this costs is going to be put on the people the citizens are seniors people that already are has you know struggling every day to to pay the bills and now you're in a bump that up to three times the amount\nAnd that's why any the has come out strongly against that and they have the number's gone right website they'll see how it can affect you love\n... and ... you have is this conception that you know we're getting solar or against renewable energy that's just not true we're ... I'm a fiscal conservative\nI Believe that we have to do it responsibly and we had to jump into looking Obamacare we jumped in and it's a disaster\nSo I just wanna make sure if we'd go this route we've got to make sure that technology's there we gotta make sure I'm In is sufficient in one day we'll get their name but it's just a matter of we don't I don't believe we should force it on the people now as a mandate right especially in this county the state I mean we lots of them want to do it tell us what we have to\nDo right force at you with us so okay so I'm now ... he got the floor what is an issue that you would like to work on 'em if and when you were elected in next month\nI'm you know I think right now you know we sat with with sunny and Regina and we've talked about uh the things that we want to accomplish water's going to be a big deal I'm you know ... resident Cobb is done a fantastic job\nUm this last year with the water and and dealing in in cerebral he's been on top of it and it's I Know the supervisor and I was well I mean in this county we had the NBA I D D situation\nUm and so that's going to be a huge huge deal and it really is legislators we need to figure out ways to uh you know preserve our water whether it's recharge stations whether it's um\nUh you know detailing edition technology whatever the case may be we need to look at other ways to make sure that we can serve our water there were ahead of the game\nIf maybe we need to look at other ways to make sure that we can serve or water there were ahead of the game\nUm you know a lot of people are worried are we running out well it's not about that it's about how we make sure we don't get to that point how do we not get to the California situation where they had a problem we're in a drought I mean that's that's for sure and and I know the first thing that happens is is it a little water issue to the farmers are going to be affected\nAnd that is a huge part of our industry or they're going to\nWrite well um I Know Regina you had a hand in the wall of pie dates and study or we talked about it are the essay you want to tell because people up in Kingman this affects them\nYes um you know look I mean just let it lay outside right there you know what one of the things that we tried to do this last year was take the lead on on water\nAnd um is your radio not working it's going on and off but go ahead [laughter] [laughter] I ... and we have a one of the things that I tried to pass over the last couple of years is is trying to do a real management area\nSomething that we can actually how some local control and it didn't get wasn't able to get past a sunny tried to help me out a little that he did some work with the NBA I D D bell and uh we just weren't able to get across the finish line this last year and it wasn't because governor duty didn't\nSupport us on that says because that we had\nSome difficulties with the legislature and and you know we're gonna probably work through that they share I think that having them out here this last year remember a has having the the forum in Kingman ... we had over three hundred people show up for that forum and that was\nPhenomenal um that really showed those legislators what we are our issues are and what and how we're going to handle it\nI don't know if you notice about last week we had\nOur county supervisors summit where we talk about the issues that we would like our lobbyists this association to work on and Gary made a really um compelling arguments for this rural ... rural manage ... area and he explained it in such a way it passed unanimously so all I\nEver lived there all the supervisors were talking Democrat and Republican around the ... they all said the same thing they said this is why we have this association even though it might not be our problem now\nThey didn't win it is good is our moral imperative to help out the more the rural counties who need it because maybe one day that there's going to happen type so it was very positive and I'm sure we'll talk about it at our meeting next week\nAnd that must have happened after I left I ended up the legislative dart for the county supervisors association down I knew my last week and and granted we had some great conversation that morning um but it must have half an hour and I'm Glad I did it\nDid well we need as a medium size pockets and that's the next morning and then we voted on it that afternoon just set it up really wants to say something\nWell and that's a perfect example of ... to more of a communication I mean we've had critics out here for this during this election cycle saying there was earlier legislature observe nothing your county supervisors had done nothing and that's a complete false or\nThe the the war is constantly moving and we're trying to do this and try to get it done and what was really beneficial is one we have that here in up in the bill was chambers was rural up other rural legislators but she was from Uma\nNow they're waking up in the ... those are our Democrat colleagues and then they understand that wants mommy county falls there so we were there the the eyes are opening up and ... years are opening up and and now we have some dialogue and with the u._s._a. actually getting behind this is going to make our job a lot easier to get physical\nRight there were a few we'll talk about later but there for a few more things to see if they got behind we actually submitted most of the proposals mommy county and that's because of our relationship we felt confident enough with these guys you know going to bat for us yeah he'll he's\nI Would love to see more retirement or on our debts and actually get out of out of debt\nI'm from the two thousand six two thousand eight area\nUm but we have this last year uh been able to reverse some of those things that we did back in two thousand six I mean ... he'll do you remember the rating of of the counties of funds rating of the licensing departments rating of the all our department's actually\nUh was something that we ended up doing so you know the fence which were just a normal thing we've been able to reverse all those funds sweets and to be able to get out of debt so honestly I think that we have just um advanced what we have uh our agenda\nOver the last few years and I can only see as doing better this year because the economy is doing fantastic right now right\nRight and I came in six years ago so and that was under a Jan Brewer and she inherited a nightmare from the previous should ... we're spending from Janet in Palo Alto and then of course the economy tax with a tank\nAnd also we hit the great recession but ... governor do she's been taking the hill or what would you know certainly retired one billion dollar debt and not only that\nRetired one billion dollar debt and not only that we would have been able to put more funding and education everybody thinks that we're restores back to two thousand an age of funding levels for pay twelve on in a two thousand and eight or with the education funding for K. twelve was\nFive point two billion dollars in two thousand and they will F. Y. Eighteen we've surpassed that we're at five point three billion and so that's why Nineteen were five point nine billion say the move backwards is really not a good solution but just the last two years in the legislature\nLast year's budget we put five hundred and fifty to ... million dollars more money to K. twelve education this year in the budget two thousand Eighteen we passed the twenty percent by twenty twenty for the teacher pay we added a hundred million dollars more for district additional assistance\nWe even be able to move money around to put\nA by adjusting modifying ... through one to put an additional sixty four million dollars into ... actually into the classroom site for\nShowing you know we're doing that for our education a side to side of things and uh you know what what is that we've eliminated her her sweets we've added Arizona's boom and we've got over two hundred and forty thousand new jobs in Arizona over three hundred\nPlus companies have relocated Arizona we could have extra Jerry and Jerry Brown for that Governor Brown in California because you're actually helping or Arizona so we've got like what's around\nFive percent increase in New Jersey New or start ups too\nAnd one of the reasons that we are this it's down to fill a successful is because of the governor D.C.'s\nUm business friendly environment he has created and\nSo um I Want people to know that again we developed ... LB five um legislative slight here but also\nThere's a governor race too and we must reelect governor did see because I Believe the Democrat in that race wants to take us back you know and if you're a company and you moved here you you gave up everything and you moved here that great expense because of the promises made\nFor the economic and then all of a sudden the new government comes in and now they want to they want to attack you at a higher rates make for education\nAnd I think that's fraud I think that is a it was it was ... he is there something\nYou know if they just on your point about the the taxes but the invested in an initiative which I'm number but didn't make it didn't make but what what is going to do is going to attack\nAnybody or to everybody but mainly whoever made over two hundred fifty thousand attacks from four point five which is our business owners business owners is is a perfect example of\nOf what you're going to do to ruin our economy I mean we've been building it up the governor's doing a great job Gina sunny but we're both doing a great job at the legislative level trying to build up our economy and and do the right things that you know pulled back regulations I'm bringing more company and so when you have an initiative that\nWe were going backwards and so this is why I think it's important to elect a Republican team because we had it on our mind we want to do what's best for the state was going to bring in more companies more jobs um invest in apple to remind\nDisaster St Louis standing and Leo you just touched on this too when we talk about the scene of a funny what's going to be sustainable is a good economy ... and you're not talking about a tax that's going to be in our everyday in reference to the day yeah\nAh we want to make sure that we just have a good economy and were good\nAnd it does trickle down in one of the reasons you know again with the county did not even discuss raising taxes this year where last year we were told that we were going to go bankrupt\nBecause of the hard work of the team um we got her money back we got our lottery money back we got a lot of money back so we were able to balance out about it and then\nEven on crack right we're able to get those funds fleet center Levin point three million now that was a temporary this year we're going to make that permit\nThat was another another thing that let sailed through without even\nAnd you just went through all those numbers I went through all those numbers and guess what we did all that with out raising taxes that's what's the most important part that I write\nIn in real quick I just wanted to touch on a crazy to read your next marrow fast is um\nYou know this is why and Meyer sunny and you know so much because they're fighting for rural Arizona\nRight I mean bottom line yet to represent the entire state but in reality represent districts by it and they always have the district is in their best interest you know it's not about what's doing what's best for the Phoenix before or metro\nIt's about how are we going to protect rural Arizona writes getting her ... sweep back or didn't ... I mean that was huge they've been pulling our money for years um and we've been suffering and needs to I just you know like I said can print them enough for all the harbor food and it's not easy you have\nThree people representing our district um until you're ... you're going against\nEverybody else in the day um and so it's not easy to do what it takes time ideas we didn't understand\nSomebody and people who can nurture relationships because that's what's happening\nSomebody and people who can nurture relationships because that's what's happening where you have to have relationships whether you agree with people or not you have to make your case and they pull people over to your side and that is not and not an easy task\nAnd one of the things that senator Brawley and I've done over the last four years has ... has worked with the real pockets in advance of real pockets where we had we didn't have a real cockpits essentially when I came on and so we decided that we were going to make sure that we\nWere part of the real ... and so we\nGot all those rural legislators together so that we can fight Maricopa County the next day America at the county and we are not necessarily on everything because there's some things that they got this year back to I mean there are judges they got their funding sweat from their judges um in Maricopa County\nAll right we are heading into a quick break here on a politicking Tuesdays on live and local on again in ... states number one news talk am FM radio leaders I've got\nLeader you'll see to Sunday but rarely a Regina ... district do supervisor if you want to call in and ask any of ebony questions at king when nine to eight seven\nFive three twelve thirty Bullhead nine to eight seven six three fourteen I Begin the toll free one a four four to one nine twelve fifty states will be right back after these messages from our sponsors we all\nDid you know there are thousands of opportunities for high school college and graduate school students to work with the national Park Service jobs for students age Fifteen to twenty six many of these jobs are filled at the park level so contact the parts that interest you they welcome the interest and involvement of the next generation who will help them care for our nation is environment and preserve our history\nYou know a student who is ready to go these jobs are perfect for high school students and young adults and the jobs are year round or summer for more information log onto NPs dot Gov\nWhen we hear about people dying of curable and preventable diseases we might find ourselves saying someone should do something about that who is doing something about that the answer is project hope for over fifty years project hope has been making hope happened\nIn poverty zones around the world by preventing disease promoting wellness and saving lives one child one family at a time to volunteer or learn more about all the great work that project hope is doing this a project hope dot org slash make help happen\nI Am Tim Daly we all need to be more aware of our health over fifty take pneumococcal pneumonia some adults think they're too active or healthy to get sick but as we age our immune system naturally weekends increasing our risk my mom had new ... ammonia and it was serious she was weak had difficulty breathing in a terrible cough\nIf you're over fifty talk to your doctor about your risk and see if you're up to date on your vaccinations learn more at WWW dot who knew dot com that's W.
