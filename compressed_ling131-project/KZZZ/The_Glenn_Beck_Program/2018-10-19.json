stop the caravan\nAnd of course that's hateful to\nQuestionable tactic I Would say uh send the military to know not not a not our response but the actual caravan itself\nIt is well I don't understand what the what the point of these things are it seems like every year or so we have another one of these stories yeah and it's certainly not something that's going to influence the type of progress you would ... theoretically want if you are a migrants from Central America wanting to come to the\nUnited yeah you're talking from their mindset yeah right from their point of view it does seem strange how they're doing it this way\nDoes not seem like it works right I mean it just all it does is it you know\nIt makes people angry you don't want people just thinking they can break into the country illegally yeah and especially when you're doing it thousands at a time that makes it even worse it would seem to me\nYeah I mean because it's this is why you hear about the dreamers all the time that the dreamers the people who dream people who've just\nCreated a dream and they dreamed that here in the United states at all they want to do is continue their dream dreaming hearing dreamland that's all they want us to tame dreamy dreamers dreamed dreamers\nAnd you hear about dreaming dreamers because they have stories that are largely compelling in a one on one basis right as you know they pick they know of course they don't pick the ah they came here at Seventeen and eleven months\nAnd uh the ads have been breaking the law for Fifteen Years they take the kid and then there are some examples of this where there's a kid who's you know four years old that comes across with their parents\nAs as the phrase is no fault of their own which is true and your four years old and there's a compelling case there and I think a lot of people are open to that case even if you I think if your for your mature enough\nTo say hey mom dad I'm not doing it this is wrong you know why not dragging me illegally across the border I'm not doing it have you guys looked at us off guard were breaking it okay right now we're going to [laughter] and it usually that doesn't happen\nWhen you're four so I mean there's a compelling case there but when you talk about four thousand people coming across the border that's just the math you can't look at those people individually or hard to I think for the average American because\nWas a huge mistake I think for her to be their number literally with go pick or not that surprising her views I don't know exactly she yeah she's been with a lot of these uh left wing extreme groups or some maize any early to thousands to the point where again like she like co hosted a show with someone who's a nine eleven truther\nWilder awhile\nThat's like crazy bonkers over the line right and and the fact that you have a really solid candidate there in Arizona and it's a border state the big deal there ... is another one the cruise cruise has got to lead there but I mean he's always been talking about border security but\nYeah I get a look at the other side of that yeah with that though\nDoesn't want no all he doesn't I don't know that even wants to border frankly them it just doesn't seem like it and he's made a big deal out of it some of those ads are like less protect the dreamers\nLet's let's protect the dreamers and you know what I mean ... ... it means amnesty for everybody it doesn't stop with the dreamers and ... I think everybody who has watched this battle for the last Fifteen or Twenty years knows it doesn't stop with the dreamers there they're going to they want amnesty for all illegals here\nAll illegals because you can't just say All right the dreamers can stay well what about their parents okay yes they can stay what about their cousins OK it's the whole chain thing than the trust\nHey what about

O'Rourke and for some reason everybody I guess including him really a emphasize it's ... ...\n... over or get a better know some of them back to go over so anyway the that a race continues to be pretty interesting right now it looks like\nCruz has is pretty well in hand right now is up by seven I think on the average\nYeah he is up about by seven um he of course is a a deep Hispanic roots as why if you don't know what better way to do is they deem a Hispanic nickname for the deeply Hispanic man\nWhose name Robert for instance do Rourke or might not signify to you that how Hispanic he is which is why he's called Beto right that that's how right um but yeah he was hit me I I I assume he probably was a dreamer right\nHe probably came here you know you would assume that he was in I or Lyndon dreamed up coming to the United states and then came here and became a Spanish\nAnd I think he believed he was until the Hispanic caucus said a no new who do not have an workers you know even the nickname didn't get him in that is weird but I end racism exact here is a patio addressing his nickname when\nIt comes from throughout the campaign you have been attacked for being what Don junior has called an Irish guy pretended to be Hispanic so what is the Hispanic community means you in what relationships do you have with that community\nSo to verify the question about my name was born Robert Francis ... son of pat France has to work with the sun and John Francis or fathers saying that you're listening Francis work who will go as UFO\nUm for for his wife\nAnd and from day one in El Paso and and you know this and that gal and if you were born Robert\nOr Albert for Gilbert ... your folks to your friends your community calls you bet though that's that's my nickname that I've gone a buyer for my entire life I'm born and raised in the fourth generation in El Paso I'm In a community that has more than eight percent Mexican American\nUh first of all I was you know I'm not Hispanic I no one calls me\nOr any name other than stew of at this point which isn't even my named either or you can criticize me the same way you can talk about better because that's actually not my ... my name's to deep uh in Phoenix book if I'm\nI'm called Stu thanks a lot for to Glenn Beck for that one up what I what I Would say there is first of all it's just an inefficient process I I don't mean to criticize or the culture of the of the Hispanic people but if you have if if if it's true what ... saying which is\nAnyone who's named any foreign names are all called that's how is that true everyone who you know every one is called Albert it's called that's how every what everybody born\nIn El Paso that's of Irish\nAmerican descent that same Albert Albert Robert framed in their home do better than you know we can go and fight an actual Robert in\nEl Paso do any exist maybe somebody in El Paso if you were in El Paso or anywhere around there and your name is Robert I'd love to know if you exist because what we were just told if I've ever what does your happy to grow up and do your name is Robert\nBills Ted Stanley Orlando or Reginald you're you're referred to as best hope I I Can't be true\nIn ... and I don't think it is\nI think it's not a common nickname and some communities it probably is but it wasn't his can be not cultural appropriation did he not appropriate Hispanic culture down oh is that not a problem if that is a thing\nTo the cultural development as much as I should be and you know please come and and and whites plane this to us because we are just ... that's not a role here that we're just two white and understand things like that to a ... let me let me the oddest admit it to me\nA ... referring to himself has that show feels like a guy who wants to take advantage of the Hispanic community for votes I I Know that can't be true but it's just because I'm too white to understand it I\nQuite get their cat clear that hurdle to understand why someone would do that and we will soon find out\nTo see if we can find any any Roberts who are actually Robert so it looks like we have a a Joel Robert ... no doubt is Beto calling from El Paso I'm Joe Robert\nYes fear or is it is it more preferred for us to refer to you is Beto\nNo no not even that meal that you\nKnow [laughter] okay what is your actual given name\nLibrary is J. O. E. first name Robert R O B e Archie and I'd already caught me in ... so when someone calls you up how did they refer to\nAs well they do say middle ... mostly 'cause the look of outlived its you know almost ... just kill\n'em you know in my lap and it's not that a lot of that so I thought you there I'm not job of us [laughter]\nLet me ask you this is ah\nYeah I'm not job are you there [laughter] let me ask you this is a ... but why did you call national radio and lie because we know every morning in the area that had Robert [laughter] better why would you live now all those\nNames mentioned I I it it does it does depend on if they want it because that though it is isn't it I mean it's\nI don't know what it is but I Know and all those people and I've always called him either out there without though you know ... and the other one over I didn't even know Gilbert with that but\nWhat do they do a lot of white guys call themselves better or do other people call them that are\nActually he's the first one that I Know a young guy [laughter]\nDon't judge Joe what is your background so do you what's your ethnic background\nOr Hispanic or you know but a lot with your parents um a lot of people I get a lot but it's the ... they say and let's get an American\nI repeat that I'm not getting it because I'm the shows that I Do have Mexican background but my surname which of course I'm not going to give out is the for the state by ... ... ...\n... ... so that this is fascinating you are in in the Hispanic community\nYou have Robert in your name your not all that show and you know ... the people that you referred to in the Hispanic community with the names Robert Albert Gilbert in Umberto you refer to buy their actual making [laughter]\nYes they do this is an interesting piece of evidence we found a unicorn this is only one or two we'll know the one we should send that the metro so he doesn't make this mistake next time on CNN\nI don't want him to go down the road where he's making mistakes and saying things that blatantly aren't true on national television ... that would be terrible for an average is trying to help we're trying to healthier and also is Joe thank you Joe for calling in and and I would love to hear from more people\nIf you happen to be Robert Albert Gilbert or Umberto for having to live in a in a Hispanic community where you know uh some of these names\nThat were always how you refer to it because that is the standard set\nUp by that show and I'm curious to see if that if there are more unicorns out there we used to discover something to work we've done our one incredible we've already uncovered something that people have told us did not exist [laughter]\nIt's a miracle and all this hard research we put into this today uh-huh by giving up the phone number you know once or twice and shockingly we were able to uncover somebody so let's see if there's more out there I don't know if there is I knew he was the only\nWe've done a lot of digging so far so I'm maybe it'll produce more fruit I don't know a Richard in Texas you're on the Glenn Beck program Hi\nHey guys my name is Richard I'm Out here in El Paso okay uh the first thing I like to say that there's really not that many Latino is named Francis [laughter]\nMy first point okay your second point that you were mentioning I which say that Ninety five percent of the people that are named in the names that you mentioned to go buy it at all\nMhm that's a high percentage I mean that's a that's a lot\nAnd I am a Latino and I am an American citizen\nAll right well thank you very much like that's what we that's what happens here in our community\nOkay so you do in El Paso you do know a lot of guys go a lot of white guys that go by that oh\nNo\nNo [laughter] okay so the guy here and talking about here the Ninety five white guy zero clothing goes\nRight for you [laughter] okay so I I 'cause this is an interesting distinction you're saying in the Hispanic community people of Hispanic descent with some of these names are like that show but the people who are white yeah Robert for instance do not go by that show\nNo yeah okay that makes it okay what are they going to help veterans that much I don't think it's the same thing\nAgain look there's a couple uniforms out there we're going to if you don't always when you're ... you're searching for horses you're going to find a couple of with horns on their head that's just one of the things some of them are going to be able to fly it's part of the it's just part of the experience when you were looking to find a horse hey look at that one it's got it happens to be rainbow colored and is flying through this guy\nEvery one has to say huh how 'bout that I'm just cure I just concerned yeah because you know look CNN is the place where they're gonna they're gonna dig deep and get the facts subject this\nGuy he's got to get a massive fact check at some point today because apparently we're hearing from El Paso that people that are white named Robert Francis are not typically called that's how this is I mean\nWe don't do it at all that if you have Hispanic background and your name is Robert or some ... that you called Beto and that doesn't I I'm not surprised by that at all what would surprise me as if a lot of Roberts who are just white guys that usually go by Bob in this culture of them are are going by Beto\nCan you know one interesting thing we could do with rubber friends or because you could call them Bob Frank over to right we can go with Bob Frank or are you good yes you could Bob Franklin work is not it doesn't connect a deeply to the Hispanic community I wouldn't say Bob Frank uh but\nDeeply to the Hispanic community I wouldn't say by Frank [laughter] ah but I'm sure he ... that had nothing to do with his consideration by putting federal knows the science that we of course know that he was calling himself Bob on television when he was in a band\nYeah and that band performed on television in El Paso on their morning show and he brought his incredible guitar style aims to the show and it was getting late in the show and the host of the show was concerned that they got to start playing to the show was about\n[noise]\nWhat's it called the near\nAre going to be over before you ever [noise]\nSo he's talking to a better way believe at that time [noise] and then you hear the guitar style and he's a veteran himself [noise]\nCredibly talented allow you to listen to this guy is [noise] it's good [laughter]\nReally heavy but yeah this is actually federal playing guitar [noise]\nAnd then they kick it into gear fan\nOf the the guitar styling\nOf federal friends is from Bob Bob Franco roar\nWow that is talented\nHe's called Bob ...\n\n... it's just a one giant in Paris it is a campaign yeah I mean the fact that this guy's\nCaught on with the left it I mean they'll ... they want to run for president in twenty twenty he's raised more money than any Senate candidate in history for quarter that's how much they love this guy he raised more in this quarter than Brock Obama did back in two thousand eight\nIncredible that amazing because why he made a speech about the NFL where he said it was okay to Neal because they are I guess that David in February ... American than that I can I can think of several other law or American than that a lot I I I don't uh I don't think I understand it\nBut maybe we'll get more evidence from El Paso and this will show us that there's only two there's only two people who would possibly disagree with the story from Beto O'Rourke in these communities\nI'm Glad we've heard from a couple a because it proves that unicorns do exist but we'll we'll figure it out and we'll we'll locked out here coming up AAA seven twenty seven back is the phone number a blend of course is a reverse in the Mediterranean Sea then coming back across the\nAtlantic Ocean in a canoe\nAnd when it gets back he will join a traveling circus this weekend if you want to check out the dates you can find those out uh I don't know if they're gonna be like Glenn Beck dot com slash tour he will if you go there you can find a date to our tour where we're going out around the country\nUh but I don't know if the this weekend traveling circus that Glenn will be hosting is going to be listed there but you could look for it in your community as well or he'll be back on Monday a ... talking about they caught a little bit here bitcoin was down forty percent ... only over just a just a year ago it was down to Eighteen fifty a coin\nAnd uh you know you forget what the huge run it hadn't leap year that anyone who invested back before the giant spike of bitcoin is still up a whole lot three and four times their money from just a little over a year ago\nHey it's hard to imagine that that uh this whole run has it could've been profitable that late\n... and John Stewart for a CPA advice and\nNow we don't agree on much I agree with that\nBut we both see the need to help our returning veterans start new careers\nAt a CPA advisor net they get smart advice from experts like well you John me think of all the free advice you've given me\nA CPA advisor net\nThe online non profit that connects veterans with business professionals like you join us because their service deserves our service\nJust as good a stone you name it is an old for it and now says ... believe in Oregon cook enough to see all the siblings and million kids in America was struggling and that's where the seat in America nationwide network and things\nLike this this was to give to Hungary cues and this and\nWe call them food and drug use can be once and for your wings and leaving America\nFor the American council\nRussian meddling in the mid term\nSome of the ... that's the allegation in a new federal case against a Russian woman accused of helping to plant misinformation on line just so division in the U.S political system\nThe forty four year old I as a citizen of Russia lives in St Petersburg and it's a legit she was part of something called project locked up but more importantly she's connected to a firm called Concord\nThat from was initially indicted by the Justice Department and the FBI and interfering in the twenties sixteen election so on its face it does seem to be an extension of that interference noxious\nCatherine heritage and Washington and it's believed to be the first federal charge against a foreign national claiming interference in this year's elections amassed a caravan of Central American migrants breaking through a border fence and Guatemala\nAnd streaming into Mexico still heading for the U.

hopefully a Glenn we'll be back from its canoe trip across the Mediterranean on Monday and traveling circus yeah mhm yeah and triathlon traveling is over I Believe finished a force which was much worse than I and I think he expected yeah\nI'm so we'll have to get him out of three thousand people though so I mean I wasn't that bad out I was looking for I think the average person money for\nHim yeah because it's such shape it was one of a rough terrain which is a specialty\nYou know a lot of a pill a lot of mountain climbing in the middle of it which is not usually in the middle of a triathlon no but he wanted to go through\nThe toughest conditions you could find yeah and so I think that's admirable it is it is really trained so hard for you can tell a look at him\nOne of them [laughter] [noise]\nRight I tell you I had nothing to do with how he pulled off that training while at the same time learning to uh to train elephants for the circus was an incredible\nIt may even I

kinda be\nToo sure of yourself too much certainty and today we're really learning here from the Hispanic community of nothing wrong with that Robert Francis at work I I was not aware mhm that every white person in El Paso\nThat was named Robert Francis will be referred to a special that was not something that I knew until very recently the last night on CNN even\nBecause he's been talking about the battle thing but I didn't know I thought maybe it was just him right there is some quirky thing about him now but no everybody everybody right let's let me remind people of of what he told us because we all want to learn\nTo gather a at a everybody has his nickname here's what he said\nBecause you got the campaign you have been attacked for being what Don junior has called an Irish guy pretending to be Hispanic so what does the Hispanic community means to you and what relationship you have with that community\nSo to to clarify the question about my name was born Robert Francis or work on a path friends has to work with the sun and John Francis or father to USC Francis org or who will go as UFO\nUm for for my wife and I want you know fast and you know that gallon if you were born\nRobert Albert Albert ... commuted out though that that's why now that are gone OK bart for my entire life and it's entirely born and raised\nThere and it's good to see it's good to see a that this has gone on I I I just I don't I don't see how people don't see through this you\nI don't see how people don't see through this\nYou know I and I think maybe on the left they don't want to because they think he has a chance you know every few years the to the left gift that terrible teeth or they get to get close in for in a few polls Wendy Murphy is kind of changed Texas who's the mayor refused and that was going to change Texas a\nOh a revert to use them and when you're down there yeah ah yeah sort of a moderate leaning a Democrat\nHe was also going to change Texas every time they were on somebody there's somebody who's going to just change it and it's going to\nIt no longer going have to deal with these darn Republicans down their return that state blue we've won forever and by the way that part of it is true if they start they turn into these little that's really do yeah yeah that's true they will run they will run the country for a very long time if they're capable of doing that just from an electoral vote standard\nBut still it's a it's not ... it's it's a way to suck the money out of small donors were throwing it away you know we keep hearing how bad people habit\nAnd I think that's true and a lot of cases ... but it's like if you have it really bad because Donald Trump has ruined your life or whatever it is is it really the best expenditure of your money to send it to somebody out of state intact who's going to lose by eight or ten or twelve\nI Can't imagine that that's the thing that you should be encouraging if you actually cared about

pat and Steve Love you guys [laughter] uh I I think you're missing a very important point and that is that over ... identifies as Hispanic or therefore ... you must be believe\nWow there's a great point here is again we're learning today yeah I forgot that was the standard how insensitive of us mhm\nHow hateful and a ... that is that we haven't spoken about how he dug identify yeah and it must\nBe a Hispanic [laughter] jak bags that they did something with that sort of talk it's like you know the the Elizabeth Warren is a centrally identifying as a Native American without real evidence that she is she's getting beat up I mean this has been one of the biggest political disasters of all time\nHer coming out and trying to say that she actually is Hispanic or lend Native American short approved it by going back ... generations trying to prove it one one thousand twenty fourth yeah that's what made the left hates it through like this is this is playing into the worst of our\nUh beliefs about you know blood being the determining factor in these things and they they hate it they're\nThey have destroyed or over the she handled it terribly I mean it's almost like one of the things I don't know maybe they should have leaked it through another source of the fact that she's associating herself with coming out of doing this is amazing\nAh but the identify think there's two parts of that\nLike I said as a you know say that you know\nThe libertarian side of me right I don't care what people say they are right like it made no difference to me if she says she's Native American or not I don't care\nBut beyond that there's an actual truth\nYou know if it does all what's to come out and say she's black or Sean King wants to come out and say he's black when they're not black does that matter to me I don't care what they're doing there I think they're lying right and they're doing this for a reason but that doesn't mean it affects me in any way however we\nHave to be able to stand up for the truth the truth is that Sean King is white but the truth is that racial does all is white and the truth is that Beto O'Rourke as white as white\nAnd it's a fascinating thing from the left who think that you know we we one of the biggest reasons Beto is you know in the public eye in the in the United states and not just the Texas figure is because of the video he made about it's ... it's a great idea to Neal uh for the national anthem\nAnd what's behind that story people like Colin Kaepernick saying that black people are being unfairly accused without evidence and being shot at the streets for no reason because\nGet on board if you're on the left are supposed to get on board with\n... with the with the new standard in which any white woman\nCan accuse the man of rape and we're supposed to believer that is not going to work out well for African Americans or any ... any race of mail but this is the type of thing that makes no sense I mean there are real cases of this this isn't a fake thing go back to you know we talked about ... about the Emmett Till\nI mean this goes back a long way where black people were accused of doing terrible thing to white people when they didn't and entire communities what an attack to the black person\nThis is obviously going back quite a ways put it in something that legitimately as part of our history\nAnd it's surprising at least if liberal actually cared about black people and black men like they say that they do that they would want to embrace a standard like this\nTo the point behind the ad I think is is relatively fair and it's something that should be communicated I think to the the African American community that ... that the criticism is perhaps a over done little over done potentially the criticism here and interesting 'cause I don't think it's a\nIt's not it does not I don't know the the uh for sure on this but what I've ... my understanding is that these are the people who are recorded this are African American that there's not like a white person doing a black voice quote unquote because you're African American or talking\nA and I guess the idea is that they have picked the stereotypical African Americans to do the commercial it's very uncomfortable\nOr I don't think that this was something that French she'll necessarily even bracing or by any means but it is or something that's making a lot of uh a lot of weight in the media because they're trying to make it seem like well this is just as Republican and who is a racist\nI I mean\nHey he didn't have anything to do with the ad but besides that uh it it's an interesting\nDouble standard that we find ourselves dealing with the always yeah and and we get that double standard in a way to the tenth power and you know I guess we get kind of used to it by now I'm just sort of used to the double standard end to the point where you almost feel silly bringing out the double standard\nAnd it happens so much it is and it but it's so obvious sometimes you have to for example does anyone I mean if you don't live in French Hill district you know French Hill is it's not a major if I actually don't yeah he's not a major national figure as a Congress a person\nUm so you know like I I think this wouldn't be a big national story it is a big national story today what is not a big national story is a name that almost everyone does Louis ...\nLouis Farrakhan is not a big national story today he's making no waves at all for his comments\nOr yet again about Jews now this is a person who has met with you know people like a tease Alison he has met with several congressman he's been embraced many times but even you know fairly recently\nUh people meeting with him we know the ... bomber at one point apparently had met with him we didn't find that out until like you out of office you got how the how that happens it's amazing\nBut here's the latest from Louis Farrakhan\nRear about everything now is a booth [noise]\nSo when they talk about for Khan\nCall me I have to\nYou know they do come in and see semi\nI pay\nA man to turn my [noise]\nI don't know nothing about pay some body because of their religious preference\nOkay right yeah you know anything about hating somebody because of their religion really really you just you seemingly just called and Jewish people termites\nYeah you don't know nothing about hey said more clearly than that the best what he's talking about another speeches wow a for pretty amazing it's to the other thing that ... that's interesting about Louis Farrakhan nobody\nLoves Louis Farrakhan more than Louis Irish or maybe this guy thinks he's really clever yeah every every arriving lie and he's got this gigantic smile on his face like he's uncovered some deep historical truth or or or or solved a perpetual motion machine and the guy is like put\nEverybody in their place just now white slamming them down I don't know nothing about hate no religious group\nAnti Semite on Turner mind it like he thinks that's a yeah he does he's really excited about himself and he ... both of those words and in ice but [laughter] it wasn't a rally should do it [laughter]\nAnother he's hanging around and he's like I don't I don't have any scheduled schedule one we need a speech just for this long [laughter] how excited he loves when he delivers bat [laughter] things are really up about it and I don't think he got the requisite reaction from the crowd\nAnd I think he wanted more of a you know\nA gas or I laugh or something\nYou just kinda got a weight I don't know how to respond\nPowerful [laughter] it's really funny oh man I think he just keeps so happy he looked so happy and you can live with I mean I Can't wait to deliver genocide above the Jews are just\nBig smiles [laughter] as long as he could come up with something\nThat rhyme you know people have simple pleasures and I think that you know he got a couple of things he's asking for rhyming words and killing the Jews other than that yeah I just come on you know maybe a good a good cup of ice tea you know something something simple pleasures beyond that I mean she's\nShe's he said some pretty outrageous things that get very little coverage and this was another one um people just they seem to kind of ignore him and act like a he's not there supporting Democrats he's kind of not there you know at the very edge of the left\nA but if anybody on the right again this was the double standard hadn't said anything approaching that ... uh about any ... can you imagine if somebody on the right had said something like that about Muslims would that be\nEverywhere it would be everywhere are on the mainstream media um but he\nFor some reason kind of flies under the radar and gets away with all this stuff ah I mean he's still haven't really suffered any consequences from talking about killing Malcolm X. even ... um\nShe pretty much I mean once you've pretty much admitted with this yeah\nIn my mom is a no city if you attack\nYesterday and today and tomorrow [noise]\n...

Know now you know are talking about his yeah we're just not how things over that's all [laughter] but you talk a little bit about the election so today or this this update as kind of fascinating\nUm I think if you want it to boil down quick version of where we stand at this very moment it looks very likely that the GOP will hold the Senate it looks very likely that the people will lose the house but you know because governors there was a bunch of stories there there's a lot of individual stories on both sides but if you're just gonna summarize overall\nThat's likely what we're looking at right now things can change as we know I don't know lock on either one of them I'm a think things can change in significant ways there's one thing that will not change however in this race which is the Democrats have found a way to milk there are people out of a lot\nOf money a lot of money\nNow this is of course the party that constantly tells us they want money out of politics they just they can't do it\nThey don't they do not want people buying elections they don't want to go and they constantly are out raising a Republicans in these big high profile races you know presidency and things like that we bronco by most famously\nAre outraged everybody in the universe and you know Donald Trump spent like nothing on his campaign twenty six team yeah it's a it's an under told stories of that election Hillary the if the idea if it's true that you can buy election Hillary Clinton absolutely would have one\nBut she had way more money far more resources\nOr because you know Donald Trump didn't\nThrow us a lot of his own money into the race it they just ran it on a shoestring promote much at the time and they were still able to win it kind of just proved every liberal theory about money in politics\n'cause he was going to go on on the theory that she didn't need anybody else's money so he didn't he sort of didn't try to fundraise much now I mean he ... he he raised some money and a little bit yeah and he used some of his own money but it wasn't like a billion dollars like she did know it wasn't even close um and that is that\nLike ... you know part of that if he's a big celebrity right like he was a celebrity before he was a candidate so he's able to get a lot of TV Time for free and and everybody was covering him all the time you could see now I mean even after each president\nAlmost nothing with the exception of maybe some bipartisan spending bills which still find ways to get those ... I'm sure of it but other than that you're going to get any real advantage not getting any attack stuff you're you're going to be tough times with any regulation you're going to get ... you know none of that stuff is going to be\n... as long as you keep running a massive deficit you'll get all those bills through yeah ingest just keep spending money and they'll\nVote for it yeah yeah it's not a problem to show you the house and how dramatic it at least by the polls what can I Know you're gonna say well the polls got the last thing wrong well some of it they got right\nA and a lot of it they got rights including the popular vote by the way which is what they were actually trying to predict in the national bulls some of the staples were totally off though so we don't know whether this whole we're not sure but right now the models are showing 'em there is a like a point one percent chance that the Democrats can pick up eighty three seats\nNow it's a point one percent chance really unlikely like you'd think that that an absolute no it's not going to get to eighty three right ... ... the models are also showing there's a point one chance for Republicans to hold the same amount of seats they have now\nIt's that bad and environment the same same percentage chance the the crazy outlier possibility is Democrats plus eighty three Republicans pluses zero\nOh the ... Democrats plus eighty three Republicans pluses zero what is the chance of not holding the same amount of seats by keeping the majority about twenty percent they're saying about uh twenty percent chance they can keep the majority right now wow that about about the same percentage chance that Democrats can get to that\n[noise] so I mean ... look and if they get the house if ... if all the Democrats do is get the house they're going to be able to launch investigations like crazy right there I always say it's going to be a nightmare most certainly in PJ relative each in right now will be convicted no no the when I Want a ... there's no chance of it really makes it unless something dramatic were to happen\nRight because you have to get to sixty seven seed pay another step better than I

uh hygiene supplies school supplies even as they get to again the first Southern Baptist church thirty one twenty qualify mountain road maybe call ahead to see\nThat's a good question I I Do see it in Arizona I Am I'm not very optimistic that that will be a solution and the near future I don't I don't think there's enough support especially with our current legislature and governor for that to be a viable option at at this current time\nMaybe someday it could be limited I I didn't try to be real if you have peg medic about that\nIn lieu of what would be even ...\nWell the next best thing is is taking steps as we have been saying and the more recent months um we we have seen that\nThat within twenty ... twenty twenty planned that there there is more funding available for teacher raises and I think that's a great step in the right direction and I would like to see that expanded and continued a that was designated for again only or your typical classroom teachers and it was not\nInclusive of our other support staff including our um bus drivers are office staff that care professionals and and that's another area that we need to be looking at because they also experienced\nA very high turnover age and when students have a revolving door of teachers and school staff it actually costing our state millions and millions of dollars because every time they have to hire someone new they have to go through that training process and get get settled and if people\nThey have to go through that training process and get get settled and if people are in and out in and out like that it's not good for our students are not good for the school community and and that's something that we need to be working on is how can we improve our teacher retention I it's\nIt's essential to have students going through grade school all these years be able to form educational relationships with their instructors so they can feel as though I have a good foundation for their education moving forward not just\nEvery year different sort of teachers every time and they have no one constant in their lives in the school setting but you able to act as an inspiration to them or a teacher in other areas of life that aren't necessarily\nFollowing the general curriculum you know I'm a mentor\nAbsolutely and and we are seeing right now is that\nRight now there's over Fifteen hundred hitter vacancies across the state and I do know that Arizona is rural schools has been hit hardest by the teacher shortage because our schools and rural Arizona tend to not have all the same resources to attract new teacher said profession and retain them\nAnd in fact one area that I'll be looking at is making sure that our funding has more equitable across the state to make sure that we can offer competitive pay and every corner of the state\nYeah those rural areas are facing just an absolutely unreal number of challenges not just compensation for teachers but the actual logistics of getting the students to the schools in some cases\nThat's very true it does mean that we need to make a comprehensive look at that which I Will do with the legislature and governor to ensure that didn't even like asking us how to even have access to their public school\nIn the recent years it's become almost painfully clear that the system of education that we have is and I hate to see it as kind of failing and some of the central areas but here in Bullhead city during the primary election\nAnd are now heading into the general one of the issues that have been made aware of is a one of our judiciary elections were in the process of electing a judge for rising division six and\nWe had the two females and one meal on the ballot there was a ... for the Republican ballot\nOr the two females is sort of split the vote and the one person who uh ended up winning the primary you was in effect ... there's a lot of people's opinion on just stating that the U.S for people that have been on live in local saying it out loud\nOr that he is not qualified for a bevy of reasons and so now judge Billy ... is trying to get on the general election ballot through writing and get elected that way which as I've heard from him personally is never actually happened before and it's a very difficult long shot\nAnd no one really wanted to think about the situation would be\nVoters looking at the ballot which the two females and one male and just locking old sort of information would vote for the mail me to think of a judge you think of a man and a powdered wig on the road perhaps\nBut overall people are blaming the situation on a lack of informed voters these people not having information about the candidates and not knowing where to get it due to a lack of civics education in our state for many years\nFirst let me start with what you started with as far as our school's failing and the way I see it as\nI rather than calling our school's failing when I see is that our schools have been underfunded under served and under staff and said that's how I view the issue of of our schools and in the current stand by we might or the amount of my focus is going forward as how can we\nRaise our school's out and make sure that school that costs us they are giving giving children at at every opportunity that they deserve to be a successful and that that title back into your question of how can we raise the standards and make sure that all this\nStandard that they're learning in the curriculum and everything is appropriate and setting ourselves up for success\nAnd one way that we need to address this it's actually something that our department of education used to do more effectively and then in recent years that's declined they haven't pirates has that and that's professional development\nAcross the state because there are we actually have great state standards than they are in the process right now things are working at and revised\nAnd they are being um they're being reviewed by experts in that field as often as our teachers\nAnd with the standards that that to make sure that students are learning civic center schools I'm having a great ... evidence and research based standards\nBut you know just having the standards on it someone doesn't accomplish anything across his tail it does is put on the website but we need is having are experts in our educational leaders and people with a good understanding of how to teach have standards\nGoing out and doing professional development across the ...\nHave standard going out and doing professional development across the ... and again that's I think that we use today earlier that day that apartment I used to be a place that provided a lot of services for school districts and teachers and administrators can make sure that we're very proactive\nAnd loading schools with information that they need to be successful at it and just being at a compliance type of agency they run it the more active and make sure that our department of education staff it's very accurately participating in communities and every county\nYeah from a purely logistical point of view of what you said about the money is any time we take away money we're effectively rippling our schools but it's not something that you could just throw money back or\nIf you throw a certain amount of of you sort through a certain dollar amount but I gather you've already lost the people that were making sure that the ... the curriculum and the logistical principles that were set in place are being followed directly so you've got to restructure the entire system\nAfter the schools have already lost so much that takes a lot more work to get that back but it does just to cut the budget loser\nAt very chair and and my thing I plan to do in my first days ended apartment is like a day of the department of education even though when you are in recent years I I I mean I get is like I knew I'd been estranged from them you need a fresh clean line by line\nThat bad yet to see what funding as that alcohol internally because that education does have a ... budget as I'm for paying staff and each and every department and we'd interest also receive federal funds\nFor those programs and that's one way that I Am hoping there's opportunities to shift and money around\nTo provide these types of professional developments around that's\nAll right we've got to take a quick break on talking with a Kathy Hoffman's do for a candidate for the superintendent of public education and you'll see her on the ballot coming up on November sick stay to this
