something I don't know\nShe is she is she is\nThe the most elegant first lady we have had since Jackie oh she's not been on any cover of any magazine she has and nobody says anything nice about her nobody says out of all I it's incredible that when she was when she was out just recently last last week in Africa and\nWho's a Ralph Lauren photo shoot it was only some of the most beautiful photos she was in Egypt in front of the in front of the uh pyramids it was in trouble so beautiful so tasteful nothing\n... you know it's not a major issue obviously per se as compared to others but what I honestly think it is the most ... your example we have a media bias is in my book that's the McDonald's\nFrench fry\nI remember when I say you don't remember that part and I said if everybody says they hate McDonalds okay that's fine\nBut if you ... that you like the French fries or that they make them as French fries but they do [laughter] and then you have no credibility millennia Trump is the McDonald's French for I'm shocked you brought it to fast food yeah OK leg I we gotta talk about conservative a ... a tell me about\nGuy that Saudi citizens been disappeared I'm always I'm always amazed how the media does all the stops doing any kind of journalism like like I see the stories are writing and I'm like this is not what I Would be writing about at all\nFor one yes this is like a Quentin Tarantino style movie so amazing really is yeah I absolutely think the Saudis are guilty on this I think turkey is probably over playing what they do have probably just a little bit anything about it\nBut um but everyone's framing this this this uh this journalist ... as this great guy Nobel Prize winning oh yeah he's got to be he'll be a Nobel Peace prize winner so he came out so surprise surprise he really came in the problem is the ... the media loved him the west loved him during the Obama administration\nWhen the Arab Spring was breaking ... outlines of exactly what the Obama administration was wanting to do and also who are they in bed with the Muslim Brotherhood and places like Egypt will surprise surprise ... is Muslim Brotherhood he's actually that's the reason why he's not and they the people in the media have said oh well he spoke out against you\nKnow the uh the kingdom the Saudi kingdom and he that's probably why they don't\nKnow kitten but it goes way beyond that like you they support a political Islam group that wants to overthrow the monarchy it's a lot goes a lot further that oh yeah he spoke out against them yeah he is the public and I was a public enemy number one but he's right up in that group with them\nUm and they must be friends with the crown prince thought was he not um I don't know how they're framing it\nHe was friends he was he was he loved the crown prince they got along and and he said a lot of great things about the crown prince now he disagrees with some of the crown princes policies\nAnd that's where they've ... wants to take the Saudi out of Saudi Arabia basically that's the best way to put it for this guy but he's a he's not a good guy he wants to political Islam he wants to political Islam to invade countries all over the world and take it over\nAnd he was living here for quite a while before he went to work at Washington Post yeah no no issues there whatsoever\nI'm I'm On the other hand you have this one guy that's not that great of a guy on the other hand you have a Mohammed bin Salman the crown prince who ever want to send this is this great reformer he he he's a great guy is a great leader is going to modernize Saudi Arabia women can drive now all these socialist all these tackling he they dug\nPlain and simple he is eight Doug they\nGo after he's doing this uh tons and tons of people thousands of people in his own country people just disappear they go to jail for the rest of the why he is a thug and the only reason he's tackling social issues is because they have a lot of young people in Saudi Arabia\nAnd social unrest about to hit the street if you want to see the place for the next uh Arab Spring might happen Saudi Arabia they the demographics point to it I Would not be surprised\nRight so how do you keep Saudi Arabia under control do without a thug\nYou can't I mean it's like Russia really either bright groups like other countries like that you really can't fears of disturbing part\n... most likely most likely this guy was killed by Saudi Arabia yeah um it just it just feels like a man and then maybe all of a sudden he pops up and I'm like\nNo I was a chick fillet and nobody in the media wants to look at chick fillet so I was invisible for a while\nMaybe doubtful here's the problem we are ... we are pushing through a major arms deal with Saudi Arabia\nWe should not be doing that now we should not be doing that that should be canceled today I can tell you however what is being what is happening is\nYou know the United states was supporting the Muslim Brotherhood now we have some people who know exactly what's going on in that part of the world and there are probably being talked to by Saudi Arabia go and look look guys guys\nYeah I Know you don't like what we're doing here but ah it's the Muslim Brotherhood and its a caliphate you what you want the whole region to be in the Muslim Brotherhood caliphate have at it yeah and that's the decision our president is is having to make\nIt's why we should stay out of other people's businesses and then stay out of their business\nCan I make a production yeah so I think that Saudi Arabia will eventually own up to this because I think the evidence will come after them I think they'll they'll blame a very familiar a photo and they'll say it's the deep state the beach they did this no shelter salmon getting out of their [noise]\nRegulations are are going to have been I don't think we're at our rescue\nDot org are rescue dot org go there\nAnd uh and make it under the name of hunter Kelly

the time and I can't believe that I'm Alone oh you ... I'm sure you're not alone yeah like I was you know basically the perfect child as my mom would Fouche uh for for\nMy mother died she would say say figure out I'm sure I'm a you know but it's it's ...\nYou're right it gets dark fast I think the ... control really fast with with social media and stuff or you know I I don't know how I don't know how to even contemplate dealing with that but yeah I mean I you know your your kid seem like they're pretty pretty good shape I mean they want you to believe upstanding young people\nHaven't you know that I mean my son is now going he's got testosterone you know pumping through his body and you know I just it's it's frightening I guess because I remember when I was like I remember how I felt ally was moody and everything else\nAnd and now [noise] you know what's real what's not what's it's just so hard and I you know I said to my son I said to my son last night we were having a conversation and I said\nSo what are\nWhat are the two words 'cause he was talking himself down and I said\nStop stop listen to yourself\nAnd he said what and I said listen to what you're creating listen to what you're saying and I gave him the dad I Am speech that I've said how many times\nHave you here at one more time my gosh you're going to kill yourself hundred times on the air you say that this\nI started in this and I said you know this and he said\nI don't I said I I ... I\nOh my gosh if I told you than you haven't told your own kids but you're told the national radio over and over and over again and I realized\nThat there are some things that we just think our kids here\nAnd because there are around us they just know they're going to pick up I mean he's in American history right now and you know she probably knows more than some kids are most kids on a lot of things but things are big gaping holes and I realized\nHow much of my time with my son do I think he gets it through us most is somehow or another\nYou know just because he's living here and blah blah blah and he hears me give speeches and he hears me on the radio and here's a blah blah blah\nHe's there we are it's maybe it's just me\nI don't know if if I'm just going through this\nBut my gosh you have to be very very specific and watch what you're saying to your kids and and be with them all the time and what's frightening is the influence is so strong and so sexy on the outside\nThat it's the draw that they're just the you're just black and white\nThat everything else as color yeah\nYeah I ah I mean one suggestion is a he was the Jodie Foster movie panic room and she what she did is she was able to lock herself in the room and have no outside influences at all\nAnd I kind of like the editor I let them and I know I Walk to the family in there and just like we were just sitting here the black and white color things interesting though because uh we had a guest on this program before and she's on wonderful worlds do as well Catherine price mhm she wrote a book recently called how to break up with your phone\nAnd in the book she just yesterday I saw something on Twitter with her where she was talking about one thing that she suggested how to break up with your phone which was turn your phone to great scale\nSo you can do this on an iPhone or Android or whatever and basically what it does it does to black and white it looks like you're old school black and white TV\nRight you're all the brilliant and vivid colors of your phone go away and it's weird because you think well you know what difference would that make a lot but when you turn it on ... there's there's something just pleasing with all those bright colors and your eyes\nI I I decided to just do it because I you know there are things they have to do my own and you see the my calendar need to be able to read articles I Need to be able to do a lot of things I Do for work our sort on my phone you know constantly emailing and doing all those things that's important and it's part of my job\nBut I don't need to ... there's times where you just flipping through Instagram because it's their right\nAnd you put it in gray scale hey look you turn it out you don't get you get a disappointment feeling when you turn on your phone rather than a pleasing feeling it doesn't give you that rush of like oh wow look at all of that and you don't even realize you're getting it until you go to great detail because when you turn up when you open up your phone just looks like junk\n[laughter] so let me uh let me uh\nLet me ask you this have you heard of these devices I don't even know somebody told me about them and I can't find I Can't find exactly what I'm looking for a Google is let me down um\nBut I'm looking for a Google is let me down I'm I'm looking for something\nThat shuts\nAll devices off of the Internet at certain times gives each yeah person you know and keeps that global record in one place and says oh you have used this amount of time on the Internet you've done this you've done that you\nYou know this shuts off at eight o'clock at night you know on these devices well I Know you're saying for like your kids for the whole family\nWell I I Know there are options for that like there's one at that you can uh install on your on your kids phones\nMy kids don't have phones bright but it'd be in your do your kids pick up devices yes um and you can turn things offered limit times through your device so you can go on your on your side of the ... and say I only want this on for an hour and it'll just turn off after an hour on their devices\nAlso I Know um depending on what why router system you have like the euro which is like one of those ... network and it you know Congress the house but you may you know I have but I have no idea and it's a big ... a room of Iraq\nOkay stuff but it's through those a lot of times to the new life by writers you can go right through there so but it's the Internet coming into the house you're getting it you know\nWay before that you can limit all the content at that level which is\nPretty good as well work to the point in my house where my ... my son is seven\nAnd worked at a point now where like I Need to start putting these parental things on all of the\nYear before he doesn't care he's going to see you know ... you're not looking for and right now I'm thinking now he's looking for anything but he could easily stumble on something I don't I just I ...

Saturday mornings I'm Jay AAA ... am FM and on line\n[noise]\nWelcome to the program so glad that your hair returning with us Steve days pat gray a stew steeper gear or executive producer and of\nCourse my charming self uh we're talking about uh the Democrats in what they have done this week just with Hillary Clinton coming out and saying you can't have a civil conversation with these people\nI don't know who these people are that these people used to be a sign of racism uh but you can't talk about these people are and then Eric Holder in the week that we have a video up somebody actually kicking a protester ... um we have Eric Holder saying a kick them when they're down\nIs is the is this the\nAh is this the beginning of the end for the Democrats or is this the end of the beginning\nUm I I Hope it's the beginning of the good\nBecause um I I think most Americans with the ... with the any sensibility left in them\nOr are being turned off by the Democrats right now I I think they've you know we talked about this many times I think maybe now they have overplay their hand we thought maybe that would have happened a year or two or three or four a goal but um I think after the Kavanaugh hearings and all that's going on now with the civility thing\nDid they're completely uh uh issuing I think I think people have had enough of them\nSo is it important for us to change a say I think people have had enough of the Democrats because of that blanket people who vote Democrat think wait I'm a Democrat or is it better to say I think people have enough of this leftist no movement I think it's the latter\nMhm and I think that um you're you're watching I Know it's a popular term in another context these days but you're watching a transition happen\nAnd you know we kind of pretended as if on the rights that just surrendering I'm America's youth ministry known as our education system to cultural Marxist for forty years um wasn't going to have any repercussions whatsoever\nAnd now you're watching the first fruits of that harvest are coming home to roost at the moment\nNothing new under the sun you know when when St Paul is looking back on the time period whom himself a Jew so he grew up in the Jewish schools he knows that history very well when he's looking back at that time period is when he writes forward thinking in a New Testament world and Romans one\nWhere he's when he's when he talks about the wrath of God revealed on the world anybody I used to think when I was a baby believer that if if cultures did bad stuff that would cause God to act\nThe more you study Romans one I think it's actually the other way around I I think we do bad stuff\nBecause we deny that God is acting meaning it's a it's a self reinforcing mechanism the natural law uh it it kind of been forces itself and so you're dealing with people that with the wind and the and the New Testament there when you exchange the truth for a ally so there's one big macro truth in in the universe\nAnd there's a lot but there's lots of eyes rights are lots of why so when you change that truth for ally you're given over to a database to mine and that's what you're talking about and\nI go back you know one of my favorite movie ranch when I was a kid\nAnd that's what you're talking about and\nI go back you know what it is my favorite movie rants when I was a kid and it's probably a terribly placed analogy but Donald presence rant and the first Halloween movie about Michael Meyers handicapped they can't be stopped that can't be reason with right when he's going off about him and when he was like in the insane asylum\nThat's what you're dealing with here there is no talking look at the guy who ... who kicked drop kick the woman in Canada when he's wearing a pen a gram around his neck you to go look at his picture closely okay I mean that's just self awareness is dead in your face kind of stuff look at the way he talks to her piece really polite he's asking her what she thinks\nHe's totally loose city not craze he's not raving roving mob okay and then when she said when she when she refuses to ... to the same idol that he is he is worshipping\nThe total countenance changes and he dropped kicks or look at this her own a woman from Hawaii that's on TV all the time now\nI mean her count the way she looks she looks like when you take your ... to Hawaii for a vacation or a honeymoon and you get off the plane she there with a plate of sweet rolls ready to welcome you to the island she looks like the sweetest oh woman doesn't
