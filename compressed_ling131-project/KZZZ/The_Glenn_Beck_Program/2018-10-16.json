of the Proud Boys a which the media is saying you know they're they're violent or and racist activists so tell me who you really are Gavin tell me what you're really fighting for what is your vision of America\nWell first of all I'm not the leader of the Proud Boys I just started it\nThey they grew organically I just happened to be there and they grow up to an ugly as someone who wanted to stand up to the violence of it if a lower pepper spraying and culture and Lawrence rather than me and all these other people who just wanted to go do it talk and they haven't stopped\nWith this violence and inevitably when you're that while I mean get a grip slashing tires you're going to have the tire boys\nAt some point you're right so this group would not exist if ... if it wasn't trying to shout people down and trying to I'm a take them out\nI don't think so I think you're just they just\nTake them out [noise] I don't think so I think you just they just stay at a bar like the ... they wouldn't be coming out to defend people but more importantly the the way I feel personally is America the greatest country on earth because it's not about identity politics because it's not about your accent\nLike it is in Britain or or where you come from it's about meritocracy you come here you bust your ass you at least appreciate Judeo Christian values you could be an atheist but you have to understand that that is the backbone of the country and as long as you're ... you're part of us your rent we don't care if you're if you're gone to\nSingapore you bust your ass you're into American values urine and there's not a lot of places like that in the world it's it's very rare\nTo have that total lack of classes in that\nAdmiration for independence and liberty and hard work\nAnd we got there through a horrible list of ups and downs and and rights and wrongs and trying to correct things we had slavery or treatment of the Indians was not a was not what you'd expect for someone to whom the sermon on the mount mount with divine commanders as you can and says\nBut we we we got here altogether through all this mess and all this suffering and here we are in the ... country of the world and we get people complaining saying America was never great\nAnd and that's what pissed me off and it's ironic that we ... we get caught a white supremacist because the reason we love America is it doesn't bother with all of that crap\nGame and we had to ask for a long time I think the media basically just say antifa was that maybe didn't exist they ignore them completely in as the violence has escalated their new tactic seemed to be well yes there's violence but it it's the Proud Boys fault or it's the right wing ... have you noticed\nOr they're just exercising I my favorite is they're just exercising their First Amendment right of the assembly and Patricia of\nCourse of course I'm curious if you have if you detected a difference recently\nI'm In the approach from the media as it is trying to make your group\nThe real a village the real villain them is because I mean I I ... you know there was a ... a tweet string going on about the alleged violence by Proud Boys members and he was re tweeted by people like ... like the big time reporters were going after this you become I think of central target in this is I Do feel that\nDefinitely I think that the DNC put their uh hate is not hate has no home here that the only thing they have to say to America and it's an idiotic thing to say that's like saying well we we are sick of albino violence\nLike most of this really weird concept the evil Nazis and they said we're going to rid America of the clan and Nazis now there are not\nSo they go ... uh we got to expand the next year so now anyone who disagrees with them as part of this evil hate that has to stop and I unfortunately have fallen into that that definition\nAnd it's it's [laughter] it's amazing that anti ...\nAnd the media and the DNC are all in cahoots like Cuomo was saying hey this is like a a match and you put it on dry dry grass and then the wind just takes it I think the matches antifa the wind is the media and they can't pay our starting fires\nI don't I I I have to tell you I have a hard time disagreeing with that I'm seeing the way the\nUh the left has just consumed the DNC I mean there there there's you know when you when you're into a an organization where you're starting to say you know shout your abortion and\nUm and and that kind of really despicable kind of a a behavior you're bound and determined to start going way off the rails and they're they are they're they're the extremist party now\n... and it's it's all getting into grey I mean they used to and at the same as in Britain by the way the way that that the anti uses antifa is paramount until it kept paramilitary wing here\nOr the media here says the jihad is over there and and the attitude in both cases the enemy of my enemy is my friend\nAnd then he says language and the DNC language getting more and more similar just like that noted that we are not simple that's what Hillary said when we go low when they go low we kick them\nOr Maxine Waters saying no no freedom no peace or whatever go to their homes attack then we've got people on CNN saying that Sarah Huckabee Sanders ... harassed for the rest of her life that's a life sentence they took the same thing about Susan Collins they're sending race in\nTwo Republicans they got Rand Paul's wife sleeping with the gun we've got senator is getting that text to be heading trick cabinet comes in I mean\nThat's who we are\nAre the people you need we need to unite with but the easy ones to get or the ones on our own side getting the Guinness and I made this\nOn our own side getting the Guinness and I may disagree on a lot of things we disagree I Believe that it would be much more helpful to take the Martin Luther King's pledge and go and walk through Atlanta FAA\nSinging hymns and let them club you wouldn't have had go ahead and let them club you in the head I Know that's not fun I don't want that\nBut that video of not breaking ranks and knocked punching back that video will speak to eighty percent of Americans\nThat video will cross all barriers and people will say okay look at these ... they're not even defending themselves look at what they're doing to them you put evil versus good side by side and people in America at least still at this point we'll choose good\nBut it has to be really good it has to be a shining example of good it has to be over the top good\nThat's why this is where we disagree I understand you know getting in and uh the Proud Boys what they're doing I don't think they're wrong for wanting to do it\nAnd I don't think they're wrong for thinking that it's the right thing because how is it right now how is it wrong to stand up to bullies how's that wrong\nHow was that wrong if the police won't stand up if the media won't stand up well who's going to so I completely understand\nThat and I can't blame you can't like I get it I just think it's not effective\nBecause what happens is the media event just takes the piece of the video that they have where somebody's swinging back and then they say it's their fault so it's just not as effective\nDo I want to get club in the ... no no\n\nBut if given and I can't come together even though we have big disagreements our disagreements are not on the things that actually matter\nWe're not talking tactics the things that actually matter or the principles bill of rights constitution declaration of independence Judeo Christian ethic\n\nFundamentally the left as you talked about this before shouting their abortion they're proud of their abortion and\nThey're heroes the Proud Boys are proud of the west right and they're the villains\nOr you know I think you and Gavin ... would agree completely on on what should be proud of the fact that ah you know western the western way of\nLife it's something to cherish it's a miracle it is and and there's nothing wrong with with defending that at all or you know tactics or a ... tactics decide we have to if we don't defend it is going to go away\nYou know we're all at the ... you know we're only one generation away from ... says we all know and maybe a generation it seems like it could be a week or two away at this at this rate\nSo we have to sit there and defended it it's just you know what's the best way of doing it and I think that there's a there's a discussion there um because I think you know I think as a ... um Gavin would acknowledge we kinda talked about it in the interview they're gonna they're gonna be under the microscope now they got to be on the absolute best behavior as when the Tea Party was going on right when we went out and do these rallies\nIf there were you said don't bring signs\nBecause we know if there's one son that's out of place if one person makes one sign that has any chance of something that it will be the entire story don't even brings on main street clean up when we when we walk away we want to look we want this or this area to be cleaner than when we got here and time after time after time\nThat happened and they weren't able to show to say it would any evidence that they were violence so here's the thing\nI think we were way ahead but Roger ales told me once he said you're so far ahead of the parade\nYou're about four blocks ahead they can't even see it just be walking by herself high or block the head of the parade you're just so that was his pointer on a stroll that was his point and he said you're so far ahead and I said well I I don't know I'm just doing what I feel is right and he said slow down your way too far ad\nThat was the best advice he ever gave me I never listened to him [laughter] who is good advice and I think you know when we were talking people used to say all the time why you're talking about Martin Luther king why are you talking about Martin Luther king when we went to Birmingham I said I Want everybody here which is a sign that that Martin Luther king thing\nWell there was nobody shouting us down there was nobody doing that and I said on stage\nThere will be there will be there's going to come a time soon where\nYoure going to have to decide there will be the times in our future and you have to decide\nHe'll be the times in our future and you have to decide now\nWe're just ahead imagine doing or imagined doing a rally now we were afraid of the restoring honor rally because if you remember right the black Panthers were going to come\nAnd they were going to engage us well the black Panthers joined with ah with Al Sharpton and they tried they just marched through they didn't cause trouble they just marched through and we let them go\nAnd there's video of people saying good saying says they're saying bad things to us we're saying good things to them now\nAt the time it wasn't like ... in Portland and asked if I wasn't there\nIf you do a rally and is peaceful and and to fall comes to attack and and we're the ones and we don't oh my gosh what am I saying God\nAnd we don't turn away we don't raise a fast\nThat's a different story now and one that people want to hear\nBecause people aren't believing the media anymore and they're seeing these words come out of there are Democrats I'm telling you all over the country that say look I maybe I Believe in abortion but I don't believe in that\nI don't believe in partial birth abortion I don't believe in hey abortion should be you know you should be proud of it go shouted it's great there's nothing wrong with it no\nNormal people look at that on the Democratic side I mean the voter that lives next to you\nThey look and say look I don't want to be involved in those decisions but you know I I'm I don't agree with that I don't agree with that out of compassion medical\nBecause I don't know people's situation yes but if that's your version of the pill and you're proud of it\nThat's a problem that's who America is and they're looking they're looking for a movement\nThey're looking for someone they can stand with who just will call balls and strikes who are not going to say yeah that's right when Donald Trump tweet something stupid to say if it's stupid\nI don't agree with that but when he does something right yeah he did that look at that ha ho balls and strikes that's where America is the first thing we have to do is come together behind\nThose principles I don't care if you are on the Democratic side of the Republican side or the independence I don't care I don't care who you voted for in the past I don't care what you believed in the past\nWhat do you believe now do you believe or on the ropes\nDo you believe this system of government is worth saving do you believe this this capitalism is worth saving do you believe the the scientific method is worth saving\nGreat that led to stand together and put our\nOur differences of approach aside because we've got a lot of work to save this thing right now\n[noise]\nBy the way Gavin has already been silenced on Twitter and invoices don't start coming together uh [noise] more

we've got your news and talk\nOn the number one news on radio network them Ninety seven point by them Ninety four point oh I'm\nGlad that\nI Want to get into the ... case uh that's the case of the Washington Post journalist he was the Saudi citizen he is not you know despite what the journalists will tell you they they leave out the part that he is actually a Muslim Brotherhood and uh\nAnd uh his problem and Saudi Arabia is that they wouldn't\nYou know a protector sanction the Muslim Brotherhood well you know Saudi Arabia knows who the Muslim Brotherhood is um and uh so you had a falling out with the kingdom and then he had to go get a a you know divorce certificate\nHe divorced his wife in Saudi Arabia had to go into the Saudi embassy in just in both turkey\nAnd he disappeared his fiance was waiting for him outside it appears as though the Saudis came landed a jet on the tarmac\nCame with a bunch of empty suitcases and bones saw chopped them up and put them in the suitcases took him out of the embassy put 'em on a plane and he's\nProbably scattered over some desert in Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia said that's out land dish that's crazy yadda yadda Turks went in ah apparently there was a massive cleaning crew that went in right before the Turks could go in and investigate\nAh the some more things were leaked by the FBI or sorry about the CIA et cetera and are now our secretary of state is over with the king of Saudi Arabia and it looks as though they are going to admit\nThat yes they did kill him a but it was an interrogation that just went horribly wrong and we're going to punish all the people that were involved\nIn this so now they're twenty four episode oh it's it's crazy you know that this is I mean this is honestly rear window Alfred Hitchcock this exactly Alfred Hitchcock with somebody said it's sitting outside\nGoing wait I I I think they chop her up in that case it's a woman I think they dropped her up and then took her away in the middle of the night and there was like no that's crazy ... yep turns out it was and\nUh and it's the same thing here somebody sitting outside going I think they've chopped them up and took a mountain suitcases that it is the Hitchcock\nRear window and this is obviously gone very arrive for the Saudis because you don't do things like this and expect to admit to and interrogation gone wrong two weeks later like did something you do and you deny me Russia does this all the time they're constantly killing\nJournalism and like I don't even know who I don't even know what that was what is ... ... am I've never even heard of the thing and you know like that that\nTheir pattern and they never admitted if Saudi Arabia actually comes out of the ... yeah we kind of killed that journalists that's a big moment or in you know geopolitics that's not a it's not a tiny thing today\nOr how today or tomorrow the way the president answered Saudi Arabia when when they admit to doing this this is an ally\nA this is one of our bigger backers this is probably our best friend next to Israel in the middle east\nThey stand against a lot of the stuff that we stand against there are a big supporter now of Israel um we're in a proxy war in Yemen with most people don't even know that but we're fighting a war in Yemen\nAt their request and they're fighting with us um they keep Iran at bay\nWe're about to sell them a whole load of arms they also don't money into our tech industry ... right now because of this um they also dump a lot of money into our banking system a\nHillside that cool or herb that what we should say that's ... pretty sweet shore okay the or predict that we know that they don't want to ask the or why hasn't anyone interview the or about this incident notice how the orbits\nAre showing me stuff inside of it [laughter] stuff inside of how they ... they hide\nSo um what is the president do what do we do this why you don't get involved in these things\nBecause it's none of our business I mean I don't want it to be any of our business I don't want to have our whole economy and everything else hinge on what they just did we don't like that we don't want to endorse it we don't want to be anywhere near it\nCertainly feels different but couldn't help me quantify the difference here for a minute\nThese regimes are killing people all the time\nYes we know that things are happening all the time and you know Saudi Arabia is not an innocent of these things yes is it just because it's a journalist is it just because it was on foreign territory in and empathy is it just because you know like the Washington Post really cares what happened to this guy so therefore it's become a big issue\nA and I think uh you probably wind up\nAs a president with everything that you have to a deal with I mean I think it's okay to take a stand and say you know the sort of stuff can happen anymore we still have relations with a lot of a lot of countries who have done much worse than having killing one journalist is added that is I mean this is you know then I remember\nAll over the world this isn't this guy is not just a journalist he is a he is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood that's really the problem\nHere is that uh they believe that he was um you know helping the Muslim Brotherhood against Saudi Arabia\nYou know helping the Muslim Brotherhood against Saudi Arabia and possibly even helping the Muslim Brotherhood here in the United states so he's not just a journalist this that let's let's\nLet's clear that up this isn't in Saudi Arabia them that's really yeah and it's not that they were killing him because he was a journalist but because of his ties to the Muslim Brotherhood right think\nI mean it's you know it's literally impossible to be able to judge all the moving parts behind the scenes that we don't know about right and you know this is why you know this is why you hire a president that you trust and and you know this is why you vote right because it's the situations that we we noticed with Bush I mean you you met with him during the war\nAnd he informed view of nothing a top secret or anything but a lot of the different uh things that you had to consider when making these decisions\nAnd you know it's easy to say well we should just never talked to Saudi Arabia again and throw them out there is a lot of things behind the scenes that they're doing for example helping in the fight against terrorism they've been\nA while obviously as we all know nine eleven or many of the people came from Saudi Arabia and there's been all sorts of questions on that and we talked about distancing ourselves for a long time and this is probably a great opportunity to do that a little bit\nUm but you know there's there have been they've also arrested and killed a lot of terrorists uh that have insisted us over the years as well um on on those efforts so\nI it's a tough one I think you have to\nYou have to send a signal you have to make sure I think probably sanctions or something if this is actually a proven um you have to you have to do something publicly but you look at I mean Russia's done terrible things like that and we haven't uh\nHaven't uh acted a anymore\nNot selling arms to Russia\nNo no it's not selling arms to Russia and you know the idea that OK well arms sales help job does not agree argument [laughter] this is the one thing that we have to we can't really consider the economy first when you're talking about arms sales yeah um but I yeah\nI think taking that step of of probably sanctions and maybe that's what it is maybe it's arms um is\nThis going to be important really really important decision for us for the president Glenda [noise] um first I go back in history and I look at uh the Archduke Ferdinand moment\nBecause this is the exact kind of moments of the world thinks is no big deal that could spiral out of control so quickly mhm um I send my secretary of state over which is exactly\nWhat Trump did yesterday um like gather all of the evidence and then I Am as strong as I possibly can uh understanding and weighing everything a that is currently going on trying not to\nWeaken them but not necessarily empower them a as well and try to get myself out of it in a long term strategy of getting away from the bad guys\nAnd and I think you know we're both going back and forth a little bit because we just don't know what's going on behind the scenes but not enough information and make this decision logical but will say is that while I Am not a fan at all of this slogan American America First\nAnd I think it has a terrible history I'm In this situation\nThat is your priority here is to make sure that whatever happens is whatever is in America's Best interest you can't start a war you can start um uh you can't go crazy and to just to make a statement if the long term effect of this is a negative\nFor the United states we've seen this with uh North Korea right like I mean North Korea you could make a serious argument that ... I don't think\nTrump wants to go out there in the ... are you talking about how he loves Kim Jong lunar publicly I think he thinks that the best way to avoid\nNegative consequences and if we're if I got to say a bunch of words it's better good\nWe were saying last night on the news the white matters again South Korea of the time to take care of that was under the Bush administration we didn't\nOr Clinton your Clinton now we didn't do it and now you're in a situation where you have no good options well welcome to the world that we ourselves created or allowed it to be created forests same situation in Saudi Arabia let me go to Chad quickly in South Carolina Hello Chad\nMorning how are you doing good very good do are you doing good how are you doing great\nOr just let it you know or how much I'm enjoying the book addicted outrage so far I've only gotten to a chapter three 'cause I like girlfriends just made a book yesterday uh I just want to tell you so relate of all the ... as you open up and say describe yourself as an optimistic a catastrophe\nBut [laughter] I I I\nCould not relate to that a more you do you have trouble\nAre showing people may be the silver lining whenever you're highlighting a negative aspects that are behind it are all of the ways that you can improve and uh uh I think it's a great book so far and I'm looking forward to reading the rest of it but I'd like to get an autograph\nI I just yeah I just made one to you Jen will set it off in the mail I'm chatting it'd be a favorite call me when you're done I'd like to hear what you think at the end\nOkay All right thanks a lot but like All right are a sponsor\nOkay All right thanks a lot but like\nAll right are a sponsor this half hour we want to thank American financing for making this program\nAll home sales have slowed down heading into fall but not for first time homebuyers they actually account for fifty five percent of the mortgages that have been originating now so to keep up with the first time homebuyers entering the market\nYou need a reliable lender that can process you're alone super fast and that is American financing\nThey offer dedicated mortgage consultants and an inhouse underwriting team to secure financing for your dream home ASAP they'd been in business since Nineteen Ninety nine they have stellar reviews on Google Zillow Bebe you name it\nSo if you're looking to buy\nYou need American financing give them a call today American financing dot net eight hundred nine zero six twenty four forty that's eight hundred nine zero six twenty four forty clothes on your house quickly get the rate loan for you American financing dot net\nAmerican financing corporation and the last one to three three or four WWW dot in the Midwest consumer excess dot org [noise]\nOkay you're a busy business person you're trying to hire somebody and\nYou've got a job site that it's just overwhelming you with tons of the wrong resumes that's smart here's what he is smart zip recruiter dot com slash back unlike other job sites zip recruiters doesn't wait for the candidates to find you it goes out and\nFind them for you zip recruiter dot com slash back has powerful matching technology that scans thousands of resumes identify people\nWith the right skills the right education and experience for your job and then invites them to apply so you get\nQuality candidates and the qualified people through the door first and you don't have to sort through things because\nThey already do that and they highlight the best people it's no wonder that zip recruiters rated number one by employers in the U.S right now you can try it for free at this exclusive Web address it zip recruiter dot com slash back that zip recruiter dot com slash B.

I think now for four years straight they have\nI been honored to be a judge and it's just really fun and so it's Saturday ... from one it's just three PM and um all the donations ... county sheriff cannot foundations are encouraged and they'll be you'll be doing a a demonstration I assume there I have\nI'm John Wilson from the sharp canine unit Hello John\nHello everybody thank you for having me and we have John ... who's the president of the foundation\nOver ... thank you for having\nOver ... such a pleasure and look after the break we'll talk more about the the foundation and lots of talk about another event that you're having coming up in November which is always fun and it's the canine car show which takes place at in for a hobby was talk about that\nPeople get the dog the dogs and the cars and find out which one could drive best yeah back then\nUm so again for those have you with with um with pets this is always a really fun fun event and I just saw the woman the hour with big hat\nAbout the bond between the dark as you train together right you go somewhere and you get professional training\nThis is my second dog my first dog I got a from Europe\nAnd have it pretty much trained on then I had to catch up to him and we did go to an academy together and we got caught up\nThe dog I got this time is actually from Guadalajara, Mexico he's a Belgium alum all just like my last dog\nBut we source them out of a through canine services in New Mexico where they got him from Mexico and he knew nothing and and I'm an older guy now and I didn't want him out and walk because they are very high dry dog so I kind of wanted a more mellow dog like a German Shepherd\nBut I saw this guy and he was just fresh out of the kennel and he was stinky and captain\nBut there was just something about him and we did bond and you really got to be a dog lover to be a dog handler and so we went to New Mexico for seven weeks we lived in a hotel\nAnd we went to New Mexico for seven weeks we lived in a hotel together another handler and his dog and uh I I he wasn't even potty trained he was sixteen months old and we've been together for about a year now and he's probably the best canine I've ever I've seen on the certainly the best dog I've ever\nHad and usually what happens is you know that you you go on and you have your career and then when that dog retires he's your dog right\nYes generally what would happen is when I retire hopefully dog will retire with me and it goes before the county board or to prove whether he can retire because he technically he's county equipment but ah he's he's my buddy and he bonds with my dogs I have a Chihuahua a little while who hates\nHim you know ... you know how to our but a dog in my lab just they're they're the\nBest of friends so um and he doesn't get free reign of a house like the other dogs 'cause you've got to be ready to work and if he's having too much fun at home he's not going to want to go jumping the car so\nI mean like ... yeah ... years and but when\nHe's not working uh he he's got his his harnesses and its color and everything he knows when those come on it's time to go to work and he jumps in the car and he's ready to go\nTo the exact tell tell us about a story about something that happened that was a successful take down I don't know what the correct um verbiage is to\nWell one of the things that the sheriff a share ... said that these dogs belong to everybody\nSo if a national parks needs to dog if Bullhead PT needs a dog or we're going to come and I got a call one day where the Bullhead PT had somebody run down the gate at the Emmy see yard up at the top of ray Moore\nAnd they uh had a lady had they knew it was a female she ran into the yard they didn't know she was injured or or what the deal was and they'd been looking for for a uh I I think well over an hour they I was out to dinner or one of their officers that called me I went home suited up ... doc out\nAnd are these dogs are certified in narcotics so they can find all those orders but they're also certified in area searches building searches and and criminal apprehension so I took doc out and I gave them the command go search this is a very very large yard up there and within five minutes she found her wow\nSo that's amazing how many jobs are there are at the ... in the county right\nNow we have for life and ah hopefully somewhere after the first of the year or jeopardy release just retired we had and so we're looking at least add one more\nThat's awesome springs I sent Shelley into this conversation and tell us what you do for the foundation\nWell my background is I you know ... retired deputy from Saint Paul Minnesota and I was on the board of St Paul please canine foundation moved down to ... city\nAh John ... Doug Schuster was running for sure that's how I got involved he found out I was on the board in St Paul he said can you help us stronger foundation here in ... city in the Mojave cardio and I said well absolutely but I had to interview him first 'cause I didn't know if I liked him or [laughter]\nOr turns out I really respect and love the guy that and so I made a commitment to do this we put the board together um community people\nAnd of course we have you know great backing a people like even ... uh we have a lot of volunteers that do a lot of stuff but what are the questions that people ask me what are these dogs to what they've done\nAnd the real important thing is you look at a dog and you think biked okay everybody says bite and of course we do demos he puts a sleeve on white suit and they get the bike they get to apprehend\nBut only ten percent of those dogs take bites in here the other Ninety percent is what narcotics um how about finding all ... patients really how about finding lost kids\nDid you take them out I search and rescue as soon as when you guys go out there\nCoordinate with search and rescue on occasion although they have the primary responsibility but you know John was talking about mutual aid or when somebody calls for a dog like Bullhead or king or someplace we're going to have a doctor to help apprehend or find a lost people\nAnd so you know the primary focus is what his community and like John says the community ... canine foundation purchase of the dogs the dogs cost about eight thousand dollars apiece and it cost about four thousand dollars to train them\nWithin their the property of the county of my hobby\nSo as John stated we support the equipment we support the veterinarian cause we support the food\nSupport the equipment we support the veterinarian cause we support the food carts\nAnd I've got to commend this community I moved here from Minnesota and I have never seen people get together not just for Keener and foundation but for other charities this community gets together and helps whatever they need to do cancer\n... the most giving the I've come from big cities and you know given our demographics and uh it's it's amazing the that's why we love it so much yeah All right so we have another that we want to talk about as well in case you can't come to Halloween let's talk about the canine car show\nJohn you went to ...\nI'd like to hear about this one is to figure out what it is [laughter] well this was one of our uh beginning events this started several years ago\nUm with Karen and Chuck paint is many many years ago when I had my first dog and they wanted to do something to help raise funds for the canines and they started this car show at Mojave marketplace joined Ninety five\nOr several years ago and it turned out to be an outstanding fundraiser force\nA and over the years it's raised a tens of thousands of dollars for the canine program\nAnd just a prior to share Schuster taking over it went away for a while and it since come back and this will be our second year that it's returned and basically what it is as its cage nine car show\nIt's a large car show that raises money specifically for the Mojave county sheriff's office canine a foundation\nAnd uh I don't know what the total from last year was what was the first year we brought it back and it did very well and we usually get well over a hundred cars out their cars and motorcycles not nine thousand dollars telling me last year the first year back we raised over nine thousand\nI tell everybody where it is and what it is it's a joy\nIn Ninety five is the Texaco a gas station or it'll be what November for John November for the first Sunday or in November and that's the place with the crispy crunchy chicken\nThey got that legislation and you ask anybody a chicken was a matter of fact\nWhen I had a the sheriff meet with some of the uh the uh foundation people he tried their chicken and he raved about it I really enjoy\nIt let's go back to the dogs we miss out on the chicken Terri Hi well anyways if you've got\nPeople bring out bicycles they bring out motorcycles they bring out cars we don't care what you bring out it's just about going out and having fun and then they have an auction or if they have a fifty fifty rap all a they have all kinds of prizes and everything out there it's just they are a really good time and it's something where you can bring your family your kid\nAnd there'll be ... and they'll say in another there'll be more demonstrations stuff like this Saturday and this is the\nThe one event every year we can guarantee all our dogs\nThat fat that's fabulous all the dogs I'll put this on my Facebook page now that would be great so you have two opportunities\nTo meet the John ... and even at the Halloween pet\nParade um Halloween costume party and at this canine car show um we have a minute left what do you want to tell them how how can people give even if they can't be at these events\nWell I I can tell you how you can give if you see me out on the street and say Hi I bring out dark anytime someone asked me to bring dark out and his favorite thing to do is is we're at the uh um the safety fair this weekend and playing tug of war are with kids\nOr he's not a pet her but I'm going to give you over to to uh Mr San Shelley and he will give you more information on how to donate to the foundation\nOkay well he just gave me something donations program our tax deductable as my hobby county sharks canine foundation is a five on the three nonprofits can I get out there you have any questions about the foundation or you'd like to give please contact John Kelly at six five one she didn't seven zero zero nine to zero thirty seconds left the\nThing on our list to take\nUs to talk about your role as the rotary an advisor from a hobby high school\nWill boy don't you just I don't know how to say no [laughter] I think I my an article it'd be the youngest member yeah and I take on the big issue has so interact um is dear to my heart and not only because I have a junior in high school\nThat is involved in interact but because I really do truly believe that the youth is our future\nAnd we need to teach them how to lead give them the tools and then let them go out there and conquer the world\nAnd what better way to do it and little Bullhead city so interact is actually a branch they're sponsored by rotary Bullhead city rhetoric\nAnd they do just a lot of service projects throughout the year not just community wise but also internationally which I think it's such a testament to let these kids know you ... you can touch the local level but it's not that hard to do international either so rotary\nAs an international a civic organization and they do they they are almost I'm singularly responsible for um\nI'm singularly responsible for\nA eradicating polio ... around the world yeah and then what super cool as we have a program called crutches for Africa\nWhich is actually it was founded by one of our interact members\nUm as far as an international program our interest here yes often ... by um by a McDonald's sister and her two sisters I have one and interact right now and last year I had one that graduated what crutches for Africa is we actually collect mobility devices throughout the whole year\nAnd then we take a trip to Kenya over the summer and we deliver these mobility divided and yeah I have not I'm not that lucky but I Do have students that has\nUm and so they go to Africa and they deliver these mobility devices to people that have literally crawled on their hands on their whole life because they've been struck him by polio and they don't have access to the simplest\nThing I don't know why I haven't seen the stories about that so we cover it locally in the newspaper when it comes to ... that actually is ... he is phenomenal and ... and he is and he this is his passion he is\nOne of the people that help us actually pick up he's willing to come to your home um so the kids get very involved in this and then they go to Kenya [noise]\nAnd do they do they get stuff like that wheelchair to wheelchair all your other anything that's no bill and and you get is how do you ship it there as you get that donate it yeah so we get it\nDonated American warehouse furniture as actually partnering with us here so it's super I mean it's just an amazing thing that these kids get to do we out of all of Arizona John Doe and yet I have a whole show and what's so need is out of all of Arizona we've had two kids two years in a row go from a hobby high school which is unheard of\nI mean little Mojave high school you don't really realize all of the accomplishments that are coming out of that school so because it's just you hear\nYou only hear the you know even at so sad 'cause I walked those campus I walked that campus everyday and I see these stories and it's just a phenomenal thing so crutches for Africa\nUm if you have any questions everybody is more than welcome to contact me I'd love to give them more information we collect year round but will actually launched the collection in November like we're will bring out all the information we're going to do door hangers and\nSo all the mobility devices will take them out that's that's fantastic fighting and then I have a a officer this year that's doing a red Sam's project\nWhich is I'm In an effort to kind of bring awareness to\nThe sex trafficking that's going on in America and that was her idea I really like these kids kind of come up with their own ideas how they want to make a difference\nAnd then I just give them the tools and I let them run so what\nThey learn you know that was something I was a little surprised about it\nWas something in the Republican platform\nUm we have people within the G O P here in Arizona who are working hard with the governor it was part of the things that\nWe don't realize what a big thing is here and uh you know along the ice forty court or it's um it's a huge problem and um so what do you do you educate the teens on how to spot and how to help it and yes and educate others\n... all of the above and then we even bring it more to a local level so I just really want these kids to research it to understand that they're not above it happening even to them even though we live in a small community and these kids might think oh you know it's somewhere out there it's not going to hurt us\nThere ... there are cases that happened very close to a very close to us that the kids need to be aware of and they always need to look out\nFor ... years without excessive resources in order to bother\nExactly when I hear about it because I'm falls and some of the social services world and it didn't you know their hotel for needles and\nUm you know and and to know what to look for I've heard success stories just because of these educational programs what to look for the signs and and it could be something so subtle of the way someone looks at you and um there's it's a wonderful program\nAnd my my son actually brought attention to the fact that most people thinks think it's just girls but really boys are just as much of a target as a girl if not more because they're never really paid attention\nRail so exactly so that a lot of ... it's a great thing to it's not hasn't really been spoken about and it needs to be and I'm like I said I was surprised when I first heard but it's a big it's a big issue and there are some great people taking it on so we've\nGot a minute and a half left in this segment and so on the other side of the break I'm like I said in the beginning my friend care is um as you can tell she's a go getter she's a mover and the shaker so\nShe's going to be she's already talked about the possibility of running for office um for a school\nThat I not that it was followed by the way that I may have that but we're a little for we're a little further out we have an election coming up so [noise] but\nOf that but we're a little for we're further out we have an election coming up so but I have to make it like to hear about some of the issues that you think is important um in what maybe the candidates who are running this year should be concentrating on I saw that\nThe um scorecard for the schools came out yeah have you seen that I had I had thought about that okay All
