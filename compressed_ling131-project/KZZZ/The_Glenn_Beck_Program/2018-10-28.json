places I Would like to go with you I'm In and talked to senator about we're going to run out of time uh I Would like to invite you to do a um an hour and a half uninterrupted podcast with means under when you have time\nUm because I think your voice needs to be hurt and understood\nAnd parts of it challenged I'm sure but uh I Would like to just pick up on this point so the number one driver of happiness is vocation your one guy that will understand that if that's true in the next ten years we're in deep trouble\n[noise] we're headed toward a really interesting time in human history and it's scary and fascinating so somebody some people shorthand for this of the ... the economy I think the simpler way to think about it is just um the average duration of people's jobs or their relationship at a firm is going to get shorter than ever before in human history\nSo let's go macro for a minute hunter gatherers throughout most of human history\nYou don't have any conception of what your job is you pursue that buffalo right and then ten thousand years ago people settled down and started planting and harvesting and we began to farm on a on a regular cycle and from ten thousand years ago to a hundred and fifty years ago nobody had job choice they just did with grandma and grandpa mom and dad and aunts and uncles had ever had done forever\nEternity past with the industrial revolution we get jobs specialization\nAnd it was really disruptive but when people took a job\nThey still kept it till death of retirement not everybody graduated high school at the beginning of the industrial revolution by the end almost everybody does\nBut you still get one job that sometime between Fifteen and twenty two years old and you keep it for all of your life I was born in the Nineteen seventies average duration at a farm for a primary breadwinner then it was still twenty six years now it's four years and getting shorter and it's got to get shorter forever more\nMcKenzie a farm I used to work with believes that fifty percent of the American labor market by three years from now this is not Twenty years in the future three years from now they take fifty percent of the labor market will be primarily freelancers\nMeaning that most people will cobble together a bunch of different jobs not all of them are going to be ap enabled tech jobs like being a new driver with the right software that makes you more efficient than an old school Gabby but\nWhat's really going to happen is we're going to head toward a world where people are going to get disrupted out of their jobs at age forty and forty five and fifty and fifty five\nForever more we've never ever done that in human history and so it means all of the banks of what's often called now the quarter life crisis\nThe sort of late adolescence crisis of trying to figure out your your role in life and how do you go from just being a consumer and mom and dad's house to be in a producer that can not just put bread on the table for your kids but can actually have a sense of meaning that you're serving your neighbor that disruption\nThat most people know in late adolescence\nWorking experience that again every three to five years for our whole life and that means there's a lot of new potential for upheaval and frankly for unhappiness there's going to be more economic output\nThan it's ever been produced before in human history but it's not at all clear that it will redound to the median family and the median household and the media and worker or going to have to become a civilization of lifelong workers able to get retrained when you're forty nobody's ever done that before\n[laughter] okay so there's about an hour of questions or just on on that one uh but I've got about three minutes left can you give me a is your\nTake on the first real political upheaval that we're going to see that I think by twenty twenty you could change everything could start global war deep fakes\nYeah so one of the reasons I wrote them is because I spent a lot of time on intelligence issues and I'm In the intel community there are people who talk about the perfect storm of deep facts that we have coming and the storm is these three ingredients number one\nEnemies doing malicious act or you know information warfare since the beginning of time you can find it in proverbs in college he asks these ah to sow discord in an enemies tent but he used to require a prostitute and the honey trapping effect business partner and a bribery scheme\nAnd more for you to get people around people number one\nIs now we can use technology to surround someone and give them a fake experience and deep audio and video or audio and fake video\nThat are going to seem really gonna make that possible number to Russia is already trying this constantly against us they're just bad at it the real reason we need to take that Russia type investigations so seriously us because China's right behind them\nRunning scout team often I'm On them and ready to do\nBig the fakes a hybrid war information operations against American leaders in business officials and the public at large and number three we have so many internal divisions about geography about race about um gender about guns there are many many issues where Americans are so divided\nThat we are susceptible to these kind of campaigns like Russia is already trying to run on social media they're just not very good at it where they try to exacerbate and inflame tensions on every side of every issue the NFL and the controversy majority of the stuff on line on social media in the first Seventy two hours after that flamed\nLast fall the majority of it on both sides stand for the anthem and taking the NFL most of it was Russian on both sides\nThat so we're going to have a world where you're going to have things like the Kavanaugh hearings where all of a sudden the audio will appear of Schumer strategizing with Michael ...\nOr video will appear it'll be fake but video will appear and it'll be Kavanaugh party in art as an undergrad at Yale it'll be fake\nBut in our echoed silo chambers of the way we consume media right now it's gonna be\nA potentially much more divisive than what we know today and so one of the reasons I wanted to write to them or why we hate each other is an awareness that there is actually national security exposures for this country and how much we ate each other around politics we need communities of people that live\nIn the same neighborhood that believe lots of stuff in common even when we differ on politics\n\nHow can we can't get anybody in Washington or in the media to talk about this than\nAh it took us what twenty five minutes to unpack some of it and the business model is selling soap three minutes from now is let's just say who the bad guy is you know there's there's some that job somewhere in a McDonald's right now who probably slap to an old man wearing a mock a hat and uh that\nPerson is a weirdo and did something wrong but they don't actually stand in for all the bait and that's really the way we're consuming most of our media right now is that kind of not pecking\nAnd so it's harder to do ten and twenty five year out issues but that's that's that's the strategic stuff that Washington should be focused on\nHow are you going to do that when you have well we've got three I've got thirty seconds I'm not getting even ask you not even ask you I Would like to ask you to come down a band and and really unpack this uh because I think your voice needs to be heard and understood and I think in soundbites\nUm it's not the not always understood I'm so thank you very much\nFor the invite good to be with you on that\nSenator Ben Sasse um why we hate each other and how to heal I really wanted
