I Will point this out and I put this pointed this out to Trump supporters one of the main reasons Trump got elected was his list of Twenty one Supreme Court nominees we all agree on that right yes okay we'll\nGo back and fight go back and she doesn't sixteen search for the Twenty one nominees for the Supreme Court that Donald Trump names and two dozen sixteen search set list for Brett Kavanaugh name so there you're not going to find it on there because it was added after he got elected now\nLook so it's likely to\nKnow Mike Lee was on the phone was he on the furloughs I'm the first place yeah the point being that he got elected because he said I'm going to pick from the list now if he had gone through twenty Supreme Court or Twenty one Supreme Court justices I could say OK needs some new people\nWhy he needed needed to expand that list and Amy Coney Barrett it was on the expansion as well why you need to expand that list after you get elected I don't know\nBut they decided to do that and that's where Kavanaugh is and I know I had to point it was going to but I Do not remember yeah I don't I don't think I mean even interested in it\nI don't care if you're interested in trying

remember that five days before the election of two thousand sixteen I predicted Trump would wherever I predict it because people didn't like Hillary Clinton would stay home I mean a that was my best that I ever did in ... right now I Am feeling it everywhere I go I Know a lot of people that I'm Around\nOkay that the regular folks know this was a sham and they know the cabin on his family were damaged very badly by people who didn't care to seek the truth they know that\nThat I think will play out at all politics but you got to remember is a powerful powerful corrupt lobby that is driving me to thing and the media is like\nWhat ... what was like this is still a brand new but then the second\nMr Grassley\nHis hair was that I I Believe okay also Jim mishaps\nAnd um you have to understand that the media in conjunction with the fanatics Israel and powerful powerful to drive\nSay San ... hold on to stop hold on\nJust or hell or she's now\n... now yes being in the big one Mr and\nMrs Hyde

scale for asking\nInstrument into almost there\nOr the summer and I agree\nSilence so we do nothing Murphy will know soon wouldn't\nYou know we didn't know on a mansion or Murkowski those are the two very interesting\nWhen is it strange I'm watching all of the networks and none of them are catching the votes so no one is\nYeah north of New York times or we're looking at all the sites right now to see what the nobody knows\nWe don't know yet yeah yeah well that's the kind of has a\nYou know they're going to the closed debate and um then they'll both tomorrow and I do believe a Kavanaugh will be confirmed [noise] um nobody wants to be on the wrong side of this and the winds are blowing against the Democrats now the way things have shifted\nA listener named the wind shifting don't you think I mean this the first time I've ever seen this tactic by the Democrats backfire on them\nI don't know the Clarence Thomas stuff was pretty rough um and I think that\nA African Americans at the time were pretty angry about it\nBut it that of course a dissipated once he got on a court the question is if Kavanaugh is confirmed Willis all go away we'll people just say okay the good guys one and then we're not\nReal are interested in punishing the Democrats I don't think so anymore I don't think I I just think people are so furious either gonna you're gonna take it out on\nThe ... I think the Democrats\nThink that they can for all these these\nUm activist they really think that they can you know half of them you know turn 'em on and turn them off no I Know they do but I think they're approaching a time when they're not going to be able to turn them off\nA ... I don't see it that way in which is very well organized you're going to get individuals that confront people in restaurants or ... like that you're going to have that and somebody might get hurt\nBut on the organized for these people are very disappointed and there's about a dozen organizations now where money is flooding in to disrupt the process on the part of the far left\nThan by some um some news Iraq\nYet with um one thing a couple things here are Collins one of the big ones are yes\nI'm like so yeah and in the ass\nYes ... and\n... so yeah and in the ass so\nI'm I'm sure Murkowski was a yes and mansion I don't know that that's an interesting\nOr in the middle of looking at that right now ah and bill do you think that they just overplayed their hand oh yeah I really feel like they could have had it they could have had Murkowski they could have had Collins if they really played that seriously but instead they overplay their hand to an incredible generally\nAbsolutely and they didn't have what they didn't have 'em look I went through this and and and all the all of a sudden I Everytime I turned around there was somebody else and a law widely did this\nWas a true mhm\nAll right so what they thought would that more people were going to come out\nAnd and for the finger at him and and or somebody was going to bolster Ford's party state but I was at that party and I saw this happen what do they have the loop through it out there that fresh accepted\nIt as fact and made it easier for people to come through and then you add an avid ... and all these other crazy people piling on and and the and the left said look this is what usually happens but here um you know with the FBI involvement and you know pretty strong statement by Kavanaugh\nCapital shaved himself ... to ... you know one of the things that I couldn't do in a way to save myself because they didn't want they being Fox need to address it yes\nA gay I couldn't save myself cabin or did\nIn a we had a ... I live with turned it it does look like a rock show mansion has voted yes on Kavanaugh\nSays that means that Kavanaugh or that ... got to vote to confirm him ... and the reason Manchin is doing that is because if he voted against cap it off that he might lose the\nElection of West Virginia how stupid\nWe do have one no vote from Lisa Murkowski so Murkowski it out a mansion is in playing in Collins is in a this would just should be enough for him to get confirmed\nHere because of it too tight pants breaks it correct Murkowski if Murkowski votes against Kavanaugh she threw in the Republican Party\nShe's finished yeah I don't get a nickel I'm from any Republican and I believe that she her Senate career will be over I think the people of Alaska very conservative state will throw her out\nDo you think Joe or do you think a bill that we have with the um with Murkowski the situation where she knew it was going to go through we wanted to vote no was able to vote no because she knew they had to fifty votes\n[noise] doesn't matter just a no vote going he goes to every single one of her colleagues\nMhm\nIsolates her and puts her as a poli a word of the day\nFor ... uh in the Republican Party saying\nThat that's an amazing situation I didn't think Murkowski was put her entire career risk ... over this but I'm fairly chef\nSo she could vote yes tomorrow\nHow how though she's voting not to advance the nomination to the floor\nWell now she voted yes I Want to confirm it\nBecause I didn't think that it should go forward but now it's gone forward and so now I'm going to because a lot of people are calling my office and I'm afraid I'm afraid for my career I Do I'm going to vote yes\nMaybe but uh I uh that's a pretty tough line\nOn yeah I don't think I'm going to do it\nAnd it's interesting point him in that one of the most shocking vote result of that I can remember my entire lifetime was Lisa Murkowski beating Joe Miller on a write in ballot or in that Senate campaign in several years ago does Alaska reward Murkowski after this with another election I mean I don't I don't\nThink so I think so they are very independent they are conservative but they're very independent and uh and will lead in the bill thanks so much Bill O'Reilly dot of a good weekend you guys will talk to you next week alright [noise] let me tell you about the greatest chair of all time\nIs the next year or the next year is a an office chair I have for uh my other studio we had to get another chair for the studio\nBought the next year they have become advertisers are in the in the around the same time and now we have them in here as well as difference I was sitting in the yesterday I was doing the live TV show\nAnd I'm sitting in a chair and I thought this is the most comfortable chair I think I've ever sent him for an office chair where you're you know you want to be supported and set up I mean you know I don't know if you've tried the cloud which is this the worst looking couch ever a because it just looks like a bean bag chair but it's really really comfortable with no support\nThat's comfortable this is great if you are sitting in it for work because you're just sitting up naturally you're sitting up straight and supportive and comfortable and it looks great too\nWife and everywhere in between listening to one of the cameras Tennessee stations right now just like you are you saw the triple a triple C I said well you know do you do for them to ...\nEvery car hone in on radios and work ... do you live and local personality huge weather reports to the\nLocal deals and events around tells you all on your local Germans broadcasting radio station do you want to get the word algae Ninety two percent of the people that tries to just let us know there's a\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] I read the men and women Marines\nAmerican way of life [noise]\n[noise]\nA Fox News alerts a turning point in the U.S Senate and the ... confirmation now considered likely\nFor the Supreme Court nominee who picked up two crucial votes today made Republican\nSusan Collins up through a link the floors speech includes she will vote in favor of judge Brett Kavanaugh for a Supreme Court seat\nThe allegation fail to me the more likely than not standard\nCollins says the presumption of innocence plus a lack of cooperation in sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh do not fairly prevent him from serving on the court\nShortly after Collins made her announcement another undecided Senate or West Virginia Democrat Joe mansion said he too will vote for Kavanaugh both announcements likely secure enough support for Kavanaugh before Saturday confirmation\nVote Fox's Jared health right on Capitol Hill where protesters have been keeping up the pressure on him camping outside Collins' office others confronting mention\nThat the White House is praising Collins show is former President George H W.

doing by the way if they need Danes are going to delayed Ollie until it comes back oh jeez delayed the vote\nWell only if they need them right now that doesn't look like they need it and we should be clear about that um it looks like it would be fifty to forty nine easy thing to do you could just it doesn't have to be tomorrow it to no\nNo they can relate till Sunday yeah ... yeah or Monday but there's that risk of like you know some new accusation without a crazy thing that happens you know with the Democrats will try right yeah a ... there is a risk there there is a risk there [noise] but I mean I Am I missing my daughter's wedding yeah\nI don't I Can't see myself missing my daughters can\nEither yeah I mean that's your first responsibility your family\nKnow so if we're the\n... values party right like if that's what we really are you\n... if you would understand that Mm signing I'm married in Montana\nAnd it would be really frustrating though if you lost the Supreme Court justice huh a feeling of a wedding [laughter] you know that's that was my first I Would I mean like that it would be really if you lost that in a good Supreme Court justice over a wedding\nThat would be pressure that wedding changes would you want your wedding to be the thing that changed the course of American history I wouldn't do do you almost want to delay your wedding yeah you'd be like dad go vote I don't want that responsibility on my back over our heads for the rest of our lives I think it was on\nFriends when they say that you know it's just basically just a party and the the the bride to be that if you say it's a party one more time you will not be invited right like it's not a party in ... really important and if your daughter and you're going through that\nYou got to have your data he wants a Walker down the aisle and I mean there's nothing more you could say about we always talk about how these people are just like political robots like this is a real person with a real daughter with a real priority and we're in a way I really feel like wow that's it's amazing that he's willing to take that stand in his motives\nBut here's the but here's the thing though also looking again from the daughters standpoint\nWould you want your marriage to start\n[noise] no it's the calving off in one way or another known in this country should probably get death threats oh she

put it in reality I don't think that I have the correct math problem the main street the means for his money mostly just drive by shootings [laughter]\nIt is sitting there are a good chunk of the country though I Know that we saw the other day of a major\nYou know quote unquote bipartisan agreement on opioids the vote was Ninety eight to one\nIn the Senate and the one vote was Mike Lee he was the no on the villain\nAnd mad if that doesn't make me hesitated and wonder what the hell out of their own you know I mean I oh yeah the\nNervous I mean if Mike Lee is voting no on something it's not like Mike Lee doesn't drug victims right and I can I just say I'm Sorry pat\nHas a guy who lives in excruciating pain in his whole life as me a guy who has woken up on the operating table they cannot keep me down my body doesn't process that stuff\nLike other people and I woke up in the middle of surgery scared the hell out of the anesthesiologist but but woken up they can't keep it may take it takes fentanyl to keep me down so\nAh I sure do appreciate those drugs so yeah I just did an interview with um [noise]\nOh shoot from the five he's a friend of ours are ... ... did the first interview with him about his son and opioids and everything else it's a how our full powerful interview\nBut his stance now is those all should be banned they should not make them at all the old opioid any opioids should be banned that he should not be even a veil of all to anybody I disagree with that is so wrong yeah it was summer example a ... it may have ... to live\nIn it it makes life miserable\nYou can you can handle getting through your daily activities otherwise you'd be curled up at a ball and pains\nYou can handle getting through your daily activities otherwise you'd be curled up at a ball and pain somewhere and you'd ... you'd you'd end up killing your uh usually would perfect yeah yeah or if you if you don't have that I mean it doesn't even it doesn't even negate all the pain it just may not\nCare yeah you just don't carry your skill in pain you just don't care as\nManaging and there does seem to be a legitimate medical use for a lot of people to use opioids in that if you had an abuse is different than you\nYou can get addicted yeah do I can't hit and you can do your body gets only normal your body gets addicted and it's held to get off of it\nI don't know about you but my doctors are really vigilant on by their ... oh my gosh they are they they've gotten ... absolutely not see ask about yet\nAnd I know you're a doctor because we we have the same back Dr and we were talking about it and I I always\nBring you up 'cause he's always when I bring you up easily because I'll always say patties in so much and he's like I think he's one of the worst\nPain patients that I have he's like I I don't know how he does it um and so we always talk about it and he's told me that his his the government is coming down on opioids into hard yeah it's like I don't know how people like pat are going to really I mean yes going to be hard it's going to be hard\nAnd they're you know you got to do drug testing in almost every time now almost every time you have to make sure you're not doctor shopping I guess in getting drugs from somebody else and you don't have anything in your system but what's supposed to be there almost every time I go I get a drug test\nSeriously ha ha ... and Dr ... interesting allegation right yeah the idea that different doctors would have different approaches to a particular medical ailments and it's not surprising right like\nYou would go to a doctor because you think they're treating it better than maybe somebody else no doctor shopping I'd well that's what the what I'm saying is the search for doctor shopping allegations could sometimes encompass some people who are yeah\nSomething legitimate yeah yeah but there are a lot of people who will go and try to get you know whatever they can from somebody or their their pernicious drugs but it's like anything is the Internet bad no right it can be\nIt can be are are these opioids bad and you know be it can be ... I mean it it's like anything with real\nPower and in the hands of each human you have the choice you can use them to alleviate pain or you can use them the way they're not supposed to be used and it's a very hard thing but you just got to be rock solid and it it it is hard it's really hard\nYeah but banning them is a is just not a good idea to its again\nProhibition yeah the drug war that's not the way you deal with it [noise]\nWhy am I doing over yourself show have already had set out to that working out here go they got a UK was a lot of beer and he's got functional really\nYeah I felt like I don't know what I'm saying anymore really clear I totally done any he seems totally ground would not know it all down by the hour\nWe'll I can drink more on the air which makes me question I've ever seen a lot less for uncle out on the show and the drunk every day's a functional I don't see the different I think that's what it now or I thought\nAll right ah wanted to share some feedback from uh our partners at Palm Beach letter taking tours crypto course now there's a course that\nIs just trying to teach you what crypto currency is what block chain is how it works why it's part of our future whether you like it or not\nFour or five star ratings everybody here's the comments very simple course very informative prevent or a presenter ... is excellent uh I knew little about um oh I knew a little from various sources but the how to pieces were missing now I understand what it is and how to buy crypto\nUh I was less than a novice when this course started the lessons we're clear and concise although still a bit apprehensive I Believe this courses give me the confidence\nTo get into crypto currencies thank you very much I read a lot about crypto currency bloc chain but this course explains a lot in an easy way suitable for a a\nA a person like me thank you uh ...

twelve fifty abide already I'm going to happen to see who it is color who are you in how are you you're on live in local\nHi this is John of England\nI John housing swinging today\nOh pretty good can I explain what's going on in the world if everyone's confused I can explain it which part of what's currently going on as far as the scientists murder governments like North Korea and others\nYou see when God is a he liberated Israel out of Egypt Egypt with the system is is whatever's the ruling power religion or government that's your God if you criticize it it's heresy it's prison or a death sentence so God liberated Israel out of that environment\nBut what they didn't know is Satan gave his own prophecy for the for a Fifteen times of crisis that's what you find the English dictionary the swastika\nThe swastika that moves from the right to the left is three hundred years\nFor those that teach called the period of the place to raise the disciples ... following\nOr currently in the fourth arm the forthright and that started in the Seventeen honors to the year two thousand two schools of education at such as the university system now we're in the enforcement time of the disciples fall away for one thousand year millennia rural\nAnd that's what's going on\nThose other universities now I'd emphasize traded that the nations of government and the infrastructure nations and if you criticize government in the future\nIt's imprisonment or a death sentence so it's called the forthright as why you get people on TALK radio said I'm a millennial well they're saying there are a modern day objection\nIs that the way that supposed to work\nWould you like to know the four arms called before Reichs it started with Egypt and went to the Roman empire then to the Roman Catholic Church and now it's it's the order of the university system of atheism back they Roman Catholic church played a trick on everyone\nThey didn't want people looking at the uh books of history and say that was the third right so a pope Pius may agreement with Bert a Adolf Hitler and the palace of Berlin that said there was a favorite will will do you favor of hiding you if you lose your military bed for the world [noise] um so they said\nTell people you're the third Reich convince them till they believe the lie and if you lose the military they will take into protection probably a place like Brazil of South America but that was the grim between Adolf Hitler and the national socialist\nThat she wouldn't you say when there's no traffic when I first moved here between where I live which by Safeway and to like the bridge there were three lights and now they're see there's that there's six and it it's it they ...\nI think there's six and it it's it's the ... the traffic\nBut gee if a child is getting bottled up too much maybe you guys should have put into traffic circles\n[laughter] uh yeah\nI don't even know what a traffic circle is\nThat's not deal where they got the nice a little little uh it's like a little plant or dealing in the middle of the road than they direct the traffic around it they usually have to look more so lanes in it and you just whenever your are intending to turn\nOn the like in a room where you just like go around the thing and try to get out of it\nAre either Rome or in Phoenix they have them\nWell that's not good either\nYou know they had the they had a plan to put one in ... but they shot that one down\nWell thank goodness they did that but you know I hate you knew you know me and driving I hate driving mhm\n[noise] and you know I just had like oil change it's been a year and the guy says you put eight eight hundred mile of a sudden your car well you know that's kind of what I Do\nOr what you don't do rather not ...\nWell no the good lord is taking things away from me and you were talking about the fishing it's driving me crazy\nNot being able to not being able to I'm Sorry to hear that\nWell Saul my ah but you know that's neither here nor there but the thing is it's so funny with the traffic and you know what's coming up\nWhat's coming up in the snow the snowbirds\nOh yeah that is heading towards us\nYes there is just starting to come here and I'm going oh no because they play games like one guy is in the in the left lane going forty five miles an hour and the other guys in the right wing one forty five miles an hour well Jesus get out on my way\n[laughter] oh Bruce where you hadn't in such a hurry\nOn that in a hurry I just want them to get a because they're ... they're blocking traffic everybody's behind me than going oh my God this is no good\nAnd do you think the people behind you're judging you for your speed\nNo I'm I'm just calling this field and I'm going to you know I'm ... I'm trying to keep to car lengths ahead of me you know the way it's supposed to be\nThe only advice I think I can offer is trying to treat driving a little more like fishing a cathartic sort of a meditative experience be aware of your surroundings but don't worry so much about what's around you don't worry about all\nI mean ... I'm actually thinking this like selling my car and taking a cab\nWell if you've got ... ... or\nBats that says that they had ... except for the people that are shooting up the drugs and the and the damn bus\nI Would not appreciate that either All right Bruce I'm gonna let you go I got another caller waiting on me\nAdios buddy\nAll right I have a good day Bruce I Hope you got that taking care of with the uh the concussion there okay\nAh hello color you are on live in local who are you how are you\nFrom John Keats in Cambridge Arizona Hi John how are you hearing today\nI heard your number I called your show ... kind of show it is other than the last caller had Bruce he's gotta be kidding he's as dumb as a board\nCalled yearly interstate way he doesn't want to know what about the money that they spend in a little town what about things that they bought and restaurants they wake when\nSomebody ... will have a very solid ... view of the world they're concerned with what is in their immediate realm of influence for Bruce it's driving he's ... he's getting to that age where it's tough to get around and\nIf he's got a few choice things to worry about who worry about the ones that affect them and I can understand that it's uh not necessarily ideal to have a limited world scope but it's in some cases what some people can manage these days\nWell I'm a ... I live twenty five miles east on the high forty I'm heading home right now at king and friday is the worst day I picked out because there's jam packed at every corner every to white backed up\nAnd I think it's because people on friday come up from Ninety three past my ranch editor the forty to an eighty five on a highway Ninety three north\nAnd can't wait to go to Las Vegas you lose your money and on Sunday night I'm back I don't want to be anywhere on the highway on Sunday when they come back at very aggressive very angry and I've never seen snow bird with a Michigan or North Dakota license do anything other than\nMichigan or North Dakota license to anything other than drive at the speed limit used their turn signals unlike the people in California\nEvery place in America has an alternate location that they blame people that cannot drive in the east coast it's mostly New Jersey uh out here it's definitely California that runs up words through ah through Colorado I think Idaho's ... Montana\nIf I'm if I'm right about that everybody everybody's got their qualms\nA trial like which one day a week to do some hunting dues and a doctor's appointment blah blah blah but I gave you my real name and a lot of people probably share the 'cause some people don't mean came in and I hope I have an offended anybody\nBut I'm wearing a ... I had a T shirt ... to that leads to look forward to re shop are you familiar with the store\nI Am not where is that it's always good here local been\nGetting a strip mall just south of the new shape way you like them I'm like the shop via leaves\nYeah like I Know personally is that in any case I had a T shirt and get that says liberalism is it mental disorder\nOoh type book written by Michael Savage you ever heard is\nI have heard of Michael's has a John one thing I Want to ask you is a the driver's licenses here in Arizona they tend to expire many many decades after their issue and I think once in a while you have to get a new picture\nBut what do you think about the idea of maybe having a more frequent driver registration say a test of abilities and capabilities and maybe if you're in once or twice or from the DMV is you should probably get an eye test if you can't read the chart go do that and then we'll talk\nWith that question you want me to do that not all I'm asking what you feel about something like that sort of scenario\nMy brother's older than I Am and he just lost his license in California these house on the miserable however I I don't think we're tested it often enough there are some people that don't this man\nBruso boil order call before they didn't know what a traffic circle was and they will they call the roundabouts but we haven't been down here in a wiccan do ...\nYou must I've never heard I've never actually been but I'll take your word for it you have not been awake and alert not lately no\nAll they've had them for years it's a circular entrance exit deal with the statue or something in the middle and it's very safe to get on and very safe to get off\nA copy Europe Europe's added I've been traveling the earth's in Seventy eight are all over most European cities and the only one I've ever seen in America right here with the Arizona\nWell ... are Johns I I ... I Want to I Want to ... and it might be a little odd but your views on a potentially increasing the amount of regulation on drivers and their capabilities and adding more traffic circles to the infrastructure might get you called the liberal in this area\n\nWell I don't have a political bone in my body I don't need to know your name but what is your name\nIs Dan how stand how yeah I well my main\nGoal on the show is to get people to see if they can't look at things from a more of a what do you call the devil's advocate sort of well maybe the way they wouldn't normally look at things\nWell ask typically gets more and more crowded as it is because Californians you're pouring in here they sell their houses for five or six hundred thousand dollars and they can buy a three bedroom two bath two car garage house we're stuck go and the tile roof for under two hundred thousand dollars\nMhm and they're just they couldn't win his building between four and five hundred dollars each loan and and we need more testing for people once they hit you five on the highway without question\nYou should call in a ... you should comment on Tuesday we've got the district to supervisor hill the NGOs she's got some years in the local and the federal government you could talk to her about that and then on Wednesday we actually have the Lord's the founder laughing ranch talking about uh\nOn this one is um [noise] what are leaving guy also some of the local and county candidates to come as well\nSo it should be very exciting it's free and we hope that everybody will come in to put their favorite candidates\nAnd didn't vote for school board are going to be on the November general\nYes they're All right so people better show up to this one if they want to find out who's what\nWell you know my opinion is that this is the most important election\nMy opinion is that this is one of the most important elections for school board because we had a big event center that's being built out there\nYou're going to want to have that managed correctly\nYes and and we're the ones that will be doing that so um I I just can't ... press how important it and it\nIs for people to show up for this so they can get a full understanding of what's going on because uh the school boards and lacking in their transparency in the last few years so\nWe do need a new candidates on board to get the word out what's happening there especially disclosing how much they're spending and what they're spending it on [noise]\nAnd the second thing which is my favorite thing is to Halloween costume contest which is to support the local sheriff's canine unit and that's on October the twelve\nIt's free we're asking for donations for the shares canine unit were going to have low key as er
