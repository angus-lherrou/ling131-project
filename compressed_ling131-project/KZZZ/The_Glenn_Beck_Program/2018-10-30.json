I'm Sorry to hear that sleep or differently and I try to try to crack your back a little later are lower than that\nRight well we're not going to go lower than that such today it's politics where one week out from the election\nAnd I can't come fast enough as far as I can serve it seems like we've been talking about this election\nNext we love it here and count the return\nWell next week we're going to have on Cathy Peterson from the Catholic charities talks\nAbout the new homeless shelter but we'll talk about that later but in Studio ... we have my friend Roy and our kids and Ryan is the district to director for the Mojave county Republican Party but she's also a candidate\nFor school board for the crushed school board that's the Colorado River unify but high school district\nAnd uh that's a pretty big contentious race there's a lot going on there are several people running running for reelection some new faces and we're going to talk to her\nAbout some of the issues she sees as the most important thing I didn't say Ryan\nI'm doing great thank you feel the unhappy to be here\nOn the issues that we will talk about the issues and then at three thirty we have on um a gentleman named John pimco\nOr some people may remember John pimco he was the finance director at Mali county\nAnd and now he is doing consulting work for the city of king then all of the issues and I\nI'm I'm sort of naive and for the um ignorance about them and that's why I'm having him on I saw him at an event last week and I said gosh I I we have a lot of lift listeners up in Kingman and I know that they'd like to know some more of what's going on and so he was gracious enough\nTo set my education so he'll be calling in around three thirty and until\nThen we'll talk about now that Colorado River um Unified School district um election it's kind of a near and dear there's so many things that are going on\nSo it in the next live about a minute before the break just talk about a few of the well first before hand you have a minute to tell everybody why you're running\nI Am running as the voice of the taxpayer because a board of governors doesn't seem to realize that it's taxpayer money that they're spending you\nGoing to the meetings I Know I've seen you over the years\nAnd by the last almost two years they are going to their meetings yeah and\nThere's there's no reason for that that we can't go to a state that's considered number one like Iowa find out what they're doing to get to be number one\nAnd in terms of proficiency especially math math is the ... the lowest that I've seen it's like less than twenty percent people are passing just a minimum qualifications for the students\nAnd uh [noise] I also I I don't want to say everything is bad about our schools is not they have a great vocational program so I think we should continue on with the vocational program that they have going on\nThere was a report card that came out from state for my hobby county and mouth was number one right which is a charter school\nAnd maybe we should look to them and see what they're doing I ... of\nAgain a little bit of a rivalry because you know you're all vying for the same teachers and stuff in the area and um there's also the sun's debate about public school and you know whether charter schools should get as much money maybe\nThey about public school and you know whether charter schools as much money maybe public schools should get more I Know there's there's so much going on and\nI'm a teacher pay what do you think about that ran I think they've got ten percent this year it's not reflected in the budget actually win over their budget it's reflected in the lake habits who budgets that they've got ten percent but in the budget um for\nThe teachers I think it was around six six percent or seven percent\nSo we need to know the thing yeah um it would be nice if the board would address these kind of things I mean [noise] I I just don't get why there's no transparency why there's not reports to the public um and\nAnd that's like we need to knock on the door the numbers ma'am\n[laughter] well also um you're going to be this forward it's going to be hiring and the superintendent yes they are I'm looking forward to that I think they're going to start their search\nBut they won't make a decision until after we after the individuals that when the three seats are seen as very on January for are smart and so who is the acting superintendent\nThat is benjy and go to restaurants and uh he's been a great guy anytime I wanted to talk to him he would you know talk to me I have the budget on just the Owen and money that the state gives us I don't have the budget yet on\nThe money that comes from property taxes which is around for a million dollars right thing to them science I'm anxious for that\nOkay and again and you should know this is such that every other board members that there are some lawsuits coming up for the county that will negatively affect the school district\nUm whenever we have let's say a a lawsuit that\nSomeone is challenging their business a big businesses challenging their taxes\nUm bad effects all of the special secondary taxing district for for questioning we as to how much they gather in that school district happens to be one of the biggest so um I I Hope that everybody who's running for office gets themselves up to speed that might be something that\nYou should look into I'll talk to you about that absolutely especially means because when you pay your taxes you know only something like Thirteen percent goes to the county to do all the things that you get mad at us for doing as sheriff since that but\nUm all the other money is divvied out percentage wise to the secondary districts in the schools because there are several school districts uh if you live in Bullhead city but crushed is the biggest one yes\nI Want to see how this was real quick if I can do this I'm so as far as the fuel house and you suggested that the committee dissolved into another committee for overseeing\nFunds would part of a potentially be liaison with the casino owners and the hotel owners to evaluate future room availability for upcoming events that are scheduled and something along those lines\nAbsolutely and be the smart thing to do\nAnd then as far as the the funding and the curriculum or another teacher pay increases we're pretty hopeful that that's going to have a positive note increase on the test scores over all those teachers find themselves more able to live their lives and afford to let's say extra curricular supplies\nAnd I'm updating the curriculum maybe to where it needs to be for more effective education of our students what do we have as far as reaching out to the normal schools teaching colleges throughout the U.S to try and maybe attract of let's call it new blood\nAnd evidently they send people out according to the board they send people out\nTrying to recruit\nNew teachers that apparently they don't think our um [noise] weather\nIs something that's very true it's always difficult to recruit people to move here\nFor a lot of reasons not just the weather thought if for young families there's the amenities and you know social aspect sorry social aspect of it and then there's the school districts that school taxes you sang for it and I thought the and then there is also our health\nCare which is always travels so it's very complicated has probably less to do with the pay 'em then then people think it's just so much more it's just one puzzle it should be more wealth is yeah so then I said before it and\nBut they do they do recruit I mean I Know that every year they have new teachers that come in thing to orientation and you know sometimes they invite me sometimes they do but\nUm yeah I like how many teachers there are\nWell one thing that I think I Would like to do\nIs to look at the curriculum and make sure that the curriculum is fostering things like critical thinking skills\nThe the curriculum is fostering things like critical thinking skills seven and [laughter] and make sure that the history classes are history classes that are accurate clique\nAnd a life skills when they get out of high school you know how to write a check know how to do a budget and know how to write your resume all those things are important\nBut at least know how to write your name in cursive for the check\nFelt that they started bringing that back in school they didn't have handwriting and now that they're bringing that back in grammar they're able to think\nThat the one of the reasons that they were um getting away from Kurt says it's because all of our founding documents are written in ... says\nThat ... feels like a little bit of factor acting like let's say you're a school bus dirty official and you're looking at things that you need to remove from the curriculum printed at school year a teacher cause you know you're trying to save our someplace for other things\nI could see that not being I'm ... I'm a model is filled a decision on the part of some school districts it might have had the unintended consequences later on that nobody really considered but I don't think they went into it with ...\nI mean we do know that you know their their choices and charges are made for a number of reasons\nAnd if you don't like hers are just 'cause nobody uses anymore hey that's the part of the central years where you're learning motor skills and fine motor control so it helps with that too it's not just you know\nSo let's talk a little about the election itself 'cause y'all got the minutes left so tell everybody um you know the mechanics of it how many they are going to vote for your name spell it\n[laughter] ... has everybody seen my cute pink and white signs up there and I ... I think that they're the cutest ones on Ninety five and so it's Roy\nAn R. O. Y. A. in in any or T. O. R. T. I.

I'll be outside that Seventy five foot line in the out my card to people\nOr going on in the early voting which is hearing bull headed right in the library you can go there now and there'll be open until the day before election day I mean the CIA now there'll be open I think friday ride writer friday friday's last ... and then Tuesday those election right\nNow I er I told one of my friends is because they were getting worried about voting had an idea of the candidates they want it but they weren't exactly sure that they were going to be able to remember all it was like\nDude okay this is not school you're allowed to write down who you want to vote for beforehand that taking it with you and use it while you're out what looks like a test taking both but you are allowed to say that's why they\nSend you if you're not if you don't get early ballot they send you a sample ballot that's what it's sports there need to fill it out so you can take it with you they're going to be plenty people standing there to tell you who to vote for the Republican Party has a sleek card that's on that but this is not because this is a non partners yeah oh yeah\nNow that's you know and that is again one of the things I think should be included in the cervix curriculum when and if they bring that back at one time were encouraging you to cheat in the future\nHas you know he'll be the the state passed a law that are put an expenditure limit on a local governments that applies to the county at a place in the cities and you're only allowed to increase your expenditures by a certain amount per year and it's based on population than inflation and things like that\nA city that he likes home rule\nIs allowed to remove certain expenditures from that calculation and and most often these are what are called proprietary funds a service funds where the users are um for example water system\nOr where the users pay fees and the city or uses those peace to cover the expense of the variety water\nSo
