it's it's a specially if she's been possessed by a gym [laughter] I mean you know this is\nThe thing we were talking about this off the air though because you know Donald Trump used the word

one is citing\nThe really bad examples of nationalism as it as where we are trying to go if you're Donald Trump or not saying all we want to be like those terrible countries he seems to be referring to it as like look we're the best country and we were routed and we regret the best you know culture and went and we should be\nA patriotic and and and be a you know sure excited about that but when you talk like this that when you when you play a clip like that it's hard to kind of argue that we don't have a superior culture and a lot of ways\nYou know like I kinda like you're saying that

I'm OK thing that a culture that embraces women as equals is superior to a culture that that puts them but won't let them drive and and forcing them to address a specific way that you can't even see their face like that it that I mean\nYes ... year you're going to extremes here and I want to adopt something you said earlier which is a National Guard approach National Guard troops are trained to deal with riot\nWhich is a National Guard approach National Guard troops are trained to deal with riots I expect that the military\nAnd National Guard and border patrol in riot gear that's how I expect this to be handled at the border if they're not coming in and entry point and it's a turn them away right there it's an invasion treat it as an invasion term way you say there's an invading force these people they're not going to legally\n[noise] now the media is trying to say wait a minute wait a minute this is not an invasion invasion force and how can we turn these poor people away and I want you to listen\nTo all of the people on television that are now saying\nWe are a country that has always had open arms to migrants we're always the country that I mean our our values or have always our greatest strength is our tolerance and are welcoming spirit\nReally that's coming from the left because I've always\nFelt that way but you always told me that we have a rape culture not a tolerance culture ... eat well I've always thought we welcomed immigrants in but ... you'll always told us that we have anything that is foreign I've always believed\nThat our our laws reflected a nation of immigrants but you'll have always said that our laws are racist and have from the beginning then a system of oppression\nSo which is it which is it how can you tell me that we've always been a country that is welcoming immigrants and our laws are set up as a nation of immigrants\nAnd yet telling me that we are the most depressive monstrous society ever that only embraces a rape culture\nYou can have it both ways which are we\nAre we a are we a\nCountry that is that embraces a a rape culture\n\nOr as or as any rational\nNon Marxist post modernist might say or are we a little of both\nAre we are we a country that tries to be this way and sometimes we fail to see you can't really say that because then you can throw the baby and the bath water out\nWhich is why we've been saying hey baby is a good thing the bath water may need to be changed but let's not throw the baby out too and that's not in your argument the radicals\nThose who don't believe in any kind of border security at all your the one leading the charge that we do all this land\nThis land doesn't belong to us\nThat were all afraid because we're white people and white people are bad\nAnd now you're on TV saying\nThat we've always had this culture that welcomes immigrants\nWell see [noise] um\nIt is true we've always had a culture that has welcomed immigrants we are a nation of immigrants but we also felt that you've always needed to come here and not want to dismantle us\nThat you came here because [noise] because you saw the American dream\nAnd most immigrants do most immigrants\nSeeing the American dream and they've come from someplace else you notice these guys are coming from Honduras they're not stopping in Mexico why they would probably have an easier life in Mexico just blending in\nThey speak the language why why would you come to America and why not just walked through America up to Canada they've got free health care\nThinking that\nThey have all kinds of hate anti hate lawns and speech laws there a progressive utopia they have free universal healthcare why not just marched through lots and go to Canada\nBecause one of two things either Canada is not the beacon\nAmerica is for all those who are the poor and the tired and the huddled masses\nOr this is a political move\nAs you're not going to Canada because it's not about you your life the job\nIt's a political move it's to destabilize\nTo help push a country over the edge now I don't know which one it is\nA country over the edge now I don't know which one it is but I Do know this\nSeventy five hundred people coming across our border in math\nIs not helpful and shouldn't happen you lose control of your borders let me ask you this if all of a sudden\nPlanes just started taking over DFW or the

wait a minute wait a minute what are you doing can't land here can't land here would you be okay with it\nOr would you think\nThat might cause chaos and might be dangerous what'd you think that if Sea Tac airport cannot control the skies if they lose control of their airport they're not really an airport\nWhy does that work for an airport but it doesn't work for a country we lose control of our borders\nAnd people are just coming whenever they want and they can just get a big huge massive people because of Seventy five hundred people can do it surely they could get twenty thousand and they

I guess her tone wasn't acceptable to lift the\nUh but I mean you know she asked a very fair question since the woman who is supporting an ideology in a movement that is a brutal to women all over the

long yeah it's\nNot not good ah so I mean I just it's a totally fair question and the fact that they continue to embrace windows are stories the ... say it you know once you bring to the table you know she just I guess you just crossed that line if you're going to be radical and you'll stand up and you'll keep saying radical thing they want breaks you no matter what\nI remember we did something years and years ago about why the\nUm the sar soars and the key thousands were brought into the movement a and it was a decision to ah make sure you didn't lose the Islamic vote in the future so they went out and they found it I'm not saying that those two but they went out and they found\nYou know connections to the Islamic community and brought them in and gave them positions are inside to make sure that we we lock up the Islamic vote and so that's the least how they got in is they were\nSaying well we have to have a broad chance we have to have a very big tent no no you really know nothing with people who are saying ...\nYeah no you're outside the tent it really comes down to the media has not held the movement accountable remembers is someone who uh you know and ... because there is of many victims of really terrible things sometimes that occurs but it's more than that it's ideology you know I'm One of the founders of the me too movement\nOr what has shown that she also had a accusations against her from me and she did sleep with a very young cast made and one of her movies\nShe was dating a Anthony Bourdain who we now know obviously killed himself later on but was at the time uh CNN employee paying off the person who's making the accusation\nI think that I mean it's amazing to me that no one has said does that contribute to his death I I've had the same thought I mean is\nIt I mean you know look suicide is unreasonable so you're not in your right mind when you commit suicide but there are things that I'm\n... that that can be so disjointed\nIn your head that you can never solve them you can never repair them if if he is at CNN and he really does believe in the me too movement to end he really believes he's on the right side and he's having to go to work with a bunch of journalists who say you know we got for all these guys away and look they all do that\nAlone simply write in a bar [laughter]\nYou know I was talking to somebody who is pretty well versed in media circles about this and and about ... a few weeks ago mhm and you're saying that like the the media knows this guy is a nut job ... they know he's in that job they know he's crazy really they know he is not a real player and they actually don't like him\nThey are just waiting for that moment to be able to charge them get rid of\nAll the background on his on his his uh you know it's settlements in court that all could have done months ago you know they're they're just they're all that with him now there's so many interesting didn't work out yeah so they moved down to something which is intriguing he'll be at the Planned Parenthood setting up his office I'm sure soon\nI'm sure I'm sure he's got to go someplace listen to this and this is the way the media does these things right wasn't it is now George Soros reportedly had an explosive device in his mailbox a over overnight mhm which needless to say but we should\nSay in any way is a horrific idea if anyone were ever to do that and you are an awful person in every respect or if you were to be responsible for such than\nOther days for the rest of my entire life up until last five or six years\nI Would say it it goes beyond saying that this shouldn't happen but now\nYou have to you you've got to because if you don't say that well what does he look he was\nCondoning it yeah and and beyond that just goes to what we're talking about yesterday with Nancy Pelosi harassing Nancy Pelosi while she's out in the streets these are terrible terrible ideas heroin and the the left\nDon't do the things they're doing we've seen that the left has been violent or ask people who were playing baseball this congressional baseball game or you know we've seen that before we've seen uh the harassment of officials in places I Would much rather have the on our argument\nOr as in our repertoire of argument that we're not we're not the ones doing that they are so don't plan to that\nI you know I Know no one in this audience would and we have no idea by the way who did this I mean I certainly the speculation is is that George Soros opponents um you know someone on the on the right but I mean would be his wife and I don't know just saying we have no idea who it is right [laughter] um but listen to this coverage from the New York times\nThat look I get that they are liberal I get it and I understand that they're not going to look at Georgetown has maybe the same way that I Do [laughter]\nThis is just to the point of like you've checked out mentally know write up a piece of a story that said this come on\nLow Mr ... name has become a trigger for a subset of Republicans and conservatives but right off the bat you're just condescending right it's not that he's done anything you could possibly disagree right trigger a name and forget there several countries\nHave named him an enemy of freedom not like I've been room put people but like they passed laws against him [laughter]\nYeah it is a subset of just about six countries have\nNamed him in it you know a a a danger to their freedom in a band any of his money you know from coming into the country\nBut that's just a small subset of how do you have any country\nThere's a ... you know ... and the trigger that got us normally you don't get survey would say like I'm a student years of war or they don't like and they go hide in a safe space that they were triggered right like it's a condescending term again for a talk show hosts for a ... for Huffington Post blogger in line to use that sort of like for the New York times\nTo say uh the Mr sorts of names of them are a trigger for sub set of Republicans conservatives this is how the airport he is a\nHe had said that his main goal is a political activist was to see a return of bipartisanship [laughter]\nDon't the founders world do you have to believe that she your course everybody says they want bipartisanship\nGeorge Soros is not a bipartisan figure he is one of the largest donors in the history of the Democratic party\nAnd he ... he launched a foundation that is funneled money to every crazy left wing calls on the planet but we're supposed to without question there is not like an argument the only thing we hear from conservatives are triggered by his name\nWhat's his name George so sorry it's it's so it's just happens sometimes\nIs that it's you know it's a crazy is you know who's more bipartisan the Koch brothers totally further yeah they're they're they're not conservatives they're libertarian which means they give to both sides sometimes they're on the side sometimes they're on that\nSite foreign socialist on social issues almost exclusively with the Democrats\nAre not conservative now and yet they're not bipartisan they're evil it's actually\nCoverage limits on this is from uh New York times as well as has their story about how anatomy does not determine gender experts say that's a headline\nLet me just say that again but who's to say that again anatomy does not determine gender experts say God and now this is of course to push back on Trump's policy to use biological sex as a as an actor and and I guess you don't get to just make it up anymore\nI'm ... I mean listen to this and I read that several times and it's actually changed and meaning as I've read it but listen to this how do you define identity researchers say gender identity comes from the brain not the body\nResearchers say gender identity comes from the brain not the body some put it more bluntly it originates between your ears not between your legs\nNow what they seem to be describing there is something different\nThan we're describing what they're describing is a feeling right like I feel like I'm a woman now you can feel like you're a woman I Believe ...\nAt one point felt like a woman\nAnd I'm actually still doubts I assume she flew it but it's what who knows a but like I say that you feel that way is almost in a in a in a in a roundabout sort of way of a criticism\nOf transgender isn't right we're a conservative would say you're not transgendered you just feel like you're transgendered that's a different thing with age that is what it is that would be in the U.S feeling which\nUsed to be called if I'm not mistaken gender does for ya and any that feeling it\nWas a was categorized by medical scientists as something that was harmful to your mental\nHealth right but I was there and and and certainly there are cases like that or where\nAt least there used to be that there were admitted as a as a you know a real problem with in in mental health however there are other cases to wear like for example we use the term tomboy right for a girl who seemed to like to\nDo a lot of the things that voice that maybe acted like a boy a little bit and you call that person a tomboy you didn't call them a an actual boy was it was a nickname for someone who was a girl what active like a boy and I guess my question here would\nBe if it's true\nGender comes from the brain not the body or a originates between your ears not between your legs\nWhy did they have surgery\nWhy do why did they change what is between their legs if it had nothing to do with what between their legs why are these two things associated all they seem to be talking about a collection of personality attributes\nRight like I like ah I like sports I like you know I like action movies I like you know giant and prime rib eye have generally issues that are ... that are with the males therefore I'm male they're talking about male interests\nOr something you know who will to be able to explain this who's and be able to make sense one way or another explain both sides is a doctor Deborah so\nYes she'd be great let's call her up half her own tomorrow because I'd like an explanation of\nWhy bother getting your gender does change that it's got nothing to derive channels and isn't that just gender this for a a\nAnd haven't we at times said that's bad what research has shown us that it's not bad because suicide rate remains the same\nSo we we've ... we've said this what this was bad because the genders for ya leads all kinds of different things and general unhappiness okay so\nWhat research said that if we say that it's not bad and we go through with surgeries and everything that it will lead to a different outcome\nAnd I think like that's an important piece of it I mean I think the outcomes are not all that positive but beyond that whether the outcome is good or bad there is truth Neal Hi can you know like I don't understand like the word gender man's sex organs forever mhm okay\nAnd if you want it instead of changing the word gender ... to mean something new\nThen in that and say okay actually this is an interesting a personality trait they see they seemed to see themselves that demand and and isn't that interesting and they can do what the what they want I have no interest in what they're doing to themselves\nOr from a perspective from a libertarian perspective thank you for that or that the ... what's but like there is also a fact are\nSo let's get into this tomorrow because the fact on gender when you say well you mean sex well yeah it used to mean sex but it doesn't now and the guy who changed it was a psychopath yeah oh yeah and uh we'll we'll start with that and let's see if we can get a doctor so on tomorrow's\nProgram to go over that [noise] All right my patriotism light [noise] one to you think\nHad one eight six six for us led by visiting here through that deal out that a message to the U.S department of labor [noise]\n[noise] maybe it's time to take a fresh look at everything we thought we knew about landing a great job for instance perhaps great careers started to middle school science fair instead of at the job fair because the fact is the jobs are the future will be heavily geared towards science technology engineering and math\nIn other words damn so if you're a student talk to your school counselor about them if you're a parent [noise] talk to your kids a public service message from America's navy\nSomething has to be done ...

those of you don't know um my wonderful husband Sam Angus passed away this weekend Saturday actually at three Fifteen or after a long illness\nThose of you know me I knew that I had been taken care of my husband for very long time he's Twenty years older than me\nSo he was Seventy nine and um\nI you know when people ask me about my husband he kind of kept a low profile he he really he he was uncomfortable with all the hoopla and the social south of politics and\nBut he really he supported me and he loved 'em the success I was having and are supported me every step in the way\nAnd uh when people ask me about him I just say I'm to note sandwich to love him he was a kind of gentle soul and he was a man's man and for those of you millennials who don't understand that\nThat means that men looked up to him my my husband can do anything he could build anything move anything and so he was like MacGyver\nIf he was younger I Would have definitely ahead and try out for survivor 'cause I could just give him a stick and he could build you know ... a condominium he was just that kind of guy and\nYou know the in the end that's what kind of did a man because he was had such a physical life he was a commercial fisherman he was a a stone mates and the master stone mates and he um his body was just kind of broke and that's what happens when you do that kind of stuff they don't call it back breaking work for nothing [noise]\nSo um if everyone can just keep my husband's Himalayan gets in their prayers as he enters the kingdom of God and um\nAnd again I just wanted to thank everyone a it was such a wonderful outpouring almost overwhelming for me I'm just humbled by it and uh and for all of this you're offered to do things for me and helped me a I thank you so much you have no idea how much that all men to me [noise]\nI don't have any influence whatsoever over what goes on in Virginia over what goes on in North Carolina over what goes on in Pennsylvania where a liberal judge ah um redesigned to his specifications the electoral map to elect more Democrats\nSame thing I Believe happened in Minnesota\nAnd um or in Virginia it was North Carolina actually [noise] um so I don't have any control over that which is very frustrating I don't really have control in Arizona but let's say I can influence ten voters or a thousand voters or how many ever many voters I think in Arizona we're going to sweep\nI really do I think ... gonna be a senator I think uh I Know Doug do see is going to win I think do she thinks he's up by about ten twelve points I actually think he's up by\nAnd she thinks she's up by about ten twelve points I actually think he's up by a hell of a lot more than that um I think he's up about I'm going to predict Seventeen um and I think he'll take Mick Sally with him I think we'll take more burn a bridge with him\nA Frank ridge will be close but I think he'll win I think the ACC candidates so when I Know that in Mojave county where we live uh I don't think I mean I think that they have a\nMade more of an effort from the Democrat side\nUm but even Nate Silver who said there's an eighty six percent chance that Democrats stick vows rates pogo SARS and Ninety nine point something chance to win the\nTheir congressional race here same thing with sunny and Leo when everybody else on our ticket a show I think we you know when the things that we control I think Arizona is are going to be a very Republican state I base that by the way on the fact that my theory\nOn this is that the two thousand and sixteen election and Arizona was something of an outlier election in other words I think that Donald Trump won the state by three percent whereas generally Arizona votes about ten to twelve percent\nOr minus ten or minus twelfth night I think that was an outlier that gave the Democrats here hope but I think it was predicated on the fact\nThat um there were certain groups thinking of the Mormons by the way who did not like Trump for his personal morality things and a lot of people some of the Ted Cruz people who didn't think he was conservative enough and they didn't vote for him or they voted for\nEvan McMullin or whoever where they shot home and I think those groups have come home to Donald Trump and so I think Arizona is back to be heavily Republican state I think we're going\nTo win here we may lose a congressional race or to I'm not too optimistic by the way about the Tucson district district to the second congressional district but I think we might win and district one\nUm and I think we'll have at least five it's about six a Republican congressmen Arizona and then when we were district in a couple of years after the census we're going to gain at least one more congressional district and I think that will go to a Republican as well\nDr phil [laughter] I'm optimistic about Arizona\nOkay good doctor said let's just go back a little ways can begin discussion 'cause we talk about polls and you know we talking about polls um like we did three years ago\nAnd you know they were so stunningly wrong on that so you know we're back to that somehow we've kind of ... or given it I I don't know that they've changed their methodology all that much\nThere's so many change so I don't take polls so much is a grain of SALT I I probably like you I follow people\nWho who delve into the numbers in individual states district things like that and when you do that when you look at things like\nI'm a voter registration that has has a significant increase usually to the Republicans' advantage I Know here in my hobby county\nOn the last day of voter registration\nThey received in their office or something like six hundred and eighty new voter um applications which is astounding a Christie Blair said she's never seen that many\nI there is excitement but on the flipside we also have to realize that we have new people coming into Arizona and not just the people fleeing California\nWe have something called student we have a lot of um students coming into our communities and they tend to stay there afterwards and and I think that we if we marginalize that that is that are that at that said our costs\nAlready was is that saying students or a positive or negative\nMatters how you look at it as a Republican students genuinely answers the ASU they tend to be more liberal they tend to be Democrats and there'll be motivated to be motivated by by Hollywood and you know but I\nI got to say that if you just ask them like I I I'll ask so tell me how your life is worse than it was two years ago I mean that's something that you always ask right\nUm are you better off than you were two years have gone and just no one can ever really have an answer for me it's always back to those for the vague generalities like heat\nAnd you know and I'm sure when you talk to them when they talk about the heat the divisiveness in this country\nThey're thinking it's our fault when we talk about ... device that they think it's terrible but you know I gotta say who's getting who's getting shot at who's getting a um yelled at and screens and chased out of restaurants you know so I think they are not\nAs unfair as some people are putting it out to be not if you are a constituent then you see your lawmaker at a restaurant and they continue really refused to listen to you\nSee your lawmaker at a restaurant and they continue really refused to listen to you either by a emails or uh any sort of a phone call you make of their office with the boilerplate message on it what are you going to do other than be upset with them and you see them in public and they think it's\nA ... or you know way way way way way\nYou think it's appropriate to chase somebody out of a restaurant because you do not agree with their political opinion\nI never suggested to say someone out of a restaurant and we have an opportunity to engage with them in public and the again marginalized un say about your constituency does it matter to them because your views are opposite of what bears or or might not even line up entirely and saying well again you have said\nAs a concert a shape it's common courtesy not to interrupt somebody\nHealthy has gone on long in the past thank you Dr ship I appreciate that that the is the time for civility to die and I don't I don't\nKnow if I said I said that he fights you you're talking about that I said that we have a president who fights and that's not I'm Talking about\nThe way we do our politics you know there's nothing wrong with 'em spirited debate ... during sessions and stuff I mean just look at parliament if you want to see\nIt I I think that's great I think that they should get up I think that the two polite and I think our sides been way to play and I think that there are members on our side who are realizing it now such as Lindsey Graham\nWho had some righteous indignation when he saw what they were doing Kavanaugh and when he said I hate to say this because I Believe some of you are my friends like I saw just change it\nI think even he realized things had are different just because you know have you thought you you'd debated the issues but then you know you all went out to dinner but that those days are gone it's it's\nIt's unfortunate that the stakes are so high but I'm going to go so far as to say in some\nPeople's minds I don't think that they were ever there and um you'll have to sort of take this and Dr ... understand what I'm saying\nFor years it's been the Republicans who have\nReached across the aisle when they say we have to work together it's always the Republicans that are expected to compromise and you know I think that at times I'm not saying all his time compromise is a defeat on the installment plan\nAnd then you get instance that by the way that I don't think it was\nDark and you get instances like Mitch McConnell saying that the greatest achievement and his wife was forbidding Obama from getting a Supreme Court nomination appointment urine\nAnd that's that that is politics that he was able to do that actually played by the rules\nThey actually change the rules and then played by them in their face\nHarry Reid changed\nThat's right so we can lay it all at Harry Reid street yes [noise] yes\nRanch ranged in age and then finally looking ...\nUm you know they got this right isn't\nOn hold and they hang on no we lost them somebody wants to enter this kind of lay here please do\nIf you start to hear the broadcast after the ringing stop that means I put you on hold but you're still able to watch here just wait for me to ah bring McCall well we've\nGot about a minute and a half before the break and um so the message that we want the takeaway here is that it's very important to vote vote vote our ticket you know what they are well said before the end of the show when we get back to shift I Want to start talking about some of the proposition because that's very important\nYeah that would be a very good and smokes both things I can you show what are you\nOkay I'll let you go through them and and tell everyone because I'm sure I agree with you and just you know when we get back\nJust a few minutes so maybe at the end of the show about your um experience being at a Trump rally which is becoming sort of like the hottest ticket in town no matter where you are if you're a Republican it's like the Superbowl all put together\nThat's a philosophical debate that we had in the beginning of Obamacare ... she usually for its mandated to buy something\nAnd and that is somebody ... thought we had we had decided that was not cool um\nWhat's more the non coolest probably unconstitutional was essentially a giveaway to the Germans industry\n[noise] yeah and\nThat was more you want to move on to one day she said she goes on also very very controversial\nYes it is I I don't think we agree on this one I'm going to be interested well if you had a\nProblem with the problem that I say with one twenty six or with a no vote on one twenty six and I and I hadn't\nRead that so people know what we're talking about like let me read I have a booklet in front of a little bit dry admittedly yeah but that last name so that All right so a yes no on proposition one twenty six protect Arizona taxpayers act\nOn proposition one twenty six the protect Arizona taxpayers act to protect Arizona families from potential unwanted taxes on services the axles amend the Arizona constitution to protect taxpayers from state and local governments\nImposing any new sales tax or use tax on services\nTo protect Arizona taxpayers act is designed to prohibit the state from implementing new sales tax on services to Arizona's use every day\nIsn't it interesting I mean think about we just talked about\nWith one twenty seven and then this one so I didn't read the Jack ... where in the ... of it is one page back where we hold on hold on hold on hold on\nOkay ah it's just for tech Arizona okay ... that's a constitutional amendment let's see if it meant that uh\nThis [noise] I don't I told you drive is dry but it should be OK he they just give sort of or they don't want to show amendment and competing legislation would permit the state to adjust certain benefits not actually wants Twenty one twenty five anyway so\nThat's one forty five protect yeah potentially pension says right\nNow and that's that's that's you give me but so the so the yes on proposition one twenty six is to you know quote unquote protect the taxpayer\nDoes is it a centrally bans taxes on services rather than [laughter] than it and and my reasoning for supporting it rather and I know it took it a lot of heat over this by the way\nIt is that it would it ...\nTo think that we're going to what what the people want a no vote\nWould rather ... services and have a you know\nShadows tax rate and I my fear is that this is the taxes on services tend to be built into the price of products and they'd be calm indirect form of taxation and what you wind up with\nIs a sales tax at the same rate except now everything that you do is taxed because ... ... and I just think that the I don't trust Democrats we you know in in a perfect world\n[noise] we we were on a low broad base tax system but that's not what we have and that's not what we're going to get\nWell is this is why I'm not happy with the other end this elected official representing the constituents of how the I Want to be able to keep those just so decisions local do not want the state coming and telling us what we should I Am a hobby county has the lowest sales tax\nRate of all the counties\nI'm there is already a cap on how much we could do\n'em and I know that there's other things with the services and things but again if you keep taking away those kinds of things then sooner or later we're going to be kind of um um I don't know if I Want to use a word I shouldn't use but we won't have any teeth\nTo make certain policies and stuff so I'm voting no on that\nI Know it's a little bit okay the weeds on the concept but the only kind of state tax I Would want in this situation is to enforce that all advertised price is included with uh the tax evaluate and into the final note\nI'm afraid of what we're going to get into it was like a value added tax system like what you're having Europe\nAnd in Europe the the the original value added tax came in at five percent I asked you know what the lowest that in Europe is today no it is twenty two percent in England\nAnd and and this is I have a real problem with these indirect taxation I'd rather\nHave the people out or how the government if they need more money for something go directly to the people not be catching you don't tax you don't touch me tax record I rarely injury\nMy dad used to say that all the time when I was growing up\nSo it and that's my preference so that's why I'm voting yeah All right\nBut I'm voting no so again we are agents you we are a a party with different voices we don't just all do within Loch Ness so now we've looked at one twenty six and one twenty seven one twenty five is just that so they could fool with\nThe pensions to make it better and I that's a yes right\nDo you see as for me also\nDo you both get pensions in your position\nNo I don't I don't buy it but I don't they changed it and it was very generous up until the year I took office and um you're talking about the people who me\nUntil the year I took office down you're talking about the people who make it and I think it should be changed that ours went to sort of a designated um benefits saying like most people get 'em\nAnyway now we're going to one twenty what's next we'll buy health real shit okay three five and three and say we got a minute\nOK quickly thrill five is to expand Shays or educational ... savings accounts\nWhich essentially allows you to have the school choice if you meet certain criteria 'em and you can get Ninety percent of the tuition paid a hundred percent if you're below a certain poverty level\n[noise] uh in order to go to the school of your choice for college or in general it increases it but it also puts a cap on the number [noise] show a lot of groups are ambivalent about it because that cap\nAnd the Americans for prosperity feels that what's gonna happen is that we will lose the whole program if we if it goes down to defeat\nAnd this is this for college level education or grade school\nNo this is great K. to twelve\nTwelve okay well we'll do three of sex and the rally when we get back after the break\nAll right it's followed the news day here on live and local in the afternoon on the ... states number one news talk am FM radio leaders K triple A.
