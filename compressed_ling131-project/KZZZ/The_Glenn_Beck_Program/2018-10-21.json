number one news on radio network\nHoney and no one asked them to find them Ninety four boys [noise]\nYou're listening to the climax program academic grievance studies and the corruption of scholarship partway introduction\nSomething has gone wrong in the university which is actually in certain fields within the humanities\nScholarship base less upon finding truth and more upon attending to social grievances has become firmly established if not fully dominant within these fields and there are scholars increasingly the bully students administrators and other departments into adhering to the world view\nSo Dr James Lindsey a along with a couple of other friends decided you know I let's find out what this was all about let's see what the lines are and they learned an awful lot ah they learn something\nQuite valuable that you just can't get away with anything you have to fall into a a set pattern really\nDr James Lindsey a is joining us now he is a thinker he's not a philosopher but he is a thinker which I like a doctorate in math a background in physics or James how are you sir\nI'm good go an hour you\nKnow good um so tell us what you were tell us what you were trying to do what were you trying to prove\nWell we were looking into these fields to find out\nWhether or not their scholarship has gotten so kind of ideological bias that if we put forth I'm really absurd arguments or that they might you be willing to publish those so long as they've solved fell in line with the political views\nThat they seem to be forwarding and plays a scholarship\nSo that first you didn't you didn't really understand the political view part right because the first few the studies that you use submitted a you got back they were rejected\nYeah um well it's not quite that actually we I think we understood the political view but we didn't understand the need for a scholarship we started this project out and as you said we got the first several papers\nA back rejected we started in August by Thanksgiving everyone are literally Thanksgiving a day off\nOr we really realized we were in trouble um we weren't getting anywhere with trying to hope that the problem wasn't we didn't understand the politics so much although there's still a lot to learn there and there was for us to a very complicated they call it a matrix of domination that you have to understand\nBut it was more that we actually we're not trying to work their scholarship and so there are two things that are needed to to get these papers and one is that you actually have to understand what they call scholarship you have to do it according to their rules you you have to understand the concepts you're working with\nPart you could tour the entire home on video white there from the comfort of your

seven point five of them were [noise]\nThese [noise]\nThese now published studies are a just a tremendous I mean I don't know how if you guys had years before you came up with this or how you guys came up with these ah but they're fantastic oh let's go through some of them one by one let's start with the first one dog\nPark the or the thesis his dog parks are re rape condoning spaces tell me about ... tell me about it\nWell it's kind of funny actually um I'll tell ya story um when I went to we we all got together to to have this ... public as best we could so I went to Portland we all went to\nPortland, Oregon too I'm ready for this project to come out to the public can we went to the dog park on the first day I got there almost right I got off the plane I took over next thing you know I'm walking\nPeter resolved after the dog park with a\nFilmmaker and uh we get to the dog park and there's this this dog they're living out the paper it was crazy this dog was fighting the other dog's hunting them down\nHunting them left right and center the the owner comes over a swing the things the ball thrower at the dog gently I'll point out it wasn't being abusive and then he says stop hunting and then we get to as I lean over to the filmmaker and kind of monitor\nThat gets a little too loudly and maybe we should start interrogating people about their sexuality given much is going down here and then this lady yells out\nTo me oh no no it's okay she's the girl dog and I was like oh man this papers happening for real\n[laughter] so what is what is the features so\nThe thesis was all the original idea behind the thesis was that we should write a feminist paper arguing that we should train ... and the way that we train dogs to prevent rape culture\nAnd so I thought that they thought it was pretty funny when I was brainstorming ideas for papers sure to Peter Peter takes his dog the dog park every day\nI'm like I said let's work in some of the stuff from the dog park and as we started working in just you know absolutely absurd ideas from\nWhat might be considered the most ridiculous dog park in the world\nOr the paper grew into that and so we made it about so called queer performed a pivotal in human reactions at the park and then ended up concluding things like the ... we we should be able to leach man likely least dogs ... to prevent rape except it's not politically feasible\nAnd uh gosh it would be great if we could put shocked colors on men\nBut that's not okay either so we have to shock them out of you know hitting on women by screaming at them to scare them and get them to desist from their behavior the thesis of the paper was though that that humans\nReacted differently to gay dog hunting as opposed to stray dog hunting and men were far worse about this than women\nAnd then we concluded that this is indicative of race culture and we called the dog park rape condoning\nAce than white\nTo nightclubs we said rate nightclubs are also right condoning spaces with no evidence for that whatsoever\nWe [laughter] um\nSo that was pretty out there um that one was was really out there I think it's I don't know maybe the one about the the feminine spiritual spirituality meetings and poetry is a little more out there but it's probably close to the most\nWell LOU LOU finished the dog park this one was accepted and reviewed\nUh some of the reviews is a wonderful paper incredibly innovative rich and analysis extremely well written in organized a yadda yadda I Believe this ah intellectually and imperial being periodically exciting paper must be published\nThat are completely ridiculous are amazing new accomplishments in the field I mean that had to be wild funny and it proved your point had to be really disturbing as well\nOh yeah that's by far what we consider to be the most important evidence that we gathered in the process of of this project that the papers it got published or that they got awards in some cases are one case and all of this it's fine and it says a lot in a disturbing but the reviewers comments show that the\n... bureau viewers which it worked out between two and four or five or paper so we ended up with something like forty five or fifty total a set of comments they they really did engage with what we did they really looked at it they ... ...\nSet our analysis was good winter analysis was terrible they didn't raise an eyebrow about the data we gather the idea that um you know the dog park paper contains\nA bit of completely irrelevant evidence about where dogs go to the bathroom and unauthorized ways as we did it and it's completely irrelevant to the paper but nobody raised an eyebrow about how ridiculous that is um they were concerned however that we\nIndicate that we're human not dogs so that we can be sure that we don't claim that when a dog that was a ... ... thing of another dog whether or not the dog they got hump wanted or not because how could\nWe know that as being [noise] dogs and they were really concerned as I Hope everybody's seen in our little\nVideo we've put out to announce the project they're really concerned with the fact that we respect the dog's privacy and the process of inspecting their genitals 'em\nAnd [laughter] so what what specifically were they concerned about I mean they're practically lived on what I mean\nYou got me man\n[laughter] and then it was done in the privacy of a a veterinary office [laughter] okay\nUm let's see you did fat body building which quickly is what\nAre the the idea that what needs to be added to the professional sport a body building as a category in which fat is displayed politically so that fat as just considered another to issue a that equal with muscle\nAnd to say that that's not true is to be mean to fat people fat phobic as they call it\n[laughter] and that was accepted\nYeah that was accepted that was a pretty pretty exciting acceptance um\nEspecially because uh we actually had a real scholar who let us use his identity who wrote that who we claimed growth that paper he actually is a professional body builder\nOr Mr northern hemisphere in Nineteen Seventy eight or something I mean this guy's Seventy years old and just stack and the picture in my mind to this guy being the author of this paper for fat body building was just kind of hilarious\nHe [laughter] 'cause that's another thing to do a lot of these papers you had a completely fake organizations you had completely fake scholars coming from colleges that I think didn't exist in some cases I mean some of this would have been easily just provide basic checking would it would it wouldn't have\nI think so I mean those kind of a this is a tricky point and I don't want to get too far into the into the weeds here but honestly scholarship should stand or fall on merit not on who did it and so a lot of people are are making that point and we deliberately chosen names that would be hard to find in a Google Search in effect\nWhich was very common names on purpose I actually used\nA a a I roll dice to pick a fight off of a list\nOf the most common names for certain years and the way that would blend in with lots of people\nHim interrupted to teach them what that feels like\nOf that was questioned\n... if this were published and they were real if this were published ... what what would that mean to the university system would would [noise] what's that mean\nSo all events is a really complicated um\nThere were the people who try to take the south in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at University of Pennsylvania who was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom he got in trouble for it a late last year\nSo this I didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting in classrooms and so there would have been some some are educators primarily working and social justice\nSide or the fields topics\nCourses I guess that's the best way to say that but also probably into some of the general ed stuff who would take up some degree of the suggestions as you know experimental but but legitimate to use in the classroom and this was being submitted to\nThe gold standard journal this wasn't some fringe journal in education this was the gold standard than is philosophy journal Asia\nThat we were working with here\nWhich is where a lot of the literature that like this already exist which you don't mind me going on a little bit this is kind of what's happening I'm we think that what's happening\nOh so they take they take these these bad\nIdeas some of which are just opinion some of them are prejudice some of them are genuinely terrifying like this educational thing\nAnd then they launder them through the academic process and they come out with the stamp of academic approval that makes them look like they're real knowledge so you'll hear people say oh well there was a study or rebates this program on studies that show well that's fine when the studies are good but when the studies\nAre coming from a place they can't tell a truth from from prejudiced and opinion it becomes a real problem [noise]\nGyms on any other ones they've found um disturbing ah was the uh H. O. H. two ...\nTwo was was accepted can you explain did explain this one\nYeah that paper was accepted by ... the singer and I was just mentioning that paycheck stood for hoax on hoaxes so it was a hoax paper we wrote that was about writing academic hoaxes that code namely gay for convenience would argue is that that you can only properly criticize\nThings that go against social justice in particular you can only use humor to make fun of or or do satire to deflate\nThat which goes against social justice if you use humor against social justice if you criticize both will drop that what that means as you never really properly engaged with it therefore we don't have to consider your criticism and that's one of the huge problems going on in this this set of of\nFields because that they don't accept criticism if you tried to criticize them they say that it's a privilege preserving epidemic pushback that a scholar named Allison Bailey huge\nIn the education literature they say it's white fragility that's Robin to Angelo who has just had a big book published on that this year has introduced a constant twenty eleven which says that if\nI'm somebody with privilege is in particular white people for her work uh is challenged so that their privileges Clinton question that they are fragile and don't know how to deal with it because their privilege made them weak they don't know how to psychologically deal with having that challenge and they act out in anger or grief or something like that\nAnd trying to maintain their privilege\nAnd so these ideas are already getting out there who just took him to step further\nAnd then you know it's interesting guy because the one about hopes as it is interesting and that is to criticize what you guys did they would almost half just like your paper and that was\nThe idea yeah it was definitely to put them in that position and I've asked a trip to stand\nBy the paper that they accept it and publish alright names they haven't responded yet but we'll see what they do I'm that way indeed people who want to criticize our project from a position of interests are an old feminist them will need to cite us in order to criticize us\n[laughter] I can we get one more ... on the talk shows on scary front at the feminist mine Tom are\nYou also did the white man my income you did to one time and this was accepted in the white man wasn't right\nCorrect correct tell me about them\nSo I'll do though the white one first because I didn't get in it was much more frightening it was written in from the position of an auto West Nile graffiti where the researcher is reflecting on and hurt the state's her own experience\nAs a white lesbian women coming to hate her own white mass and it was rejected partly because the scholarship wasn't quite er which is the case in all of the papers but also because the position that the author as a good white\nRather than being sufficiently ... or whatever to critical race ... ... so there was there was an explicitly political reasoning behind why it was was rejected and it was that the the author as a white woman was trying to make herself look good by criticizing her own white\nWas was one of the main reason the feminist one was\nWell hold on just a second hold on just saying that took mind the parts of mine Tom where he was talking about Jews and replace the word Jews with a with whites\nYeah in that case it was either whites are white and this and then we edited the text around it and added a whole bunch of literature and rewarded things get passed plagiarism checked and things like that so yeah that was a\nIt started with scanning through my income picking out passages about the Jews in replacing juice with whites are white ness\nThan editing around it uh the feminist one didn't\nDo it quite the same way as soon as one was not about it didn't take the Jews out and replace it\nWith with men for example that actually has the chapter in my income where Hitler explains the need for the Nazi Party is chapter twelve and what its members would be expected to a whole to and including especially the sacrifices that have to make it could be Nazis and\nIncluding especially the sacrifices that they have to make to the Nazis and we replaced\nOur movement party et cetera he doesn't mention Nazis specifically in that chapter or we replace that with intersection of feminism or solidarity or ally ... something to do with with the feminist movement\nAnd criticize the idea that\nUh some feminists do what they call choice feminism which is the idea that if a woman is living her own life the way she wants to end considers that to be a statement of feminism than she is doing feminism is salmon is for women to have you know full agency and make their own choices in the world that's what this paper was criticizing\nSaying that no no they're responsibility if they really want to consider themselves feminists is to be to make sacrifices and stand in solidarity with other oppressed people particularly of you know women of color or women of other marginalized status is\nJames [noise] couple of quick questions um hey\nIs this had to be one of those things that you entered into and hope that you were wrong and when they were accepted you had to celebrate and then short time later going\nGood God this is bad and my right\nTo that is exactly right so especially the ... paper I think the one that got accepted um the idea there was that we were trying to it's very different from mine ... of course do I mean as you get a one to one thing uh\nBut the ... the politics of grievance through I really am glad I get to talk to you about that I can because politics the grievances everywhere and it's certainly being used in the academic left as we were trying to demonstrate we called this stuff grievance he's we see it everywhere right and I think this is why we're so divided\nA politically right now I was really happy to talk to you because I mean I don't want to get in touch with you but you're a real dude and that's why I wanted to talk to you thanks you know you have this whole may have ... about\nHow things were going for you under Obama's time and I thought that was huge and I was like you know this guy Glenn Beck is is is a bridge she's looking for reconciliation it's on your on your Twitter bio we need to be talking to each other again\nSo our project was you know or people on the left or left liberal I'm not ashamed to say that I Know you consider yourself a classical liberal and conservative on the right that's great I'm we're on the left me to take responsibility for our own lunatics and so our project was kind of that\nYou know we're in a left wing people who want the left to come back from the from the edge and we hope that you know the same things happening on the right and we can all START I think you know people\nIn general I get a lot of sense of the people send me emails about this now all the time especially um\nWe're all kind of sick of all this nonsense all the fighting all the polarization and we can't get anything done I think we want to get back to ... politics and as long as we're relying heavily on this grievance stuff which clearly the academic left is I think we see a lot of it coming out of the right wing media is here as well from my perspective\nI think as long as we're focusing on that we can't have productive conversations we can't ... remember you know you're an American I'm an American your person I'm a person we have ... most of the things that we think\nIncome and even though we have some probably pretty serious political differences but I think we also have in common that we want to have better conversations we want to move society and a direction that benefits us all and it's just a matter of working out the details and I really hope that you know that our project kinda reaches reaches that point does that make sense\nCan you pass the catch a penny dinner

lean in their category get them get them to fifty there's no additional seven tossup races where they could get all the way up to fifty seven if they were to switch those\nUm you know maybe even outside shot at something dramatic maybe getting getting to fifty eight most likely you're probably in that area of fifty three fifty four right now which is an improvement over the current situation in the Senate but if they lose the house that doesn't mean that\nIs that yeah you know it doesn't mean it means something but it doesn't mean a a heck of a lot 'cause you're not gonna be able to pass anything 'cause you know the health is going to have both the other way and the houses where it looks real things look very bad for Republicans\nUm it's interesting the way that they're looking at this is\nNot whether usually it's like we'll we'll ever will the party loser gain seats right that's the way we usually typically look at these things and then there's the control angle as well who control the house\nWell even notice you haven't heard a lot of talk about whether Republicans\nWill will didn't gain any seats large because it looks like it's not even possible at this point in fact um the the polling models that they have working right now uh five thirty eight has one which they have um the ... the chance of Republicans can maintain their courage amount of seats at less than zero point one percent\nNow you might say oh well they've gotten you know there was issues with they didn't get Trump right which is a big thing every time I talked about polls were like oh well they didn't get truck right well first of all the national polls are almost exactly dead on for Donald Trump\nOr it just didn't get the ah electoral college right but that also wasn't what they were pulling in right in some of the states were were obviously wrong\nBut for example uh five thirty I Believe had about thirty percent chance that they thought Donald Trump or when they're saying there was a point one percent less than a point one percent chance that the Republicans will maintain the same amount of house seats in the house in fact they are saying the\nKicking\nBurning flags whatever\nBurning flags whatever\nThat's pretty scary and the mayor ... released\nA statement at a press conference where he said I was appalled by what I saw in the video but I support the police's decision not to intervene\nHow how how can you how can you support that decision I don't\nI mean I guess the the just the idea of look this is wrong but we want to make it any worse he's trying to make it\nSound as if um the police this is his angle for the mainstream our police can do no right they they act and they're just folks they don't act and their do nothing's\nSo they have no way to win the great observation there are two political parties and whatever you do one of them might criticize you yeah\nThat that's the job of being married right out of your job of being a leader you're supposed to actually have an idea and do something and which I think he did by the way I think you're right would you would not speak to me right when you say for public consumption that is exactly what he's doing his his opinion is oh jeez where we're damned if we do damned if we don't\nBut in reality what he wants is a is much more on the side\nBut you have a fully much more on the ... and you can back that up with how he reacted to the FBI the FBI building in Portland is ... is under siege for ... to ... I mean think of the calls on these guys\nThey take the FBI building and block it off so FBI agents are are now trapped inside the building they\nCall for police police say a we've got a call the mayor why I'm calling you dispatch police we have to call the mayor the mayor goes on and says if the FBI thinks that this city is going to back them up there in the wrong city\n... excuse me what what\n... so the FBI had to get federal officers to come in and get everybody out of that building and into safety\nSounded nothing Portland did nothing to these guys that I mean whoa what is this\nIt's a I mean it's it's close to anarchy right it's certainly the way that that you think it would come if it does it say you know the idea that ... the FBI can't depend on police officer forget the FBI just these are people that these are actual real individuals who are in danger or and\nThat was a woman who has the food carts across the street from the FBI um she was a a threatened with an inch of her life\nThat I think they've had to move out of the city or in her family um they took her stuff destroyed it or threaten the neighbors who are coming down trying to you know stick up for\nI mean they're just that they've become animals they become animals and their claim these are they're streets no they're not\nThey're not punk if you pay for them\nBecause I think a lot of the people who are trying to make it to work are the ones who actually paid for it your streets since when but\nEnough history [noise] usually people are who are um\nYou know national socialist or Marxist radicals of some sort they were in power and they let this they let this stuff go until the people have had enough and then they do what they want with those people and they you know use\nThose people as cover to seize even more power that's the way it works on a national scale I have no idea what this Portland mayor is doing\nBut it's insane\nMeanwhile Alex ... Alec Baldwin who uh has a new show on where where's this new show starting to you know\nA head Sharon ... off the top of my head I don't think it's yeah it's got a new show ABC ABC jeez yeah so he's got a new show on ABC had of course he's on NBC all the time a he's a he was just giving a speech and he was\nTalking about you know ... you know the elections when I make sure it's a clear it's elections but he did say we need to overthrow this government and the government of Donald\nTrump maybe we should watch what we're saying [noise] plan\n[noise] hey Andrew is due to the new Africa ... now available get access to live and on demand video breaking news from the blaze dot com and more downloaded today on your Android phone in Google and start bringing the blaze everywhere you go [noise]\nIt might be hard to find good craftsmanship these days but it's definitely out there I see it now yes\nI'm good craftsmanship these days but it's definitely out there I see it now you experience it I that's why I collect watches old watches because of the craftsmanship if you want really thought full attention to detail simply safe systems keeps more than two million Americans safe every single day and simply safe\nDoes it right starts out with a nice box arriving on your doorstep\nBut you set up the system within minutes and simply safes sensors are practically invisible so they don't read the look of your home that people don't really even notice them and before\nYou know what your home is set up for professional monitoring twenty four hours a day and you'd never have to sign a contract which is something the other home security companies always make you do simply say they have changed the home security business and they've done it right right now you can get ten percent off your simply safe system just go to simply safe back dot\nCom that simply said back dot com this is the company\nI trust with my home in my family you will to simply say back dot com\nThis holiday season impress everyone who visit to your home with brand new made to order custom blinds from blinds dot com get inspired by before and after pictures read reviews and get the latest trends and colors and patterns that blinds dot com and right now you can save up to forty percent plus take an additional five\nPercent off site wide when you use promo code back\nThat's up to forty percent plus take an additional five percent off site wide blinds dot com blinds dot com promo code back rules and restrictions apply\nAccording to the department of energy the most expensive utility\nFor most Americans is their electricity bill patting to your financial misery this allergy season has been one of the worst in years and that was the perfect time to order a new set of age back to the authors from filtered by dot com with over six hundred size just to choose from including custom often you'll find the perfect it shipped free within twenty four\nHours with filtered by dot com they're made in America\n\nI always check the rating and content descriptor the for buying a video game but sometimes I Want more detail about a game content that's why I Love these new raining summaries for more information about the ratings and rating summaries ...

what you are to get from cold there for example you they have each had different way different lens might be a little lens than ah than the new\nI become desperate to hold on to something I thought I might be losing and I thought I had to do something special to keep it I started doing things out\nThey thought I had to do something special to keep it\nI started doing things out of my comfort zone like presenting and the truth is\nIt had been a while since I had been having fun it started I started to worry about ticket sales for my tours what the critics said what the perception of bite me might be I felt like I was living with this over my face and near a and the reality I was seeing was all blurred by it\nI decided I never wanted to read my name and print again never read a review and I never have I decided I'd never use social media again and I never have but the diagnosis made me realize how stupid I had been to worry about all of these unimportant things I was embarrassed by my ego\nI was embarrassed that has allowed this in security\nI realize that for many years I couldn't believe I was on the same stage as my heroes I couldn't believe I was looking cross somebody like Paul McCartney and saying things like it's hard to get here but my God it's harder to stay here\nThen I woke up and sought after ten years of trying to get here in five years of being scared that it would go away I think I can enjoy it\nAfter his son's illness he says I just don't have the stomach for it anymore the celebrity narcissism it started I started to crumble but then I started to wonder why I wanted to do it in the first place\nI had forgotten that it was all about souls connecting because I become so anxious\nThere were people in my business life saying if you hadn't done this or that you've written a better song tickets might be selling quicker I started to take all of that on board and no one wanted to take any responsibility is just so much easier for people to pass the buck to me because I was in insecure enough already\nI Would digested and say it's my fault time rubbish\nIt affected me and I started to think it's all going to go I'm going to lose everything\nIt is fascinating to read these things from him because what I've always felt about Mike who play was she was just having fun\nHe was just living a dream and I wondered and I never spotted in him I just wondered\nIf it was ever going to get old to him because what makes him I think the best performer I've ever seen on stage is that joy he just has a joy of performance and it is it is so infectious\nYeah he loves it I mean you can tell when you see 'em live you can tell he just absolutely loves doing it or at least did at one point um but they're starting to talk about I mean there's conflicting reports that he's actually thinking about stopping it completely he says I was learning with\nPassion that I was afraid I'd become a mere poor photo copy of my heroes\nBut when I come back from this terrible time I realized I'm not a mere photocopy of learned everything I can from them taking it found my own soul my own voice my own style and now know critic can take that away\nIt needed clarifying now I'm just seeing the music I Love maybe when you let go that's when it comes back to you it's a lot like love\nHe is um he he I think he's joking about he because he says I miss the guys in my band so when my wife had to go back to Argentina I said to the guys come on over to the house let's have a drink order some pizza place in video games and jam\nThey came over we partied and I said let's play some music and I thought wow this is fun it was then that I realized that I missed making music I didn't even know I missed it that was about a year ago so why would he possibly be saying that he is now\nIt seems like it might be one of those situations where the Internet has taken a somewhat a sarcastic comment and turn it into reality his spokespeople are coming out today and saying that he's not actually going to retire because he got in the middle of a tour in a book or ... album released and all that other stuff so here's what he's here's what he says exactly\nTo the reporter he pauses there are three reasons I wanted to do this album one because I felt a debt of gratitude deeper than I can explain to the millions of people all over the world who pray for us and showed us compassion that gave me faith in humanity to because I Love music and I feel I can continue the legacy of my idols\nAnd three because of the world was ending not just my own personal hell but watching the political turmoil in America and watching Europe breakup\nThere's never a better time for music then he suddenly stops\nQuote this is my last interview he says quite solemnly I'm retiring from the business of made the perfect record and now I can leave at the very top end quote somehow though the writer says I don't think he really means that\nIt's unbelievable because I you know that it was put all over the media as if he was retiring well he said it was his last interview he got other interviews scheduled\nRetiring well he said it was his last interview he got other interviews scheduled right like he's had a whole pressed for for the problem it's just silly and most important thing though is is looking at that and saying\nThat that is really the type of thing that that changes your perspective completely right you go through something like that and you stop and you examine all the nonsensical idiocy that you you participate in every day\nUh and you can re prioritize you don't want to have to go through that to do it but sometimes it's the only thing that makes you kind of re prioritize the things you're doing in your life\nUh and and he seems to have I mean he he gets making thirty five million dollars a year if he's out there a touring and stuff and he's able to walk away from that um\nBecause he just wants to spend time with us on how many times you hear those excuses I'm so quitting I Would have had more time with my family that was completely real guy yeah it's nice to see somebody who actually you know and it's nice to see\nThat he he got through it and has made it into a good thing you know I have I have\n... probably more respect for Michael bootleg than any other professional that I've ever met in\nThe entertainment industry\nBecause he has found a way to keep his feet on the ground and he was afraid I mean when everybody when everyone it was very popular to hate me\nShe didn't\nMean happier hate you I Know but the heat but he and he was never taking a stand for me he just wouldn't he just didn't understand and to use like look I'm I'm not in politics I'm Canadian why do I care if they get out of\nIt and then he got to fight a lot about yeah he said the guy turned around and said I\nCould leave you look what Beck and he's like I'm Canadian I Do vote what what does it matter what does it matter to you and the guy's real ... and he said I drew punches back and he's like I Do it I got into a hockey fight [laughter] you got to do a hockey fight [laughter]\nI Am so happy to hear that his ah family is um is doing better and his son has made this miraculous turn and\nAh Michael Blue play you've given enough if\nYou want to give more we will certainly take it\nBut uh do what's right for you do what's
