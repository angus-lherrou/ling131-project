look real body you have to look hot\n[laughter] yes yes this is going to be quite a transition going from a brick and mortar office to my home office where I can either use my Mac laptop or even my eye\nPad and iPhone right yeah so um I just didn't know if there was a way that I can do is ... feet check to see you know if the lighting is okay for me maybe the background the position that the camera I Know you're supposed to look into the eye of the camera and not the actual screen right\nThings like that so I did I wanted to know what I can do to prepare before I actually get out and start thinking\nWell you know the big thing is is that we want to make sure there's a good light on ya okay and in Chicago you have sunny days and you have cloudy days right\nYes and you have a cold winter days than say I've been there and like get so I'm the best case scenario is that you get what's called a ring light I don't know if you've heard of this\nAnd it's a it is a rank\nUh I can put a link to one for you that I Would recommend free over at Amazon dot com and\n... over at Amazon dot com\nAnd so what does it has it's for a facial ... like torture it's that people use that for it's also when you're on when you're using a Web cam\nIs that you have a tendency to be washed out okay with the green light is exactly what it is is that it's going to a little miniature face\nAnd so that this way people are better able to see you and you'll actually you will actually look better lit up than dark a lot of people say oh no I look better in a dark restaurant\nNot not so much in K now when you're ... is a looming ate it within the background will appear darker OK okay and so you being a doctor I Would want to see your credentials on the wall\nMeaning I Want to see those diplomas you know what I mean even though I Can't I won't be able to read them\nI Want to see all your awards I Want to know where you went to medical school I mean like like if you have to look that closely but I can tell them what they are right and of course you want to get rid of any junk behind you to you don't strike me as a person but [noise] you know we've interviewed people for like the guy you know for jobs here\nAnd you know and you look and they have it's like there was a hoarders behind them and you're like what is that a child that's just the right so we clean all that up\nNow there are ways when you have faced type for example that you can hit a button this was going to be hard but what I Would do is I Would just record say a couple of seconds\nAnd then you don't have to worry about just taking a picture so if you can record some video of herself for thirty seconds\nBig thing too that a lot of people don't realize why is that you want to smile okay\nAnd because when you lie or you look welcoming\nAnd I'm sure you've done that you know where it's hard to deliver bad news but you might have a little bit of this file you know race or is there is a whole side of\nI mean I have a lot of friends who are doctors might I hear a lot of the bad story but I also got a good stories you know yeah and um but you know to be letting your personality comes through\nHave you ever done this before they actually as a patient doctor so cool I'm so excited for you\nUm the ring lights are about sixty bucks okay and it makes like I said it makes total difference you're going to love what you see when you record a couple of minutes of yourself because at that point you're going to say yes\nA little extra blood sometimes works too when you're on a webcam because [noise] uh you seem to get a little bit washed out even if you do have this ring light and again thank you for your call [noise]\nHey let's talk about\nSarah works relieves like many of us she might suffer from muscle

our businesses are reputation is always on the line and that's where the gal small business technology advisors comment reliable gal PCs and they tell car processors rock solid\nI understand but that's not their role at\nSo if you're at target would you tips the person who was checking you out at target not the guy who was checking out the person that I was working the register no of course you want\nBut if I had but ... okay but sometimes they do like I was at the gas station the guy but Aaron my tires and it and he was using square and I got gas and he said in\nAnd said like ten percent for air and the tires and I'm like am I supposed to tip the gas station guy now what does that but you're absolutely right there are some places where it's I don't think just because they handed me a muffin\nThat if I mean that's part of me going there you know there's a a there's the Starbucks I was at the Starbucks in Honolulu and I'll never forget\nThe ... percent like eight hundred dollars or something in common they had to tip jars\nOkay and so you know not only can you tip on the receipt but they actually had tip jars right one was once and for all you Android people and the other ones had for\nThat's one said for all you Android people and the other ones had for all you iPhone people and the iPhone ... drivers like overflowing [laughter] and the Android One didn't have\nAnything yeah I was at a video game thing and they said if you think the X. box sucks to appear if you think the PlayStation ... it's just a ploy it's just like you said before guilt and people out of their money\nBut how about this one this is a little different when we order on my sister's kids came over for dinner or something like let's just get a bunch of barbecue so we'd go on Amazon restaurants and a bunch of barbecue and I get the total and it's like a hundred and twenty five dollars sounds like that's a lot more than I was expecting right the automatically added on twenty five per cent tip\nAfter also charging me a delivery fee\nOkay that that's really tough because they don't even ask you yeah and you know ... and it tore us for that and also overreach because they'll say like pricing search okay and so they add another five dollars\nIf you order something that's under ten dollars there'll be a small order delivery charge you know or whatever it may be\nBut maybe it's like\nBeing a server at one point in my life I actually will tip the whole foods or the Amazon Prime driver or whatever it is I'll actually add more like he's like okay I got a whole foods delivery yesterday and it was probably I think it was like a hundred and fifty dollars\nShe got two things yeah I had seven and broccoli [laughter]\nWhich is probably about it and some sushi okay\nAnd if the tip was a recommended to was twelve dollars tape and so so I was ten percent okay I ... I gave the guy sixteen I gave him an extra four\nOr five I Wonder what I mean the research has got to be out there that this worked otherwise the absolute are doing this the squares and stuff like that they wouldn't include it\nWell and because you know remember they're making a percentage of the total\nEven on a tip yes okay because they charge square and the other one said two point nine percent two and a half percent of as a transaction fee of the total amount right okay so if they can get that told and thinking about that so they can get the total\nAmount up by five dollars I Would think the tip of the dollar is no no no you pay the whole transaction ... what the ... what is that what is the bottom line transaction\nThen you have to pay a fee\nFor them collecting the money and doing things like that and he joined the gym I'm On I'm Still not tipping well artist was hard it is hard and you know I I don't know maybe I'm maybe I'm just a nicer more generous person than you are there's no maybe about it uh that I think that you know but I but sometimes it is kind of awkward\nYou know tipping again for just like what is normally\nAnd what we should be considered like just part of the experience like somebody handing you a napkin so here's ten percent instead of having an African let me just use the cash that you're expecting me to like my ... something like that [noise]\nAll right let me tell you something over the years of epson printers may have earned my trust which is why I'm uncommitted user and you'll see what I mean you have to experience the economical apps an ego tank forty seven fifty it's a fantastic wireless all in one corner love this friend is my corner of choice\nFor a couple of reasons well first of all it's cartridge free don't you hate buying printer ink cartridges oh my gosh what's in there anyway gold but no it's colored IQ\nBut the experts in ego taint forty seven fifties cartridge free comes with up to two years of AIG writing about that's enough to print up to eleven thousand color pages that's the equivalent of thirty a cartridge that's now if I were to run to the store and buy thirty cartridge that's ... yeah do the math it would cost me about Fifteen hundred dollars\nWas ego take you easily refill the printers ain't tank and seconds\nThey go take of the compact space saving printer that's truly cartridge free and it's available everywhere\nYou can learn more right now epson dot\nCom slash eco tank cameras each CEO she A.

the acts are\nReally truly worth the money it's actually cheap seven hundred and forty nine dollars I Know you're saying Kim seven hundred and forty nine dollars is really expensive for a phone well not when you compare it to like eleven hundred for the latest iPhone\nAnyway just few luxury talking more about that but I really love to hear from you this show one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty for once again as a way to join us\nAnd then there's Andrew ... commando show man cave whole low there Andrew Kim\nWe're going to start with Karen and she is in spring grove Pennsylvania she lives spring\n... that sounds like a nice place to live doesn't it doesn't really horrible place I live in spring grows right next to the\nGarbage town Pennsylvania which is not very well populated not at all she uh she lives in rural areas and she's thinking about switching cell phone providers currently she has ... and for home wireless confusing rural and she has it for ...\nThe company that she was thinking about switching to use the rising powers and she's like oh well they use all the same stuff is going to be all the\nSame kind of action and then she went what if\nWhat if it's worth it to where I Need to call him and it's so frustrating\nThough isn't it I mean when you don't have a decent connection in your house I mean you know we just talked about you buy a new house right now is a lot of millennials especially millennials are you a millennial your you know I think I missed it by yeah you're right on the edge\nIs that a lot of millennials won't be won't buy a new home if it doesn't have say a fiber\nOptic next I mean that is now requirements like you know two and a half bathrooms three bedrooms and fiber connection so that this way you don't have to worry about what's going on so so care and you don't have all bars in all places that's what I'm hearing\nThat is correct and there's no way that you want to move to the big city ah no no we're going to stay right here okay so so when you complained of arise and what did they say [noise]\nUm they really can't get many answer I've been I've been within twenty twelve okay but the past month it is just so slow here that the Internet's almost useless [noise] so I'm looking at switching to Comcast\nFor my Internet and I can't can't say well we also have noble and so I thought well that might be a great service but I'm concerned that maybe it won't be because they do you have rising powers and would switch between Brighton towers and Comcast hot spots so I don't know\nI I don't I don't know if I could switching between the hot spots um [noise] you you know what you okay ... you know which you could possibly get and I don't know ... varieties and you know would give you a deal on or sometimes if you complain loud enough you get it for free\nIs that you may be able to get a little what's called a ... self or your house and so it's kind of like a repeat or off of the cell tower itself\nAnd but the thing with the ... and this is why I kinda went about the Comcast is that\nIs Comcast is using other sent to sell to increase your reception and you're in bars I don't know if I like that either um so my first recommendation we go back to arise in and say listen I Need to have some type of Microsoft or something that you can I can put inside my house that will repeat that\nAll from the tower that you have nearest me so I get a stronger signal and then they'll say no we can't do that because you're only talking to a rap\nBut if you get up into a manager a supervisor level and explain to them that you're paying for the service and you're not getting everything that they promised sometimes you can get it for free if not that it's like a hundred maybe two hundred bucks okay\nOkay now let's talk a little bit about the cell phone towers than that even though like varieties in at AT and T and Comcast or maybe they can share cell towers\nThey often use different frequencies in technologies so they're not actually sharing the hardware on the tower makes sense\nOkay um and they're usually own now the towers are owned by a leasing company not even by the provider anymore because the providers figured out that they could sell\nThe uh the towers and they don't have to carry that that and they can make more money so the thing that you couldn't go back to Comcast with and say you know\nWhich frequency is Comcast on a tower and how does that compare for rides and so that there's enough that you're going to know what all this means but just this way if the numbers are different than you know that that it should be different enough that one service might be better\nAnd I and Comcast sense as a cable companies some of this band with maybe coming off the cable to now there is hope on the horizon\nAnd the hope on the horizon it's five gee\nAnd it's supposed to get better for all of us that are having cell phone problems um because basically you're talking on poor gee you're talking about one gig abet a per second speed versus\nOn five gee you're talking about multiple ... and so you know couple of solutions that she might wanna try before you just dumped ... do you think you could call ask one of your neighbors if they have Comcast\n[noise] I could try that we don't have real real close neighbor from afraid of 'em [laughter] I knew that we know but um [noise] but I could try that\nBecause sometimes you know and and of course you know they may say it's great and then you get it and then you're mileage made very right and she could be you know here's where I'm at you know what you might want to do\nIs explain to Comcast what the problem is have Comcast turn turn on the line you try it for a couple of days\nSee how it works explain to them I don't want to sign a long term contract right now I Want to be able to at least ten and put my tone or she when I'm getting and you know let me tell you something the cable companies are struggling right now they'll do anything to keep occurring customers to get a customer so getting might have to escalate this little\nBit up higher but it's definitely something that you might want to take a look at doing just having a conversation and Karen thank you so much for your call Gary in South bend hello there Gary what's going on\n[noise] Hi how you doing on looking or an app that I can suck you release them money to a private party\nUm [noise] I was in a small car accident and\nRather than go through the insurance on the ... center it's a it's a friend of mine who liked to take care of it personally sure I'm I'm just looking for secure after that I can send her um payments or I'm not not something we all use all the time that\nSomething that can periodicals down here in the ... uh\nUh you know a couple of ways you can do it you know [noise]\nJust just a rule\nOf thumb is when you're sending money to friends be you know we have to be really careful make sure that you have everything done correctly because they don't issue refunds okay\nA couple of options you've have Google Wallet you'll have pay pal and one of the most popular ones out there now is something called the ... and all of them charged two point nine percent as far as to make this wire transfer a bit the exception of pay pal they charge two point nine percent plus thirty cents\nBut if you're looking for a safe secure way you don't want to give out your checks or maybe you don't even have a bank account anymore\nAnd that you want to take a look at as I mentioned Google Wallet probably pay pal is the one that's most commonly used then ... it seems to be getting a lot of traction though as time goes on Gary thank you for your call it the right where you are we have our money to coming up and more of your phone calls that you don't want to miss here on the ... commando show [noise]\nOh\nLord memory America digital cameras on them\n\nOver the years I've tried it tested every way that average people can and should back of the debt on their computers I'll tell you that I drive is simply the best climb back upstairs there is for big reasons why\nFirst it's the easiest to use a backup everything all my computers smartphones I've had to have everything to one single I drive a ... second it's the most secure with I tried snapshots I'll never lose it\nBy the lock and then it connects to a hub okay\nSo you have like a smart things hub or you have what what I have is the next year up okay\nAnd then within the next ... with us where things have you'll find that there are other things that you can do so like if you wanted certain likes to come on and the middle you know say from eleven PM to fix am when nobody's there so at least illuminates maybe it's less likely for somebody to\nBreak in is that you can program the lights for that if you had certain cameras you could do that as well if you were worried about a water damage when nobody's actually there and it's snowing and the pipes are freezing you know what I'm saying\nIs that there are water detection sensors you could also put in there that you can get alerts so once you once you get the hub Charles what I'm saying is that once you get the hobby started thinking about OK\nWhat more can I add to that right\nYeah so ...\nYou know so if there are there any other things that we can for a couple of hundred bucks because that's all you're talking about\nRight that they are that's awesome McGill\nYeah then it might be worth it okay so when you start looking at different products the smart things do this is where it gets confusing is that you've got the wave in the bay and those are different standards\nAre well and that works with the smart things next to the ah everything works like um I have a a train air conditioner that I can control remotely you know on the next year or so so so that's what I'm trying to it so I'm trying to expand your horizons so once we had the hub what else can we\nDo at that law took things yeah it's exciting I mean it's really cool to doctors all states with the holograms turning Oliver\nAndrea don't you think that you and I would add be excellent at doing like a theatre version of the came commando show absolutely inquiry making a musical\nWell I don't know I can think commando them he was one that I don't [laughter]\nI don't think we'd go past one no memory and just say so anyway popular demand one that I don't have a say in great bend Kansas that was [laughter] we didn't even make it sound like like Broadway in Tempe that was it that's off off off off osmosis\nRuns right or the ... it's more intimate but well absolutely and [laughter]\nAll right so the next the system's going to set you back eight dollars and Ninety nine cents a month\nOr I'd say\nThat's it not a big deal so I'll take a look at the there's the fish legs since and connect OK okay\nThe next thing you have is about sixty bucks the lockers going and such back a hundred and fifty and then you're looking at say just for giggles ten bucks a month\nAnd then it allows you to program all those codes get reports whose common and what's going on with that and then if you could set up for twenty four hours and then if somebody does or do you think something was wrong you can just kill that code it kills it automatically there's no delay\nYou can also un sled\nYeah you can set up a code really ... you know if you're if you're doing anything remotely\nA really makes sense that you start looking at smart stuff an order to be notified and get alerts and things like that who Charlie thank you for your call and keep us posted on what's going on in great band and how that locks working out for you [noise] All right speaking of homes\nWill talk a little bit about simply
