Red Cross training saves lives sign up for class today and Red Cross dot org\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nThe name of the book Christians in the age of outrage and very Frank talks about uh what Christians can and should do and also have knocked on and how we're actually hurting ourselves\nUm you talk about our God really kind of being identity no usually not that\nKind of lives when they moved to shoulder the factions and I want I don't want to be a faction in a world of factions\nOh says you know I'm I'm this or that I've got a social media community and and and then that faction sort of becomes identity becomes a faction the faction becomes an echo chamber and then ultimately are we the volume just goes up up up up in the anger just goes up up up up and\nAnd we can't survive I think as a nation factional ... at this level eventually you'll Balkan eyes to use the term for history where what kind of break apart and so I think the ultimate thing is I I Can't you know I kept solve all the political things you're you're got much bigger platform talk about politics than I Do\nI'm just trying to help Christians to say All right how do we react to how do we respond and the answer is is not to take our identity from anything other than king Jesus and and and again I Know that's overtly spiritual but we're talking here and this this focus I mean so it's to take out any for Jesus Jesus is\nNot coming back on air force one he's not riding a dump irrelevant when he does\nAnd to acknowledge that I'm only all in as a Christian in following Christ and everything else is shaped around that my identity is more to Christ in his kingdom that's kind of our motto here we can college my identity is more to Christ in his kingdom than anything else\nSo I explain this yesterday that um you know the the so called Christians of the Westboro Baptist church\nYou know they they hold up signs you know God hates this Scott hates that blah blah blah they're just despicable\nYou don't win by by holding up signs no God hates view and shouting things back you win by listening by understanding by him great seeing them as a soul or a brother and sister not to do what they're doing\nStanding up but people have been changes one woman in particular that actually left her own family in the Westboro Baptist church because right cause somebody spoke to her with ... who is the ability and said let's just reason here for a minute\nYeah that's okay I I on my desk actually right every front of me a name played because they actually protests that at my church we went out and serve them coffee and doughnuts and they called me and the national news\nI Can't use one of the words probably on the radio but a lying the false prophet and so it's actually one of my staff made it into a name played it says it says lying blank false prophet Westboro Baptist church which by the way it's either wrap does your does either Baptist church\nBut but in doing so I mean the question is how do we respond well somebody reached out actually interviewed or the members of the family as well a Christian Today so somebody reached out and I will tell you I think that's what\nWe can do right now with people who deeply disagree with us and the book is filled with examples of Christians who actually build relationships with people who radically disagreed and in the process we're able to come to maybe a better understanding of what examples for example is a is the president viola university which is a Christian university in California\nAre met with the kind of the leader of the uh the party of state legislature there in California that was trying to change laws that would make it illegal for viola to live their Christian beliefs about marriage sexuality and more while he ended up getting to understand each other better\nThe will the bill was ultimately not moved forward but dropped and and and now we're at a very different place now I'm not saying you can always do that but I Am saying that Christians need to try to do that\nAnd I do think that in doing so will act a lot more like Jesus or even this how about a lot more like Christians historically because of the moment we're in is not time for us to join in ratcheting up the outrage and and as you said earlier to your caller I'm telling people to arms\nYet that's not I mean ... that's not an uncommon view\nAnd I know some of the some of the worst things I see on social media\nI I click on a lake and I find go to the bio and its first thanks listen the thing is Christian and I'm like that's not what it's supposed to look like and I think that's what we need is a change in a lot of hearts\nI Will tell you this the ones who can teach us this right now or the the victims of ISIS and the ones who were were literally chained a as slaves or you know story after story after story of these Christian\nWho I mean I Know one family that actually wrote to ISIS after they said you're all dead were coming Saturday to kill you\nI'm a I think it was on I think it was on Sunday we're going to come on Sunday and kill you or if you don't submit and we're gonna crucify you the family sat down kids at all and wrote a letter and said\nWe understand we forgive you for that we're not we're not going to leave we'll be here you can come at three o'clock we only have that you do not crucify us it it is we're not worthy of that kind of a death\nAnd they lived because they stood up with Peter yeah unbelievable what's happening\nAnd we can learn from global Christians are also historically there was emperor fascinating ever called Julian the apostate I write about this in the book and he he actually he's called the apostate 'cause you know victors right the history and the Christians eventually became more prominent and and here's what he writes 'cause he's so angry about trying to hold back the advance of Christians either pagan and he's\nAngry about or tried to hold back the of course and he says this I'll watch the priest hated cub Social Security goes on and says either go all the young scholar Leon Scott only feed their own for but also came with them in there by\nGas ... it'd be really really yeah because they they it needs to a listen but it's also learning it's trying to learn how to communicate\nOr they're already so more votes than anybody on earth have driven how many uh book retailers out of business um and they're they're about to spend more on the original programming than even Netflix\nOr they're going to be the biggest Hollywood producer [laughter] there's so many things is it time to I mean I don't know what you do about it do you favor as a capital is breaking up a company that's what they did that Microsoft is what they did to or are they tried to Microsoft\nWhat they did with mountain bell I'm\nYvette mountain bell was in with the government\nI mean that was that was protected by the government and part of a you know that was\nThat was a protected property you couldn't you couldn't start anything against them\nRight that's why yeah I mean you know you could start your own Amazon you're not going to be able to compete on a ... they taught there are other options you know there are other options are just ... you know the problem is Amazon does everything better than everybody else you know this is a real problem where we've been talking about this whole week is\nI don't I don't want you to change Amazon I like Amazon I like Amazon Prime I like the fact until yesterday we were trying to build a stupid volcano for um my daughter and\nTanya went and got a three percent hydrogen peroxide and we're reading and I'm like I think Seventy five percent is a different kind of peroxide and it is so I didn't I mean it's a dangerous kind of peroxide [noise] um and we didn't have it so I go online and I'm like work and you get it Amazon\n[laughter] I mean it'll have you'll have tomorrow you know yeah that was ... I mean it's I don't want them to change some of these things\nYeah and and we're the same way with Google and Google's getting pretty intrusive things right but we we like their search engine yeah we'd like their browser their mail is greater mail is great I mean like free and so we just we\nGet it out or you know yeah yeah when it all off from Google Amazon you make the same arm of Amazon controls I mean people are like oh well I buy a lot of things for Amazon and that's obviously a big part of the bits and when they're cloud computing is really the main thing driving all of their profit off of\nUm you know and it's a and so many places or use it every place you go on the Web based government young Amazon yeah I mean\nAnd it's like you know Alexa at this point is a\nIt's a luxury a product of moderate\n... utility right like I mean I feel like it's fun to play with like we use it as a speaker you ask if the weather every once in awhile I mean there's a couple of things you can do it but I mean like I I don't know as a lecture changing my life now at the end I Know rhino abs so ... has changed my yes yeah I mean it's ... I I ... just the way he was shot from it yeah\nPrime out can deliver to your door within an hour yeah I mean you could\nI think you can safely say Amazon has almost\nKilled the them all\nYes yeah most of the ... right I mean it's you know and the ... Amazon and Google they have totally changed the world will get you know like there's a there's a big mall near where we're doing the show in Texas and\nYou know it's it's still has tons and tons of stores in it but you start to notice the way it changes it's changing from a place to shop into a place\nFor experiences yes there are lots of things for kids and lay goes stores and aquariums they took one of the big box stores and they made it into a giant um I think it's called the field house\nIt's a giant gym with like twenty five basketball courts in all leagues showing more and entertain

they've been out of power some about when then and now they have a social service\nBut she thinks she thinks there's some ... other turn it off and on and on and turn it off and turn it on so they're limiting the amount of people\nThat are real I mean you've seen the ... ... I'm surprised that more people did not get hurt though when you start looking at the idea that storm and where it hit how close it hit it could have had to like a major metropolitan area\nAnd it wasn't just twenty miles or twenty miles per hour from being a category five storm I mean this would be huge hurricane\nYeah my brother lives not near Panama City\nAnd how's he doing right okay uh his house survived good but we're all you know\nThinking I kept on them like you know you you should go evacuate I think you should leave and you know your tone of evacuations two days beforehand and he did them morning of the hurricane yeah Russian government aren't we yeah um\nBut you know he lives right on the water on and he built a house that's like twelve or you know like twelve feet above the ground and he said the water was four feet up\nOkay so so ... was a smart choices but you know it's so funny that you know think about that so so if your house is twelve feet off\nThe ground right every time that you pull into your driveway\nYou're getting your steps and make sure where on your ...

ah we have spotty cell service\nAll right so without the Internet\nWhat do you miss the most\nOh my God I'm probably social media\nFacebook that I heard Facebook in the background\nFake my daughter and my husband are here with me there are so um yeah I I I went to make a dinner for the last night and I thought oh I've got the rest of it away [laughter] I Can't list\nMy daughter and my husband

out the window [laughter] I'm very into her\nAnd all I did was eat it was like I had the nerve is chief\n[laughter] that's okay you know what you guys are doing good and it takes a while you know make sure that everything's all back in action and uh but certainly our our hearts and our first goes to everybody that has been affected by that hurricane especially as it continues just to keep moving on\nOff the coast um so I understand you have a question about the smart a speaker is once you get the power and once you get your Internet back\nRight yeah I mean I just heard a lot about you know everybody is saying that everyone should have and I'm like do I really neat what what would I use it for\nYou know it's a really good question because it's one of these gadgets that initially when you get you go wow that's really cool I mean so you can say you know tell me what's the weather is tell me what the traffic is going to look like order\nA more toilet paper paper towels or whatever it may be and they start moving up the actual long so then you say turn on the line\nAnd you can also say goodnight and when you say goodnight is that the alarm system will set the front door will walk the lights will go into a night mode and then suddenly on the smart speaker next year end table some white noise is playing to to to you to sleep\nThat is all that happen automatically\nKnow of course not you know that [laughter] you [laughter] if they like you to think that but you have to you have to buy all the gadgets along the way right uh-huh you got to buy the live the smart lights and the smart locks and then you have to program this but it's not very difficult to program it\nOr they were thermostats that like the ego be and the death that work with the Amazon Echo so that this way if you're sitting on the couch and you don't want to get your lazy but up and you can say you know turn the air down to Seventy six or turn the heat up to sixty six or whatever it may be\nAnd so it takes a while for you to get indoctrinated into it so to speak\nOr no pun intended with these smart speakers but once you once you get it I think that you'll understand like this was exactly how it's supposed
