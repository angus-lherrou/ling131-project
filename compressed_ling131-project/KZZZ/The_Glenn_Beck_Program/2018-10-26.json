Case it said about the um the caravan coming from a Honduras\nThey're marching north and you know what it could easily have been all of us that we're in the caravan there were marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nWe got to start putting ourselves in the shoes of other people\nWe've got to start thinking about the consequences that other suffer and we've been spared those by the grace of God let us be let us be appreciative let us count are blessed setting stop\nLet us take 'em anymore bill\nWe're within six hours my crack team found out who these people were what the real intention was\nA and the the crafts and John cases still or just say no no no the good people want to talk a little bit about uh the Caribbean\nI'm ... personal and okay so it's a long time he used to a sub for me once in a while and there are a\nFactor on a Fox I'm a good man a very sincere job running a Ohio but John ... is a theoretical guy he's not a real world guy and people want to know that\nSo you basically saying amen\nAnd we have to put ourselves in the position of somebody in Honduras\nWho uh is poor and oppressed because the society down there as violent and out of control okay but then what is the point of that exercise governor case that we allow everyone in Honduras to come to Ohio\nEvery one\nAnd the same thing with all the poor countries and the world because that's what your spouse thing by saying that the caravan people should be allowed to seek asylum in the United states that's what you're saying everyone can come here and do that\nWe would leave ... now California would be a foreign country within Eighteen months\nRight three year backlog right now of asylum um [noise] uh hearings and if you apply you are in the country you're here\nFor three years at least okay what do you do arrow who does fifty percent of all immigrant families both illegal and legal are on means tested welfare\nSo there's a one out of two chance that the American taxpayers are going to have to pick up some of your bills twenty two trillion dollar debt right now for the usa so if you look at the unintended consequences\nOf John ... six\nVision of compassion it's not compassionate all you're basically wrecking a system that does provide true opportunity for three hundred and twenty million Americans should they do what they need to do to succeed you'll wrecking that system governor case it\nDo you not understand that\nSee I can and that's the debate I mean I just crush them in the bay 'cause he would have no answer for any of that\nBill tell me who's behind this who's financing this\nWell I Do believe it's the progressive crew um the George Soros people um\nBecause that was done it in the past that we did a big thing on Bill O'Reilly dot com last night about Soros after CBS glorified and\nWe said no I'm the he's pumping in two thousand Eighteen this year alone tens of millions of dollars into the worst organizations and by that I mean they attack and smear anyone they disagree with David Brock runs one of them\nThat the media matters guy and I don't tell me that's you know this was a benevolent man so I Believe that these kinds of people I Can't prove it because there's no accountability in Honduras\nBut I Believe they're behind a big ... big money behind is everybody knows\nA bill I and I invite you to read what even the president of ... saying I'm this is this is backed by a Cuba Venezuela a and ousted president of Honduras\nAre that are blaming the United states for all of the unrest ah the former president says that ah America's gonna have to pay for all of this\nOr they'll have to accept our citizens this is just an ongoing internal battle\nA in Honduras that has quite honestly lied to many of their people um and said that America's gonna have to take you and they're going to because they're responsible for this man this is a Marxist a revolutionary\nUh that uh has tried to take Honduras by force the Supreme Court two branches of their government\nFound what he was doing to be unconstitutional and kicked him out and he's been causing problems ever since and now he Venezuela in Cuba are together and what was formerly known as ... but they are tested the United states and they're the ones financing at least the beginning of it that's\nHow it started now sorrows or others may be involved but I haven't seen any evidence of that yet but I Would not put it past them\nRight and and it would be interesting to see if there is a pipe line of cash going into ... so this is what I say I'm skeptical of everything and I agree with you there has been no hard evidence put forth of George Soros or people like him did this but if\nYou know it's it's one of his these things they've done in the past yes but the the government of Honduras should\nBe able to trace ... foreign money coming into that country back they should be able to show people this is what has arrived here so ...\nI Hope they do that if they if they believed Cuban Venezuela are actively involved in subverting their own country on doors and then by extension hurting the usa they have the ability to find that out\nThere or to let's go there are two other groups that\nThey don't want all this because it drains their infrastructure I mean this is an environmental disaster from Mexico these people only facilities that they are the\nWater they need food Mexican people are poor there's not the infrastructure to support their so yeah so how do they\nWould love shantytowns there with a mothers and babies and look at the United states they're rich and look at these people and let them in short but the Mexican government I'm telling you is under tremendous pressure by the Trump Administration not to allow any of this to happen\nSo so um how did you move seven to fourteen thousand people and just find enough water how is this not a humanitarian crisis\nDisaster but they have it set up where by there are tens who paid for those tents\nYou in the media would care no [laughter] I\nDon't know who they are and all I Want to know no pictures of the poor baby and you know older and you know but the mother known in a building you\nKnow they care so much about the Harry inside of this you ... you might think that they would find out is there enough baby formula yeah who's paying for it\nRight or ride it look we've been over this and all that it's been over this we don't have a a ... a honest press in America anymore which is enormous story\nThere is not being covered by the disarming president going to cover themselves so these guys like you and me we do it but you know the most of the American people feel that we do have a functioning on us press and we don't\nFind any level let me ask you this there was a story out this week and I know you've touched on it about the um one for college students were in Korea all distress in response to the Trump election twenty five percent said they felt like they had P. T. S. D.\nYeah this is that Arizona State university um and in Tempe um and and look it just an ongoing indicator\nThat there is a segment of the American population are under the age of thirty who cannot cope with life\nAnd that's why you're seeing the rise of opioids are opioids you seeing this whole thing it all plays into rice and we just can't handle it you know we can't handle any stress no stress so I didn't have any you know we\nWere micro aggressions I Know I'm offended by a sign I'm offended by a speaker I'm offended by hat I there's a frog over there you have fans\nIn Maine [laughter] can you imagine when they have children like gosh they're not going to be able to get up in the morning\nA it's but those people will fail they will fail in our system is our system not going to change is going to be competitive it's going to be self reliance that\nThe progress as would love to change it but it's not going to change in our lifetime and these people who have all of this anxiety about Donald Trump being present or whatever else it may be are going to fail\nIn the marketplace going to give you an opportunity to address Megan Kelly anything to say about making Kelly\nI think I was kinder to Megan Kelly than any other person in the news business as you well know um we featured her and on my program in a segment called the Kelly file which became her a name of her program when she got one\nUm we've promoted her and the beginning I thought she was a very honest you know great talent and did what I always do I helped her along subsequently um she turned out to be not a very nice person to me and many others at Fox\nMany others and went on her way and now it's not looking so good but\nI Am not a seriously and wants\nTo revel in anybody's a discomfort\nRight I don't like doing I specifically wants to know about what you think about\nLosing a job because uh you would dare ask a question\nIf you're not trying to tear somebody down and it's Halloween and here's this specific case about a woman who loved Diana Ross when is Diana Ross ... how is that offensive and losing your job\nIn our PC culture now and this ties and it was it's so ironic because ms Kelley one of the biggest boosters of me to um which of course um does not uh take into account\nShe did not know her comments may have been a ... to her in offensive but if you know your history I'm black faced entertainers in America we're used to denigrate African American\nAnd she she she knows that she should have known it you know what she does um\nNo I don't know about that back I really don't know if she if she knew that or not because she could have easily pointed that out and a couple of paragraphs before going into any kind of defense of it\nAnd she did not but in our in our media society now if you say anything out of the PC line in the network arena or if you're attacked\nBy me to situation in the network arena your career is over there is no due process no presumption of innocence no benefit of the doubt you're out\nIs it ironic at all that there are so many people on the left in the journalism that are celebrating her demise or\nNot all of its celebrating as much as\nIt's a virtue play you see this is what has risen all these left wing commentators see themselves as for ... oh Meghan Kelly or did you see what a curious than powers wrote in USA Today did you see that you know\n[noise] All right that you're you're a take a look at that\nBecause she's a Fox was a Fox News contributor which are and who I use a lot and she just scorched Kelly absolutely scorched or as a racist came flat out set it\nYou're a racist and you know what I Am a racist to this was what kept empowered said but I'm working on it I'm aware of my racist tendencies 'cause I'm white\nYou know for some parents everyone who's ... white privilege\nAlright but I'm working on it so I'm virtuous but she's not and this is what you get that all of these people that pile on and I'm certainly not going to do that to Megan Kelly or anybody else unless it's George Soros\nUm all of these people oh I'm really good person you know and it's very frightening what's happening in this country um I could tie it into killing the ss but I'm sure you don't want to hear that [laughter]\nOf course you could die ended up killing the as as\nWell it's all about it's all about what you can say\nIt's all about fear and that's what the Nazis were all about absolutely all about it\nGoes back to you cannot say things in America anymore you or you will be punished yes yes
