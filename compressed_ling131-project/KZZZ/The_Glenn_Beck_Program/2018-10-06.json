Randi [laughter] she's on the line he can tell you is Dorrie someone\nSomething good rather it seems like something out of new and so I just wanted to get the information out there that folks up because you know as you know hackers are finding new ways to probe into your uh to access your uh money\nAnd now just a few weeks ago we got a phone call from our local um I'm a credit union and they know our habits anyway they they they got a um a um\nCheck that said a so called purchase said it was near Fifteen thousand dollars from the um [noise] a popular a sporting goods chain and uh they produce to we went to St Louis excellent they produce that similarly there's it's our check we don't use too many checks\nBut somebody was able to take our check and others are there's there's there's or address there's are routing number there's our account number the the the check that one was a little bit different\nBut there was it was like for fourteen thousand five hundred dollar coins from from this this place and I called to if I can say the name of the company\nYeah sure go ahead yeah it's a ... okay so I called them\nThat's a lot older that's a lot of fishing gear by the way and everything and I vote [laughter] All right but wait wait before you continue I Want to know so the check looks really good\nIt was it was a it was\nOur check the only difference was that it had a different name on it [noise] and uh yeah so yeah we had that so when I I I contacted a they they were most interested in and saying what was going on because I told her I said that if it's it's not just one\nBut I suspect that there may be some other things going on maybe it's not only with our account but with other people's accounts as well sure and sure enough you out there it was and so they they put a ... I'm a stop on it but the guy said that he had his own experience was that this was the second or third ah like\nI'm a I'm a problem that he had seen and so I don't know if this was if you had any awareness that there is something that you might be able to offer because the next day here where at the credit union\nAnd and to do the fraudulent paperwork and or I kind of good stuff well the the bank manager right then they're as she got some information and she said hey they just took nine hundred dollars from your checking\nUm she yeah yeah they were so so so so that the number one I'm impressed that your credit union called you I mean that's really something right there I don't know a lot of banks that might do that\nA number two is that they were able to potentially passed this checks through so what are what are the banks say that you could do as a precautionary means right now\n[laughter] well the only thing that we had to do was to actually shut down the uh the our account number and switch over to another one not the the routing number was invented thing I'm most certainly because we wanted to maintain a weight we'd been there for years and they again they know our habits\nThat was a kind of a defense of layers\nAnd so I so I guess the the big thing they take away message here is that a lot of people don't like to keep track of their checking accounts right I mean\nWell sometimes it's just very easy not to think about doing that and I and to be honest this caught us at off guard a bit because we were right smack in the camp right smack in the middle of that just solar house and how we are we're right in the middle of moving I mean it was like a constant\nYou know and then when you're moving like that I mean jeeze I mean the last thing you want to think about is if somebody who's trying to steal from you know what I mean it's crazy\nUm you know what rainy thank you so much for your call today and thank you for spreading the word because there is any takeaway take home message from this is that if you have not been watching what's going on with your checking account\nYou need to do it at least once a month appointment on your calendar so that have popped up on your phone and say you know it just scan it doesn't take too long\nI mean obviously you've noticed a Fifteen thousand dollars taken out but they may just start by with just a

mentioned by a work in the banking industry do okay to do a do it or not support for people that call up\nSo do I do Internet support for people that call up to the end\nHave issues with their website or unable to log into our phone up things like that and a lot of times you know how people are when they are on hold bill push this button though that button to try to get a life you know\nAnd I've actually taken calls just like what you're describing also liquid Randy called in probably about ten minutes ago right so\nWe're in light of all of these things and then you just mentioned about technology and you mentioned about monitoring couch when I'm done primary but large amount of the people that call and generally seniors are they tend to be a good target for fraudsters\nWhat do you think is probably the best reason for them to get involved or stay involved on line with technology what's the biggest reason than your mind that would be beneficial to them\nAnd what why do you ask 'em personally I've run into the worst um I've I've I've\nSeen and heard it all over the many many years that have been doing this uh I've talked to many Rand is over the past um I've dealt with\nThe

after the faster if they are\nSomebody who is still gets a paper statement than the good at the end of the month it's as far as the money is long gone\nAnd the ability to recover is is\nJust you know that that's a good point you're right previous position\nThat that's a real chance that's a really good point is that I'm thinking of even my mother she gets a paper statement at the end of the month right by the time you get the statement your account can be wiped out\nAnd exactly so you don't do the so the whole thing is to educate the right\nTo get to empower people so and empower seniors that
