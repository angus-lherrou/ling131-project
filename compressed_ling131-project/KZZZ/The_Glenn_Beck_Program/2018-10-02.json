percolating and they just make hay out of it um we go back to normal and ... the GOP loses the house to the Democrats\nThe Democrats than are going to demand testimony from Donald Trump because they're going to try to impeach him they're going to demand is tax records because they're going to impeach him and the White House response by going to the Supreme Court and says that the president doesn't have time to do this yadda yadda\nUm and the Democrats then I'm wads a Kavanaugh to recuse himself she won't do and you all do it doesn't happen a and the the house then moves to impeach Canada Day so we got a\nYear of fun oh ... okay uh let's say he's not confirmed because flake or Collins or Murkowski or Heller\nOkay they just don't believe him and the Republicans dropped the ball they have NO PLAN\nAnd they just like well you know and where you need your vote because we're a repeal Obamacare do they lose the house and possibly the Senate worst case scenario if they don't get they don't get them through down because of the Republican and because of this week with Jeff Flake\nPeople are just like okay the Republicans are worthless and they don't come out with a huge plant yeah I think you're right they'll try to turn that into a reason to get to the polls but if if it's the Republicans that cause it I don't know how it's going to I don't think it'll work\nOK mothers scenario he is confirmed\nThe house impeach is Trump\nThe house or in peaches Kavanaugh on perjury\nThink that is if they were in the house you know they're going at least attempt and they will attempt Trump and probably Kavanaugh to correct if we lose the house and the Senate\nThese things are happening and there was there was no chance of them being removed but you will have the next two years of non stop impeachment hearings of both capital and Trump OK mhm\nThe only one that seems good to me is I'm a ... if Kavanaugh loses the vote\nThe only one that I think works out is Kavanaugh loses the vote which could be really bad because it will be the Republicans that do it um however Donald Trump comes out\nAnd while she says yup that's over here's the guy he ups the ante and you get a guy that all conservatives are rabid about\nDay somebody who you just know oh my gosh that's a skill Leah\nRight now Brett Kavanaugh has not been a lot of people's favorites I mean they're okay with them but no I\nAlways willing to die in a sword for em em remember remember Kavanaugh was not on the initial list of judge right from Trump and there's lots of them\nHe asked them later I personally think the best course of action\nIs to nominate let's say let's say flake and Collins come out and go you know what I Can't do it I'm not going to vote on friday I Can't vote for him great\nDonald Trump with in ten minutes should be on television and say in my opinion Mike Lee is the next the nominee and you know what he's already been vetted for the FBI and every senator knows them\nAnd your

stories that you you talk about because I Would I like about this this is not a gun is not a book about um you know necessarily the laws and everything else this is a story about America and how\nWe we do ... I mean we're unlike any other nation on earth when it comes to guns in our history take me through like a either Sam colder or buffalo bill who might say\n... probably the most amazing Americans that ever lived I mean not only was he an engineer and and just created this incredible innovation where\nA person one from firing one you know must get shot once a minute or maybe twice a minute to shooting five times in mere seconds he was also just an innovator and in in marketing in selling himself in\nThe in using the press to to to sell sell to other people and using and using\nEngineering to to create something that he can make cheaper so their normal American than normal man the normal woman can get their hands on it and um changed the west\nIt changed the way that the relationship a person has with with a weapon and I'm here so I ... you know he was before Henry Ford he was using interchangeable parts it was like first industrial revolution so he was just amazing man and almost it was my favorite chapter to right I think he needs you know more when it ...\nIt on him yeah so I'm here we are at the the one year anniversary of a Las Vegas shooting of Las Vegas [noise]\nUm did you and you're looking through history did you ever find another time in American history and I should say you know a free progressive uh where guns had been viewed in America as anything but good\n[noise] no I I sort of actually you know in in the in the nineteenth century guns were sort of idealized romanticized in books and things of that nature\nIt wasn't until the thirty is really when I started to think about [noise] um and and and for some good reason people running around with machine guns shooting up places you can go now swear so I mean there was a legitimate fear that some people had [noise]\nUm but before that time no one even thought to limit\nGun ownership in any way I mean certain places and the west maybe they have certain areas where you couldn't have a gun because everyone was drunk and fighting but generally no one had to go and ask the government the state uh for a gun I think in fact that when you think about\nThe second amendment how you think about the ideals behind it tells us a lot about how do you think about freedom in general I think you're pretty authoritarian if you think that the individual shouldn't be able to defend themselves and rather should rely solely on the state\nBecause you could have um you could have had a gambling and I think you can still buy a gambling I'm legally ah but you could buy a gambling gun but we didn't have those you know the mass shootings\nOr one is a little harder to conceal of gambling gun in a violin case but also because the government's prohibition\nOf alcohol led to the formation of these huge terrible and powerful mob [noise]\nYeah and and you know they used Tommy guns and you see them in a movie at movies and um\nYou know it's kind of fix it's fictitious only in that but the gun has ... you know big blow back and it's not that easy to shoot and it was almost never really used in criminal activity there was more scare mongering by people who want it to ban them not I'm not saying people should have Tommy guns and driving around in their cars but I'm just\nSaying I I Am yeah I'm okay with that if you're responsible citizen I'm fine with that that's true that's very well so and so I'm David hum when we were together how long does ten years ago\nI I don't know ... yeah almost\nYeah so ten years ago if I Would have said to you in your lifetime do you think there will be a serious move 'em that either comes close or does\nTake away America's right to guns you would have thought that was a crazy question if I'm not mistaken do you think\nCan you\nActually yeah I Do but I Do feel better about the second amendment than I Do the first fourth fifth and others\nBecause\nThere were four hundred million guns out there and I think that the people who who are part of the culture that I'm writing about and talking about will not hand them over that easily so I'm I'm less worried about them than I Am a [noise] a certainly a First Amendment I think for most but others as well\nYou lose the second and you definitely lose the first ...

Antonio Houston Dallas Richmond Hershey, Pennsylvania Pittsburgh a Cleveland Kansas City Evansville Tulsa Tampa and Orlando grab your tickets it's going to be a lot of\nFun [noise] All right [noise]\nStew mhm [noise]\nThey now believe now this is alleged Cummings they now believe that uh [noise] have it on each to take a lie detector tests [noise]\nFirst of all the first thing you need to do when someone mentioned divided in protest to stop learning ... and type in a YouTube\nAnd then Penn and teller or I won't say the forward but BS about lie detector tests and just watch that episode you will be done at how terrible\nThe idea of ever given any one a lie detector test is and of course you know obviously Penn and teller an entertaining presentation of the of the information but is that the checks out I mean they're they're really I just I it's behind lights out lie detector tests are not you can beat them yeah and it's it's not\nI mean it's it it it is not the end all be All right not to the what it is useful for a in certain circumstances\nIs the uh idea of a\nIntimidation right if you were to say I'm going to give you a lie detector test you have to tell me the truth\nIt's possible that the person tells you the truth because they're scared of the lie detector test right\nUm and that's where it's most useful if not to say that there's you know there's almost literally nothing behind them I mean it does not tell you when you life not like there's no such thing there is no way to do that think about it and it's incredible and it's one of those things that I think most people take for granted if you pass a lie detector test you're telling the truth that it's not really the ... the way it works\nYou know yesterday we had Larry sharp on he's running for governor of New York now and November how he had these out of the box ideas you know there's like ... nobody's talking about that yeah I got an idea OK okay\nWe administer sodium Penn is all\nTo a Ford Kavanaugh and ... higher committee\nMhm okay okay and then we just let the cameras are all this has nothing to do with getting the truth I just want to see it I just am I Want to see\nAll that bad I was doing that and I will I Do that last week\nYeah [laughter] I thought it would you love to see these guys because nobody is talking about fines Feinstein really\nNobody in the media is despicable I mean the I don't want to just take one side 'cause I'm not God so I don't know what happened I happen to believe Kavanaugh of on forward and\nMost of that is because Ford has changed her testimony several times a day you just did it or to there's nothing support it but maybe she's telling the truth I don't know I'm not God\nSo if I have to put them in a room and choose one or the other I'm going to choose him because I don't think she has enough evidence for me to credibly say\nYeah he's a bad guy and even if I kind of believed her yeah I still would ... there was a ... there that it's not on him you know he's not a not proven negative correct so I I Hope he didn't do it um and I don't think she has proven that he did by any stretch it out I don't mean beyond a shadow of a doubt I mean just a preponderance of evidence\nThere is an inclination I mean I honestly I just want I Do not believe he did it I frankly don't need to not believe I don't either I'm now that's not to say I'm as you point out we're not God even though they're pretty cool um so it's possible okay ah but yeah I I don't I don't believe that he did right so we've plowed this field\nOver and over and over again you know how come nobody is plowing the field on how much they've destroyed her life Senator Feinstein is destroyed her life\nThey lied to her several times lied to her she requested anonymity they released a letter anyway causing a chain of events that would obviously reveal who she was um\n... obviously they lied to her about the Democrats are the Republicans not willing to come out and take her testimony in California yeah she was surprised by that\nI mean look to be Frank I mean she's told many lives in this process as well um and I I don't how does realize what low things like you know she'd ever fly that's why she can't make it to the hearing and then oh well yes I Do fly often\nA named source and those people say the exact same thing and say they've seen evidence of the actual uh\nAnd again we have no one that forward told about it at the moment in fact in any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually he had like having a I've said the name Kavanaugh even at that\nTime yeah but but but ... and I mean you I mean you don't have videotape well\nThere was a videotape now we haven't seen it yet though are now there is allegedly videotape that exist some one of these physical altercation we actually we have not seen it yet I'm of course there's no video of the cabinet thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing\nThat we have to take her word that there is video with the\nWith the with the ... and we don't have that evidence yeah we have a a ton of evidence and in fact\nI don't know hundreds of times more there's really no evidence and the fourteen so we are I mean like we have any amount more it was like we have a preponderance of evidence in the Alice in case\nThe however um what's interesting about this is that fifty six\nPercent of Democrats believe Christine Blasey Ford's allegations fifty six percent only eight percent say they ... they believe Kavanaugh fifty six to eight\nIs a split there so you assume that if you ask people and it wasn't a partisan situation what do you think about the Alison situation do you what do you believe from her 'cause she's got a more recent allegation she actually brought it to the attention in real time to multiple people people around her have seen evidence of it there's text messages there is a there are medical notes\nAll the evidence that we just talked about there's\nAn infinity amount times more evidence in the elephant case\nYet only five percent of Democrats believe Allison's accuser we're told over and over again that women are to be believed it only five percent of Democrats believe the allegations against Keith Ellison and here's\nWhy this is really important I'm just like I don't want an abuser and the Supreme Court\nIf if there was the amount of evidence on Kavanaugh that there is on a Keith Ellison I Would not be for Kavanaugh would you if there was amount on have enough I Would yeah I Would if if if the evidence was the same way yeah\n\nWe still have a standard here in this country um called innocent until proven guilty and preponderance of evidence is a floor is a lower level than that\nAnd I understand that um my issue here would be\nYou can once there is in the legal standard because people will say well this is just a job interview or this is just a legal proceeding once you have the absence of a legal standard you'll have to choose the standard you apply\nI Choose to apply it very high standard because people who are in relationships many many times when he relationships breakup or someone feels jolted say things that are not true I haven't done all that I agree with you in this case\nI'm Keith Ellison should have the right to defend himself\nAnd he should we should assume his innocence unless I at three point in which he is and if especially with a case like this where it's very recent that should just go through the legal system\nAnd when he comes out and he's guilty then he should get thrown out of that job and you can factor that in in your vote if you wish\nBut I don't think he should lose any job because of this at this point he needs to you need to be able to see whether this case goes through and and claims are proven someone had said they have video we need to see the video we see everyone a ... in investigated we need to see an actual police\nAh investigation go through and and and the weather the evidence leads us to a belief that he actually committed these acts if we do not get that\nYou do not ruin people's lives over it I mean think about the amount of times of evidence that there is a with Keith Ellison overall you more which everyone I mean even at a lot of people on the right where like look ... really looked like he did these things his answers are really bad\nI you know there's much more evidence for he's a lot more ... much more there's people you can interview right now yeah children who went through traumatic moments where they had to read about their mom being abused or you know sure her telling other friends at the time\nThat being said however you didn't you he went through this process with the presumption of innocence I agree\nSo but what I Know about she fell assumes the evidence against him okay\nAssuming this was not current day and it was thirty five years ago if for ... would come with that evidence I have letters\nI have a photo of lead bruises on my arm I have um uh I can tell you where it happened I told my friends and here they are they verify that I told them after the party ... would you not\nWould you not go okay I think that's good yeah I mean I think that would be enough and it was the only way we can judge this situation ... correct here it is with Alison and again this\nCorrect correct here it is with Alison and again this is why it's important just like I don't want to have a Supreme Court justice that is an abuser or a liar or whatever\nI also think it's extraordinarily dangerous to have a guy who\nMay have beaten his girlfriend may have mentally abused his girlfriend assuming the evidence is real and checks out you can't have him as the as the the the chief law enforcement of the state\nRight and just anybody care no this shows you that nobody in the media\nHairs and iota\nFor this woman and her story they don't care if she was abused and they don't care about any of it what they care about stopping Brett Kavanaugh\nIf they cared they would be just as passionate as a guy let's not just thrown out of the Minnesota attorney general this is a guy who was second in charge of the ... what the the DNC ... this is not a a a ... a peripheral figure in politics he's one of the most powerful Democrats in America and is now going to be a chief law enforcement officer for state\nAnd you could say oh well it's all you're what you're doing is what about them no no it's not it's not what about some I apply that same standard Elton that I applied to Kavanaugh you weren't doing this to Kevin I Would still be saying this about I'm I'm a about Alice yeah and look at going back to whites bracket why was Brock Obama president\nRight above was president because he won a presidential election in two thousand eight\nPreviously he made a heck of a speech\nAnd what two thousand four\nAnd a two thousand four ... election he won a Senate seat a Senate seat that would have been incredibly close if he was going against not Alan Keyes who they flew in the last week\nTo just started a campaign but it was a Jack Jack Ryan but it might be thinking of junk present gave this point I'm [laughter] I think too many Amazon commercials but uh Ryan was his last name and he was a legitimate challenger\nTo Brock Obama in that Senate race it was a close election and he may have won it\nAs a Republican in Illinois wow and what they did is they went through his divorce is sealed divorce or um hearings and ... and paper work out at it to the public and in there there were accusations by his wife the actress who said they went to a swingers clubs and all this sort of shady stuff\nDo we know if that was true\nIn added horse proceeding and the divorce proceeding people make all sorts of lanes yeah and that's why you don't just believe them that's why the ... because they went and got them unsealed in a democratic state and they they they ... Brian eventually dropped out there was no real opposition for a bronco bomb and you've got eight years of them\nThat sort of thing should be always\nViewed skeptically every claim of a crime should be viewed skeptically by people on that side you're supposed to give the presumption of innocence and posts to start with skepticism of a claim on any side on any side on any side of all people who are accused\nAnd here we are in a situation where Democrats overwhelmingly believe the accusations against capital with almost no evidence\nAnd they only five percent of them believe the woman who is a Democrat who does not want someone up a ideologically opposed to ... to ... and to have that job she's a Democrat\nAnd only five percent of people believe her the the platitudes you hear from the media and the left I mean nothing on the story they do not care about whether Ford was abused or not they don't [noise]\nAnd this shows you how fast that standard is applied and how [noise]\nAnd how your life could be destroyed\nYou are on the wrong side of an issue and by the way\nI think you've seen\nThe issues change\nAnd a physician's what's politically correct changes and if you don't abide one hundred percent and you're not on the right side will destroy your life [noise]\nWhile they'll let somebody else be fine [noise]\nThis is why we must have a standard we must have a standard [noise] getting dangerous to be an American [noise]\nThat's the frightening thing to say [noise]\nI've been telling about gold mines do silver maple flex bar that to the maple flex far here so\nCan you open this up and and a member ... pizzas off what it is it's it's a it's a\nIt's a bar of silver a ... and it's it's made by the Canadian meant and what you do is you take it and you break it apart and it's in one tenth of announced one quarter of an ounce I couldn't get that one open either leaves me no one\nBut you might be able to stop me\nWith the United way you can tutor me be my mentor or volunteering and just to read with me there are tons of ways people like you can help kids like me stay in school [noise]\nMake me sick fast [noise] not a statistic [noise]\nTake the pledge to volunteer now and the United way down or to you\n\n\n[noise]\nBattle wears on I'm Lisa ...

named judge belief site that's where you brought with ads run dry so nice to meet you and judge side is going to be running as a write in candidate\nFor the position of judge of the superior court division sick now so I mean you may be a little confused because we already had a primary in fact I had\nA lady who was running for that and um we will be speaking on now in after the break about why

minutes introduce yourself to people and tell them why you're here today\nMy name is Billy site and it might be very important to know how to spell this in about a month B. I. L. L. Y. S. I. P. E. I made my hobby county superior court commissioner judge pro tem and had been for almost four years\nI'm a native of my hobby county I was born and raised in Kingman, Arizona and I've lived in Kingman, Arizona virtually in my entire life obviously went away to college for seven years and after I graduate graduated from law school in Nineteen eighty eight I came back\nAnd establish ... came in Arizona for the next twenty six years and then about four years ago I was appointed to the commissioner judge potent position in Kingman\nWhat is actually going to a protest means well\nWhat approached him is is it's a title as a judge when you're not a permanent judge such as a Supreme Court judges Supreme Court judges appointed by the governor or elected depend on the circumstances and you're pretty much a permanent judge you have to run for election every four years\nThe judge protests him is more of a temporary type position where you served at the pleasure of the presiding judge which is the audible Chuck burglar\nAnd every judge pro tem and Bobby county has eventually become a full time permanent judge right now it's more of a temporary judge but I have the same responsibilities and duties as any other judge on the Supreme Court bench very\nGood so when we come back from our break we're going to get into why you you are running as a write in a at the general election on November sex\nAnd um how people can help you out on that and hopefully people call in if you have any ... any questions came in Ninety two eight seven five three twelve thirty Bullhead night to eight seven six three fourteen Ninety and toll free one aid for four to one nine twelve fifty where here in Studio a judge deli side he\nNow make it easier it'll be one line\nV. I. L. L. Y. S. I. P. E.\nIs very important to them also fill in the oval bubble because if you write my name and that will not kill\nYou also must fill in and dark and the dog 'cause you can the old all the other thing of please keep in mind is this is the vision six on the ballot there'll be division one division two division three\nDivision for division six\nLike cause a lot of problems so make sure it's division six perhaps an easy way to try to remember that are hash tag is side for six so that might be an easy way to remember division six that you're writing side in four but again it has to be both names Billy and site right\nAnd again I Can't convey that more that you can't just write Billy you can't just write site you can't write Mr site or you can't say him you have to write belly site and dark in that little oval you know someone who's read for office and I've been on the ballot by myself\nI I still get that nervous thing you have to still even though it would be one name you have to ... you know right in and fill in that oval or else that doesn't count I don't think people understand that all the time\nSo early voting begins October tenth and if you get permanent mail in ballots you should be receiving them or you can go to the library\nAnd at the library to since since ... the site is an official right and so you could at any time you can write in Mickey\nMouse if you wanted to but that doesn't count it only counts if the if the person\nWho is a a write in candidate filled out some paperwork I assume with the county correct and um so they will count that the votes for him and so I'm at that time is up the absence obviously\nYes that is correct this is not the traditional campaign we may have several months we made the decision was seven weeks before the election\nThat is a really small time frame um to get the word out and what I've been telling people is what's so important to me is that the voters be educated as to the qualifications other candidates\nEven if you don't believe the judicial system of an impact on your life as trial court judges\nWe make decisions every day that effect community in fact the lives of people and sometimes we make very difficult decisions and it takes a lot of experience and wisdom to make some of these decisions and\nWhat I really want the voters to understand and research there on their own is the qualifications of respective candidates I think that's so important I'm not convinced\nThat the voters in the primary\nAt all the facts and knew all the qualifications of the candidates and that's what I'm really advocating as please do your own research and determine\nWho you want to serve in the community as a judge based on their qualifications and based on what they've done during their\nTenure as a judge says I Am now or is an attorney you\nKnow after the primary within the party there was a lot of discussion about how this could happen and it makes sense I mean I don't think it's rocket science you know I'm a lot of people a lot of people didn't vote at all\nI Know I for one and I'm sure some people in the audience if if I don't know the names of anybody I I Will not vote for someone if I like their name it's not a horse sound horse race you liked their name and you and your bet on them\nUm and and and that was true with this race I'd say as many people didn't vote as voted for somebody on the ballot\nShow 'em to get that information out is very trying and um judges the judicial arm cannot do certain things that we can do as just regular elected politicians\nSo it's very important and so we were we were talking about maybe in the future ... how to get that information out and so we said not everybody knows the judge but most everyone knows a lawyer\nAnd so it's look at it like that like a professional reference if you don't know them call up and someone that works in the legal field and say who these judges you know are they respected I mean who you gonna vote for so I'm I\nThat's my advice to people just call someone who's in that world you know someone who works for a lawyer is a lawyer but that's kind of now after the fact that for the future so right now\nA judge Billy side is running as a write in candidate for division sex superior court judge and um so what if some of the things that you plan on doing to get your name out and to get your position out well\nOne nice thing that's been really overwhelming\nIs the support I've been receiving I have been humbled quite frankly what the medal support I received in the community that includes the private community the legal community the political committee and mommy county and again I'm very humbled by it\nAnd so a lot of people understand the importance\nAnd the reason I'm running as a write in candidate and they were supported me a lot of people or spreading the word is the best that they can I Am ...\nIn the word the best that they can I Am speak and it has many groups as I possibly can I Would like to go to\nEvery corner of a hobby county and talk to voters and explain why I'm running the reasons I'm running my qualifications cause I really want them to know my qualifications of what I've been to the bench\nAnd you are here now that we we've heard the situation sort of for the most part so far can I ask you about your qualifications where you've come from things you've done a as a judge both him\nWell it really starts back to being an attorney and again typically when you are elevated to the bench there's a body of work something object this objective that somebody could see and measure\nAnd again before I took the ban Charles an attorney for twenty six years practicing law for twenty six years in of itself\nIs substantial experience that the length of time as an attorney I tried one hundred and Twenty one joy draws during that time period I don't know too many attorneys have tried that many cases to a jury during that time period\nI litigated countless motions involving very serious constitutional issues and other very important legal issues\nI have handled everything from a misdemeanor shoplifting to triple homicide to death penalty cases though I just have a tremendous amount of experience as an attorney\nI also have spoke at many seminars\nI've always was again very humbled when somebody thought enough of my experience in my skill didn't teach and train other people so I've spoken to many seminars as an attorney and I've spoken twice as a judge already at seminars\nLaw enforcement what often contact me and asked me to train them which is kind of ironic because most police officers do not like defense attorneys\nMost police officers really liked me and respect me as an attorney\nBecause they knew I was always very fair and honest with them\nDuring my practice and they're on cases I had with them and so they understood that and they appreciate it so they would often ask me questions or asked me to come and train them and give them tips as well\nThe other thing is important to give back to a community through my Rotary Club an active and many many sort of charitable events in the community through my Rotary Club I had what I call the Easter basket project for every year\nWe put together Easter baskets and then we give these Easter baskets out under privileged children in the community that's a project is very near and dear to me I've been to Mexico\nWhere we distributed wheelchairs to people who otherwise could not be mobile because they don't have the finances to be mobile also we distribute in wheelchairs\nAnd so given back to the community is is very important as well and when you have a a body of work you obviously\nAchieve a certain level of respect and reputation in the community as well and as a judge again I've been a judge for almost four years and\nBeing a judge is not glamorous if anybody thinks that this is a great job just put on your role to get on the bench and you get all the glory and fame that's not it whatsoever it has a job that you have to dedicate yourself to\nIt's almost like you're a judge twenty four seven because you're constantly work in research and so you can make the best decisions that again affect the community and the lives of people\nAll right we're heading into a quick break I got a judge Billy site here on the show he's going for a write in candidate see in the general election coming up in November for district six\nOf politicking Tuesdays wait till the ... division divisions six almost [noise]\nAh it's politicking Tuesday withheld Angus where uh we mostly correct me and make sure we could have a right information out to the people if you want to call in and get some information over here to us in Studio all you need to do was dialing in Kingman and golden valley nine to wait seven five three twelve thirty in Bullhead city nine to eight seven six three fourteen Ninety\nNo ... you are correct and and a good it's a good example is when judge con retired I had applied for his position now if a judge retires mid term\nThe position is appointed by governor do say it's not an election\nIf a new position opens\nThen it's appointed by governor do say it's not an election and I think of the process I went through when I applied for division three I first had to submit a very lengthy very detailed application\nThat as pretty much every question that could be asked to find out everything about me\nHave ever been arrested for a crime ever been sued I'm just a very detailed questions and then you have to ...\nVery detailed questions and then you have to have a lot of references you have to submit writing samples and I think that with all my attachments my application pack and I think was in\nLike eighty five pages it was a very detailed packet that another entity the governor's office is going to review as it start vetting the applicants\nAfter that then they invited three of us to be interviewed in public and the board of supervisors auditorium by the governor step\nThat's never happened and the history of my hobby county as far as ... that and let's try to find the best person for this position and then after all the interviews the members of the public will and we're a we're allowed to address the members of governor's office\nTo to give him give their comments and input on the candidates\nAfter that the three candidates and had to go to Phoenix\nAnd then do a private interview with the governor's staff as well and then we weren't sure whether or not we're going to be interviewed by the governor directly or not that was a possibility but after the interviews in Phoenix never satisfied and they appointed judge Steven moss for that position of or a good choice\nAnd we didn't have to be interviewed by the governor personally\nSo I think about that vetting process and I think to myself that is a very good process to make sure that the people that are serving on the bench a extremely important position judges have an enormous amount of power\nAnd authority and decision making decisions that we make almost never appealed\nAnd when they are ill were rarely overturned so decisions we make pretty much is what's going to happen and they're not going to change\nAnd so I really advocate for a process where you have to meet certain criteria you have to have certain qualifications and you are vetted the way the governor's office that candidates that they're in a position to a point\nRight and we'll talk more about that but I Believe we have a caller on the phone and\nIt sounds like an intense vetting process [noise] golly you're on live and local who are you on how are you\nFrom a John ... city and I'm currently enjoying the Martin miracles indoor air conditioning [laughter]\nMarvelous John how are you in the what do you have for the drugs today\n[noise] well I was actually a intending to call in a bit earlier or I had a question I wanted to run by bill and hill the\nUm the judge being is actually a pleasant surprise it's more of a national issue more of a a large scope thing and it's it's something that's all it's a very one sided right now the Brett Kavanaugh issue right yeah um I was wondering where any all stand them\nOkay well we'll talk about that for a couple of minutes before we go back um I I I Believe\nThat um it's a witch hunt and it couldn't forever change the way that um we that Supreme Court nominees um if you ... seconds you have access to Facebook\nJohn ah\nOld only on like a cell phone which is what I'm going on right now I can absolutely right out of who will Google I'm\nBen Sasse S. A. S. S. E. and he gave a statement\nWhen he was it was his turn to interview judge Kavanaugh and I think he said it all um as for what how I Believe things have changed for the worst and why we are where we were we are but that like the judges um you know he has a unique\nUm perspective on that\nWe're ... it's a very pleasant surprise ...\nWell I'm not sure I'm allowed to say on the air is how I feel about the vetting process of judge Kavanaugh I mean he clearly is more than qualified to serve on the United States Supreme court\nAnd I've not heard a single attack\nAbout his legal wisdom his legal experience his decision making I've not heard one comment that you can't be on the Supreme Court because he is somehow a flawed judged by all accounts he's a remarkable judge\nAnd as a kid has a remarkable a body of work and that's just the word that I use a body of work that you can measure to determine whether this person should sit on the Supreme Court or not and and clearly he is more than qualified to sit on the Supreme Court and\nI don't know how political I should get your or not but this is simply an attack on the twenty sixteen presidential election that's all this is that it has nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh personally have not those qualifications of simply attack on President\n... we only have a minute left I Know someone's been hanging on so lovely hung out they hung up to the right John did did that answer your question\nSo while they hung up they hung up that high John did did that answer your question a air\nOh well I don't want to make a broad political statement here okay or Wally understand that judges qualified um they're rather that is qualified for the position I think it's a really ugly picture of the the the moral degradation of America\nThat these allegations might come to nothing at all I think that they should be a rather amorphous hideously pursuit\nWell I ... latest allegation John don't you think they already have\nAgainst cabinet\nI'm a you know they should be taken rather more seriously what do you say here's impales ladies base of ads are being taken out\nSo you wait so you think that that there should be a against a cabin are against his accusers\nIs it a judge or\nRather have it all OK well we'll talk about that in that time where we hear a judge site but maybe next week will will there'll be some more to talk about that thanks for calling John thank you stay on the air time you go to you too\nAll right we're getting close to a break here on live a local and going to give up the numbers on the other side but we've got to heal the I guess and the judge believes that if you're in the studio we're talking about the upcoming election in November stay tuned on gay AAA capability\nThree tours driving
