I didn't find that at all so I I Want to\nWhere we struck me about the films how how complicated it is and I want to play a scene that I think exemplifies that's this is when your brother in the film played by Michael Shannon tells you that your mother hit on him to take a listen to this\nIs for him and she was looking at me like she was she hit [noise] what'd you do\n[noise] [laughter]\nOh I should say a ...\nReally glad you brought them and [noise]\n[laughter] [laughter]\nThis is a situation that a lot of families find themselves in a a parrot getting older of having to go from being taken care of being a caregiver for your parents and again you'd be forgiven for thinking this is a very big Ernest films but there's there's kinda funny moments like that\nYou know I think that in situations like this you have to find ... and I think all is a bath chunk of the writer director did a great job and doing that and without that you kind of come by I mean I went\nThrough taking care of my dad who that lung transplant and I took three years off my working to be his whole caretaker and you had to find ... are you there were moments that no one looking in would maybe find funny but you just you you know you either you break down and cry or you laugh\nAnd so there are I think a lot of moments in the movie that are unexpected where there is laughter\nHave you done good thank you doing All right yeah yeah did for him yeah I think you know I was wondering about that when I when I saw it when I saw the news like I mean of course if that happens to having to all of us really does change the relationship dynamic to someone who you know ... they got close free up close yeah a kid I Know all of a sudden you're looking after them\nYeah and you know you hear it time and time again and it's part of life it's what happens is like you you're born in someone's taking care of you and then you go through taking care of yourself and then you start taking care of others and then you're taking care of your parents it's you know it's\nLife so this must have been crossing your mind a lot when you're making this film\nYeah it was I'm I was a pretty great movie to step into after being a caretaker and him being in that kind of position of how do you care take and how do you take care of yourself through being a caretaker and where do you find support and um how do you find support and how do you get through your\nDay yeah just turning into speaking with Hilary Swank a two time Oscar winning actor who is very crazy I think oh yeah\nLet's do this is Sylvana credited yeah there has to do it is or it could be something to get used to know Russia or not we're talking about her latest film is talking about me and later found was called what they had a and speaking of actually let's let's take a listen to this\nI Want to thank Brandon Tina for seeing\nSuch an inspiration to us all his\nLegacy lives on through our movie to remind us to always be ourselves to follow our hearts to not conform I pray for the day when we not only accept our differences that we actually celebrate diversity thank you very much [noise]\nThat is you winning an Oscar as your effective speech in two thousand for your own in both do cry yeah has really hear it uh well\nIt's crazy to think that now here we are how many years later I'm Eighteen years later and we're still saying the same thing and we're still really working on that same issue of um inclusiveness and um the quality and um\nI think we've come further but it's still crazy to think that people are still\nNot allowed to to live the way they see that they're that themselves or their lives because of the way the juice which gender they choose to be or they choose to same she's at the same person same sex to love yeah um it's it's\nAs was feels like a long time ago it feels like we should have come further I'm Glad we've come a long but I feel like we still have a long way to go\nSo how do you react to the whole settled you'll have something how do you react to set your hands and coming under fire for for taking a role playing and playing a trans person I mean you know with these issues are in a society right now I often hear people reference goes down quite a talk about I mean this must give you pause\nUm you know I feel like I understand and\nI'm I being a part of a film that started the conversation in it and that kind of real way um I get it I I I feel like people should all types of people should have the opportunity to tell a story and especially their story um I Do think um\nYou know uh I wasn't known I wasn't well known I a lot of people are like oh if you're famous you more people see the movie and that's not necessarily true\nYou know I wasn't famous than boys don't cry got scene and it got it won an Academy Award so um I think that every once you get an opportunity to audition and I think whoever's right for the role should get it\nSo when you hear when you hear the controversy happened you're you're the the veto necessarily think have you know you need to be a ... a person\nRight I don't think that you and I I I I Do think that that trans people and have people ... and questioning people need the opportunity to work and ... edition and I think that there are a lack of those opportunities and that's not fair\nYou know over the course of your career you played a single mom with transgender teen waitress turn boxer a daughter of a woman with dementia and we we've talked a little bit about staying true to the characters inhabit have to you and how you write down you you kind of rude to the essence of the film and boil it down to his sentence I feel like you take a real responsibility when you take on a roll do see it that\nWay yeah I Do especially when it's a true story it's really really a big responsibility to take on a true story on and I think it's a you know it's someone's life it and I don't take that lately I really\nFeel that something that you need to do justice to 'em and and it's it's different than playing a fictional world you know 'cause of liberty and you've license to\nTo play around and and change it up and you don't really in a true story\nIs nice to talk to you this far out of that cause another part of the Oscar speech that we didn't play real look over your mom and the crowd and you say it looks like living out of our car was worth it [noise] and you told the story before you were Fifteen you and your mom ... six Seventy five bucks in the backyard of there and\nYeah you know what's funny is that I looked up and I said mom wherever you are up there and people thought my mom was dead\nAh yeah I understand but it just we I couldn't get an extra ticket sitting next to me is my mom was way up in the nose bleed seats [noise] um but my mom is such a powerhouse she took her shoes off just in case I one so that she could run down\n[laughter] run down yeah rundown and re ... below me yeah so she took her shoes off and the woman next it was like when you're doing that's my daughter she lives alone even she could win and she wins I have to get down there\nI Can't believe you have the clarity of mind to think that way at all I can only imagine you can't believe it's happening you get up on stage and all of a sudden you have to give a coach and speech that will be analyzed walk to go and try and when you're ...\nYeah well I I don't know if I was I think it was so young I wasn't even thinking about that but I was feeling the responsibility of saying something that um\nWas um\nThoughtful of this person's life do still reflect on that you still reflecting whether it was worth of whether what was worth it\nGoing down when you were Fifteen Years old\nAt all or no I don't ever I that was all worth it and for me living out of my car was fun I was Fifteen Years old it wasn't harrowing at all it was from my mom and you know but for me I was living my dream and and er about trying to pursue my dream so it was exciting\nI can tell you still love acting I can still I Love it I can still do you do sometimes fail and people come in whether they're going through the survey goes to the cycles a little bit of of putting the phone together but I still you really do love\nThis I really love it I really love it and what's interesting is taking time off to take care of my dad it was um there was there was no doubt in my mind that that's what I was going to do and I didn't know how long it was going to take and in doing that there were two things that happened one I realized that\nI'm more than just an actor because you are what you do people say oh in a specially your industry especially but I mean if you really think about if you say oh tell me about you the first thing I Will say is I'm an architect ... they say what they do yeah and I am and I'm\nSo I say oh I'm an actor you know that that's what I and that's for since I was Fifteen that's what I have been doing and\nIt's just so much of who I Am is defined within and taking time off made me realize that I'm so much more than that\nUm and there was freedom in that somehow I don't know I don't know how to say do you think that changed the way you acted well that would also happen on the flip side is it made me fall in love with acting in a whole different way because I appreciated all the opportunities that it gave me and it to\nSee the world and a different way to walk in someone else's shoes and I'm\nExpand my ideas of how I Walk in the world you know every character I play from\nBoys don't cry to ... million dollar baby to conviction to Freedom Riders these stories of these women all of them being true other than a million dollar baby\nAnd I made a lot of music found them better than it would have otherwise [noise] and uh and and this is trying to find it to do that I've changed this industry and\nAnd that was anti held a brand new to the cue origin story of the audio prophecy tool he created\nCalled auto tune I Love what he said I just built the car I don't drive at the wrong way down the road\nYou're probably frustrate auto tune when it was using shares being hit believe exactly Twenty years ago
