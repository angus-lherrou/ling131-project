I was still around and you're listening to you and you're listening to you and you're listening to Q. Tom power you might know rubber\nEver it from that movie with Julia Roberts my best friend's wedding or he was also in Shakespeare in love and inspector gadget but as long as he's been acting as long as you've been conscious really been an obsessive fan of the legendary writer Oscar Wilde and now Rupert gets to play your idol you'll hear more about that\nBut he's a raise an actor and writer you might know from the HBO show insecure she's in a new movie called the have you give as she knows what it's like the feud with the first lady of the United states she talked about the whole that's going to take on your boss live music from the pride and joy uh Vancouver British Columbia dam and getting all that\nComing up on cue\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm neuron the death toll from hurricane Michael is rising nearly a week after the storm NPR's Debbie Elliott reports Florida officials say at least sixteen people were killed in that state alone\nI think the thing that I learned about myself or making the movie and in the years it took two political together\nWas a I think I had much more tenacity denied ever given myself credit for and I'm having made the film I thought my God if I didn't know that I had this kind of mountain goats a kind of a\nOut before maybe I'd uh I'd go further in the world of I think I think you've done All right [laughter] you know\nThinking about to go out and getting ready for this interview ... has also just made me think about\nHow we value art now I mean you mentioned the picture Dorian Gray which I think is probably the best shot we have ... as sort of a unanimous universal work of Oscar Wilde it's one of those work that you know I think you know you know the story of the painting even if you don't do the detail yeah even if you know eat\nOr if you don't know the author ... hated when it was when it was first published even though now it's considered a classic and I guess it's made me think about the art that we devalue now and how we're going to feel about it in the future well\nWhat's so interesting about the world is uh what what grows culturally off there's been done and what a diminishes you know some things that we think you're absolutely amazing at the time I mean nothing a hundred years later and I'm a particularly for example in the in the time of wild or there was sitting on the other\nPlay rights and rights as who would just as popular as he was and we don't know about any of them now and I think I think there'll be a lot of things like that I'm coming from today because actually this is an era kind of of um trash you think of him in many respects yes I ...\nI think are some of the commercial ... ah for example if you look at the results of the nineties and uh the turn of the century uh I Wonder how how that will India a in a hundred years ah I'm I Wonder\nHow are you know I'm On mainstream Hollywood within do in a hundred years\nI guess ... will we ... we we still be able to sing some of\nYeah which which which songs we thing now will still be thinking around campfires you know in the right when the apocalypse states we have no we haven't insurance they might give\nA ... [laughter] I think that maybe we've got to do All right [laughter] it's I guess there's it\nMakes you wonder how many Oscar Wilde they're walking among us right now perhaps you know a hundred years from now we will be still talking about them\nAnd you know business for example or you know in the movie business with the TV business is so much probe the product going towards the people who have to choose it on choose what to make that you look at them and you realize half way through conversation that you might be setting himself on fire and they wouldn't really notice\nAnd I think that's because uh you know there's there's so much\nFor so much too much going on there's a I think our brains are over I'm excited and\nIt just ... I'm speaking with Rupert ever it he's in a new film about Oscar Wilde a particular chapter of Oscar wildlife it's called the happy prince and as you may have gleaned if you're just joining us is a robot is a very big fan of Oscar Wao he made a very meaningful figure in his life\nAnd which makes sense because he wrote and directed and stars in this film and a river it's it's interesting to talk to you about this because I feel like\nYou've embodied so much of wild work in the past I mean you were in on screen adaptations of an ideal husband in the importance of being Ernest however in this case you play wild himself so can you compare and contrast playing wild himself versus playing one of his characters\nI think a lot of his character's lead to him um the the characters I played a will load Henry was born in the ...\nAnd then in his character or we see the whole shop edgy or I'm slightly decadent side of wild um and then um I played also ah in\nThe ideal husband or another character who is also quite edgy um but then ends up having a kind of heart of gold and that sort of leads one too wild too and then of course both algae and Jack and the importance of being Ernest I'm give us a real\nInsight into how all those famous conversations that we hear was so exciting at the cafe royal or in the in the end of the nineteenth century ... how they were [noise] um\nSo um I think for me playing wild it was very very useful to have done is plays a and writing trying to write wild to recreate I'm my own while in dialogue I think that was very useful to\nOn the other hand I think uh when when he hits my film he's considerably changed really he's been to prison he's come out of prison he pauses briefly through a kind of faces a born again Christian\nAnd then get bored of that and then a runs back to load out for Douglas and really with this act destroys whatever Chauncey has of ever rehabilitate himself\nTo tell us a little bit more about we're after a while thought finds himself in a in your family because I've for people who aren't necessarily definitely with a story well\nAh I guess with people who want that familiar with this story they should know that it's wild went to prison or for grossing decency which was for being a homosexual basically a he had two years and with hard labor\nAnd the day he came out of prison he left a England forever to live in France and um he arrived in France with every single good intention and ah also this kind of Christian fervor\nOr that are quite soon but in time to actually an only been out there would be because as soon as you go to France he found English people everywhere and these English people since you've been so famous or recognized in which is quite a thought because it's not recognizing through TV or photographs is recognizing\nFrom ... in theater programs and things like that and but he was recognized and the English uh thought it was within the ... to either have been removed from restaurants to spit on him or given chase him run towns for fun\nAnd uh he realized pretty quickly that uh liberty was actually going to be another kind of a torture and other kinds of prison\nIn in the film and and so much of what we talked about today is Oscar Wilde struggling with his own celebrity as you mentioned he goes he goes to France but he can't escape his own fame\nHe bullied a lot publicly for his own fame and and you start to wonder if you've watched the film whether\nHe crossing that line between fame in infamy and you have an interesting perspective as opposed to an Oscar Wilde biographer and then you had your own brushes are in life with fame and celebrity did get making this film and learning about Oscar Wilde make you reflect in that relationship\nWith my relationship with fame [laughter] yeah no not really a um I I think are making the film but Oscar Wilde um\nMade me a just think really of my position or more than the thing is is attempting to uh to uh be in this business or as a as a as a homosexual man ready or I think uh the inspiration I find from him is a is how\nHow complex it is a well suddenly historically to to work in a world as rigidly heterosexual as a cinema for example uh and and be gay I'm so that is is the power line mostly found with me and Oscar Wilde\nDid do you think do you think that's changed for actors today I mean you you you've talked in in a number of interviews about helping openly gay limited your opportunities and highly but did you see a change today\n[noise] um I think there is a change I think um I think that that I mean everything's up for grabs now this is very exciting time um and definitely changes happening and er and er it hopefully things will go on moving um\nPersonally I think uh you know I'm gay I just need to be able to play straight pilots I don't understand why all the streets actors can go and play gay pots and everyone just to see you know how to do but somehow the mindset of the powers that be this doesn't work or\nIn the other direction or they always blame the audiences who the audience wouldn't accept it but um\nI think this is not true is to do with the mindset in in what remains of the boys club of um the people in power in the executive branch and that has to that is a thing that still I feel needs to launch the\nChange I'm sure this is something you've experienced yourself\nAbsolutely it does it make you reflect on that I mean it ... when I tell people I was interviewing you today I was a kind of talked about Oscar Wilde and and people still ... referred to my best friend's wedding with him to a lot of the road and you had in the in the nineties ... reflecting that time now do you like thinking back to that time\nBut it was a very exciting time uh and I'm\nA number ... time for me it was like it was one of those kind of dream come true type of times in one sense of ... that I could catapult myself into such a\nA successful place for my best friend's wedding and uh that film went so I'm incredibly well for me but in one sense or a\nOr the you can only go so far I'm playing the gay best friend I mean you have to kind of be able to come up with something else along the line otherwise ah the audiences will get bored\nI don't mean to be rooting for the absurd questions sometimes you know well what an any human question for the way people actually working we're not caricatures yeah it's just you know\nThe other people care though and I was having this conversation yesterday we need allies so much and you need like five people talking about this all the time yeah like we know what it is you're in a sense when you're speaking out to other black people it's like you're ... preaching to the choir and when you\nNeed help is you need unfortunately white people to care you need white people to tell their friends you need\nYou know people who aren't related to police officers you know people respect police officers winter sand that they keep us safe but there is a serious problem there is a fear and hatred and a disdain for black people in this country and\nWe want to feel protected\nBut there's an issue and so we need these conversations to be happening and hopefully this film will prompt those conversations and those conversations will lead to action\nIf you're just tuning in speaking with the survey one of the stars of the upcoming film to hate you give she's also distorted creator of the Peabody Award winning HBO series and secure I'll see it again hey Peabody Award winning HBO series insecure comedy to follow the trial and tribulations of two best friends in LA currently in its third season ...\nThank you I haven't heard that Peabody Award winning series and then I'm not saying that's that's amazing\n... how do you find that out is the phone calls that I\n[laughter] I thought it out on the Internet the morning and I wasn't sure because it wasn't clear you found like I found out that yeah\nAnd I talked to the writers like hey I I saw it on the website but I'm not sure did we went in and there were like yeah we definitely one this and so then we like a couple of weeks later I got to go to the awards ceremony how um and it was a great wars have money because you know you went All right\nYou're right there's no there's there's no camera waiting for all kinds of it's beyond as we're watching the words were always kind of Washington not going to win\n... seats back pocket I Love when they get angry too yes I got another beer for an award show when someone got angry and I was like\nLiving and I had just lost I was like I get you [laughter] I\nAs as a matter of her I wasn't a matter of fact I was like ah I get you\nOf your character Easter and your own name he's a how often people get confused every single day of my life people calling after years of your character\nAll the time right was that a good thing though no reasonable thing but it's a good thing for the show\nHow do you tell me [noise] I keep thinking about the fact that\nI have to do another project because now even in rap\nLyrics I've always wanted to be like I always wanted to have a sat out in rap alert right like for me being a young girl and I'm like my last name ray it rhymes with so many things but now I realize when I'm brought up it's like you will secure like Easter right and it's like oh no\nSo so many of my friends or talk about how he said in in an insecure is that it's a depiction of the black female experience but she's never seen on television the friend of mine said that to me the other day or how does it feel when you hear that people come talk to you about that particular people who actually enjoy the show not our critics\nThat's amazing yeah anytime somebody comes up to you and it's like oh I relate to this story like um\nI I just fell on her name you know and and creating this it was because I didn't\nSee you know this type of depiction of a black woman and I didn't go out to like create the black female experience at all by any means and so there was a pressure anytime you do a black show when there's not\nA huge representation on the spectrum then get the pressure of like this has to be the end of the experience of black women and I always made it clear like this is a very specific experience\nWell that that's the reason I ask whether that was that's OK to people come up and talk to you like this was because I also know like in interviews you've talked about how sometimes you have to face questions like what is the underlying political message of of insecure or you know what to say about black culture in two thousand Eighteen and you said I mean rightly so\nThese are not questions that white filmmakers that way TV creators have to you know no one's asking about the larger perspective on corporate enthusiasm nope\nAnd so that yeah there there is an unfair burden of just like you are\nBecause you're black you have to tackle these issues and for me is it a burden it's just an annoyance yeah you know and\nI think that's also why this was like I don't want\nHave to constantly um have discussions about\nHow this is changing the world if at all and I'm like I just wanted to tell a good story at the number that features the black people that I Know in my life and is that enough\nBut it's funny the change in the world what's going on now with Bill Maloney trumping and secure what had\nNothing literally not to have and why and I didn't interview where I spoke about how much I Love the fact\nI'm a former president Barack Obama and his wife first\nLady Michelle loved insecure and I got to talk to them separately about that and\nThat feeling of being able to be\nTo have the White House and ... and feel like they have your back to have your best interests are and they mess with you so hard and I was like you know I'll never had that feeling\nWith ... like and I jokingly said if money why should I mean I guess we have to cancel it because I interest on the line and I just know that there is that the White House does not have my best interests at heart right when so many of my best interests at heart\nAnd so then you know click bait cultures that is the right things to cancel insecure if money actually and then her spokes person was like well she watches it\nAnd so I was like does mum on your watch her body devil and that's not\nMega maggots them I mentioned\nYeah you're staying on the Internet for no no I mean for eating grapes which I get oh for sure I took a four week break over the summer the best thing I ever did that\nThing in life and want to live on um I'm On a but then I Can't wait for it to be ...\nSo you mean you make this show starting as a as a Web series then it becomes you know then insecure happens but you're just creating things again you're just trying to tell stories about you and your friends about the about your life about the life of people you know\nBut now it's being talked about by like the president and now it's being talked about by the by the first like how do you navigate that\nUm are they just didn't like that school\nAnd keeping it fresh and you know you live in a moment and when it's brought up again then I get to relate it but\n[laughter]\nUm but it's just it's just that it's cold I'm grateful\nI hear you I guess you're saying it's just like you know like that's a crazy situation find yourself it is and it\nWon't happen again I Hope in my lifetime I don't think\nYou're right maybe maybe so are you made a point of saying that you have you said we we have a different audiences that's not form of life that's not for for Donald Trump and there's also been just click bait culture where you know you see a lot of ... says insecure isn't for white people and and is in permanent obviously the doesn't mean that white folks and men can't watch the show actually that that's not the points\nBut what inspired that message to begin with a demand for any weird moments HBO executives or anything like that no no like\nActually executives just set out to them I Can't give them enough credit they just give me space to create and they never you know I made it very clear like this is my audience\nIn whenever I'm writing I'm always thinking about my friends and my family like can they well they laugh when they get it will they mess with it\nAnd I never want it to feel like I had over explain certain things about you know\nThe culture and HBO never there are things I'm not going to get ... and that's why it's like you mentioned her like and I say this other time there's so many like jokes about being Jewish and encourage 'em and you know get is phrases that out and Patrick Google and has not for me\nWe had a poet ... Ali barriers and he didn't translate some of the Spanish parts of his poems and he said well you know how many times do I have to look up to Johnny Depp is\nHello [laughter]\nI Know many I mean John Wayne [laughter] nothing like that\nYou know but I mean that's that's accurate and so you just keep pushing and there's just certain elements that you know that people will relate to and if you don't get it you don't get it you can listen\nAnd that's what I meant I never said don't you dare watch this laypeople and men like that's just I was just like oh I wasn't thinking about that audience when I wrote this and they're watching and relating and that's great\nTo think about the he gave his anti Thomas's said she wasn't seeing stories being told that reflected her and her friends she made herself first and then she shopping around she made it herself and their way to put people to come to it and I and I bet you can see a parallel there\nA hundred percent I feel like that's the model I think that's a model for so many black people for so many people have called the creators like I've seen that that's kind of been the trend for getting people to notice you is like\nFor salon Hollywood has been like this isn't this isn't going to be marketable this isn't going to have an audience and because of the Internet because of social media because the sort of this stuff is way we've been able to prove them wrong time and time again and so now they're like clamoring for content from us\nAnd you're there to give it to him even though you may not use her real name next time I may not he's not really nice to meet you\nNice to meet you too thank you for having me\nThese arrays the co creator and star of insecure where she stars as an ether which just wrapped up its third season on HBO you can catcher in the heat and you gave which thing in some theaters now it's going to open everywhere else on friday\nAnd I should say if you want to see the video of that conversation you can see it on her YouTube page YouTube dot com slash rescue\nComing up next on cute one of the finest singer and songwriter to right now Dan Macon right after\n\n... ... sometimes it seems\nLike the news cycle is one big runaway train headed way too fast to destination unknown I'm Mary Louise Kelly that all things considered we plan to our daily voyage carefully and take the time to see the important things along the way don't worry we'll still get you where you need to go all things considered from NPR News", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "17"}
