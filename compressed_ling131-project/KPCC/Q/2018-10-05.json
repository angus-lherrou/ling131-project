{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "That they've been driven into hiding because of their as they put it inexplicable battle with Facebook to try to get this kind of material taken down so that they don't have to deal with trolls and people who are you know discovering their address and then and then threatening them\nOnline and finally I'm this summer apple took down infowars as\nA podcast and then very soon thereafter a Facebook and other companies followed suit and I talked to him or talk about it I said why did you wait this\nWhy did you wait so long why did you wait so long to take down this thing that people had so clearly complained about and he said well which we don't want to punish people who are just wrong we don't want to ban them from Facebook what we're trying to do is figure out how to shape this thing and\nHe acknowledged in effect that because apple had moved on this that he said you know at that point we realized we had to make a decision we had to get we had to get rid of this and and so we did it\nBut from my perspective what was interesting about this was that this is the very beginning of an issue for face but this is not the end I mean this is just the front edge of an unbelievably complex problem which is what are the bounds of of free speech what do we actually want to be able to have\nAnd what do we consider to be out of bounds what is in effect shouting fire in a crowded theater and what is legitimate provocative unsavory speech and and these are some of the hardest problems that we face and they're now in the hands of\nLet's face it there in the hands of the engineers that people who created this incredibly powerful a application\nYou know there's lots of First Amendment law that says the government can't you know distinguish types of speech and prohibited um is it clear that a private company like Facebook can when it's this ...\nWell actually if Facebook as a private company can do whatever it wants on speech if if they decided tomorrow that you couldn't talk about golden retrievers on Facebook they could put that ruined place and I think for some reason that\nWe find ourselves really torn you even if you're not a fan of info wars and God Knows I'm not\nIt has to make a person uneasy to know that there is now a company which is capable of deciding not only what kind of information it's going to suppress but also which kind of information it's going to promote\nAnd on any given day there are people who are going to be offended by those choices um but the tools by which Facebook has held accountable or not the tools that we use in politics it's not like you vote the bums out\nIt's not like people are appointed to Facebook's board as if they were Supreme Court justices this is a case in which a private company is making profound choices about the contours and the boundaries of political expression and we don't have obvious tools with which to regulate them\nYou know when you look at the arc of the story I mean this company founded by mark ... has this astonishing growth is deeply committed to growth and in doing so [noise]\nYou know compromises privacy and and ends up you know sharing data it shouldn't about its users and gets into some trouble and a question arises about whether the company has the ability um has the capacity for self reflection whether it can take\nYou know adverse information and reexamine the assumptions and practices and in many respects this really comes down to ... ... what did you find about that [noise]\nI found that he is insulated too I think an unhealthy degree from this kind of criticism and\nIf he was sitting with me right now I Would say this directly the reality is he built the company in his own image she's had the luxury of sculpting an organization too is like I mean quite literally the the blue color that Facebook has as its signature blue\nIs chosen because he is red green colorblind and he prefers to look at the color blue you can see a very distinctly so in every way both physical and spiritual this company\nReflects his sensibilities but in order to be able to continue to grow and evolve and respond to the problems that it encountered\nHe needs people sitting in the room with him who will tell him mark I think you're not seeing this the right way you're not seeing this clearly you're wrong and I was struck that in our interviews I got the sense from him that he knows that on some level he's tried over the years to make these\nChoices to get outside what he described it as as as the bubble or he's got five people who report directly to him and they are all people who he has an effect chosen a and installed in those positions and there's very few there are very few people at Facebook who are willing to stick their neck out and say I fundamentally disagree we need to do things differently\n[noise] you know at the end of this piece you write that some people think of Mark Zuckerberg as an atomic tongue with little regard for the human dimensions of his work and you say not exactly the truth is something else what's the truth\nThe truth is that he is at peace with what he has done with the choices that he has made I I I came to really\nUnderstand that Mark Zuckerberg in his own conception of his place in history believes that no change happens painless Lee and that change is difficult and in in many ways it's like his inspiration Augustus Caesar he he believes that he's made trade offs that he has\nIn order to grow he had to give up perfection if you wanted to be vastly influential and he couldn't always be quite as safe as people wanted him to be\nAnd in his mind and in the minds of the people around him they are vindicated by their sheer scale\nAnd success and for that reason it's very hard for them to accept that the public is howling in many cases for real change because they believe if we had given into the critics at every step along the way and made changes then we wouldn't be as big as we are today\n[noise] having us thanks so much for speaking with us thanks very much for having me to\nHave an ... as a staff writer for New Yorker his article

Senators took turns reviewing an FBI report on sexual misconduct claims against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh Virginia democratic Senator Tim Kaine calls the process of sham\nAnyway I was thinking about how I don't really miss that elements in terms of the adaptation and it's because John seems to me anyway John ... the film with his expressions and and just uh\nThe look he has in his eyes you know you can sort of really place where he's out emotionally with each scene I'm I Know he knows the book very well he could quote it to me and [laughter] actually sort of corrected me a couple of times and I would get a line wrong really during the early discussions about the film yeah you'd really studied it and so here's another reason why I just sort of felt like it was in good hands with him\nI Love the idea of Jack johnson erotic correcting the author but his own book yeah yeah a job but it's funny you mentioned John cease it must have been self in life because I Know John has also said that ... sisters talk like you do ... do you have your own voice and that performance [laughter] well\nI remember sisters brothers was a ... my first book was more of a biographical and then I I I wanted to make a break from that and I started sort of um [noise] inventing stories and and I learned that winds up happening is you put a lot of yourself\nInto the characters that you that you popular book with so a lot of ... questions and concerns and feelings and desires are mine um it's not a mirror image by any means but\nYeah there's a lot of me in there and then I think just the way that um dialogue is handled in my books generally um it's just a a a a tone that I think is reflective of the conversations that I have in my day to day life\nIt is it's scary to give up control like that because as a writer\nYou mentioned the narrator you you sort of are able to carry through the book everything that is happening and you have complete control over everything that happens on that page when you're handed over it's not just John analyses to send the ... it's the it's the editors it is scary to lose that control of your own story\nIt is scary um and there were certainly moments where I I I\nWas worried or or or I mean the first time I saw the film I couldn't really watch it when a person wants to watch a film I couldn't just sit back and and enjoy it as a as an you know piece of art there is too much going on in my mind and there was things that I was missing or things that\nYou know everything is interpreted as you say every every line\nIs a you know and and actors interpretation of the line and very rarely lines up with the way the author has it in his or her mind\nUm but you know a ... by the time I watched the film the second time which was a tiff and this was in a proper you know a proper a film hall with a you know regular audience and everything whereas before I'd seen it in a private screening room in Los Angeles\nI could give myself over to the experience much more and\nWatch it the way that you know you want to watch a film and and all these sort of concerns I found fell away and were replaced with my being impressed and moved by the story and I'm interpreting the interpretations I'm an eyewitness in the film\nIt isn't I never felt that they were wrong it was just a process of of acceptance for me um [noise] just recognizing how different the film is than than the book you know it's um\nYou're told from the start that the film was going to be different than the book and you understand that intellectually but emotionally I think it took me a minute to catch up\n... you look at the movie parts with the book quite a bit tell me more about the process of accepting that [noise] well\nUm I think the primary difference between the film and the book is just a the narration which we discussed already but also the tone I think it's much more comedic in in in the in the book and it's it's more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ... code but at the same time I don't think you bring on a big name designer like Hattie cemented and expect him to follow someone else's suit he's going to do what he does arguably somewhat say fast\nSo here's what the critics were saying I I read one quote that was a gust of toxic masculinity\nA who describes the line as entirely predictable and heinous and one from inside that said the minis which I'm guessing or the or the skirts withdraw miniskirts the minis couldn't have been shorter had they been designed by a gynecologist\nYes critics were did not mince words and we're pretty uh unanimously against this direction and I think they just felt that it was really really out of step with where\nFashion is today um I think ... really made his mark\nAt cellar on that was a different time fashion moves very quickly so what worked in twenty sixteen I mean look at the arrow renowned twenty Eighteen it's a completely different world and those kind of aesthetic and not the kind of limited view of a woman has to be in a skin tight short\nFrock in order to present herself just feels so outdated and frankly offensive to a lot of people who don't want you to conform to death a mentality that you have to be super skinny um\nSuper flashy and reveal a lot of your body in order to participate in fashion\nThis is where it gets really interesting for me critics are just saying I hate to stress this doesn't look good this is a step back for fashion their relating to massaging the inequality the hearings around the judge Brett Kavanaugh and even US President Donald Trump how are they getting there\n[noise] [noise] well I think right now in our culture we have a lot of examples of\nA patriarchy that a lot of people are very uncomfortable with and I think we're looking to redefine definitions of what is sexy and and how women want to ... portray themselves in society and when there are these male figures that are so polarizing like Trump and like Kavanaugh\nHow to use them as becoming part of that conversation as well on the fashion side obviously there's like way less severe already there and I think that's important to note ahead Eastleigh men has gone on record saying he's\nYou know very anti Trump but um I think where there might be a similarity is they're both the type of figured that really whatever they do incite the reaction and they seem to like controversy it's part of their it's part of their identity in a part of the game they like to play with the media\nSo this isn't just about the reversal of ... rather than the this is becoming about the politics of fashion right\nDefinitely fashion in politics are so intertwined these days and I think it's very hard for people participating in the industry to adjust focus purely on the effects and not tied into greater socio economic issues that we're all talking about and thinking about how they're intertwined\nSo what's going on with the B follows you said anything\n[noise] she has not she as a woman a few words and I think she really communicated herself through her designs and\nShe's sort of taking a little bit of a break right now it seems um I've always got the impression from her that she's not a slave to fashion or the industry she someone that really has a full life outside of it um so I think a lot of women know are hoping that she returned there was actually\nA kind of public morning session that were staged for her drink Paris fashion week where a bunch of her deportees gathered outside of\nA saline boutique wearing her archival designs and drinking champagne in solidarity with um with her design codes but\nWhat I think it's really interesting though is there is a bit of almost fan fiction happening on line in a narrative that I Wish I had happened where Phoebe file I Would have gone to Barbary instead of recorder to she\nAnd on how to swim and might have gone to ... now eventually and maybe a quarter to she would have gone to saline and perhaps everyone would have been a bit happier\nAs this is fascinating how the with the world a pipe fashion can relate to the conversations we're having a ... that are in her kitchen tables right now about politics mostly thanks a lot for doing this thanks so much Tom that was cute brushing contributor fashion director and vote dot com
