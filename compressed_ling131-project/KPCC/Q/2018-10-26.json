Nino who has spent more than Thirty years trying to remake it\nYou can understand why the director of such viscerally erotic romances as call me by your name and I am love would respond as a ... a fourth lush stylistic possibilities alone\nSo it's surprising that this new movie departs from the original in every way imaginable the visual palate is cold and gray water Nino has drained away the rights lurid colors and most of the shocks and crowded the story with historical detail\nAt two and a half hours this dispute ... runs a full hour longer than the original and it takes its time creeping into your veins but creep it does the movie is a hoot and the folly but it's also a marvel magnificently obsessive vision that comes to feel less like a remake than a rebirth\nIt's Nineteen Seventy seven year of the deadly German Autumn and the still divided city of Berlin is reeling from the violent acts of the radical Red Army faction also known as the butter mine off gang\nInto this chaos comes Suzie banyan a strikingly self possessed young woman from Ohio who is just joined the prestigious Helena Marcos dance company\nSuzie as played by Dakota Johnson who starred in the fifty shades of gray trilogy and his bus no stranger to subjecting herself to extreme physical exertion ...\nThe company's specializes in a form of modern dance notable for its forceful aggressive choreography which expresses an bodies the traumas of Germany's war torn past and present\nThe director Matt ... is played by Tilda Swinton an actress with natural sorcery and her veins she begins preparing Suzie for the lead role in an upcoming piece working especially on her jumps but men don't belong is also clearly grooming her for a darker purpose\nWhen you go down for you make your energy to create\n\nAnd you said how can we can dance than\nYeah\nYeah and again you have to find the right place you have to decide\nWhat do you do you want to be ... what\n...\nWas dying [noise] ... where we're going to be the company's ... were\n[noise] Hi [noise] Hi [noise]\n[noise] no spoiler to note that this dance is a form of witchcraft any doubts will be laid to rest early on by a hideously gruesome set piece in which Suzie dances a solo unaware that her body has been magically can joined to that of a dancer in another room\nAs soon as he dances the other woman is mercilessly tossed about her bones cracking as her limbs twist like a pretzel\nSuch grizzly moments aside it's almost perverse how little the spirit traffics in overt scares why don't you know in his screenwriter David ... generate plenty of unease but they seem disinclined to build suspense\nAt times the movie draws you right into the witches inner circle as if it were trying to get you on their side these which is maybe wicked luring young women into their ranks and punishing those who disappoint them but are they more evil the horrors of war\nCould the dance academy perhaps be stronghold against those horrors in all female enclave passing down it's dark arts from generation to generation in an effort to ward off an even greater darkness\nI Can't decide if this notion is brilliantly audacious or completely pretentious maybe it's brilliantly pretentious either way why don't you know commit to it entirely and with an astounding level of craft\nThe dance choreography by Damien ... outlay is mesmerizing and the music by Tom York of Radiohead strikes discordant notes of beauty and longing\nPerhaps the most shocking thing about what you know ... is how moving it becomes as you realize how deeply these women earn slave by the past and also by the powers the summoned to escape it on a lighter note one of the most significant characters is\nAn elderly psychotherapist who starts investigating the bizarre goings on at the academy after one of the students seeks his counsel he's played by an actor named looks a bird store\nThough as a New York times story recently revealed neighbors door is in fact in alias for Tilda Swinton buried under layers of old age makeup\nIt's an ingenious piece of prosthetic sorcery that makes an odd sort of sense in context outside this which is covering the only man of notes turns out to be a woman in disguise\nJustin Chang is a film critic for the LA Times\nBoom boom boom\nRussia is executive producer is Dennis Miller our interviews and reviews are produced an edited by a nice salad films Myers sim rigor ...

dealt with the same thing this depiction of Scotland specifically Edinburgh as a place you come to the haggis take a picture of someone playing bagpipes\nMaybe have a ... gift crime writing that had to change all that to show the real Scotland he grew up and\nSo we in rank will tell you what parts of stop and you don't get to know about why he thinks that led to him selling millions in books coming up on cue\nNPR News in Washington I'm shape Stevens law enforcement officials are asking the public for any tips about the ten suspicious packages sent to CNN and from that critics of President Trump\nAnd and you know read this is no longer cope he's now retired so my main task is to realistically get him involved in a police investigation although you know a member of the public and again I enjoy the challenge it keeps the series fresh\nAnd there was this true light a true story of a private detective and London ... years ago who had been investigating alleged links between senior police officers in organized crime he was phoned hacked to death with an axe in a public ... park\nAnd the story has never really gone away and I saw some intriguing start to a book and I thought well hang them and if I Move this to Edinburgh and if I have his body turning up having been missing for ten years\n... as a cult would have been involved in the original missing persons inquiries and other alive murder inquiry\nBall so they're looking into the mistakes that may have been made first time around when it was a missing persons case so that brings us into the economy inquiry filling it is it all these ... cases you're looking for no but sometimes it's just you know I've got to keep a clippings folder of things that come from newspapers and magazines and stories that people tell me the true stories things have happened to them or [noise]\nUm things from things from history from Ed in British history may be enough just to sift through whenever I'm panicking though got nothing for my next book and something always turns out\nHe got buddies on the inside you don't you well yeah\nBut most of them I'm afraid they're retired nowhere near retired so most of the cup so hang out with a no retired corps and I tend to go a little retirement parties\nBut the reason I bring this up is not because simply it's interesting and it but it definitely is but in in reading this book and I think even the one before you're not always painting incredibly rosy picture of the police and I'm Wondering if any of the people you work with mine\nAnd police Scotland the ... the senior officers might be a little bit concerned but as fiction at the end of the day I mean I Do reference in this book the thoughts of there being some big changes to open police Scotland\nSome senior officers have been given what we called gardening leaves an I either under investigation for various misdemeanors\nUm hopefully has in real life though has hopefully I'll be ... no um but yeah I Do I Do reflect on it and and the book and also the way that they know investigate murder has changed so the local see id local detectives are no longer in charge of the case I can crack unit\nOr parachute than to take over so that leads to low attentional drama between the local cops on these experts who've come in and trampled all over their territory [noise]\nShe got mail you get tension you get ... from the situations so I'm not actually enjoy the fact to all this stuff's happening and police Scotland and they don't seem to mind to reference a couple of chief constable is it going the guy in charge no but the guy before him\nWhen he took over he got a bunch of scotch primaries together for dinner so that he could he could explain to us well these changes meant and why they were going ahead really yeah yeah because he knew that we were taken a message out to the world that people knew police Scotland\n'em through the ... that made me nervous they get too close to the people you're writing yeah I I Try not to get to ... I don't want it I don't buddies and nobody in up to the police into some writers do 'em if I've got specific question or a query this somebody I can go and ask\nBut I'm not hanging out with 'em all day to find out what they're up to the body than the other side and so much again they're all dead they're all over the gangsters of Dinah the old fashioned gangsters like counter to the guy who runs Edinburgh pretty much gone the\nYounger ones are doing computer crime right on corporate crime um cybercrime um they're they're not doing protection rackets the way they used to the ... going to bars and saying we'll set fire to your bar if you don't give us a hundred times a week or whatever so crime is changing and the people involved in our changing but it never goes away\nIn crime fiction is oh predicated on a very simple question why do we human beings keep doing terrible things specifically to each other have you got an answer you know what I've been investigating up for Thirty years and I don't know how much needed ... to find that an answer to a few years ago did a TV series\nDocumentary cities and evil and I go I spent months so that we went around the world I was exercise by the chief ex assist the diocese of room I went to death row in Texas and it'd be the guy who was on death row I spoke to cope through the rest of the serial killers or all of the psychiatrists about white people do these things [noise]\nBut ended up process I wasn't much closer to ... to pointing to ... evil um bucket point an action that somebody had carried out and say that was an octave evil point at which you did it\nUm the reverse is different from me he's more of an Old Testament guy he sees the world and in absolutes in black and white good and evil\nOnce you've done something wrong that sick you're ah you're you're you're never going to be allowed to be redeemed who does the younger cups like shoveling Clark and my books have they have to trust my point of view which is a bit more liberal and we say a than ... so I've always got to make sure it's his voice in his eyes looking through the world yeah\nYou got some deep fans here actually reached out to one of them if the if the mother of one of our producers and the shows a deep and read all the books and we will normally do this but we got her to write you a question oh well going a lot of your work describes the side of and bread that is dark depressing and corrupt\nDoes that come from the sort of ... on where you're writing or do you see it as a realistic depiction of the life in politics that Brett\nI'm good question and I think it's probably a ... both when I started writing these books I start to rise above Edinburgh to try and make sense of the city and the darker side too in real life it was a darker side of the crime that was ...\nThere were social problems um but also historically the history of of literature in Edinburgh or and also the history of the the city is every city it's quite dark\n... eyes of cannibalism take we'd go out and I'm Jacqueline hide written by a a an admiral author Robert Louis Stevenson partly based on a ...

I don't I don't know who's going to end it is\nYeah there was a there was a a read this novel a few years ago called I'm hanging garden which is some by the cure I'm a high end garden and the first draft was finished and I still didn't know who did it I just said he'd been in the tax LA say ... to myself going to fix this late\n[laughter] like if you will like CSI to photos in the yeah the wire and\nYou know I mean when I started the project of go blank wall or in front of me and as the as the ... the first draft goes along them out more and more posted notes more and more noticed it out well how people make connect ... you know people that might have been a time when the crime happened you know and eventually go okay ... rationally was you and this is why\nBut you know some writers would not be able to do that they would want to know before they start the where it's going to go\nI don't I mean I get bored if I knew what was going to go to his readers ever surprise you yeah I mean all of us want to keep ... keep writing about him to find that more above them to get to the code of what makes them tick and\nYou know as he changes his he gets older I'm his philosophy of life changes a little bit uh yeah he does surprise me I mean I surprised ... a girlfriend you know a girlfriend you know one of those for a while not surprise me he's got a dog hates dogs\nBut previous book was code even dogs in the wilderness ... dog in this book and it was a stray dog and he takes a home and he's trying to give it to somebody's begging people would take this dog with his hands with nobody will\nSo that in this book I started writing and thought oh I forgot he's got a dog can go to the dog and again so that surprises me let me a bit of magic that is have you know what I mean writers have just kids who refused to grow up\nThat's what it was what we are we say we're still going to play with her imaginary friends we're still going to play with her toys are going to have this extraordinary interior creative life all kids have and at some point the other world says you can't do that anymore\nIt's happening is those are so many like songs that are touching on that\nHow did you end up being in the roots anyway\n[noise] um I left\nMy school every day and I wouldn't cut class and you know go go to the city in Philly and I'm versus I was you know in the suburbs I was in ninth grade was just starting and I you know I met this dude Richard Nichols who's aspiring music manager and um\nHe kind of took me under his wing\nAnd he's like one day he was just like there's this group there weren't called the roots and it was called the square roots mhm and you know they were just getting started and they were developing their bad as they needed a keyboard player\nSo I came in and I you know I went to this ... this I'm skewing the audition and I brought with me my friend or roads which at the time nobody wanted offender roads you couldn't give them away mhm now they're like very expensive again they have like this vintage thing to him\nBut I should say listen to this ... is a type of the type of electric piano ... a board you hear a lot of music in Nineteen Seventy lately and sixties yeah\nYeah it's amazing selling warm instrument and I had one because it was the only keyboard I could find for two hundred dollars\nTo get federal ... yeah\nAnd you could not do that anymore yeah I mean that's I mean they were given world which is the way it was amazing and I you know I had one and it just was like this perfect fit where everybody else had a a you know DX seven or whatever you know chord keyboard was I had this thing and\nThey loved it and the the sound of it and it just stick with this would evolved into being this incredible jazz trio\nA hip hop jazz trio hub motor Nelson Hubbard myself requests love Mary nucleus of all the music that was that there was no seventies ... piece band like on the TV with the roots it was just a fan of we made we made it sound\nDid you ever you made really amazing music what what made you step away\nUm I just I wanted to explore more music and I wanted to spend my time in the studio being creator and not being on the road and all that stuff and\nI was just so many times\nI heard people sit referring to me has the white guy who plays ... and the roots and and I just was like it had nothing to do with the the white part but it was just it could have been just the guy who's playing ... and the roots like I didn't want to be remembered as the guy who played ...
