{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Some of these columns have just been collected in a book called if you ask me and our book critic Maureen car again has a review\nAs an advice columnist Eleanor Roosevelt was not especially witty nor psychologically acute unlike many of today's inspirational life coaches Eleanor didn't invite her readers to accompany her on extended journeys of introspection\nIndeed when a questionnaire wrote to her in Nineteen forty four asking what did the president said to you when he proposed Eleanor firmly drew the curtains over that intimate subject by replying there are some things in life which one should be allowed to keep to oneself\nBut one of the things Eleanor did have going for her as a counselor and dispenser of practical wisdom was the fact that she was so real\nShe clearly was not performing nor winking at her readers and she certainly wasn't checking in with the PR team before weighing in on questions ranging from the death penalty anti\nBirth control pro and how soon a widow might begin dating again after the loss of a beloved husband\nHeavens above Eleanor explained in a column in Nineteen forty six you can decently be seen with other men whenever you feel like going out again this is your life\nOnce upon a time in America ordinary people turn to Eleanor Roosevelt for advice\nAnd does these columns that test she repaid their trust with responses that are downright startling to read today because of how seriously she took even their most mundane problems\nEleanor is advice column was called if you ask me and it ran first in the ladies' home journal and then we'll calls magazine from Nineteen forty one when of course she was still first lady to her death in Nineteen sixty two\nA selection of those columns has just been published in a book also called if you ask me edited by Eleanor Roosevelt scholar Mary Jo banker\nAs with anything Eleanor you have to wonder where she found the time to be a regular magazine columnist in addition to among other things writing her syndicated newspaper column called my day\nHolding weekly White House press conferences traveling around the country on behalf of new deal programs and answering some estimated one hundred and thirty thousand letters a year as first lady\nThe America that emerges through this Twenty years sampling of Eleanor is advice column is it once familiar and very long gone\nWe're still wrestling of course with arguments over civil liberties national health care the electoral college and institutionalized racism and sexism\nEleanor ... gamely weighed in on those hot button topics but then there are a whole slew of other letters here that come out of an America so earnest it almost seems like the product of a work of speculative fiction\nImagine being a young woman in Nineteen forty nine and feeling that it was okay to write to Eleanor Roosevelt to ask do girls who refused to neck ever get married\nOr the Nineteen year old boy in Nineteen forty six who's already a veteran of World War two who asked Eleanor if he's too young to marry his sweetheart\nEleanor uncharacteristically waffle on that one\nAlthough she was by nature and upbringing emotionally reticent Eleanor sometimes responded to the genuine need of her questioners with an openness that was rare than and almost unimaginable now\nIn Nineteen fifty four Eleanor received this letter that reads my sister eats her heart out about mistake she made bringing up her oldest boy\nShe thinks you are in great woman Mrs Roosevelt and I wish you could tell her a few mistakes you think you made when your children were growing up\nEleanor wrote along response that in part contain these raw admissions I gave in and allowed one of my sons to be sent to boarding school I did not have the courage to fight the family tradition it was a serious mistake on my part\nI did too little for my three older children personally when they were babies\nAs trivial a cultural artifact as an advice column may seem to be Eleanor is if you ask me columns reveal multitudes about the extraordinary relationship she forged with her fellow Americans of all races young and old\nThere's something very democratic about this twenty plus year monthly conversation of sorts that Eleanor conducted on the pages of popular women's magazines people felt they had a right to contact Eleanor and she felt she had a responsibility to respond\nAnd all those seriousness was her hallmark as an advice columnist I also get the feeling that writing these columns and consequently being more connected to the lives of everyday Americans gave Eleanor great joy\nMarine Corps again teaches literature at Georgetown University she reviewed if you ask me essential advice from Eleanor Roosevelt edited by Mary Jo Baker tomorrow in fresh air will examine facts that dispel the myth of Donald Trump as a self made man\nAnd my guess will be New York times you ... and\nDavid Barstow who's investigative reporting based on a trove of documents reveal how Trump received the equivalent today a four hundred Thirteen million dollars from his father's real

asking turkey for audio and video relating to a missing Saudi journalist Trump confirmed it during a brief Q A name with reporters\nVery personal to me you know it felt like something that I was just ... it was like a conversation that I was having with myself which at the time I was having a lot of conversations with just myself you know and so I'm kind of my like\nComing to terms with myself and coming out to myself and all that is very closely tied to to music yes I I Would love to be that full for someone\nI think I think you're right I Want to listen to music right now this is an older song from blue neighborhood your last record this was called heaven [noise]\nFrom a blue neighborhood that's I'm having a trace of him or if I'm losing a piece of me maybe I don't want to have enough to that is if you listen back to that song too by the way\nI'm now when I when I hear that some it's much more about um you know I almost like performing as a form of like story telling about something that feels very in the past now for\nMe you know because he grew up Jewish in in Perth right and it's sort of a traditional Jewish family in prison\nAre completely um even though I was never really a very religious person I grew up in a in a kind of just traditional Jewish community in past\nI went to a Jewish school so that was something that I I grappled with for like a second before I kind of I just don't really proud and they'll say fine you know I I don't believe in God anymore kind of thing [laughter] um I was probably going to arrive at that point anyway there where you are now still yeah I think so yeah I\nI Love being Jewish and I feel very very Jewish every Friday night growing up I had a button and with my family and um my parents did well my dad did that which is ... with his family and my mom can vetted 'em and their parents did that and their parents did that and you know we'd like\nEscaped the Holocaust and and all this stuff I I really appreciate um where I've come from but at the time it was it was a bit of stress and then I also talk about like really wanting to have a family one day that something that's extremely important to me and\nThat was something that I remember I was very very heartbroken about for a little while when it was when I was a kid 'cause I was like I don't know how\nHow I'm ever going to be able to do that you know um I still don't know how I'm going to do it but at least now I've come to terms with the fact that I still can do that ...\nThere's there's you know a million options of how you know kind of do that so um but at the time it felt really scary and\nYeah I was kinda just tackling all of that stuff and and\nIt's sort of the moment where you realize like\nOh this is like my reality you know ... growing up I Would meet a gay person in the back of my head I'm like oh my God the gate gate to gate gate you it's like all I could think about and I think that's probably because I in the back of my mind you that I was too but still it it's a weird way you like\nThat's that's my truth you know that's like my life now for the rest of my life and that's my journey I'm going to have to come out and I'm going to have to like\nAdopt kids all or whatever you know it's just like a shift in the way that you think about yourself\nHow yeah how are you finding people coming up to you in and sharing their own experiences like you're ... you're being very generous by the way in talking to me about these very personal things in your life yeah how do you do with that\nI mean I Love it passionately you know I think um yeah sometimes you know somebody will will come up and they're like\nA team you know even younger than I was when I came out and you can kinda see if she can tell the entire story just by like what's going on in their face you can just feel just like white on on the kids chest\nAnd they come up in like hug you and they're all sweaty from having a really good time at a show where my biggest biggest hope is that they've seen people that are coming from all different walks of life you know identifying all different kinds of ways just relaxing and having a good time\nIt's very very special but ... but are there are moments now with your fans of course but I I was there ever a moment just for people like me or the pressure the attention given around as you're still you're twenty three years old yeah I mean it's still a lot left to figure out totally you know you're still on it you're still on a journey you know are there moments where you have to\nSlow down I you know I'm I'm Still figuring this out myself I'm Still struggling with things myself you know\nCompletely yeah you know I think like I I really just take comfort in the fact that I Am on a journey and I I talk about that all the time almost to like remind people you know that like nobody is kind of fully\nSelf ... like I I really like reminding people that because that takes a little bit of the pressure off me you know what I mean\nWe just didn't get him to speak in Detroit event of a terms listen to some more music this was the title track from your new album bloom take kitchen\nSince I'm a God and I've got so much to show that found them know why it is up to a game and it's true\nThey\nThey\nGas in the in the end boy made you write them on the coast of his his true\n\nThat is true with them bloom I'm Tom ... thank you I Love that song by the way thank you so so much saying I I didn't I wasn't in this morning I listen to that's only like two in the morning last night so yeah it's it's it's a beautiful song and it's just a very passionate debate on the Internet about the meaning of that you do in right at right\nWhat's the debate well you know I guess before the before the meaning of the song came out oh yeah yeah um yeah I have\nEver on sort of figured it out and that's absolutely fine by me but are there are ... the thing is that what the signs of songs\nAbout some sex the songs about your first time being intimate with this this person you are you aware that there are people who would listen to that time when it comes on the radio and kind of stop to it it might miss some of the nuances of it yes that was the goal that's like the funny part to me you know I heard that\nLike the whole song is kind of tongue in cheek and honestly it was me and my best friend writing it and\nWe were having a laugh like it was I didn't ever think that the sun was going to come out I think it said I think it's sort of full know me too tightly a hundred percent you know I like I I think that um\nFor every line that's kind of like a little bit cheeky there's ... it's also extremely extremely like real and and I think romantic actually and sweet you know so I really I Love the song so much but ... is an element of like like it's a little bit tongue in cheek and there's like a wing with every couple of lines you know\nAnd and the awareness that people are are going\nTo be ... it sounds like a Katy Perry song let something like that and that somebody is just going to like somebody who may be as I call them a phobic one day is going to be like I Love the song\nYou know what I mean like that's really funny to me so um yeah you know pop pop music is sometimes can be seen as really conservative genre of music you know it it can seem to be\nI'm based in lyrics better to have changed since the eighties and in the nineties ... I'm a scene as it on our music that's often less afraid to take risks and sometimes that's afraid to be provocative but here you are I mean you're climbing the charts with the songs that erotic around apologetic but what does that say to you about pops ability to talk about things like that right now it's interesting hearing you\nTalk about that um you know I was talking about papas kind of like a more conservative genre on\nBecause I don't really see it that way unless I maybe I'm just like I'm no please I mean ... ... to me is actually like kind of a I don't know how to describe it but it's like a sonic genre not necessarily like a ... what's popular on the radio and I'm you know what I mean 'cause I guess like icy papas like on\nA specific kind of sound almost and I'm overwhelmed and within that you know you've got like the child the X axis and you've got ... and you've got I'm Robin and then you've got lately Alan and there's like a bunch of people who um who keeps things interesting for me\nI had to actually speaking to try to actually ... the kind of break my heart a little bit you knew\nYour new video life because it was you being missed algae for the first time I'm In my early thirties yea you there that that it's been nine years old in Nineteen Ninety nine writer you entirely extracting the Titanic you know and then you're you're kind of being ... for an Arab music they run around four and I went\nI was around for that right I was I was around I was just fall I was four years old but it but it leads me to my next question said this I Want to take a listen businesses dance to this very underground dare go\nOn a cruise\nShip [noise]\n\nA song that his family that started Venona area on the ground\nI Love that song so much by the way thank you I I'm ... and the key to you with the right now so the connection I'm going to make between Nineteen Ninety nine in that song is\nWho no idea max Martin right well\nIf you're listening to the max Martin is the guy who wrote hit me baby one more time for Britney Spears he wrote everybody back streets back for it back to your boys I'm just trying to think of the most obvious one last forward to him writing I mean like I give you my face with the weekend actually I'm a ... and ... were never ever ever getting back together um you worked with those sort of Swedish pop\nWe'll see yeah so then max I'm started up I guess it's like a a publishing company and he has signed a bunch of writers in Sweden and a bunch of right is in LA and for me as a fan of pop that's like the holy grail of like that's where you go if you want to make those songs\nA ... at least ... I feel like we're in that clip we just heard it was mainly mainly all men like I feel like we hardly see women's but\nI Do know there are women admonishing man that didn't you did ... everybody fun uh yeah that\nWhen you're talking about their culture you don't often or bring up women are having fun\nAh with women unless they're passed up beside you in lots of other movies I'm interesting when I was thinking about that the first instance in a in a big movie where we see women smoking marijuana was actually a nine to find anyone remembers it like Tom and Dolly Parton and Jane Fonda\nAll sat around kind of getting together to figure out what they're going to do at work and that was like they they say the first instance of seeing women\nEnjoying themselves smoking marijuana and I think we just went into like sad wind women then ... right yeah well look at us worlds that drinking wine so yeah I'd rather be in a particularly great place for women with marijuana Ella mean you think that the stoner\nWas dated long before today yeah I mean like look stoner comedy is so out to me because when you watch the movies that have been made in the last I don't know decade or so it's like these movies about people getting nothing done produced by people who are high as hell mhm I'm an obviously producing incredible\nWe have fifty people and ten cast I'm so when I watched Seth Rogen movie when I watch the games Frank I'm movie I'm like oh you're trying to make fun of stoner culture but your high right now making this because the the secrets always been that students can accomplish a lot\nSo at least another weed is legal in Canada I Do think we're going to see changes to the stone or character in immediate oh I Hope they just disappear completely it's a very ... character I mean I guess it's sort of what is it like a court jester\nKind of you know the guy sitting around all day on smoking up and you go to get some wisdom from him occasionally that's and that's really being kind I don't\nKnow I I'm kind of hoping we could go back to sort of I Know reefer madness has made fun of but everyone was in such a nice suit steer member\nSo I'm kind of really looking for a good wardrobe change a maybe a couple of hair cuts that the women part admonishing there again I yeah I mean if we're going to like still have you know hot and movies I just hope it just becomes something\nLike you know stopping off at seven eleven for a slurp me just a very dull ordinary part of life\nBut John I Know you've come on the show before and talk a little bit about wheat advertising and how you've seen changes in we'd advertising like are we seeing in our popular culture at different perspective on this donor on this one of the week smoker\nWell I think that the sort of caricatured a tie dye T shirt dreadlocks devils fixing that sort of started character is certainly not something that's being targeted by we'd marketing I mean the thing with we'd marketing is a cannabis act says that you cannot actually advertise the product or any effects of the product\nSo it becomes a sort of pure lifestyle advertising so some will be like for the person who likes to take it to go for a hike or someone who likes to smoke into yoga\nSo we're kind of seeing these new categories of the stoner emerge or more to the point we're seeing that we'd is sort of being advertised to anyone under the sun which I think is the sort of good demographic who actually uses it right\nOr if you didn't do anything and you're listening to Q. I speaking with element that bill my mood at least Christian San and John suddenly we're talking a little bit about the the impacts of legalization of marijuana on pop culture and I want to talk a little bit about music now\nCome on down all these things about me fatty meat\nDo you get not now what about you\nKnow the game of everything\nSo that they have it on a ... from here a vibrant vibe or back in the thirties by\nSomeone who you can smoke um\nLately it's impossible to overstate the relationship between modern music and we got one of the reason we played that because I Want to say it's nothing new it's especially since\nOh where to go you know yeah well the holy trinity of sex drugs and rock and roll I mean I suppose drugs kind of a ... a little bit but yeah we\nGo back to the Nineteen thirties I think one of the most famous early\nPot at the kids was Louis Armstrong he this was a big part of his life\nHe believed in it he didn't just do have recreation he did it recreationally but he believed in all the properties of it and then we just watch this kind of snowball effect where you know went into the next and then it goes into hippies and what's really interesting to me as whatever sort of evolution and music that you can think of pot somehow has made its way in there\nAnd that's what I find kind of fascinating I mean you just look at every sort of genre and time of music and they've got some sort of pot association so I'll be curious to see how that goes forward\nBut I Do feel like music before film or television was openly openly talking about we even if it wasn't in in such a blatant sort of way at least they were singing about a job I write about them\nI think so yeah I mean as Lisa said there's always been a thread through it and sort of be\n... how much the revolutionary censor hyped up but you know there's the Beatles before they did drugs and then there's the Beatles after they did drugs there's bad deal and before you did drugs Bob Dylan after he did drugs I mean these sort of signify at least at the time in certain areas a shift in consciousness at some level ...\nThe ... I Want to go see the gold near of hip hop in the early Nineteen nineties uh people aren't trying too hard to cover this up take a listen to the\n[noise]\nThe only difference is that I Would have if you have like ...\nWhat's that brings a field of following yeah you're right it is for sale but here from ... a police was energy when it came out\nYeah of course I mean but the but it's it's funny if you'd probably sat for a second and thought oh my goodness Louis Armstrong did already talked about that is not particularly edgy I found it more edgy and find when they ended up on The Simpsons\nUm and couldn't figure out why they ordered the London symphony orchestra that was very ah and so I Do think that we've had an interesting relationship where the where we've taken seriously and then also made fun of it and then also arrested people for it and then also celebrated it so it's just been a very confusing\nIssue but it but he's I remember when I first heard I spoke to joined by sublime and I thought I thought I was listening to a very dangerous song you know I was like you know driving around in in a car with someone who had a license I didn't have my license yet but you know fast forward now I mean ... hosting a cooking show called potluck with with Martha Stewart I Will be what does that tell you so hip hop\nArtist like use that danger of a weed and the nineties it'd be like hey I'm dangerous look at how filled with with pot smoke this room is\nBack tells you that in the most dangerous precedent here but the reality is that you know since everybody was always smoking weed and it was inevitable that snoop dog would end up on a cooking show with Martha Stewart us or are you know at a certain point on and you can bet they get high together\nSo it's a job I mean it was under this is we'd still edgy anymore\nWell yeah I mean I went to the extent to which was ever edgy I mean there's this thing around the uh the sides of this conversation which is that\nI think we all sort of find stoner culture a little bit annoying or passe or anything like that and maybe that will receipt I mean obviously when something becomes legal it is no longer subversive\nUh so I think maybe it will not be cool but at the same time it's better that it's legal it's better that people getting part in that people are going to jail for stupid reasons you know I Would rather it'd be a cool in safe and good for society than it'd be cool because I Wonder how cool it ever really was\nYou know as a person who has their birthday on for twenty I look forward to not having to read this every year you are just about\nReady to move on and I am yes I mean how do you feel about that and how how do you feel about leads his birthday and if I was in the late at least a man a\nListen I the the the fact of the matter is that a weed is not cool because we're talking about it on the radio right I\nMean about the radio or write a book that kids have moved on to other things and I don't say that these things are cool because that's the thing that people who in their thirties and on and so read as long ago last August edge not a knock on people under thirty\n... thirty yeah or you're going to try something else it's going to take a little work let's not that easy thing and just I'll do this no you're going to have to work at being cool now everyone yeah as someone who you know when somebody started playing the auto ... he was sixteen years old\nI don't think I've ever had to worry about really kind of being with if ah before we\nGo to I should mention that uh musicians like Margaret Price and Willie Nelson and Bob Marley the state of tragically hips are all getting involved in the business side of Canada is this is a clip of the country singer market price on our show\nHe ... a lot now old that that I mean when I when I hung out in the first time ...\n... is Willie Nelson sweetie crazy strong\nIt again it's very strong and coming out with man strain actually through religious areas and do you know it's getting legalized ... yeah yeah and they had to live here\nSo I'm going to leave less for it to you Lisa again many musicians willy Nelson bum rises state or the hip or getting involved and legalization and I know you have a theory on this\nIdea this is also the first anniversary of the death of Gore Downey um and so I'm not saying that that's the reason why this is the first day that pot is legal I'm just thinking about\nIt every one think about it you think that you think there might have been it might have been a decision on today I'm just saying think about it as a donor thing\nRight isn't it [laughter] I Know and then they are hanging it later on when I was actually kind of down but at the moment it sounded really smart\nI Do want to join a what a joy to have you and thanks so much for coming to everybody I say I have ... plays on adjunct freelance writer element that bill my mood is ... feet social media editor at least a
