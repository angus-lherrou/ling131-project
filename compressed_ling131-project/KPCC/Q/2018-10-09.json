McLaughlin you started tearing up a little bit because come on she's kind of a sad singer\nAngel and building a mystery these songs are kind of ... right but here's the thing when you actually talk to Sarah McLaughlin not only is she funny not only should kind and thoughtful she has a pretty good sense of humor about ourselves like today you're going to hear Sarah McLaughlin say the words Hi Sarah McLaughlin and I'm here to\nRuin your day so that's coming up next and also at least in the Williams taking you back to the record that changed her life and all that coming up on cue\n\nLive from NPR News in Washington on child Snyder Brett Kavanaugh said dear is first arguments as a Supreme Court justice and the more that needs to take his seat on the bench after a Monday Night ceremonial swearing in at the White House\nAbsolutely yeah I mean I think we we created\nA safe environment um for for women in particular because most of the summer festivals were very male dominated and quite frankly a lot of them were\nKind of aggressive and I think a lot of women didn't feel comfortable putting themselves in the center of that because you're all the time but women getting raped getting molested getting touched and appropriately and it sort of being this common theme because well you're all in the scrum together and it just happens well\nUm they didn't have to worry about that at ...\nAnd they also I think all of us that one of the biggest successes for me was that we all got to feel like we're\nPart of something bigger than ourselves and in a really nurturing loving environment\nDo you still have people coming up and talking to you about going to those shows\nYeah yeah actually I'm just last year at that you know as a young woman maybe thirty eight thirty nine came up to me and said you know I'm I'm running a company now the c._e._o. of a company that pretty successful and little affair Nineteen Ninety seven was my very first concert\nAnd you showed me that I could do anything how does that feel that you I Swear to God I nearly cried yeah it's beautiful validation to marry you know you know that you had an impact and you know ... you know you try and create positive change in the world and there it is right there like that is\nPowerful I Love that you said you started off his conversation by saying that it was really fun 'cause you're right I I I think about the affair so important in so beautiful and and so revolutionary but it must have been a laugh like they have any good any good stories from just being on the road\nUm I I have so many stories and I'm not sure I'm willing to share it [laughter]\nI don't believe that they're using them beers and I'm so Christie hind was on tour with us and she came in\nAt the beginning I think she was there for two weeks and she had her collar up and she's like oh you\nYou're just I I don't know about it in his feminist as new you know I've been in the rock business a long time and I I Know what I'm doing and you know don't mess with me and slowly word down were her down and at the end shifting okay I get it\nThis is a lot of fun and I remember every night I go out and dance a middle of the road I'd go there and do some ridiculous dance because it made her laugh and I like making her [laughter] and the last night I went out and um I had a little sequence to top on and I went out and I I did my dad's ...\nOh no and I also read thinking that I was also flashing the entire band right right and the drummer\nDropped it sticks and Christie Hi drafter guitar and basically it was like a chemical you if you just did that in\nAny way that I brought Christie Hi during these so that was like okay\nIf you're just tuning in you're listening to Q. I'm speaking with Sarah McLaughlin as there I think of all the songs are I think this one has become your signature articles and ah\nThat's our McLaughlin with angel from Nineteen Ninety seven out surfing\nYou know I think that it's a bit of a trope to talk to you about you know people cry to that song how emotional it is [noise] I I can tell you that\nEarlier today I was getting ready for this interview and I was just thinking about this song when I was thinking about that one line in the end listeners that you fear and I it happened did you lose this idea\nIt's just oh if I saw you know what it's interesting because I almost never hear the recording of it\nOr just doesn't often happen on an ... ... it moves me like I say that to me is one of the songs one of my great songs if ... if not the best song I've ever written because it came up very easily with sort of like I I channeled that\nIt came through me um I don't know how else to say because usually writing songs like extracting blood from a stone especially lyrical and that song just it just happened over the course of a week\nAnd I was in a sense over in um just outside of Montreal staying in a um Jamie ... little cottage in orange and it's just trying to write I think I had been on the road for a\nClose to two years and was pretty exhausted and drained emotionally and physically and was recuperating and of course trying to write the new record 'em and I read a Rolling Stone article about the keyboard player from smashing pumpkins who had ... on heroin and I'm\nIn a hotel room and\nIt it broke my heart you know they were they were great band and I'd just like it just it was like God there's yet another story and I think it was so poignant for me because I was in that situation myself so many times in another hotel room by myself on the road\nExhausted wondering you know\nIs there an end to this I mean I'm not I I think near the end of that tour I was like oh I don't think I was enjoying myself playing anymore and when you stop enjoying the thing that you that that is your purpose in life it's it's kind of a a scary hollow feeling and so I just I felt great empathy for what I thought\nYou know I had a bit of an understanding of perhaps what he was going through I've never done heroin in my life and never will but just that feeling of of emptiness and and ... needing desperately to find something to to fill up this void\nYou know some of the scary but at the hotel rooms and you're like you get off stage bed that pop isn't there anymore and you're just you and the TV you know\nYou know it's it's a lonely existence being on the road especially for that period of time and you know it is a life of extremes in a certain way you know from these massive highest you especially you know you you may be having a horrible day a horrible week a horrible month and you've got\nFive thousand ten thousand people screaming you saying they love you see what can you possibly love me I hate myself right now uh [laughter]\nYou know so it's it's almost worse in some ways but I mean I digress but so I don't know I was yeah it but that song for me I mean I don't\nIt moves me it move it move me when I heard it just in that moment and it moves me every time I sing I feel grateful and I feel this this flood of\nKind of quiet and joy when I sing that song and it again it's just it's\nPart of it is because I don't I don't even begin to understand how it moves me but perhaps it's in a similar way that it moves so many other people because that's part of the beauty of that song is you know so many people over the years\nHave stopped me on the street or wherever and said you know that song in particular has really\nHelped me through a tough time or you know I played it at my mother's funeral or when my father was passing that was our song and there's such an intense emotional connection to people's personal lives with that song it it's it's such a um it's such a gift as an artist did you hear those stories so\nAngel became some sort of like an unofficial ... morning around the house of lives around nine eleven like where you were you aware of that what's happening\nI think I became aware of it after the fact and and I continue you know I was I was I'm a little island I'm In the Caribbean in March on spring break and [noise]\nUm the people in the island I you know I figured I'm In the middle of nowhere it and they all knew who I was because you know they they they had gone through this hurricane and that was a song that everybody attach themselves to a ... with when they lost their loved ones and so I was kind of a celebrity\nAlso used for years and very famous TV campaign for the ASPCA to American society for that as a write up so to the animals you were in the ad to sitting next to you and I promised myself it wouldn't be glued beer but sitting next to a very sad looking dog Sarah\nOh those dogs are brutal to work with I got to tell you [laughter]\nCan I please bring my dog I Know they're not SPCA ducks but they're really well trained these you know dogs when they um are nervous or anxious they pan yeah\nAnd these dogs they're they're rescue dogs and they're beautiful sweet animals but they were nervous as hell being forced to sit with a stranger under these hot lights for a significant period of time for life still [laughter] so you know when actors they\nDon't ever worked with babies are dogs are you ready to there's a reason you're ready to thirty million dollars well we're working on a hot day yeah oh it was ...\nI think it changed it changed everything I think there was a piece in the New York times about it because it was everybody was so shocked by the by the money that it generated and myself included and I think the SPCA as well\nYou also had a pretty good sense of humor about it I Know ... you were in a car commercial yeah we thought of it\nI have to make fun of it yeah I I think you know because there's so many means and everything else about do you know Debbie Downer Hi I'm Sarah McLaughlin and I'm about to wrap your day yeah I mean [laughter]\nIt makes you laugh 'cause I'm like I Know I Can't watch it it's brutal\nBut it does work oh Sarah everyone was on to play for you and this one might take you for\n\nThat [laughter]\n\n[laughter]\nYou know the same can be ... and the blues world my husband and manager Tom and I got to see a ... play at a little club in LA\nProbably about maybe a year less than a year before he died he was Ninety One I think yeah thing yeah and he played his ass off it was beautiful as strong and young and spirit and I mean this was the guy who hung out with Robert Johnson yeah you know and\nSo it is now one of the world are grew up in war you know yeah I saw I saw dead as ... yeah\nYeah she's great you know looking at for last week I talked to like a songwriter came up to me and she was talking to me 'cause she knows by show and she said you know I really wanted to be a musician for a while but you know I'm about to turn thirty so I think it'd be too\nLate oh oh please [noise] uh I got a letter\nOr ... or email from a from a guy I'm recently as he's a struggling writer and um that he said well I'm Still struggling with this idea you know I'm thirty eight\nAnd it's too late you know so a running back and I said no it's not too late you know go find a mentor it's good to have a mentor or someone who you try to you can whose work you do\nYou admire um just show your work two and get really good honest constructive criticism from who's that for you know [noise]\nUm my dad really was the first was the one unusually you know as soon as I started you know putting pen to paper and\nComing up with things that would show on you know when I was still living at home I Would show 'em in the late or even after I left home\nYou know I sent him a tape with all the all the lyrics to the songs on car wheels as I was working on those even as late as car will so I was still I wanted his approval [laughter] you know yeah\nAnd um I think that it's important to have that not just sit by herself you know like on the edge of your bed\nYou know um\nYou gotta have you got to put it out there and get response maybe some people are afraid to do that you know they're afraid that it's not good enough or whatever but you're not going to know\nAnd you're not going to grow without good constructive criticism read that's the thing we got it all out there and play in front of people to you know that this whole idea that you can you know just create something on the Internet and\nI mean I Know it happens and it was within a certain mental you um but\nYou know at the end of the day I mean for the kind of music that we're talking about you know it's important to\nYou know go to a little coffee houses and things and I'm not talking about trying to get a big important good would just go out fine to\nYou know group of like minded singer songwriters and you know have some sort of exchange you know that's what I did I spent Fifteen plus years basically doing\nThat what I'm Talking about in Austin and Houston taxes back and forth and all the little clubs there and you know there was a real supportive scene of other songwriters and you know that's really were cut my teeth before\nI even thought about you know having a manager or record label or anything like that they're all trying to move too fast these days yeah you know they've got to have a record label now they've got to do this now and yet you also have to be willing to travel\nYou can't make excuses I Know it's harder now because it's harder to live now\nYou know\nYeah I when I was doing it it was all during the seventies you know and everything was dirt cheap and you know you could work and get all day job of two or three days a week you can\nPay your rent you know\nYeah I'm right always it's a lot harder now you know it's it's great to hear you talk about this this and I think I think I Want to make it a lot of people need to hear it you know yeah well the ... on the other two old when you're thirty or me that's just such a\nSad sad actually you know because you're just going to go downhill from there I mean where are you going to go how are you going to go forward if you're already thinking every it's too late for everything at the age of thirty\nYou know that's really sad to me\nAs well as you get older listen to you gotta you gotta deal with a lot of stuff and you mentioned your dad being your mentor and a half and half of your brought it up because I wanted to play a cut from your ah read from your recommend twenty sixteen from coastal highway twenty take a listen to this\nMan\n\nAnd a\nHad a man ...\nFrom my mom is and\nDo is from ghost a highway twenty and twenty sixteen that's my guess listening to Williamsburg ... listen to that some song [noise]\nWow that's now you're going to fight it out one that's thank you for playing out when I don't it doesn't get\nYou know talked about that much or anything tell me about it [noise]\nUm I actually wrote\nThat after my mother died um because\nUm she passed away in two thousand for 'em so I was I started just rotting like crazy you know around that time um and that was\n... yeah I just ... a rod that earlier um [noise] it didn't come out of twenty sixteen but it was an older song that I'd written after my\nMy mother's yes but you know so I had it on the back burner and um you know it was it was time you know for it to come out for it to the real heist\nIt's a it's a moral song but it's also sort of a defiant song you\nKnow what I mean yeah well you know I was inspired when I was writing it by that traditional song that Raul Stanley um say death what'd you went to the army over for another year yeah you know I was just fire\nIn general and bought a lot of the old English in Irish vote ballads you know the mountain music and everything there was so powerful and dark and primal and scary\nYou know um\nWould you go back and listen to those a lot of the lyrics in those early songs you know they're very dark on mystical you know I'm like banks of the Ohio yeah our barber Allen where you\nKnow her lover tapes or ... or the guy takes\nHis love her to the woods 'cause she's been unfaithful and you know as plunges a knife into her breast and the blood runs down and you know\nI Love that line in the banks the Ohio My my dad used to sing it was and only say that you'll be my any no other arms in ... and I always thought that was such a beautiful\nLord yeah it's beautiful yeah no\nI wasn't what I what I got ya I wanted to get your perspective on this because I I Know we're we're we're talking about death a fair bit here but I wanted to get some perspective on or someone else who I Know mental idea which was Tom Petty who we lost so suddenly last year yeah what do you\nOh\nYou know we were starting to become really you know friends you know and it started with just a mutual admiration for each other's music and art you know and\nIt started with back in the nineties um he asked me to go out and open up for him which was a huge honor\nI went out and open I guess about ten date forum or something like that or a couple of weeks or something and you know this was people still doesn't know\nMost of the people there didn't know who I was still yeah you know who were coming to fish shows and um you know it was a big hot you know high budget kind of shows you know these big arenas and everything and um I remember one of 'em\nThis guy sitting across you know with his arms crossed in front world and patiently waiting for time to come out another time somebody do a banana peel on stage\nOr there was that at a vision
