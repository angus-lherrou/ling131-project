{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "It's the latest picture ... inches now who won an Oscar two years ago the directing the musical ... don't go to Justin Chang has this review\nFirst man might be one of the noisiest clunky is most you know we get movies about space travel ever made\nAnd I mean that in a good way\nThe film adapted from James are Hansen's biography of Neil Armstrong returns us to a time when NASA technology was in its early stages we first meet Armstrong played by Ryan Gosling as a test pilot in Nineteen sixty one flying a small fighter jet over Southern California\nAt an altitude of around a hundred and forty thousand feet\nThe director Damien ... though doesn't give us anything so beautiful as an exterior shot at the plane's going through the sky he locks us inside the cockpit\nThe engine noises deafening the images blurry and disorienting the tense close ups of Armstrong's eyes and the rattling motions of the aircraft remind you of the irrationality of human flight the sheer violence of defying the laws of physics\nYou learn a lot about Armstrong in this scene alone he doesn't say much and he's very very good at his job\nEven back on Tara from the camera has a lingering case of the jitters there's a hand held roughness did the scenes of meal at home with his wife Janet played by an excellent clear for and their children\nTragedy strikes early on the Armstrong's lose their two year old daughter Karen to cancer Neal is devastated and throws himself into his work\nSeeking a fresh start he moved the family to Houston and enters NASA's Gemini astronaut training program\nAlthough gorgeously scored by ... longtime composer Justin her with first man looks and sounds nothing like their musicals whiplash and low end\nBut it has the same outsized ambition\nThe movie captures the flux and upheaval of the sixties when NASA found itself caught between the pressures of the Cold War with its mandate to beat the Russians by any means and the resistance of a public unhappy with the program which cost millions of taxpayer dollars and several astronauts lives\nAgainst this tumultuous backdrop should sell and his screenwriter just singer set themselves the tricky task of dramatizing the inner life of an American hero known for his lack of flash or pretension\nIn one scene Neal was interviewed by NASA panel and he responds to even the probing personal question in a stoic professional way\nI don't know what space exploration well uncovered but I don't think it'll be exploration just for the sake of exploration\nI think it'd be more of the fact that it allows us to see things\nMaybe we should have seen a long time ago\nJust haven't been able to until now\n\nThe new whenever anything else yeah you know sorry to hear about your daughter I'm Sorry to hear a question\nWhat I mean uh do you think it will have an effect\nI think he would be\nA reasonable to assume that it wouldn't have some effect\nGiven how carefully Armstrong guarded his privacy before and especially after the moon landing there is something of invasive about the way first manned keeps returning to parents death linking family tragedy and professional triumph\nFor the most part should selling Gosling respect Armstrong's reticence he's unwillingness to speak on this absolutely necessary\nHis home life predictably suffers as it becomes emotionally withdrawn from Janet and their two sons but he develops the balance of warm camaraderie and unspoken rivalry with his fellow pilots played by actors including Jason Clarke Patrick future even Embry and Christopher Abbott\nCorey stole gets an amusing loud enough performance as Buzz Aldrin with whom Neal will share his history making Apollo eleven moment\nThere were points in first man when the disjointed and his filmmaking drove me to distraction the leaps forward in time the closeups stubborn refusal to let us get our bearings but after a while those surface ruptures begin to make dramatic and psychological sense\nYou come to understand what it must have been like to be Armstrong thrown from one hurdle to the next navigating endless chaos losing friends and colleagues plugging of course to the moon driven by little more than ... flights of risk an instinct\nFinally July Nineteen sixty nine arrives and she sells stages the moon landing with the stillness and supplement the that feels like both an antidote at an answer to all the proceeding chaos\nIt's a sequence of hushed an otherworldly grander that demands to be seen an IMAX as possible for several minutes we really do seem to have left planet earth behind transported to a landscape of dust desolation and wonder\nSome dust was stirred up shortly after first manned premiered at the Venice film festival where journalists noted that the movie didn't show the U.S flag being planted on the moon's surface effect that quickly drew fire from conservative politicians\nIn fact ... does show the flag after it's been planted he just doesn't treat the planting itself as a combination point\nHe takes the moon landing in achievement that might have been played for easy triumph and turns it into one man's solemn personal reckoning with all the sorrows failures sacrifices and convictions that have brought him to this extraordinary moment\nWe may not truly know Neil Armstrong buy movies and but we know that his one small step contain multitudes\nGuessing Chang's film critic for the LA Times if you want to hear the interview we broadcast yesterday

I had to have it parts of labor and you talk about that you talk about the kid that you were in the book one of the last recipes recipes in the book yeah ah it's a big part of your story\nYeah do you kind of chuckle when I mentioned it could have you did become sort of associated\nWith yeah it's like what are those things where you I'm In bands often talk about this but like you can't really pick your fans and I\nI'm you know I worked in like the best French restaurants in Toronto for a long time and\nWorked really hard at opening odd fellows although it was kind of like a cluster hoot [laughter]\nYou know like a it was pretty wild restaurant I was twenty six years old in the midst of like a lot of drugs and alcohol and ego and who up man that's that is that was a hoot and spot\nAnd uh and so it\nUm but the burger the burger\nUm it was the first time I ever did any television stuff and they didn't really understand any of it and I just I made my son was a game show or like a reality check on her gr yeah like burger or is there really call a burger wars\nLike no offense to them I'm the I chose to do it you know and um I just didn't understand or the power of of television I think at that time or understand anything really\nAnd I was like yeah sure I'll do this thing I don't have to do anything they just come to the restaurant I'm going to cook a cheeseburger at the restaurant and that's kind of it and they're like yeah I'm like that's easy let's go and you want\nAnd I one hand and then all of a sudden when that aired I remember it aired and like I think August and all of a sudden our restaurant that I worked really hard at every one involved worked really hard at\nMaking amazing food we were trying to it was a restaurant\nWasn't of forgetting [laughter] friend a burger shot at and all of a sudden\nI was known for this cheeseburger and we used to change the thing that's crazy too is like we used to change or cheeseburger like three or four times a year and that burger the burger the piano burger\nIs just the burger that we had at that time that's all it was it wasn't a special like really it was just like every menu change we would do we would change the burger\nAnd and that just happened to be the burger and now that the burger\nAnd um we would have people from Cornwall we have people coming to knock it on our windows all day uh that's why we open up piano burger and that's one of the things that is like ... you don't do something like that and that's like one of the biggest business I'm\nKind of like nods that I've really learned is like just because people want something from you doesn't mean you have to give it to him all the time because I didn't even care about cheeseburgers and we open up the piano burger\nAnd it failed because no one actually cared about it I cared about parts of labor I care about like restaurants I certainly don't care about like fast food or quit service there um style restaurants we haven't had just had like ... I remember you and it did well and within like a\nAfter the third year we like I literally got a phone call from Richard was like hey we're going to close ... where do you think it was like ... like talk to you I'm I'm doing something else\nLike cool it's it's it's interesting 'cause we were talking about talking about this book I speaking with Matty Matheson about his his new cookbook because I Want to talk about that perception of you that like you're you're you're a train French chef and then you were getting known for making cheese burgers\nYou know when we listen to the when we listen to the clubs at the very beginning you know you're you're ... and You're Joking around like it's it's it's awesome and I yeah I watch the DVDs I Love the Youtube video I follow you and Instagram you're you're you're funny you're loud and you're boisterous and it's all those things\nAre but in the book we talk about what your family eight when times are tough your grandfather's career as a member of the ... you mentioned your trips to Nova Scotia as you mentioned we learned about the people who influenced uses chef at a person I feel like it's a side of you that people might not know about because that intentional when writing this book because it showed a different side of you I think so well\nI I think that\nUm this book\nI I I I think if I'm not a I'm I'm certainly not ashamed of anything I've done no of course and I think everything that I've done is funny yeah and I I think a lot of people and I and you see this with a lot of comedic actors and I put myself into a comedy role\nAnd kind of comedy cooking I'm funny like I'm just naturally kind of funny I'm reactionary I say funny than\nIt is what it is but now I'm known as is like funny guy\nAnd which is fine but I think that like the thing that this book is is a true juxtaposition between like what that is and who I Am and that you can sit in a bathtub any macaroni and cheese if you want and you can still be serious and care about things and make beautiful things\nLike just because I can make a good macaroni and cheese with like Cheetos on top\nDoesn't mean that I Can't make the most beautiful cash to lay or roasted chicken or serve just beautiful food and I think like that is I'm now ... like this book is me\nRight like it's not vice isn't it even like with me making this book with Abrams they allowed me to make my book it was published or Abrams yeah Aaron's is the publisher and they've been amazing to work with like that book as my proposal\nWhich is an amazing thing like I stayed the course I went in with a very strong proposal and I was like this is the book I'm selling [laughter] this is the book that I Want to make\nA if you want to do this but then we can do it yeah I mean the very first line of the book is\nUm this cookbook is not about farms gardens sustainable seafood or how much cocaine I did before or after service every night and like I I think it's pretty well documented you struggle with addiction yeah attack when you were twenty nine you got to have you use the drugs and alcohol like is is this book changing what people think about when they think about you\nI think it's just going to add another layer yeah you know it's just going to be like oh sick like I used to love reading like um blue she's books and like these auto biography like you know these books about these\nAmazing funny characters that are pretty tragic getting booted up booted out of ... lots of knows there's lots of beer who thoughts of ... and and I I just\nI had an opportunity to just how much real like my story there's no there's no me trying to ... like I I could easily right all of the horror stories and all of the\nUm kinda nightmares that I went through but I think it's more it it it's better for everyone if I kind of just write about food and a little bit of the nightmares and a little bit of like the excess because I think that like\n... it's just true to who I this book is just really true it's hard to even describe it but as it is just true to me I think\nA reading this book the way you talk about your family's food is really interesting to me a lot of the recipes in in this\nBook Matty are yeah it's like half and half yeah but the the the family has to be the last I grew up with to everyone freaking out about your fry blown up it's affecting me because I Love ... cops yeah footage quickly turning into the bologna cop\nA sex worker and the ... and you know why because\nI think it's a way of like bringing humanity to people who it's easy to judge like kind of challenging our massaging a kind of empathy out of other people in out of myself to like imagine if you heard on the local news station\nThe story of what happens in this movie which I won't I won't say you know 'cause I hopefully I'll go see it and lived through the story that but imagine if you can imagine having seen the movie that this story could be on your local news station you think God\nHow could that have happened and and so this is an imagining of how it could have happened and how you could even\nPossibly for a long long time have been rooting for her\nSo what do you do as an actor I mean I think even if people don't again we can't really hard to talk about this film because you don't give anything away but I mean so far we've given it a little bit of a way like I think we've said that you know this is obviously a kindergarten teacher who's obsessed with the poetry of of a student or class\nThreat and you want people to know I think like it's not like about\nA kindergarten teacher who was you know like you to go to the top rate you know what I mean there's like a dark side is the kindergarten teacher with me in it [laughter]\nSo do so with you in it how how do you put your cells in the head space to play this character because she does things in this film that makes us\nIt was really uncomfortable she's not a monster she crosses a lot of lines what do you do\n[noise] well I guess intellectually Sarah ... the director and I I think we both really new and it was very clear in the script the movie doesn't work unless you really deeply relate to her\nYou know if you start this movie and they're like oh she's a creepy teacher will then where it's what is it ... so you have to\nShe has to feel like\nLike one of us\nI'm so that was important so I knew okay she's got to be a great teacher I spent some time\nIn a kindergarten class I read about that learning really the stuffed those little special things at the kindergarten\nTeachers do amazing stuff I mean like ... like one thing I Love to a gym I've seen my own daughter do who actually is the same age as Parker who plays Jimmy a is you know a kindergarten teacher someone raises their hand and said something like I Am this weekend a was\nPassover and we we had a Passover Seder that all the kids raised their hand yeah me too me too right but she had set this thing up where they like we're on the radio how to you know they did this little habits\nFor hang it sort of ... to what's happening in the ... yeah or one of US Army major who are doing if you don't want another aggravating that I've\nRead but I think that's what it was and all the kids instead raise\nTheir hand in went like that and that meant me too and then they didn't have to all scream oh you're just see all the kissing that or sometimes they would take their hand and um [noise] uh put it on their head and say brain match [laughter]\nI didn't know what that meant they had to check in but it meant something similar I I have something I'm going to I'd like to share or whatever for\nAll those kind of kindergarten great kindergarten teacher tracks did you did you teach the class [noise] well yeah so we had um we shop very very quickly you know a movie about a woman made by a group of women we didn't surprise and we have enough money\nFor like running and gardening and it was like really independent film edits classic you know at its best so we had five days with the cats\n[noise] and um [noise] yeah I staring I talked about it and we thought\nWe I don't believe children who are five and six years old or actors and I don't believe it's fair to ask them to act and I think when you do you get something really strange gift and we wanted\nReal kids I'm behaving like kids so yes\nI Would just kind of teach the class you know if you're watching in the movie there is a painting class the kids are really painting and when they're that age you're not going to sort of be like pretend pain no right now so they're deeply engaged in their projects when they're when we're doing this effort I'm teaching them letters you know they're really and they're going like\nEither figuring out the letter saying I'm really in first grade so I Know I'm a writer and [laughter] and or the songs we sang actually had it was like one of the only actual arguments I had with a one of the producers was I just started singing the song which I knew was in public domain but Edward there when I was like I'm\nA sat down in the valley oh\nRattling bogged down in a valley oh yeah but how do you remember of\nIt just if it's everyone knows that so [laughter] but she's Israeli and she didn't know that it was in the public domain\nAnd a lot of naval everything that we're on from his speeds up as it goes along yeah so I just started\nSinging that song with the kids and the kids all knew it and the kids that are super engaged in they're excited to say you know whatever funny things um you know a fly on the bottom and the you know what evidence yeah and so that's really exciting to watch on on on film\nYou would you ... to them I think yes and no because you're pretty recognized imagine people\nWould come up to me and say I know I ... ... you know things like that right little five year old and my mom told me you're in ... man you know and so to the children will do hold my mom told me to to totally alternate realities in their mind at once you know at that age\nDo you as a adult now yeah when you act\nAlong side of the the coast or in kindergarten teacher Parker speed actually play Jimmy Roy this boy with a different poetry ... really beautiful form and do you learn anything from from that\nFrom him yeah [noise]\nHuh Interesting question I felt because I have a child exactly the same age as Parker a I felt really focused on protecting him\nFrom having\nTo\nPerform too much from having to feel any of the feelings of having his boundaries crossed in the way that Jimmy does in the movie I didn't want this little boy to have to go through the experience of what his character\nJimmy goes through I never thought about so instead and I was really a tune to it because my child was five I knew every day what it meant to be five I knew how vulnerable I knew I mean in a way that I Can't even remember now because now my child's sex and I it's hard to really remember\nSo mostly in terms of the acting with Parker Sarah and I either we put the camera on him and trying not to let him know or you know just sort of capture moments of him just being five\nWhich is so beautiful yeah or it was super technical you can't say to a five year old you need to find the place and you that's more angry\nRight you know you I mean it's weird note for an adult children but it sounded something some bad director exactly instead you have to say or what we decided to do and I felt really strongly about this was\nStand on that red acts on the ground look out the window and we're willing look out the window now look back at me now look back out the window now say I don't want to go and he'd say I don't want to go no Parker sing it like a song I don't want\nTo go you know until he was really repeating after us and doing something very very technical and simple yeah\nUm and then and then I think in terms of me acting with him\nIt's funny it's like Lisa thinks she's having a relationship with Jimmy but she's having a relationship with herself\nAnd I think she's missing him and so\nIt was All right that I didn't have like a deeply intimate relationship with this little boy it was just really more about a conversation with myself\nDidn't feel like a risky film to you I mean you have a child is key rural very complex lead character that you don't really know whether you're rooting for even when the film was over right entirely sure of rooted here on August ... film and feel to risk at all when you were making you\nYeah I mean of course of course of course but like why else are we doing it you know and when I sat in the audience and ... and I felt\nThis kind of wild effect that it has I mean you can imagine that gets people gas and they laugh that strange things were and\nI think it's saying something real about the state of the world for women at the moment I'm\nThis is a woman who is not fundamentally mentally ill she's not crazy but I think you're looking at someone who is driven crazy by the culture that she finds herself in [noise]\nAnd I think for many women at the moment if we're honest I don't I don't know that I could imagine doing the things that Lisa does I mean it's an allegory she goes real\nFar real extreme I really don't want to do more notice there's lots of it but a very not related will\nKnow well right it's it's beyond a normal behavior of course but up until the point the ways in which she's out of control confused has no hell no one understands\nHer um and I think is hungry for some kind of\nReal interaction in the world um is something I really relate to and I know because of what's the cultural conversation at the moment that half of you know the\nPeople in the world the women relate to it I mean basically we made the movie last", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "12"}
