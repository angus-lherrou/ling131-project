I don't ... I haven't practiced in over ten years but it's kind of I you know I Do keep up my license and California read you know a thousand bucks a year but that that's what that takes to\nToday and then you have to watch 'em a little bit of a kind of continue medical education but he was like my my wife also a doctor and she still practices part time so I\nBasically not the kind of thing you don't have to put in like another pilot you had to put a certain amount of hours in a walking\nOut on the go I don't want to do like five prostate exams a day or something\n[noise] um there were there were as we mentioned there's an overlap between you as an actor in your time is a doctor I'm at what point did you decide kind of crystal I just wanted to do acting\n[noise] that was knocked off that was the first movie that I booked back in it came out in those seven by both at into six and I still have my day job\nAt that time I play the doctor to I'm Kevin Hi go in and um it it it it was honestly the most transformative moment of my career at that time because and I shot that movie while taking a vacation week I shot that movie in three days and uh\nIt it was it was amazing because anybody's anybody in comedy was in that movie it was a yet Seth Rogen Paul Rudd Jonah Hill Jason segal is Bill Bill Hader Christian we grow in it it felt like an event and\nAnd at the end of it when judge said to me that he actually said after filming said you you are my discovery I Will I Will put you in all my movies and and he did so it was at that point where you talk like that huh\nYeah you are my discoveries [laughter] I Know what you and all my move yeah he had a cloak and dagger I [laughter] I don't know [laughter] it'd be a\nLot to learn about showed his baby the happiest number one jacket number one number one to stop using them contract [laughter] taking their contracts with back to ...\n[laughter] [noise] sorry I just graduated ... cum laude economic\nCouple of courses on record 'em prop work and but it was it was around the hangover when you did leave medical practice yet\nIt was it was around that time that literally within within a matter of months I actually was sooner than that I decided it was time for this college kid to go pro so to speak yeah\nSo how many people here first can on the hangover\nYour\nJob\nBut\nHe says that you're involved I I'll get you some parents [laughter] [noise]\n[noise]\nSo\nWe saw that I haven't I haven't seen that scene literally in days no I [noise] it's\nBeen a few years since I've actually if you have if you got to tell me something about shooting\nKnow yeah yeah oh that was well hey that was my idea to be naked in the hangover I have that and um and ...\nDirector you know who did old school you know I knew this was on par tone you know with with the topic was movies though when I when I like nervously pitch and when you do you think it'd be okay if ... jumps out naked instead of just having parents because you don't have to me it was\n[noise] God those impressive yeah that's a key literally within ... within an hour\nHe he sent someone to make me sign a contract or uh like stating that I Would not change my mom at the right to not because he ... he was he knew that would be the right the right move for that for that but he wouldn't dare ask the actor to do that so\nSo we knew were kind of onto something at that time how quickly after the hangover came out did you notice that something had changed\nAh within that weekend I mean going eating sushi at the same spot with my white that we normally do um like\nDuring that week in the movie came out everyone's just staring at me and it just like just change from black and white to technicolor it I mean they are really to get it just got it just got ever since then it's kind of been more of a spotlight yeah\nThere was a lot um and we don't have to go too much into this will be there were there was a lot going on in your life around the time of shooting the hangover right out of the river regarding your wife\nBegan to you and I talk about him in my act tonight actually where you know I was my wife had breast cancer survivor ten years cancer free [noise]\nBut it was at that point\nWhere she was I'm going through her chemotherapy I got offered the part of Mr down the hangover and ... and what a lot of people don't know about I actually turned down that part's even though she was actually a recovering we actually the first as the chemo actually got rid of the cancer\nBut I she had told more rounds of chemo to go and I did not want to leave her side for understandable reasons that we have twin girls we have two eleven year old twin girls Alexa\nZoe and so and we had really no one to help take care of the kids at home so I was like not you know we didn't know the hang of it would be a big movie at that time so it's not uncommon to turn down\nParts like this and so I was like no I I I'm you know we're politely decline and with Todd Phillips and that was my wife herself she was like what look we I Know I'm getting better and we know we're we're on the recovery slope of this so\nI think this could be therapeutic for you in many ways it was so it was actually my wife's encouragement to do the movie and so and and and there's some a bit of trivia in the hangover actually ... my wife Vietnamese and I speak\nIn Vietnamese and the hang of it there's a couple of things just some in jokes just to make her laugh when I say actually that actually means of Vietnamese chicken die\nIt was just a random just because we didn't\nKnow the hangover would be that we do I thought that this will be a great comedy cult movie you know and no one knew at that time it would be you know one of the biggest movies are rated movies of all the time\nSo there there's a few I think I'm On which means what you think I'm saying come on in an accident actually means thank you and being a me so I was just doing little things that just to make me laugh and then\nFirst movie where you were you there when she thought for the first time yes\nWe we saw together at a screening I'm Todd had a family and friends grading and we saw it together and it was a member of Italy like three months before the movie came out she could not stop laughing when\nThe first moment where ... Tracey Tracey you know we have to that kind of trend has got it she just could not stop laughing and she just 'cause I kept downplaying I said this is going to be a ... movie you may or may not like it you know this is a this is the ... as you know it's not\nThis she actually said I don't think ... even though this she said this move will make two hundred million dollars\nShe said that it did and what like two Seventy eight or something like that you know it was amazing and not that I Know numbers or anything like that [noise] for sixty seven worldwide\nNow [laughter] [noise]\nI don't know what any of those numbers are\nBut I I don't want to hear from this too much but I I understand that like\nBeing naked in the film and kind of going all out really good sort of inspired by your wife in so many ways because I think you learn something about the value of life for\nYou know it really inform iconic because if you look at my work prior till then I had done knocked up role models and had done the office I we're talking about shaved my one of my first guest spots I guess roses on the office back in two thousand five\nMcCain being on The Vagina remember that it was the one of my favorite my to this day\nStill my favorite ... against aren't rolling any any show Paul feed a directed that it was it was it was amazing and uh\nBut until then I was kind of known to be more of like the more of a subtle you know a character actor wasn't famous but the ... a good hand on the set and which I was all I wanted to be with just to be a good character actor I didn't you know it was not in the cards I thought for me to be no notice ... I\nI felt like well I thought it was older and I felt like I just\nI just felt like I had that character looking I it I just wanted to be a character I had no desire to be a leading anything and so I just wanted I just said if I and I think that the fear of like going back\nInto medicine if this fails was always weighing in my head so I was like man if I can just go for a couple of road like oh you're that Dr from knocked up and have to go back to my day job in my mind I still won three though I always have that\nThing in my head like okay maybe I have to go back and so by the time I'm a ... I forgot what I was saying I just enjoy talking about myself\nWe were talking about the tanning foods\nWhen you're when it got sick yes there was a change in how you approached your career\nIf you look on a if you look in the Blu ray DVD of hanging over one there's me in the desert I'm doing this improv for ten minutes and it's not listed as refined UC be kind of an ... it is like I'm literally channeling me being really mad\nAt the demons of at the world for you know cursing my life with cancer I remember that deadly and I was just like shouting screaming in the most\nPolitically incorrect things I still don't remember what I said but it was just raw as I've ever been on any set and I just remember yelling allied and and I got this big applause at the end of it and uh\nI went to taught I was like man this is this is this is what I needed so therapeutic so I just remember\nThinking that and I would think about trans cancer ... said just to get me into character plain mister chow as aggressively as I did so they kind of taught me that life is you know\nFar beyond our man in my life much less in comedy and I remember I improvise a lot of that yeah and he\nLater told me years later he was going to freaking nudge he was not a good than harm\nAnd there's a lot like you know he's he's like a play right you don't you really don't improvise on community much I mean so so easy me improvised on the hangover a lot of my movies are a lot of people don't know community actually ... like ... in Providence disagree and we don't want I don't want to improvise cause of writing is so tight and so good\nAnd the un Harman has a certain slow like in in any good play you know but I didn't know that I came with my moody kind of kind of approach and I was just provide all these things and I later her friends of mine who right on the show there like Dan was going for it in a but\nUh but but then when he saw the added he was like wow I can use that when that there is a there was a mom or I go ... gray Gino and that was all improvised\nOn me I had a ... jacket in a paint all episode ... like a tiger striped AK forty seven eight ball you know a chain\nUses so it was one of the rare moments in you know on community where like an improv of mind really informed and fleshed out that character and years later Dan told me was like yeah I'm I'm Glad even though I mean I'm Glad he's looking back I'm Glad you provide so much you know but just don't do it again you know [laughter]\nI Love how angry you were the first season\nYou know if you were saying was so angry all the yeah I I\nDefinitely if it was really just a few months after coming off of the hangover hadn't really thought about that way too because and and I think I was just kind of playing off of the kind of kind of the newfound confidence I learned from the ... I was playing things generally a little bit aggressively and I ...\nTo give it the one who told you the funniest when you're angry right yes\nYes he told me that they need and I I remember even asking him like so when I play calm ... what does that mean that means your anger levels that zero so he was telling me to ... years later and so in that always informed me any and sometimes and I remember using that in a community when I Lived ... let's say there was a take I\nI'm not really executing the way the writers and vision to\nYou know especially that first season I Would just maybe okay I'll get a little bit more pepper on it a little bit more juice on it\nAnd then it would take me into an area where okay I can find the truth the navy you know it it's not just getting angry shouting the line I hate to be so inside the actors studio you get it's almost like you you you get angry your eyes you find your own voice and then you get to the I hate to say this but the truth of the scene and then if I'm saying yelling then I can\nActually go back and can track it to a lead to a lower volume but at least I found my\nTruth I'm Sorry to be some protests as long as you mentioned the troops out of things because I always thought it was interesting to see your Chang but he was really really funny like I hated him for a while and there was always some kind of humanity in there yeah I\nYeah I I um [noise] the nicest compound I get from fellow actors as they're you know when they see my whole body of work if they know me well are they know my work well they're like you know there's\nYou know there always seems to be a trace of humanity or comedy even if you're playing someone as a out mentally ill like senior Chang well mental illness as a human condition so I think maybe that maybe some kind of it's not that I Do it deliberately but there's something possibly subconscious about me being a physician or my medical background where\nYou're trying to just humanize everything so is it the mother of an understanding what you're trying to do that I I\nAbsolutely believe that I Do think that when I play in movies where I've been kind of cast as the villain I feel like the\nKey is to never think of yourself as the villain you think yourself as misunderstood you think of yourself as the white hat and they just don't understand and that's I I first show with every road whether I'm of protecting us or an antagonist or aside player I never think I'm a bad person who quote unquote you know\nBefore we move on for community because you have to have a great story from yeah I'm after\nMy one of my favorite stories is in a lot of people don't notice on the\nThe fifth year community I was getting burned out chain was getting so crazy I think due to the aggressive style my first two years but they're like I think the end of the writers are assuming he likes that sounds so we'll play it to a point in but what was happening was like I was kind of growing tired of it and I was getting frustrated um\n'cause like I'm living in an air event and putting gasoline on\nMyself [laughter] and I'm eating a up pine cone sandwich and I'm like you know I used to be a doctor [laughter] and and I I Would just getting burned out being on the show where I ended up emailing Danny because I didn't want to be that actor complaining about a bigger part\nAnd so I emailed him 'cause I mean I Want to make sure I chose my words carefully I Want my uh I Would love for Chang just to\nJust to be a straight man or maybe to you know it it it into into Canada of his character he went to jail he he's kind of like this Charlie Brown character that no matter how pathetic he is at least he's trying\nAnd can you give him an art where he tries to redeem itself even if he makes things worse and and and I\nAnd I thought they would kill me you know for say\nI didn't want to come off complaining and by that time also is a stressful time cause Donna\nGlover had just left the show so I was self aware that okay I don't want to pile on right now you know and he sent me the nicest email back and I get a kind of get emotional thinking about it because he he said you know he's explained why I'm doing all these obvious jokes and these are eating a pine cone sandwich because what we're doing this weird David Fincher like episodes\nWere looking for the after I added up a shooting in like in the style of seven\nAnd the EU is is that your character has the only two guaranteed last in the show and that's kind of your job on the show to get them guaranteed last you know that's your device and as an actor I understand it was not offended by that and if in fact in for me he goes please eat this pine cone sandwich for uncle Dan and ... and I promise the next episode\nI don't write you a monologue to even where you will you'll cry in the scene and even your daughters will go wow your father has my my dad has amazing acting range\nAnd I said to myself well not that good and accurate [laughter] trying to feed and then I literally he wrote in Monterey so now I'm an hour right in Mali where you're going to cry camera going to have this amazing art\nAnd I was like well and I even told people like I Can't I I'm not that good an actor and then uh my monologue and every word and my script the next episode was the email was that I wrote with my words that I wrote him that you know oh man and\nA food and I mean I just started crying I just I mean the ... the un everywhere I read was for me talking about my ... Mehta upon meta and honestly that's why our community so much because it it made me a better after\nYou know I feel like we're coming across so many different moment yeah that that most doctors would dream of you know yeah I had the opportunity\nI've already lived heading lifetimes I mean I already political I find as a doctor and\nSo I really do feel the rest of my career really the rest of my life quite frankly just just a bonus so when I'm doing standup I feel like this is the year that I've come full circle and I think it's no coincidence I kind of want to go back full circle I didn't calling my Netflix special which I just shot a week and a half\nAgo calling full circle at the comedy club where I where my wife or his army do comedy at the Pasadena ice house and so\nI feel like this year and it's also directed by John Cho crazy Rich Asians he just directed my Netflix special so there's all this whole circle elements that I'm having a play and uh you know I feel like it's this this feels right that I'm doing this right now and and it it just kind of where\n'cause kids when you're doing this career where you know there there was always this cruise kind of a rat race you ... with my next move and I really don't know I just only one now I don't want to be happy doing what I'm doing and\nBut I feel like the Senate sending an email that Dan Herman I feel like taking that opportunity and the hangover even though the two people to be they get to really take a chance there and to quit your job as a doctor and like I feel like there's there's advice there there's there's a model there for creative people you know\nBe naked in a movie you can get famous and millions of dollars and um and all and complain about your part like any TV out here um [noise] thank you very much [laughter] I really think\nThere is to me I think my life has been about going with the flow but just take I\nI Do my manager is that as my longtime Andrew I worked with for Fifteen Years and uh and he said you you always make the most of what ever opportunities given it could be even on crazy Rich Asians that was an afterthought I look at my acting exercises in my acting roles as like okay make the most out of it and uh\nDo it for you like to do it for therapeutic reasons it just helped me it's better to shoot a movie like crazy Rich Asians and then be at home like feeling sorry for myself you know so I feel like there's\nI guess the message is to just keep moving forward I guess it's been nice talking to you and I so I can think of so much about them\nFor [noise]\nWhy I Do that was my conversation with Ken Jon comedian actor and Dr ...
