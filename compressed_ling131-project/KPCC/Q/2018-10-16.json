Google has canceled plans to attend to Saudi investment conference after the disappearance of well known Saudi journalist ... NPR's Emily Sullivan reports\nMy attention for like [noise] um but a fellow was a diagnosis Ike ... trick syndrome it was morbid jealousy so it seemed to me that a fellow have become a mythic an archetype\nAnd I wondered what the question that arose with me was\nWho would he be from my perspective because all of the portraits of them were written by people who were not of African descent and I thought he would he be in my community does he really exist and looking around I Believe I found him\nI Want to find out more about your fellow here at tag on he's been played by boat Dixon who many in the beginning he barely speaks we have him just confessing to having fall in love with Mona and he's leaving his partner of nine years\nAnd she's devastated originally at Griffith giving a fantastic performance say everybody in that cast just gave me the chills they were ... I don't feel like I saw a piece of eater I feel like I was in their world with them so here we are with them and bow Dixon\nIs our Othello and he's so complicated and conflicted tell us a little bit of the story of your fellow well I think that\nUh when I started to explore who have fellow laws and I\nCame across this on fellow in a contemporary setting [noise]\nWhat I realized is there was a perspective I was in from and there was another voice it was as if I was seeing him through the eyes of someone else and so I started to figure out who's RAs are these and who I came across was his first wife when we first\n... when we were first introduced to a fellow in ... he's a man in his late forties early fifties he talks in fact one of the things that really attracts a a a detriment or to him is the fact that he's been through your mentors\nSo I wondered well who's he been have you never fallen in love [noise] when I started to look at who this man was in the contemporary world and I started to see him through the eyes of another character I realized\nThis this was his first wife his first love\nAnd I started to be really interested in her what was her story of yes they break up people break up but uh was something unusual was there something intriguing was or something that I'm pulled my attention and that was\nWhy did you follow than this this pair this pair in that moment of of breaking up a devastating breakup she's devastated and every word that she delivers she's devastated\nAnd we have heard we received this story play out in Eighteen sixty yeah in the Nineteen twenties and then in modern day which for you at that time was the mid nineties why did you choose those three time period\nI think we're free time periods of there because they are very important very significant in terms of a black\nHistory in North America so Eighteen sixties and that that's just\nPrior to civil war to be much patient proclamation of like Nineteen twenty eight in Harlem or that the Harlem Renaissance and contemporary Arab looks play a set up a corner of Malcolm X and Martin Luther king boulevards an actual place which is a one hundred and twenty fifth street\nAnd Linux in New York's in New York City um and I really uh I really wanted to\nLook at my real question was how does race get into my bedroom [noise] how does race affect every aspect of a breakup\nAnd men of further to how does race affect me every day people break up all the time and you know uh I Love a great a tragedy like anyone else but when you layer other aspects on top of it how does it affect somebody and\nAt the heart of it uh I was looking at\nWhat are the psychological effects of four hundred years of white supremacy I'm a psych ease of people of African descent\nWhen it really does enter their bedroom they are arguing with such energy and they go from the emotional and personal right to the political and the division between them and it was sort of widens on stage in front of you\nIf you are just tuning in you're listening to ... and for Tom power and I'm speaking with play right Janet fears about her play Harlem do at a prequel to Shakespeare's Othello\nJanet only have a few minutes left I really want to ask you this just debuted in Nineteen Ninety seven at one that Governor generals literacy award back then why was now the right time to revisit it\n[noise] um it's interesting because ah the plays Twenty one years old it's grown up as an adult and yet\nTwenty one years later here we are and I wonder if the [noise] the society we live in has not gone backwards\nI feel the uh there are lots of questions not being posed around race around gender and I think or these questions are being dismissed and I think raising them now [noise] it's not only valid\nIsn't necessary it's interesting you set up our two main protagonists there they have daily or civil ... who as is tormented by injustice and oppression is highly articulate about the struggle and you have her partner of nearly a decade\nWho really wants to integrate she see that I think almost as ... herself but he really just wants to blend in and be part of the world be accepted eases word accepted and I'm Wondering why you place that this tension between them this this growing divide between them and I get lots of reasons\nSo cornered Malcolm X and Martin Luther king not because of who these men were because later in life they believed very close to similar things a lot of ... in Harlem exactly where the place that\nAnd I think that I wanted to look at the breadth of a kind of a idealized or a fictionalized blackness I Want to look at an interpretation is and I wanted to look at a nationalist and anybody can fall in love with anybody but what if these two people fall in love\nAnd I think that you know they talk about politics they talk about their feelings but for some people politics are ... rhetoric\nBut for other people it's their lives\nBlackness is not among all if black people talk all agree white people don't all agree uh Asian people don't all agree but sometimes because uh our stories are not written by us we're\nKind of seen as this block so here's the black perspective or here's the black voice when there are multiple black voices and I wanted to look at multiple black voices\nTo want to ask you what you like audiences to leave the theater with I Know that I left with a head full of thoughts as scenes\nUm especially because the performances are so beautifully I felt like I was on on stage with them just experiencing it with them but you left us with so much to work with as you say there is that political but there was also so much personal really personal drama unfolding between us what is it that you wanted audiences to leave the theater with one\nOf the additional things that there is no place to live cello in a base that emotionally accompany the story I think for me there are three important things in terms of art\nYou know I think that that education entertainment and entrapment if a story a narrative can educate an audience if a narrative a play can entertain an audience and if\nA story a narrative a play a show a film can in Chad an audience if you can do all three [noise]\nThat would make me happy if I even began to approach those and\nMy work thank you very much for being here today and telling me a little bit about your story such a pleasure thank you very much I've been speaking with Janet ... she's the creator of the award winning play Harlan do at its onstage now at Toronto's tag on theater the main space and

J. E. R. B. L. A. dot com\n[noise] you're listening you on the radio one serious eggs every one sixty nine NPR I public radio international I'm way low in for\nWell here's a question I'm sure every directorate Hollywood has grappled with at one point or another\nHe's like a factory worker but the entire factories just him and he's just writing and writing and writing and has been for decades um and I also agree that his prose as the best I Am not a big fan of\nHis actual work but yeah like he has these really interesting ideas for movies and because his um books don't deal as much with the internal lives of its characters the premise is and the scenarios and the situations are much more remarkable and memorable\nWhen the American film and TV industry is of average more than two Stephen King adaptations per year since Nineteen Seventy six there's been a bit of a ship lately last year for the first time there were more than five different king adaptations releasing the same year Tina why do you think there's this bike right now\n[laughter] my cynical take is that um the outside world is extremely scary and difficult to deal with it's hard to read the news every day but we still want entertainment and ah going into a movie theater and\nI'm sitting down and being scared um is a much safer way of dealing with\nStuff that yeah it's interesting the way that you put that you have the safer fear the safer near exactly\n'cause you can walk out of that movie theater and still be alive and safe and knowing that everything has gone back to normal\nWhat do you think John what what is the fascination with Stephen king's world\nThe response to that I mean I Know when the academic literature Ron horror films of called recreational terrorists see what's going on a rollercoaster ride you could frightened yourself but in a way that's manageable and you don't actually have the threat of death [laughter]\nUm but I think more to the point these days and maybe this was even more surgical by different that everything's gr game and the way that everything's been remade re adapted increased quip the streams troops to return what does that say about creativity right now [noise]\nWell I again I I I Would hasten to say if it's any worse or better than the stream print that happened in other genres or another mediums a you know like some of the Stephen King stuff that's been re adapted in recent years like I felt the new movie was very good and fond and scary\nUh then there's been other stuff that was not so good and a ... again I think that's always gonna be the case\nYeah what about you yeah I mean just the fact that there are so many adaptations coming out like not all of them are going to be great and that is true if you look at the number of films and TV shows that have been created a with with king's sad story\nWith pet cemetery it's always nice to be drawn let's go to work [laughter]\nI mean really perfect for that it's been a pleasure to have both of you here thank you very much or like you I have been joined by Tina than yet and ... who's a regular contributor to the national post John Stanley writes about film for publication cyclical the

on the radio one serious ... public radio international I ... in for Tom our\nWell here is a question for you how many times today have you looked at your phone that is one of many themes you're about to hear about on the new record from Aftab\nYes we cannot say their full name on the radio but you might also remember them because they were the hard core band that won the ... music pride in two thousand nine and it probably best known for making music this sounds like this [noise]\n\nThose are out there from asked a that was from their last record glass boys released\nFour years ago and the band unveiled their new album does your dreams and along with topics like social media and its impact on our culture the record also brings is a really different sounds it a hardcore band and they loved switching things up for their fans you'll hear and this one to just go there and sixty pop\nBut like a lot of their previous albums you'll still find pretty hardcore punk songs in the next haven't completely deserted who they are they're just trying a little bit of new territory\nDamon Abraham Mike ... and ... they piled into the studio with Tom power and the story um I just make you think about all that social media that you're plugged into the almost the moment the Damien Abraham sat down in the studio with Tom he\nAdmitted this record almost never saw the light of day once ... finished their last album she thought they might actually be done\n... was was really kind of the like and it was really bad about about it was like you know are certainly be under my\nNeed to be creative and the bad boy do I think what was his ultimate compromise you know Mike ... who is crazy elaborate thing and I'm like mom I don't have any interest in doing that I Want to do a strip down ... to ...\nAnd with with after it's impossible to get a straight a straightforward are correct\nAnd we got ... which I I Do like that record I Do stand by that being like if I never write another album where the lyrics again in my life\nI said everything I wanted to say on that record you know I think by between all the records I mean but like all the things that I felt I haven't said this yet I think I said the ... so you had to be had a period at the end of that sentence and I think so yeah I felt like a fellow at the end of a chapter in a in a big way like and I think", "year": "2018",
