ties\nHere's the thing she knows you know her as best as she's written a new book about what it means to be on famous Monday October first coming up on cue\n\nLive from NPR News in Washington ... democratic leaders in Congress are demanding transparency in the extended background investigation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer says he wants to the White House to release its guidance on the FBI probe and to report the outcome\nTwenty three year old Leonard Cohen [laughter] amazing and how great of that but ah he's\nAlways had such an incredible spark and even do a you know the the flame was tarnished and burned in different capacities and different levels of the woods so inevitable about him is a well as what you hear when you hear him\nThere's there's a certain irony there you know he says I Want to take it out of the classrooms I Want to bring it back to the hipsters and the booze or the nightclubs and of course he ends up becoming sort of canonized into poetry edition by his letter Cohen's Bones Are are taught in classrooms now it's\nExtraordinary to see that he was actually a rabbi like many people in his family you know there was a quite a few rabbis some heavy rabbis and the family and\nHe didn't go into that line of work he went into a something rather different that we all know but he did have that kind of rabbinical quality to this is a man whose work has a is being studied no across university campuses globally\nWhose work has been replaced even in rabbinical studies you know liturgy go studies it's a ... straw ordinary what he's done and when I Do happen to consult his work\nOutside of the heartstrings that are pulled to marvel at how sparkling the language is always was and even when you hear at twenty three year old version of him and it it still somehow piqued my interest in fact that he's always been some kind of a peacock when it comes to language\nIt can't be there eight us to talk about your father after his pet but on the talk about your father's meaning an answer all these questions but I I didn't want to go back to something that you said earlier about you know to do not disturb emails and that was something that jumped out of me about your forward to the book is he was working when he was very ill he was living with great pain\nWhy do you think he was pushing towards this work right up until the end\nI think his work invites you into your own inner life because it takes in her life so seriously I think that uh he knew that at the end of his life she was writing on some kind of mysterious wind in in the grace of of the occasion\nAnd the urgency of his of his frailty\nWhen I see the grace of the occasion I mean he recognized that it's not uncommon for a poet\nI'm In a in a songwriter to become more and more and more popular as they grow older and he went through an incredible amount of anonymity given his iconic status\nAnd emerged after having suffered a economic crises I'm at the top of his game at the end of his life and they're not that many examples of that so he was in recognition of this mysterious wind that ah that he was lifted by\nYou mentioned the the economic crises I Want to play another clip from a Norwegian talk show called first and last in two thousand seven this is your father talking about the aftermath of losing much of his life savings to a manager who embezzled millions from him this is why you have to say\nAs a matter of fact I was fast approaching the situation when I Would put my car to the ATM machine and nothing would come out and you're still don't have much money they don't have to do that too much no no it's quite happy with it [laughter]\nSo you know I I mean I don't recommend this as a spiritual exercise [noise]\nBut if it happens to do a lot of lot of very important information is delivered\nYour heart for instance I I think that every parent would wait for this to happen my son said to me\nThey said that do whatever you have to do on the legal side too you know take care of the situation but that don't worry about us we've had a good life and we can take care of ourselves so\nMuch wonderful information came my way\nThis letter calling it two thousand seven to remember that conversation you're talking about their Adam\nOh of course it was a matter of great pride for his son to be able to tell his father hey man you've done even more than exonerated yourself in terms of generosity to us please don't let us burden you any further and this is such a mighty\nMighty complication to uh to negotiate and to handle the last thing we want to be as an extra layer of concern\nI'm Adam I Want to play a little bit of of one of your own songs now a no no please don't do that I'm going to do it

I I can only think of the um the super bowl is being a program that can get those kinds of numbers now\nSo I Want to pay you a clip this is from Nineteen eighty three family ties have been on for less than a year you're Seventeen years old and this is you on the CBC take a listen\nWhat's it like see now that I'm you're famous for being recognized really sure [laughter]\nAnyways [laughter] it's when people say oh it must be nice to do recognize you say it's nice when they do and it's nice and they don't [noise] you\nKnow some of his name now he got to be nice and because you are public property you you cannot you expose yourself some halogen you belong to them and and it's hard to sign their autographs passing them whatever 'cause you you brought that on yourself\nTo two things there I have and all that weight first of all I got to tell you that's fantastic when you first then you're going to do a clip and family ties and I thought wow somebody's going to play a clip from the show but you did the right thing you actually tell you something that was about fame that I don't\nPaul saying that now in the book and which is probably what you're going to get into I poo poo that whole attitude of like you owe it to everybody OK sorry go on that was great clip\nWasn't my attention to to contradict anything in the book I should say so that eighty three you're Seventeen years old age you laugh at the same famous like oh my God I I mean you say the words your public property and you brought it on yourself how does how does hearing that make you feel now\n[noise] well you know I Do absolutely remember at the time and um you know I'm sure there are others that feel this way to that\nBecause it was so new to this I I just felt and because families has such a great experience and ... I Love all those people I did feel that every time I went out I was a representative of that show and I was a representative of paramount studios you know the producers of the show and a and NBC the network that air the show\nSo now remember I'm Seventeen there the show's been on for a year if that\nSo yes I I don't recall saying that but I Do recall feeling that it was it was an obligation that I I assumed I just assumed it was an obligation and that wasn't anywhere near the the height of the same that um that presented itself later\nSo I Want to compare and contrast that with something that just happened four years later so this is another clip ... Arsenio Hall show in eighty seven\nYou can kind of ... always has the gambling you lazy people always want to ... how do you let you hear it on how do you have ... um\n... friends' houses or during ... and go to a hundred and really don't get 'em don't show\nI recently went to Rio de Janeiro and it was an incredible feelings misery times when you cannot have anyone watching when I'm doing I got an tables or dance or you would be okay nobody we can use it as long as there was no end in ...\nSo that's just in the basement of the earth and the whole show in eighty seven so again you're very famous at that point tabloid stories a lot and you're saying that the only places you can relax or your friends' houses or out of the country I have to say reading the book I'm listening to that clip it sounds like you had doubts about fame even then\nWell Dow it's I mean it's it's just something that is on you\nThere's no it's not like an amusement park ride where there's like an exit just before you you know sit down in the car that's going to take you through the rollercoaster you're you're on the roller coaster\nBefore you know what's happening yeah so you really just have to you know check the security of your seatbelt and just not fall out while it goes through the you know the lived looper are down a very steep\nDecline you just hold on I Want to\nContinue on a little bit about your journey hair so in the book you talk about people calling you Mallory the name of your character on family ties I Want to point out that when we booked this interview I was talking to people in the office and some people came up to meet people who don't work on the show became a comment to me is that I heard you have Mallory on\nUm I I I guess I wasn't around ah when the show's on but or or I I ... I didn't have that same I'm I'm excited to talk to you but then I read in your book that there's a time where a bouncer won't let you into a bar even though you're of age but Mallory is into legal drinking age [noise]\nYou know is it frustrating for you to have yourself so intertwined with this character can can you understand why people would do that\n[noise] doing the price for this book is sort of a\nA meta performance art epilogue to the book and I didn't answer your question when when you when you say oh people say oh is Mallory going to be on the show\nWhat it does to me and to to people generally not just the performers but when something is brought up that was your most popular thing that and I go into in the chapter called inadequacies in my book\nEverything you ever do will be compared or will not rank rather relative to the high level of popularity or fame\nOf whatever it is you did that you were most well known for and it makes it does make the individual feel like not seen it all like\nIt'd be like if somebody was a a really good a foot you know a high school football champ and and everybody knew who they were and then\nLater in life you know they just sort of a normal sales job and maybe the thing they're most proud of recently as they've they've really honed their carpentry skills and they they built an addition on their home themselves but every time they see their friends in particularly their old friends\nAnd they say you know when you were such a rat quarterback and then the guy can be sitting there\nThinking what the hell like\nYour most well known thing is not necessary is I'm not necessarily the most interesting thing you've ever done so I Do go into that in the book like\nWith regards to fame like wow you used to be I mean people and say this exactly but when they would say things like what are you up to now or you know it it it is them saying\nBy the feeling is we gave you this and you've squandered it and were upset\nAbout that I should say the Justinian or speaking with Justin Bateman she's an actor writer director producer would argue about her new book fame I'm so far we've been talking about what it's like the game fame I but we were just talking a little bit about what happens when it switched from you know we started this interview by asking do you remember the moment\nWhere you realize you were famous and I want to continue on a on a journey and ask and I probably I Can't imagine him out I Can't believe I'm asking this buddy but do you remember the moment you realized that we're slipping but you were getting less famous oh sure and I and I'll\nTell you I'm I'm very happy to talk about the backside of fame I think that's actually the most interesting part of my book because it's talked about so infrequently by by anybody who's who's experienced fame [noise]\nUm [noise] so\nWhen it starts flipping I guess you notice it starts slipping in a similar way to realizing in the beginning that you are gaining fame or when you first realize you're gaining fame it's people are listening more intently to you they are\nThey're approaching you more frequently of course they're being far more accommodating and part of use like this is weird what just happened especially when you're in a situation where they don't recognize you at first and you get sort of their normal\nTreatment and then they realized who you are and everything shifts\nThe way they treat you changes almost instantly\nAnd then when it starts that started slipping\nThat's when you first notice it and and not to make it sound like\nYou like an entitlement thing like you expect to be treated like that yeah but you are I'm prepared to your rather prepared to deal with being overly accommodated you're prepared to deal with that and then when somebody when it becomes intermittent you're like\nOh I'm and I do I need to be prepared to deal with this or do I need to just can I just relax and feel like maybe they don't recognize me and it's all about\nHow can I be set up to deal with what you're going to come out in the ... and when it started fading almost completely I had to keep telling myself or made it better for me if I just said I'm not famous enough ... and not famous at all it all at all\nAnd then if somebody did recognize your did try to overly accommodate me I could just see it as as bizarre behavior\nDo you have a different perspective on it because you were in the\nYou were in it\nIn writing this book than people who could write about fame and more of an edict way like from the third party perspective\nUh absolutely I don't I and and there are you know a lot of books written on fame you know I'm a lot of them take a and historical approach um a lot of them seem to take a I'm sort of a than approach like\nHear all these different famous people and this is this is why I like them this is why we like them or do these and these were my few encounters with some of the famous people but what I really wanted to do is\nBring the reader in to the whole experience the whole life cycle and not just hey here's what it's like to be famous but really here's what this entire life cycle is like and\nAnd submit to the reader that that fame as a social construct and I I dropped parallel between this", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Q", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "02"}
