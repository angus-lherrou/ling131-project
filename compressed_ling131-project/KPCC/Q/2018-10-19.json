Stevens President Trump says he might send troops to the southern border if a caravan of mostly Honduran migrants reaches the United states Trump told a campaign rally in Montana that Republicans are taking up the cause of border security without support from Democrats\nSo if I were to play those four notes with four fingers as you would expect a pianist to do I have four notes to play it I'm going to line up my hand and I'll play with ... put my arm and a very strange position as well so the ... have this trick where the finger falls from a black no to the white note so when I'm playing these four notes [noise]\nIn fact the first two are played with one single finger because it's dropping from this is really nerdy 'cause it's when your finger drops from a black to white key\nThey actually do that with a single finger that means something that can play super fast\nAnd if I tried to do it in the way you'd expect my arm would be in a really difficult position\nAnd I wouldn't be able to be nearly as precise\nRight playful with it so you know to accomplish entertainment there's a lot of technique that goes into it but you want that\nTechnique to mostly be invisible so you can maintain that that sort of playfulness and now we're lifting the curtain here and the radio of course we're living in an open source era so if you feel something it's always nice to analyze it when I when I Do a video on YouTube where I\nI might try to explain the music theory behind a desk punk song and\nAt first is because I Love the song it passes the goose bumps test and then I'm interested to what what might be behind it that gives me those goose bumps what were your earliest memories of sitting at the piano\nWell with my strict grandfather who was as I said all about respect for the composer and not losing touch with I guess his sort of European culture that he was forced to leave he was a Hungarian Jew and and left\nNone of his own free will he was sort of forced to leave for survival and I think he wanted his grandchildren too you know not lose touch with that so\nI had a very early age I think age three that was put in front of the piano and told that this was an important place to be right and then of course next to that was the beginning of much music and watching Leno Ritchie dance on the ceiling and saying that looks fun and I guess my whole career has been trying to bridge that gap\n... what what was the first piece as you were claiming studies replaying yeah I mean of course there's you know this ... I had to play\n\nThe prelude in the un actually own solo piano three my new album I did a prelude and see sharp major\n[noise] and again that's another iconic piece of music that you\nHear a sort of you know through the wall of some apartment because some kids learning it and you sort of ceased to be able to judge it as a piece of music and those pieces really interest me pieces of music that take on more than just their own musical information might become sort of part of the culture\nAnd uh what else did I play\nA lot of the um let me just with my brother I can remember that one you know\n... oh yeah yeah well it's a pretty good minor on but it is but in\nI was there and a pivotal moment was there a moment where you realize you could bridge these two worlds in the piano or is that still quest you're um\n[noise] it was it was entertaining my family you know and entertain my family\nWas coming at the end I think of many hours spent alone at the piano and then sort of presenting the fruits of that labor to my family I was like this is very interesting I was very disciplined\nFor some hours to prepare something I was a good student I was hard on myself but then came the moment where I played it for my family and they laughed and they they smiled at me and I felt like I had value and I suddenly realized what all that preparation was four and I think\nThat might be also what I'm trying to get across in my music school to\nDeserve a tour that I started yes about one year ago and I sort of realized you know they call it being a ham for a reason and friendships bet descent stage beast in German it's ... which means like us out of the stage\nAnd I'm not surprised that these metaphors have to do with letting the animal loved you prepare and disciplined but you you you let go and execution when you're finally in front of people you aren't an artist anymore you are an entertainer I suppose that's the sort of\nA ... without being able to put the words on at the time I felt that difference between the solitude\nAnd the way that my brain was working in solitude to prepare and how it felt to finally get in front of my family and entertain them and I was hooked I don't really think of it as making music unless there is at least one other person listening\nIt's one reason perhaps why when I'm In the studio I have a little bit more difficulty I feel like I'm guessing and who is listening\nOne year from now someone's going to hear this album and I have no idea in which context they'll hear it it's very different from I'm On stage or I'm here in front of you Tom and I'm going to play songs for you and I'm reading you and I'm feeling you and I'm trying to create a moment between us\nYou can't really do that in the studio perhaps that's why I don't really see myself as a\nParticularly good at being in the studio would I Do happens when there's someone in front of me listening\nBut you took some time off from performing in some time off from playing in front of people it All right\nIn two thousand sixteen that took a sabbatical year that was the first time perhaps that I\nSort of realized the one thing I hadn't tried yet in Twenty years of my career is stopping getting out from the front of people despite the fact that I I excel in that situation I did want to see what it felt like to deny myself that and the pieces\nI Believe go a little deeper than perhaps the other solo piano albums which were written as part of that fast lifestyles constantly being on airplanes and trains and getting in front of people's\nBut in terms of what you were just saying about you don't necessarily consider it making music if there's not one person in front of you if you take a break them from before me did that change your relationship entirely with making music with like was that epiphany about um you don't make me made me music is not music unless it's a play for somebody did that it's\nThat than what I'm doing alone is preparing for that moment okay just met I was preparing for an entire year rather than\nIt only it only crystallized that\nIdea absolutely right I I I like\nTo say that you're an artist when you're alone but entertainer in front of people that I I was an artist for a whole year and I was a wonderful thing actually\nDid you enjoy it I kind of did [laughter]\nThat's a good life yeah I mean it [laughter] I I used to be quite hard on the word artist but drink two thousand sixteen I think I made some peace with it and I realized I Am an artist it's just that I'm an artist when I'm Alone\nDo you ever feel constrained by the piano and that you can't play sharp there or sharply or flatly um that you can't banned in the way that other strange means can\n... well yeah I mean the piano is weak it's true like this note here I'm about to head\nRight once I hit it isn't that can do to change the sound where's the human voice of course can ads are brought into and look for the blue note yeah as you're saying to play more flat more sharp however the piano compensates for this was all these little tricks you know so if you can't really you know\nFind a blue notes and you'll [noise]\nIt was just kind of look for it you know there's these two notes here is the shortest possible distance between two notes [noise]\nAnd the way it wasn't Beethoven sort of pointing out the impossibility of playing a Blue Note when he wrote this [noise]\nThere's something about the weakness of the piano that has sort of fascinated composers how can you create a kind of air that's false sense of expression you know you can't really keep notes going like you can on a on a violent where you can literally just\nKeep your hand going back and forth with the bow and you can play it on forever you can't do that with a piano because it dies but\nWith the pedal first of all you get more time\nAnd if you do this this is called ... says lightly just alternating these no sort of create the illusion of a no lasting forever [noise]\nOoh\nAnd that's why they say the piano is sort of the orchestra and when there's an opera being rehearsed and they can't afford the orchestra until the last two weeks of versus for those other six months they were ... they have a pianist is the only instruments that can credibly imitate you know rhythm [noise]\nAnd of course it can do harmony\nCan any other instrument do that I mean perhaps the guitar in some way and it's portable that's a nice advantage but truly it's perhaps the piano that has that atomic level of music and Dana plays alone you're covering all the basis of what music is supposed to be melody harmony rhythm and sound\nSo but when you when you're composing is that's satisfying I only ask because I didn't know when you're in your composition whether it be and it can do everything you want it to do\nI don't think in terms of being a pianist I'm a musician who happens to play the piano the piano is this atomic level of instrument that means that if I Want to conceive\nOf complete music the piano is just the easiest way to do it my best teachers when I was growing up were guitarists drummers they taught me about music how to tell a story through court aggressions how to leave space what is it to take all the ear of the listener these are all skills\nThat if you are stuck too much in your instrumental identity\nYou'll never learned and I think it's dangerous I think for musicians to get too caught up in their instrumental identity\nAnd yes there's different you know parts of the body that are engaged for different instruments and every instruments list has his or her own map of music viewed through the prism of that instrument\nStopped by the studio no need to wait for Hulu we got him to tell you and take you right back to the beginning\nYou know everybody's talking about the good old days\nThe good old good old days when\n\nYo man CBC was managed to go up and say man this is going to be the origin story of the books say this is the this is the story\nBut the beginning of how you know we all came together it's going to get interesting certain people one thing I realized going do life that certain people just come and go see it like great minds think alike\nGreat minds come together we grew up together we came from the streets for real but for the for most you know I grew up segregated on Staten Island and the black community in in a tight the whites database you couldn't go the other side because it was you know it was racial you know media would chase us\nOn our side then when they come on our side we chased him off our side paid in the dumpsters me was dumped the kids cause that's no we didn't ...\nPlaystations back then it was no entertainment like that so we had that come with our magic nation so we get the chalk up ... out the garbage we get to the eggs and the baseball bats and the debate that we pay tagging\nOn catching case and um cops and robbers and the girls ... double Dutch and the park and also in your favorite crushed should be over there and you'd be trying to play by catchy kids ... and the community was more or less how can I say\nWas family orientated it was rough it was a good neighborhood well by the time in the beginning there was no dogs out it was just you know we get chased around by that kids that was a little bit older than us needs to bully us into things like that and give us where do you support the arms and take our money now that that's the craziness yes I saw a crazy this\nBut it was fun growing up as a kid and Paul killed\nHad a lot of stray dogs though you had to have your ... your\nBack pocket [noise] topic was on Mondays Wednesdays Fridays the late night center would be open with kids would come into play basketball being want to be on the streets you go to send to play basketball they be playing music in there and at a time I think candy girl by new addition without\n[noise]\nMy first as a matter of fact he was dancing doing candy girl will change the method was always a dance it up you know always a big guy you know when I'm feeling down I used to be around people like that he was just always upbeat and I just maybe snow stay next to him like a like a stray dog you know\nThat was my introduction to be mass looted I Know later on we become real close and um you know\nAnd then walk on another journey pot and\nStarting black community you know started telling the wrong the genius thing about hip hop was that he was able to create music\nAnd invent something new\nAnd that's what Paul people do poverty we create things for nothing\nWould your imagination just\nWalk around a massive heart attack was you know I've worked at a rover Curtis flow with the first guy to gold gold\nHands every by\nAnd I don't know that he\nHoped for as fully as fast as four grand was it the it or we had some trouble and then later on news relative evolved to help poor multi treasures do we get busy be US dollars you had no man I was there was too many I was raised over hip hop\nAnd\nI don't know if you know damaged the damage was somebody to plug in a speakers and stuff\nAnd the equipment into the lamppost in age to set up speakers and stuff for people to dance and have a good time on the weekends and and get away from the problems and you see people out there you know the answer to the music and and that was that was I think we used to do jams and and it jams was was was where it went down in um one particular summer\nWe've run out put me down just able to park\nAnd we just so happened to be cutting down there and visit walked up and um his name his name was em rock came at the time they were saying and I'm reserve was a DJ and he was nice\nAnd we started talking and building that was my first introduction to reserve will lose I Know I didn't know he was a genius he had a great mind and he was you know he was very very intelligent for his age you me and you know we just\nClicked splits I grew up with the kid and so you know to the plate of of drugs that's where the guy\nI mean it was so much money being made from this plague but everybody was looking at so spectacular\nYou know we had people would poop chi down if you had Louisville tall woman was when no gold jewelry go bamboo poles and ... you know it just it just was our coach it was our thing man and it was a beautiful time then and then came the drama\nI got street poison\nI got three boys and because of poverty I got load into the trap of southern drugs because we've been completely broke loose poverty I mean\nAnd we used to we come from poverty and you see a means of making money\nThe temptation is too powerful so I got sucked up into that world win and to this day and pay for that you know I got convicted of of of narcotics and had had gun charges and that's going to be with me for the rest of my life case you need to have me so don't make those choices\nWhat happened was I got addicted to St money I mean and\nThat money that you receive from Huston on streets there's also an addiction must outlets so as well be why you'll do my own [noise]\nReserve house was out sanctuary [noise]\nWe wanted to get away from the guns
