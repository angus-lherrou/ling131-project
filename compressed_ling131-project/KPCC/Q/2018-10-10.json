I Know we're playing a\nVenus and I'm performing let me tell you a little secret people don't know is back then the ban was still transitioning from their two albums previous to me\nWhich were very instrumental ... orchestrated sort of like a song fusion jazz he almost there was fusion jazz very good that's what it was called back then\nAnd so I Would go out there in my Levis nobody knew who I was because I was new I Would get the sound board up I Would get all the ... up while they're playing\nThe first half of the show gets to sound just write tell the second engineer and thinking this is my Mike amusement when I Walk on I'd go back changed my clothes and the middle of a\nFeeling that way Greg would start it and I would walk on with the summer's gone she'll be there to buy the light\n[noise] shield [noise]\nSo I used to do sound before I'd walk [laughter]\nThat's how we did it back then nobody knew nobody knew\nI I Want to but I'm the reason we played that midnight special tip is not just the way back machine as you said it but it was also the kind of show that remind us of that even before you joined journey and Seventy eight\nYou were still sort of on the verge of of quitting music and and sometimes it seems like a theme throughout your career be sort of crucial moments of having to decide whether to give up or whether to so soldier on maybe give up that the term but like whether to do something else or the soldier on through music I mean ... you left journey\nTwice yeah that's interesting I mean I tried to go back to the ban and did give it a shot and then that didn't work out you know um but that's because sometimes you can't go back you know we all would like to go back to something remember what it once was but you know things change everybody changes and time moves on and\nAnd never ever as anything ever the same again you know so\nYou have to adjust yourself along the way and grow with the times or grow with the change of life in order to survive and\nI don't know I didn't really work out for us the second time I went back but I think this the time you're talking about leaving the music business before I even joined them was when the bass player in my band got killed in a car wreck just before we were about to be signed to Columbia Records\nAnd that's when I told my mom I said you know I don't think I'm supposed to be doing this I mean I keep on thinking I can but every time I get close to being knocked me back so she said don't give up something will happen I said no mom come on\nThe base where I mean he just got killed in a car wreck or I'm not supposed to do this so [noise]\nWeek or two later downhill us from Columbia Records calls me and says look I'm really sorry about that we really love Japan and we think are great but would you be interested in meeting some members of the band journey because I think they want to make a musical change and do more songs I said well\nYeah I've always loved Neal shops guitar playing so that's the beginning of that next thing I knew I was in Denver, Colorado Neal Sean I'm we wrote our first song patiently together\nAnd you were doing sounding planes into your name [laughter] but what what I find interesting with all this is that the say let's say that the first time you leave you leave journey um I read that you even\nLast passion for music in general you said you stop and enjoying music is that right\n[noise] that's true I I think after the fortunate success we had and how hard we used\nWork um I just got totally burnt out and I just started to get pi TST for for music in general I I Can't explain it except a passion I had for it wasn't there and you know band members we\nWe were not getting along that great band members don't get along sometimes you know it isn't all roses and candy I mean bands are tough a tough on each other that's what makes it work and that also with tears it apart so\nAt that point I was feeling apart from it and um I wasn't really voicing my feelings about it so when I did\nFinally say look I I don't think I can do this anymore it was a shock to them because I had not been talking about it I was just in my rope and I knew that the fans are going to be disappointed\nBut there was nothing else I could do Tom except to walk away from it and try to become comfortable in my own skin away from a lights away from the sound away from the crowds ran from the adoration that I Would just reached for my whole life\nI had to get away from it and just try to be okay ah on my own so I went back to my home town and just stayed there for a while\nBut you did you find yourself not even loving listening to music right\nI I did not listen to anything that you would remotely think I Would be listening to listen to a theory of music or ambient as it was called by then you know that's the kind of music that it was comfortable for me liquid mind things like that 'cause I didn't want to hear nobody singing and they wouldn't even know buddy playing drums 'cause I go back to work\nI just would go back into that place of\nHim not yes no okay maybe I don't know boot pretty good that's good you know my mind is like bouncing around with opinions and I I just didn't want them anymore\nIt's Steve it's interesting to talk to you because I was born I think I was born to a year you left journey for the first time so my knowledge of your music was was was those share he was like your own music and which I Love by the way it was like one of my favorite songs of all time\nUm but then when the Sopranos era don't stop believing in the finale\nThat's when I think me and a lot of people in my generation kinda caught on to you and cut onto what journey was and now there seems to be like this renewed appreciation for that time or what I find funny about that is that I I understand you were initially a little reluctant to have don't stop believing in the Sopranos finale right\nYou only from the standpoint that I I didn't want to see the entire family get whacked where the songs being played Scorsese would do that uh and I didn't know of David Chase had that in mind and since it was the end of the entire [noise]\nThe entire of an amazing run of the show um I didn't know what he was going to do so I held out simply I was the only member of the songwriting team\nOf do stop believing that held out 'cause I just wanted them to tell me what happens I promise I won't tell nobody so Thursday for thirty that evening I get\nThe phone call okay this is what ... said pointed to him but they didn't tell me what to block [noise]\nI got enough for what was going on to know that okay you can do it and it aired that Sunday after that Thursday I did hold out 'cause I I just wanted to make sure that nobody you know was getting whacked\nI Can't believe you had to carry that secret if you're just tuning in my name's Tom power you're listening to us speaking with Steve Perry or you might know him from journey but I'm speaking about his first solo album in twenty four years it's called traces such I've listened to this song is called no more crime [noise]\nThat is the Perry was Sonoma crying from his new album traces or Steve I I understand that might be difficult for you to talk about and I only want you to talk about it as much as you as you feel comfortable doing so he might have been a big reason why a new album even exist as the relationship you have with a woman named Kelly Nash\nWho sadly passed away in two thousand twelve says is to tell me a little bit about Kelly how did she inspired you\nWell I'll tell you something interesting as she was a a French Canadian girl and um her mother was from Canada yeah um and um\nI saw her for the first time on a lifetime network special the petty Jake as my friend was directing called five and I saw sitting in this scene\nI asked petty who she was she was not an actress she's just a PHD psychologist that has struggled with cancer and since the theme of the show is about cancer I put real patients on the set and I said well do\nYou have her number or her her email 'cause I don't do that separate but it looked at me funny I said yeah I I'd like you to send an email for me please and she said yeah I'll send up but\nThere is something I Need to tell you first I said well what's that she said well she was in remission but they came back and [noise] um\nIt's her bones and she's struggling for her life right now and\nI just thought oh man I don't know what to do now I I just there was something about her when I saw that just went through it jumped out at me I can explain that was a connection and the next thing I Know I'm looking at Patti should send it send email she sends it so I sit on pins and needles for two weeks\nWaiting for her to get back to keep badgering poor Patty and she's ... and I you know so finally kill you got back to her in one night she got back to me an email gave me her phone number so I called her and um\nWe were talking we started about six thirty at night we talk till midnight and then I remember June\nWe always put on an annual Christmas show and I think one of the things I discovered about when writing this book which is already suspected was that I Do tend to take myself a tattoo seriously and think that I may be a little bit more important than I actually ended and and it's only when you're a kid and\nRealizing like oh you know this is my this is my masterpiece my um you know Christmas magic a tale of dreams coming through and you know it's not as good if you think it is and your family is so devoted and your parents are so patient with you and I don't think that my parents or\nMy friends' parents or my grandmother necessarily enjoy the show but they sat through\nThat again I think that's real you know kind of normal you know for kids to have to create things and think they're the greatest things in the world however like I don't know many kids who made something like this [noise]\nYou know he\nWas just I I don't\nKnow why you have family\nThere\nWhat if everybody what that is\nThat was a clip from I'm a horror movie that we made when we were eight or so maybe twelve I Can't remember on called the man under the stairs and it was horrifying tale about a man played by my younger sister carry\nOn who lived under the stairs we were doing construction or my parents were doing construction on as of the time so there wasn't opening under the stairs or carry could go definitely dangerous I'm sure there were nails everywhere\nUm and I remember from the clip you just played being so I'm conscious of the fact that I needed to make a dramatic turn between not believing Katie\nAnd asking if you talk to mom about this and like and being shored and take that moment and [laughter]\nAnd feeling like that was you know a critical moment in the film\nYou're going to write in the book about coming out of college and starting out in the comedy industry and you you read particular ... poignantly about your time in New York where you were holding down\nOdd jobs are in breaking in to the improv scene and the way you write about it is definitely funnier if definitely lighthearted but I I get the feeling that it was actually pretty serious kind of a pivotal moment in your life [noise]\nI'm Glad that you've got that impression one of the things in this book I feel like ... you know I erred on the side of keeping it lighter but I definitely think that that period you just described as it is for so many people I think who are making a new start or changing\nI'm a tracks are beginning a new phase of like it can be totally depressing and demoralizing and very difficult so\nI remember like ordering um Chinese food at the\nAt at a Chinese restaurant down the street in the middle of the day and feeling like hey I shouldn't be spending money on takeout and B why am I eating Chinese food alone in the middle of a sunny day like I should be at work I should be performing I should be doing something I just felt so\nDepressed I have more challenging for me than adolescence because ah for the first time in my life I wasn't sure where I was going\nBut I Want to make sure people know that it wasn't like you were saying that any Chinese food\nAll day every day oh correct like thank you for clarifying me because I have a lot of Chinese food yeah and and be the one thing I get from the books that you have to take and credible perseverance you write that you sent in over a hundred headlined suggestions into the onion\nOr the ... news magazine the onion because as a public radio show and they say that\nFor you heard back from them so what drives you she submitting ideas even when you don't get any feedback for so long\nI don't know now that is maybe that's more U.S I mean I Would say that of course I think there's the um element of\nWanting to say that you did it wanting to win in a way of wanting to feel like okay well I I set my\nSights on this and I want to see it through I think there's there's that element wanting to finish a project in that case if it is okay I'm going to keep submitting headlines until either they told me to stop or they put one in the newspaper and I guess\nI quit plenty of things but I but I think something that you care that strongly about is worth um is worth the perseverance\nIf you're just tending and you're listening to Q. I speaking with every camper she started an unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt on Netflix she's written a memoir called my squirrel days continuing on his\nPast you meet loan Michael's and you try ever SNL but you you don't get it your dishes for parks and rec you don't get that either the these are all dream jobs for people who work in kind of comedy that you're working and I'm sure at the moment you were a little bombed out\nBut you don't seem as long as he could have been like it doesn't feel like as much of a disaster as it was for you\nOh I'm Glad it comes across that way I remember doing a sketch on late night with Conan O'Brien on years before auditioning for Saturday Night live and the sketch was cut and I I just remember crying and I do sound like I\nAm clinically depressed but neither his mom in the early or are you where you're at the very intense for a day or two and then it passes but I so clearly remember a hike they hate me something I did I Do it this is personal\nAnd then once you work at you know those shows are have more experience in any field you realize oh no no no none of this is personal the the stuff happens move on but I Do think it's a matter of\nMy my I think a policy maybe is absolutely indulge that feeling of of feeling just completely destroyed but then like let it out but then you know you do have to move on because there is no other choice\nA camper and where I Know your best and I have to admit that I've I've been kind of holding it in this entire time 'cause yeah one thing I've learned about being a someone who does this kind of job yet is that you got to not say these things right away short because you don't want to be that guy correct but um\nI think I watched the office every day\nI'm so happy to hear that you should have said that right away but I understand\nIt every day it's good\nSo you're a fan of the show before you got cast in it which is a beautiful thing because a this is kind of your first really big acting role um but also you were coming into such a well loved cast and an established cats at the same time so it must have been both beautiful and scary yeah\nYes scary in the sense of you basically can only you can only keep the office at its current level or you can bring it down like you're not going to make their show any better but I just don't mess up\nThis beautiful thing that they have so it is of eleven show and it is and and everyone on that show several of the ... that part was nerve wracking I think but also\nI Am the luckiest person on the planet because that show I Can't I Can't think of another show that you would have rather they would have been um more fantastic place to come in into in the in the middle of their series I was able to like enter their magic show and I I\nI'm incredibly lucky that I got that chance because they they really did all the hard work and then I got to step in and\nYeah which is which is sort of the opposite experience for ... for unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt because this is a situation with Tina Fey basically pair makes a show for you and and you haven't really been a lead before is what was that experience like just been chosen with them\nI Know so far as I'm an anxious person so that entire thing well maybe continues to be nervous [laughter] no I never know what's going to have an although I Know now I mean the show is that a sadly ending but I think the experience of going from\nI mention this in the book was number Eighteen on the call sheet which is the piece of paper that actors and crew members get ah it's it ... it it tells you what the you know plan is for the day and I was number Eighteen on the Catholic which is pretty low down and they do kind of do it in terms of rank so going from that to them being the lead on his show\n'em so scary because I wasn't sure I was completely prepared well qualified to do such a thing and one thing I was very worried about was um [noise]\n... me in a similar way to uh Aaron because they share some characteristics but they're but they're back stories are widely different and also I think they're um\nThey're they're global outlooks might be a little bit different and so um I I ... the first season I was very concerned about that and I think I mentioned it's you know once and she said oh I'm not I'm not worried [laughter] [laughter]\nShe's really been speaking with a camera on us that can be shipped over a\nAbout her new book my ... and and definitely it's a it's a lovely fun book to read but there's a quote here in your book you write that you were quote an obedient person in real life so it's therapeutic to play women who were slightly unhinged onstage\nYes um [noise] and you know I was thinking about that a lot and that particular line I'm over the past couple of weeks because I'm\nNot going to political women are so angry right now and I've been thinking about you know and people have been encouraging women to demonstrate that anger rather than keep it and and I think that in playing characters who are on hand to do a let their anger\nOut that there's something free in that and I play a lot of characters who are maybe more um buttoned up or or just keep those emotions a little bit um\nDown low and and then when they do rise to the service I think that's very um I think it's cathartic for me but it's also fun to see those characters let it out\nOr do
