I'd I'd made the decision very early on that I really cared more about being a good singer and delivering\nA good show to my audience than any other stuff and the other part in any of that stuff and uh\nI just had to do something because this was this was getting so out of hand now this was going to destroy this wonderful machine we've kind of put together\nThat reminds me of a line in the autobiography um that really jumped out of me Roger you write so many times in my life I've had to be tough with people stuck on drugs\nAre the ones I was tough with are still hear the ones where I wasn't tough enough didn't make it I mean I mean that's that's a lot for you to carry around man needs to people who made their own choices in their life have you made peace with that\nWell among these just saying like it was because he knows days we knew very little about you know rehabilitation we knew very little about it I I and I was you know groups that you can join to get help\nAh we were I was floundering um we will roll floundering watching these self destruct it was a very painful\nUm and ah\nI just wish I had to I don't know how I Would have done it and maybe it's just deemed to be how it ended up but I sometimes wish we could have done more and I'm certainly think without management to who ended up as a weight loss ... land but for instance\nA food food drugs\nUm we could have dumb mold but we didn't know he knows dies we completely ignorant of how to get help\nYeah it's it's it's a great the bunk ... in some ways of of of some of the myths around the excesses of rock and roll you know for\nSome people loved it I mean I just felt ostracized from that will be you know I used to the early sixties I used to we we used to hang around that same clown systems the Beatles Jimi Hendrix so everyone just to see each other quite regularly in the clubs\nBut then when the drugs so to kick in ... you know the serious drug store to kick in\nPre ... ... ... I'm going to groups and they'd be they'd be the future didn't and it'd be the majority the deeds and the majority the deed became very boring to the few if you didn't have and probably vice versa\nYeah right right I mean I mean you talk about how and you ... you're right and it's still quite candidly about how you kind of we're expecting that phone call about Keith Moon for years before you actually got it\nThat's yes that's that's that's true I mean he had some you seem to have nine lives and uh there were so many times when you should kind of all of them died\nUm for for what he'd done ... trying to pull through it but then the fact that the ... that kind of been gone that kind of destructive behavior been solved out of control for probably\nThe last four years of his life but when he did finally come he just kind of made it more shocking and I I don't know what it was but it you will still be bounce back and then one day he didn't\nKnow they still think about um\nOh yeah I mean I'm working on a film projects\nAt the moment now I've been working on for Thirty years because I've got a clear idea of a film and how I wanted to be about Keith Moon and it won't be karaoke\nIt won't be you know what he he was he was an extraordinary character some ... characters I've never met anyone in my life come close to he was absolutely student ...\nYou know ... reading the book all I can think of that you you're still making music with Peter towns and that's how you guys I think it was last year the year before in Toronto uh why do you think you Pete and made it out on the other side of the others didn't\nUm discipline a lot of discipline locked and loaded locked and a love of each other and some reason or or the other\nWe respect each other and I think there was one time when ... was very very bad and that was the game I think it was it was still grieving for case\nWe're launching we'd go out cells into a position where\nFor him as a writer was becoming increasingly pressurized Pete got very bad and onto a heroin and I managed to go I went to see him and spent four hours to consume in\nTo his credit and so's intelligence and wisdom he checked into rehab the next die or not you know better than the reasons we survive we respect each other\nBut how are you getting along now outcomes stand each other\n[laughter] it\nIs that though [laughter] no [laughter] I I I kinda brothers is now he says if we've been married for sixty years [laughter] you know they're not quite that book\nBut It's MORNING It's MORNING friendship is it's kind of more than family is it the the into the ... ... ... I can only speak for me not there but I'm sure would I get from ... is a the caring about me and I and I care deeply about him\nRoger you've been so generous and and talking about some of these things that I Know aren't easy to talk about what could you tell us the story though I have to say my favorite story in the book is the story about you in the bath tub with a baked beans [laughter] yes well I Know the\nKind of interesting time we would we will make an album crews who sell out to do the album cover like that you know I turned ... last\nAnd actually I got the short straw jai alai got the joy of sitting near the top of bike beans which doesn't sound bad doesn't sound bad on the engine that much you can buy beans apart from the fact that this kind of Victoria ... I was in in\nHad about a hundred by a of a slimy bite beans in them those come straight out of the fridge\nSo proud of my life so easy to just above Seventy three degrees\nUltimately through all these conversations did you do you feel like you learned anything at least about the big decisions that drives us when we're deciding whether or not to have children\n[noise] ah yeah I mean it's just that it's not exactly\nA decision that make you have children or not there so many other things that are beyond choice that make a life what it is said even this idea that you have to decide whether or not to have a child is a bit of an illusion because life is\nLife happens beyond what you want it to be and so not to say that the question is not important or that answering it doesn't help you lead you know the kind of life you want to lead but there's so many other factors involved so [laughter]\nSo so that's partly where I came with writing this book but also just the idea of motherhood having to be\nUm a relationship to a child I mean one of the things that happens in the book is that the narrator realizes that mothering her own mother and her grandmother and sort of trying\nTo um do something with her mother sadness and her grandmother sadness through the way that she lived her life is a kind of motherhood it it doesn't just have to go forward in time it can also go backwards in time so just broadening the idea of motherhood\nWas it that's interesting 'cause I was going to ask you about that because I saw a ... in this book between motherhood and being a parent\nMhm yeah it's funny ... considering the title mother had a friend of mine said that that title is like war and peace you know it's it's just so big the the word my mother had it if it's that big as the word peace as the word war and that did a lot for me and thinking about this subject because my\nMother had to me no longer a means like you know chasing a child\nAround um it can also mean that that can it can mean so much more there is something like it's part of it's like an innate human experience that in some way everyone's life touches even just the fact of having been mother does it kind of motherhood\nShe sure I I I had to say that these questions like are are you planning on having children why haven't you had children I Do regret having children are\nAmong I Would say some of the most uncomfortable questions that I could ever think about asking somebody like some of the most personal questions about asking somebody and not only in this kind of pressure to have you personally been asked that a couple of times ah and you've also been asked about your relationship with your with your own mother or your your your relationship in your own family how\nAre you finding all that\nUm it's fine I mean I'm I'm able to answer when I Want to not answer when I don't want [laughter] and I I just I've actually found\nYou know for instance when I'm doing when I'm signing people's books it's really nice to hear people say to me like I'm twenty eight\nYears old and I just decided that I wasn't going to have children and they say it with so much excitement and just like they want to say it to me 'cause they know that I'll be excited for them or something and it's it's nice to hear all the antiques encounter all these different women who\nFeel kind of a lack of shame about saying that because I think there is still far a lot of women that lingering sense of shame if you don't want to child what's wrong with you and or are people going to judge you so there's a wonderful kind of warm you know that I've been experiencing from from women who can say that to me\nA large part of this book is uh on what it means to be creative person and also a mother and that's something that she comes up so much with gifts to come on the shows why why is that in particular so interesting to you\nI'm I I guess because they're both act of creation and they both take a lot of dedication and time to do well and they both take a lot of attention and they both kind of have the ability to sort of take over your whole life and um and the the the idea of\nThere was somebody that I was interviewing and maybe as Mary gate the writer Mary gate scaling are saying you know I can only really imagine ... you know it's like that biblical quote ... men can either serve God or Mad Men like you can only have one God in your life like if they're going to be art is it going to be children like that's how the way I felt like there was a binary\nAnd she if it was her um she said\nWell I I don't see it that way I I think of it as you know serving love and that love can extend to you know ...\nYou know the actor parenting and it can extend to the the act of writing are creating or a million things in the world some but I Do think it's hard to do both I think it's hard to do to of anything really well you know it's it's hard to an hard enough to do one thing well so\nThere is certainly in a lot of artistic people and not actors and people I Know myself this fear that if you bring this humongous responsibility in your life\nWhat will it do to this this this other occupation that seems to demand so much isolation so much attention so much care and I there I Know lots of people who managed to do both but it does do some daunting\nIn in in the New York and he's written about you just comes up a couple of times and it occurred to me if you times it is it about letting go of the self then when you when you get rid of the creative expression that you focus entirely on somebody else I\nDon't know I don't know do you have children no yeah I I I'm not sure I don't know can you ever completely give up the south\nI don't know I mean that that that those those are the things that I think when when I was growing up I think that's what my ... ... people in my family would say to me and said oh you'll hear about you you hear about all these things now but when you when you have children you don't care about the middle you only care about them I have a\nScary thing to be told\nYeah I've I have a conversation with bands about that you who have said you know I Want to get this record out because I Want to have something an artifact of when I just lived for myself\nHuh yeah I don't know I think you can have children and also still live for yourself probably I mean I don't know if that makes you a a a bad parent or not I mean in the in the book them the mother character is is very devoted to her work and it's really the father who\nWho is the mothering stereotypically mothering type and that's very similar to the family that I grew up in where my mother a doctor spent a lot of time working in wasn't very dedicated to childcare or whatever and um but\nFor me I I understand that as I always admired\nHer you know for for working and for not giving up herself and for having other things in her life that were so important to her so I\nI Do not\nI guess for me that the mother that I saw growing up wasn't the the selfless giving up everything for her children type so I I think that's you can do it that way and and still be loved I mean I Love her you know I don't feel resentment or oh [laughter] whatever\nUm anger\nQuestion about the kind of a narrative structure of the book sure I'm a another way that your narrator makes yes or no decisions it's through this coin toss in tradition from from trying to help you or a chain\nAnd you say in the beginning of the book you actually toss these real coins in real life and use those answers in the book so this is this is like you know should I write a book you flip the coin yes you know what should I write a book about myself with the coin no well should I read a book about this\nI mean I Know that's the most embarrassing example I could use a vet but did why did you use this narrative device why did you really parts of your character story up to chance\nUm\nYou know there there's a way in which as a writer I I Love dialogue I Love conversation and interview 'em that forum so it was kind of a way you had to sort of in the in the introduction like it was a way of the ... the narrator interviewing herself like having a conversation or a dialogue with herself but\nSo chance forms of the answer is yes or no but then she has to come up with the next question so\nIt was just like also a way of being thrown off when I write I don't like to I like to have some other force that comes in and and um and surprises me and so those coin tosses war way of doing that were way of pushing myself into um\n[noise] ... into lines of questioning that ... that I wouldn't have come to you on my own\nAnd it's it's also a way of giving you a giving one I should say it clear answers like you are going to get a yes or no to the answer's\nYeah and I think there's a there's a way in which what do you have a child and not as a kind of a coin toss like some people want children they can't get pregnant you know some people don't want children they do get pregnant like in some way randomness and chants has a lot to do with what ends up happening\nBut what I think about you I think about someone who's constantly asking these gigantic questions and I I'm I'm getting even more of a sense of after this interview that you are talking to your friends not about you know why did you get for for breakfast but you know about some of the great mysteries of life\nHow important is it to you to get answers to the questions that you're raising\nA I don't think most of these questions have answers the biggest questions of life don't have answers but\nThere's but I think it's still worthwhile to ask the questions it gives you a different relationship to life to have undergone the questioning\nDo you feel after completing the book that you um are any closer to figuring out motherhood an existential level\nYeah I mean I feel settled in myself I I think if I hadn't written this book there would always be this nagging feeling in May of here was you had it here was you know there's\nThis moment in your life where it where this was on your mind and and you decided to look away from it and I I think I Would have always criticized myself for that and and felt like I got into the future without\nWithout thinking it through and I I don't want to do that I'm not done that with lots of things in my life kind of been very impulsive and spontaneous and I just thought with this question I I don't want to be positive and spontaneous I I Want to give it their
