junkies with somebody else might be\nAnd you're listening to talk to\nThey might know Sally Field from Steel Magnolias normal re Forrest Gump Mrs doubt fire here's how famous Sally Field is I just mentioned four of her most critically acclaimed movies and someone you know probably still yelled at the radio oh come on Tom you forgot like that's what a great actor she is but she's not\nHere to reminisce about her old rules or or stories from the SAT here to talk about something a lot more meaningful to her you'll hear Sally Field in just a minute\nFlushing PE eyes Catherine McClellan is here to talk about a new documentary about her dad the great singer songwriter gene McClellan and she's going to play ... one of his most\nFamous songs Wednesday October tenth all of that coming up on cue\nLive from NPR News in Washington a gym Huck\nHurricane Michael's slammed into the Florida Panhandle with winds of one hundred fifty five miles an hour on Wednesday\nSplintering homes and some merging neighborhoods before continuing it's destructive church inland across the south east Franklin County sheriff VJ Smith ordered a curfew from sunset through sunrise to give emergency crews a chance to clear the debris\nCreated as a child and me I'm the survival mechanism that allowed me to navigate very complicated emotional terrain as a child of seven and eight and nine ten eleven twelve\nAnd I needed to understand that system and how it got placed there what exactly it was because I've spent my lifetime trying to untangle it\nIt's funny you mentioned survival so much because in the in in the book you read about someone who child is obviously struggling\nWith understanding why this is happening\nHow you can still have a a relationship with people who are when this is happening to you\nYour understanding of what your mother knows what your what your mother doesn't know and and I'm just trying to grapple things with ... with No Child should have should have to grapple with\nAnd then on top of that you also start a career a very young um I can imagine what it was like I mean you were you were Gidget which was this sort of sunny and bright character you were the flying none which I have you with described as sort of the bottom of the rung of the sitcoms [laughter]\nBut it's such a what does it was a pleasant happy character I Can't imagine having to play those roles such kind of darkness swirling around\nBut I had those characters to I mean I was also in pieces\nAnd that was the personality of me that is very sunny and get it and uh I Love her she's she was incredibly important to me and still isn't still\nYou know lives within me that's Julius and gleeful and science fun and things um and yet there is there are aspects of me that art that that are dark\nAnd sad and furious and um and that's those are also\n... that also deals with the title of in pieces\nBut you also talk about the the about being a a fog for much of your life is a ... except when you were acting can you tell me a little bit more about the um\n[noise] well I think part of my survival mechanism ... certainly as I was moving into adolescence ah was to put myself in a fog for that I saw that feelings were left sharp\nEverything was numb to a degree and I couldn't really um perceive a lot of the feelings and complexities\nUm that were going on inside of me you know there was so much fear riding around in the danger of a fifth year of one when you when you live with a a man who's who's potentially dangerous mhm and you adore him mhm\nThat's a very frightening place for a child or how you feel safe within the fog feel safer within the fog\nAnd as a result in high school I couldn't I could hardly read a book or\nOr focus on certainly couldn't do math or anything that called on that part of my brain because it would cause me to be engaged in in in in what was happening right by could memorize a poem I couldn't memorize dialogue and when I when I finally found a stage at twelve\nSomething happened I went the the all clear to bell rang and I could hear myself and I can react\nIt's a feeling of being utterly explicitly alive\nI first picked up the book reside with all due respect you I thought oh this'll be a a a memoir about all she was in this role and then this thing happened and then you know he's got this guy you know to the your credit typical celebrity memoir and I think one of the things that is\nThe conversation that's happening around his book is is it is better than anything but it took a lot of bravery and it took a lot of at least a lot of giving to write this book who told me about the process of having to give all that out by ... putting all this time it was really\nOf this this search for something I felt an urgency to find 'em so\nUh urgency took seven years but I had no publisher ahead nobody on my team I had a I finally reached out to a literary agent in New York\nWho boldly reached out to to someone who um [noise]\n... you know seem to represent some of the writers that I I'm most admire like Elizabeth drought and Jane Smiley and and Frank McCourt who arguably wrote one of the great man was ever Angela's Ashes and and this was early on and says like seven years ago and she said this what I Want you to do I want you to write\n... fifty eighty pages and and if I respond to that I represent that and not you\nSo that fifty pages that she told me to write seven years ago turned into eighty turned into a hundred turned into year turned into two years turned to three years and two hundred pages and two hundred and fifty pages and seven years later and I sent it\nTurn I thought well I completely expected Mali to go what a nice try [laughter] well\nWe're going to have to figure out how we can get you some education and fix it up and you know it'll do really well to the bottom of the bird cage that's what I thought and that's not what she did and she said I'm the one here\nYelling and screaming urging you to publish it and these are the editors I Want you to meet with\nI I mean I read the even the day before publishing gotta get rid of an interview or you're you're still not sure where literally you wanted to come out of\nOut of ... my wonderful wonderful editor militant and I kept saying no is it is it too late to just change your mind in maybe ... maybe we could think about it maybe next year maybe the following year year after that even or maybe like literally when I'm On my deathbed what what about that\n[laughter] I've never voted I don't know I completely back in my fog I think I I don't know I Can't I Can't really tell\nImages to him again I'm speaking with Sally Field just released a memoir called in pieces which tells\nThe story of her life growing up in in California for careers are also her survival being abused as a child you like I said started working in this book seven years we've been saying that number seven years I have found in Seventy seven and a lot of happened or seven years I'm In the meantime in seven years we've seen\nThe rise of the me too movement was widespread public conversation for the first time in a very long time about about women safety [noise]\nDo you see this book perhaps being part of that conversation that's happening right now\nI I don't know I Can't I Can't really tell I my\nThe the episodes I talk about in this are really not used as ways to um to lash out at any of the things that happened to me or the people who perpetrated them is really an examination of myself within that\nI'm examination of how all of this fit into a sort of a pre formed ... in my road and um how I was predisposed to put myself and to respond as I did is it's so it's not really examining them or\nI'm examining whether the situation was right or wrong it only talk about my feeling within it\nEven though I say that I Do I Am very appreciative of the fact that women are now speaking out but I Know that that the outrageous number one you know that's the first thing loud screaming rage outrage of wrong this behavior has to stop but that's just the\nBeginning that's just the beginning there has to be something else on the other side of it to change society because it has to do with how we how we raise our our little boys in our little girls that bad behavior comes from somewhere and in men I raised three sons\nUm men are are raised also in a very tight little box you know to have like a man\nWhat is that it allows them a great deal of themselves of their humanity of their ... their tenderness of their instinct you know their instincts are cut off from themselves\nBecause they're not allowed to behave certain ways and they're also taught that this bad behavior is cool is great it makes you more of a man and makes you more um sexy\nAny of that and that has to be done\nAnd not to mention to deny deny deny if you were ever accused of anything if you look at the current narrative to modernize our divided by as much as you possibly can and never take ownership workout ability for your actions\nThat well if that's yes um especially those who are who are caught in the spotlight of all of this and have never realized in their lives that that you know that they are part and parcel of this at their behavior has been\nNot ideal um but within the confines of when they grow up and how they grow up they were acting like everybody else are they could see\nGenerally can address I'd be having this conversation beyond the book\nYou talked about a director FU to kiss him before I'll give you a part in the film he comes out and says that's completely untrue I mean a lot of the current moment is about survivors who come forward stories like you and whether or not there believe so I just want to know how how does it feel to write such a painful moment and then just have a denial thrown back and you're like that\n[noise] um ...\nYou know I don't think about that I I certainly think about Dr Ford and have the kind of ... it was yesterday I couldn't even watch yesterday and President Trump apologized um you know to the ... you know on behalf of the country um for\nJustice Kavanaugh's ill treatment\nAnd that's a great just as far as I'm concerned agree ages and um [noise] I you know it's it really is you can be outraged and you can be you know incensed in or any of those but that doesn't get anything\nWe and my friend Dave who's the drummer and the band he worked at a record store so we got grand master flash records and sugar hill gang and then this ban will take it in a bag it wasn't many hip hop record Steven by back then so he got them so I was kind of listening to that and then\nIt sort of inspired me to do to sort of like talking style\nAnd it gets along with a bunch of the next three years I just\nI Can't say was robbed and definitely was [laughter] but it was the idea that you could talk and that was sort of acceptable way to create music\n[noise]\nI was in vans and when I Lived in Edmonton, Alberta\nA lot of aunts and it was very frustrating that wasn't really any place to play I so I ... I'd have to move\nSomewhere else I really want us to do it so I moved to Toronto when we recorded I'm an adult now originally we recorded that we recorded for song damage to try and get gigs on clean street I'm so we've we've recorded for song demo and this guy Scott Smith basement on a sixteen ... what don't even real drums on it\n[noise]\nCouldn't even make a drum kit so Dave pat I'm Simmons care and uh we used ... real symbols and we record these forests\nFrom a lot of candidates for the for our music channel Sunday should use extinction user\nEither for another friend named ... who worked for the uh national film board and so he was a director and he had a little bit of success there\nAnd so when they were just sitting around you know whatever drinking a beer and he said you know we should make a video and this was one video on the ... the sort of I'm fairly new thing I guess and I said sure let's do that so we one day he had a friend who had some ... a camera and some film and we just kind of cobbled together a group of people and\nWent out on the street and shot some stuff\nAnd ready to ward known as much as it resembles today a little bit ridiculous for progress every minute George dreamy they're much music and relax we both love on guard off the wall video and audio\nI took it to much music and thinking that we get played on city limits are\nPraying not even thinking would but hoping we would get played on city limits which was sort of alternative music show at the time and then you know and then I went home and the next day I got a call\nAnd saying oh we reelect declare for going to put it into full rotation\nAnd we're just like flabbergasted completely flabbergasted and then did nothing about it like nothing\nAnd so then I you know at at being a record avid record shopper I wandered into I don't know a mayor Sam to recommend or something and someone said hey where's your record that's what I mean she said\nMy record on what he even talking about the you know director prominent don't you know do you how do you have that I said no we don't have a record and said you should get one because all day long people have been coming and you're asking to buy\nA ... never even occurred to us to like you said we so we figured it out and we all cable we have some friends who who did the cover of forest and then we got oppressed and we got a thousand made and we brought them around to record stores and then they sold out right away you know see up and why started planning a ... you know like a holiday I\nInterviewed me for now magazine and a bunch of stuff started happening [noise]\n\nThere's a whole bunch of bands but it was yeah it was tragically hip cowboy junkies blue rodeo [noise]\nAnd then a few other bands promote website the grapes of wrath and and I'm In the northern pike would be another one all these bans are just\nStarting to record deal all that kind of around the same time and it seemed like there was an openness to a Canadian music that maybe there hadn't been\nI think what had happened previously as a lot of bands that\nSounded like American band Scott record deals so like I think that would be easy to put a band that sounded like whatever's courage in America like about it sound like journey began to gain a better sound like journey to be on the radio [noise]\nWhereas I think there was some sort of change in an attitude that all there's always been in Canada and they don't really sound like what we have so maybe that's a better idea get these bans don't challenge like second we're versions of what we already have in ... I'm\n\n\nNow when we were just struggling unclean street whatever I can get anybody to answer my phone calls or anything and then I remember just one day getting home after a lot of the stuff that happened I my answering machine was completely full and it was all people say don't talk to anybody before he called me and it was like agents and managers and various kinds of people and then I was like okay [noise]\n\n\nAnd so we ended up in New York and we were in their chrysalis officers so who do want to produce record and I said a Todd ...\nAnd just saying that you know I just like saying you know who would you like to have dinner with I don't know\nBobby hall [laughter] you know I guess he does say whatever and I didn't even I I don't know if he's better and then forgot I'd even say that never even thought about it again so we got back in our van and started driving around playing shows and and so we are doing a soundtrack and a guy came up into this phone call for you\nAnd so I picked up the phone when I said hello as I'm always taught ... and I literally almost buckled my knees almost buckle under me I was like I was a huge fan I basically I left him\nAnd and so he started talking about doing a record and told me what a terrible guitar player I was and all that kind of stuff and just the kind of things that Todd would say and and that was it that's kind of how it all came together he basically defined us to find our founding figured out who we were 'cause we had all these songs that were a little heavier and he said oh you don't do those very good I always thought that\nWas really really poppy light once he said you don't really do those ones that grant so there are these ones in the mail that are a little bit ... being a little bit ... that's your that's your style\n[noise]\nOriginal video I guess sometimes I look at it and I see what trauma used to be and it's it's ... it's ... I ... I wouldn't I don't want to go so far to say it makes me feel a bit melancholy but a lot of people have said that to me a lot of people talk to me about it and say when I see that video it kinda makes me sad for Toronto but I don't I mean I\nI think ... it was great band queen street was by them but I don't think it's like terrible now I guess I don't think it's as terrible as everybody else thinks it is they're still cool things going on on green street I'm even now at a lot of those great venue is like a horseshoe in that and the rebel east all of their camera Alice\nSo those three Venus were actually read my three favorite venues on green street anyway and so I still go to them all the time [noise]\n...\nAnd the pursuit of happiness and that was the story of I'm an adult now [noise]\nPursuit of\nHappiness when I'm an adult now before that you heard there from ... bird take you through a bit of the history of that song the pursuit of happiness recently re issued their debut album loving junk in a special thirtieth anniversary edition coming up next another Canadian classic you're going to hear\n'em snowbirds you got to hear that up next\nHave user actually tried to get rid of an old car it's surprisingly complicated but not if you give it to keeping the seat that we make it really easy for you\nWill pick it up no matter what condition it in and handle all the paperwork and you'll get rid of your car you'll be contributing to trustworthy local journalism you also get a tax deduction in the satisfaction of having supported the program and he left\nYou Mickey PCC possible go to keep you see the dot org slash cars thanks\nThe LA county inspector general's launched an investigation into whether LA county sheriff's deputies engaged in racial profiling the allegation is that during the long term drug enforcement operation along interstate five\nThe Latino were just proportionally pulled over and their cars search this is Larry natural next time on air talk LA county sheriff Jim McDonald's with us to talk about how deputies handled those songs on weekdays attend Iran eighty nine point\nThree key PCC\nMade a cue on CBC Radio one serious XM one sixty nine NPR I public radio international I'm Tom how in\nThe long run not ladies don't ring\nAnd Marie Under secret I think that's about all this year to the requirements that once they're snow bird song that she made famous she made it famous after it was written by gene McClellan one of the most beloved singer songwriters\nEver to make his home in Prince Edward island ... songs went on to be recorded by Elvis Presley Bing Crosby Loretta Lynn ...
