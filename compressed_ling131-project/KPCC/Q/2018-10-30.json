{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "But each disease for quite a different percentage of had immunity ... disease differences in how contagious a taste is also known as transmissions so for example if a person has the flu it will pass onto an average of two other people smallpox has the right of one person spreading it to five others\nAnd measles have the transmission rate Fifteen\nMore contagious diseases the more people who needs to be vaccinated\nOn average one smallpox case transmitted to five other individuals if four\nOf those had been a view that's eighty percent\nThen each case would transmit the only one other and on average you'd have won going to one going to one going to one\nWhereas if the proportion immune were higher than that eighty percent than each individual should on average lead to less than one in the subsequent generation on when we look at something like measles using the same logic if one infected individual transmits on average to Fifteen others\nWill if fourteen of those were immune then we would have that threshold of going one to one to one words of a greater proportion than not graders and fourteen Fifteen\nThan the incidence of measles should declined each individual should transmit on average to less than one another and fourteen out at Fifteen is Ninety three percent this is a very useful number and it gives a rough estimate of levels of immunity required to stop transmission of difference infections\nBut we need to be careful although the average total population might meet the threshold some canned food for the gaps\nThere's an underlying assumption there\nThat these people are mixing at random and that the immunity is randomly distributed in the population whereas we know that's not the world we live in\nYou may have Ninety three percent on average immune in in a population but there will be communities and sometimes quite large communities where the proportionate Muniz appreciably less than that and you will get transmission in this example of measles virus\nSome countries are so concerned about these clusters of people who are not vaccinated that they've introduced monetary schemes and this has caused some conflict [noise]\nIn July twenty Seventeen beaches\nOn unseen then minister of health ... introduced a bill that made it mandatory for children to have as a ticket to prove that they were vaccinated before attending school\nIn August of this yeah that was overturned by the new coalition government made up of the ... five star movement that by Luigi ... on the moon right wing lego nice by my side of beanie\nI spoke to ... director of Italian fact checking website ... about why this policy was changed\nTo be homeless the boxing submarine and the topic of political discussion in the last couple of years at least for samples from beanie as well spoken many times so I guess making the vaccines mandatory\nUh was some of the most vocal and the director ... to the vaccination have come from the five Star Movement\nIn February of two tongues for the for example the five Star Movement presented the now famous build that explicitly this the the the the false blame over link between vaccines and autism\nThe movement against the books and they show move partially fed by\nSimilar movements from other countries in the world even if it ignores obviously and an enormous amount of scientific evidence\nI Would say that the mix of public distrust and the government upper support for do skeptical position I guess looks a nation we make this issue are recovering won in the next few weeks or so at least\nAnd this is worrying for public health because equally as mayor recently between the thing come through in the world with the highest incidence rate for Muslims\nThis anti vaccination matchmaking politics and social media concerns health authorities\nBut what and patch does actually have on vaccination rates hard enough and if the director of the vaccination confidence project and professor of anthropology and risk at the London School of hygiene and tropical medicine ... has found a link between skipped school fees and vaccines and the incidence rate of measles\nThe countries that this year have had more than a thousand cases of measles we're all countries that are in our twenties sixteen study had high levels a vaccine skepticism or low level of confidence and safety\nThere's a mix of things going on in Europe there were over forty seven thousand cases\nThat's more than double all of Africa this year that's that's a lot of measles cases Africa just over twenty thousand cases is here\nTo be fair just over thirty thousand of the cases were in the Ukraine alone\nA lot of that was historic issues systemic problems supply problems and compounded by parents anxieties about autism and developmental issues with vaccines\nTo autism debate has been going on for over Twenty years stemming from an now discredited medical report that was found to have falsified data but the anti vaccination movement is spreading in part thanks to social media\nI absolutely failed that social media has exacerbated this issue tremendously it's the echo chamber effect where you get groups of like minded people together and they're surrounded by\nVoices or posts of similar sentiment which makes them feel like everybody's like this\nSome authorities have launched a social media campaigns demonstrating the benefits of vaccines and they ... success has been in Denmark\nIn Denmark because of negative feelings anxieties about the age ... vaccine which were further amplified by social media there was a dramatic drop from over Ninety percent\nExcept in ... in two thousand two under twenty percent in two thousand five when social media programs were\nInitiated the numbers went up from just over Fifteen thousand girls in twenty sixteen to over thirty one thousand so it doubled within just over a year it's not the only thing to do but it it's an important component\nThis highlights the problem of communication that health authorities are keen to walk on intimation describing the benefits of vaccines isn't accessible to everyone has some people's minds suspicious\nI Would have questions if I went online and saw such conflicting information but I think when it comes to deeper skepticism that's not based on fact that I think we have a responsibility to intervene with\nVaccination mates among babies and children have once again started to pick up in countries such as it's in Ukraine but the incidents of disease is likely to continue to rise because of the large numbers of unvaccinated teenagers and young adults\nThat we have time for this week and I'm missing the nail if he's put any suspicious that he's ... at more or less at BBC does he I don't you can\nDating as hard but dating apps are easy and bumbling tender you swipe left for no right forget now the ads are suing each

Marie is here along with Andrea Warner\nWho wrote the new biography of Buffy it raises an interesting challenge how to write a book about someone when their story\nWhere they were born even when is largely unknown you're going to find out how you do that coming up on cue\n\nLive from NPR News in Washington ... Stevens Robert Bowers remains in custody after his first court appearance since being arrested in the ... of eleven people at a Pittsburgh synagogue\nHad a a hatch it that needed burying for a long time and like I I I don't believe in\nUm Josh artist sheer therapy I I think like look if you're in therapy and it helps you to get through stuff by writing about it or painting it fine but that doesn't mean we have to look at it for free [laughter] um and so I\nUm [noise] so I was very reticent to sort of a do this exercising of demons half however I couldn't write a book about my connection talking my connection to the haves are without writing a book about my dad because that was my way into\nAll of it and I I had a very kind of a unique relationship with him a unique in that uh my whole life I felt like I wasn't the kind of kid that he had hoped for [noise] but\nI was always meant made to believe I ... made to feel proud of the kid that I was so I Know the dad wanted me to be a much more sort of in in ... closer to him a\nMore kind of standard um you know a hockey plane drinking beer with your buddies kind of guy and that just wasn't me or however when he saw that I liked writing and I liked watching movies he he sort of leaned into that in a big way\nUm and and there's there's a lot of him in me and I I mean every time I look in the bloody mirror I see him\nUm but when he passed away when I was Twenty one I haven't spoken to them like five years at that point right\nUm so I never got to sort of I never got to ah make peace and this was my way of\nYou know when I wrote this book I no longer a was thinking of my dad just as my dad I I gave him a context um where he was a man on to himself and I was able to forgive\nHim from that I find that's not easy I I I almost good read the reticence of you writing about it while I was reading the books in a good one point you say this is not meant to be well at one point you say this is not my showbiz men moron for this was a book about to have and then at one point you say something like along the lines of a a I think I've used up all my Ernest\nPoints [laughter] in this book so I I get the feeling that was tough to write about the oh definitely definitely because I I uh\n[noise] I was bred ah\nIn my in my in my\nFamily the worst thing you could possibly be as a a show off\nLike my my family would rather you be an utter failure but humble rather than like a sort of proud successful person and so I was like bread with this intrinsic fear of talking about myself\nAnd and I and I whenever I'm Talking about myself with people there is this I see the the sixty minutes logo I see\nYeah give myself X amount of time before I feel like I've talked about myself too much and so yeah\nI I had to I had to force myself to kind of\nSee what was interesting in my life and what was maybe worth a sharing and the way that I reconciled it was if there was a kid out there or someone out there who's dealing with similar stuff is me or dealt with the stuff that I dealt with maybe reading this makes them feel a bit it makes it feel less instrumental\nYeah John Updike that something like that like there are days I wake up and even on the show and I go I said why why are we doing this again you know what is the I mean I ...\nI should admit you know what I mean you might not even an actor yes I Know ours\nNo I I of course because it's like you you you do these jobs because you like these jobs you to ... we we chose this life as opposed to the other one\nUm and and in in an incident and then that's an inherently emotional decision um and\nOh you're a motion though em is that the mercy of your life and and so there are ... you know if if the fulcrum of your interest in this in this job is based on your emotions while there's going to be times where you just don't feel it\nYeah it's a John Updike has this call I think I'm going to paraphrase but I think it's something along the lines of like I present in my life as a life at all others can be judged against Iran and and baked against and then I'm I I\nI mean I kind of know you as a as a happy go lucky and passionate habit Spanish median guy in in funny comedy movie it's it's it's nice to see it talk about some of this other stuff but I Can't imagine that I mean you talk with your parents divorced then yeah you talk about having to take up as a kid side yeah if you could not have been easy\nNo no I was a super super awkward stuff\nUm and and and of course you know arm you know my I I was also wrestling with this idea that you know my my my dad passed away you know for so he's not here to defend himself against any of the things I say yeah um and I also am proud and I'm a I'm a\nProud member of my family whatever my personal issues with any of them are and so I was also raised to like we are dirty laundry in private Mm\nUh how how however I ... and on top of that my mom still alive a lot of people I write about are still alive and so I was like\nYou know scared really really scared when she read it to see what she thought\nAnd if I you know she thought she made her look bad or anything like that and and she didn't she ... she think\nShe said she goes you know how I Know I like it is that I remember the events you're describing 'cause I was in them and I'm Still eager to turn the page I Want to see how it turns out I don't remember laughing and it's like okay cool that's pretty that's pretty cool\nBut um no I I think sometimes yeah you know ... I I\nI Know that in my life I'm living\nThrough this sort of tougher experiences that I kind of talk about in this book what got me through them was knowing other people had gotten through them and so maybe I can assertive now it's my turn in the in the in the in the change is sort of pass on those it's okay to go through this stuff\nKind of thing if you just to me and I'm speaking to the actor Jake Barrett show and I think one of the things that helps you get through them is is banned um yeah I think the last time you were on the show I think the last time you're on the show was for good reason to you for that was for a your film about the Celtic football at all yeah Celtics all that um I feel like you are just a fan\nOf sports team than just a fan of things but you see in a hearing importance and being a fan daytime yeah big\nTime like we we we every one\nOf us needs a context or a up some kind and I think that like\nYou know when you're lucky enough to either be a born into a sort of sincere kind of legacy offend them in a in your family or do you discover a team to be ... by a team like I was a Celtic could just how I say I I didn't pick them they're they picked me um\nYou know each it's you buying in to a a history or occur in a culture um you you know tradition all these different things\nAnd look we all um\nWe ... it is a function of the human condition to want to belong and to be around just to share in something and I think that fandom um you know sports fandom springs from that\nBut do you think that ... and ... again not to bring it back or too many times but you talk about your dad's addiction in this book you talk about your folks divorce he talked about moving to Los Angeles you feeling isolated and appealing sort of an ... be appealing\nI'm looking into phone book and they'd be a bail bondsman insane just just doesn't feel like being home do you think fandom can help us through that oh yeah and you get a lot of ... you know it's just a game what are you still upset about\nYeah well and that and that's the funny kind of dichotomy because like when people say that they're not wrong [laughter] watch you know rare ... reason and logic would dictate eyes and thirty six year old man should not care about these things but I\nUm well yes I'm ... fandom those those gets\nYou through that stuff's all those those those kind of wilderness years in Los Angeles or as a sort of lonely and home sick are painfully painfully home said if you go out and you get\nDown there to get this you end up getting this lead Ronan declare yes dream gig for any actor and I was like\nBali my eyes out once a week and I was like um by what made me survive was um\n... I really hope ... going to sound like I'm pandering to this audience by how much water is a guy [laughter]\nBut then listening listening to the CBC checking the CBC I remember getting an apartment in Los Angeles and I was like ... you know cable package\nI remember getting CBC News rolled in Los Angeles and it was like the channel that was that in much music I had in my apartment in Los Angeles and I they were just on all day I wake up to him because it um ID or home and ... that sounds Mustang credibly hokey but\nUh when I was a way yeah um me identifying myself as a Canadian as Montreal or as a ... fan that's allowed me to survive being in a place where I knew absolutely no way\nThat it it it's a really powerful man thanks man that's very nice you to say I also love how candid you are about the you know some of the trappings of fame and I think right now in in twenty Eighteen we're having a really interesting argument over what is the value of fame at all and it's it's fun to see someone who somewhat comforted with it\nSo hard so I reached a judicial things are coming in extra having a book born into it a hands like comes out tomorrow he's about to head off in a book tour across Canada yeah I look forward to\nUh we'll see the photo convention basically everybody will\nA because two months after\nThe DNC in two thousand four there were like twenty podcasts and the next month there were a hundred pod cast and you can if we had a curve on this you would see it was just\nYou know it would be going along very very very very low for a couple of years and then in the summer of two thousand for the curve with all of a sudden get very steep and\nWhat matters to me is beautiful expression of ideas by human beings and\nBecause I think what we do when we communicate were just manipulated symbols you know and what we're really saying is this is what I'm like on the inside [noise]\nOther than ... voice religious do so much more than the words of represents hope and confidence or depression or shyness or sadness for accents or origin for experience it\nGets a full register of who we are and I love hearing it\n[noise]\n\nHave the story the very first podcast Christopher Leyden is a longtime public radio host they've Weiner is a software developer and two thousand three they created what's often called the very first broadcast today the very latest podcast check out front burner from CBC News you can get it wherever you get your podcasts and\nIf you're already subscribed to the coupon cast well thanks and if not yourself favor\n[noise]\nOver the weekend we heard news that enters ...
