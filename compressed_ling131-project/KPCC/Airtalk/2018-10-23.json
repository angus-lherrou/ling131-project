retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced this morning she's experiencing dimension most likely Alzheimer's da da to recently withdrew from public life\nAfter her ... she spoken about changes on the high court and in American politics generally the\nImpact of Justice O'Connor right after the news [noise]\nLie from NPR News in Washington I'm Lakshmi sang a major investment conference allowing for billions of dollars in deals is underway in Saudi Arabia however in recent days and weeks\nA flurry of individuals and organizations including prominent Americans have backed out NPR's Camilla dominant ski report certain guests are distancing themselves from the Saudi crown prince who was widely suspected of ordering a hit on a Washington Post columnist who died inside of the Saudi conflict in Turkey\nIs there any way you can point to her gender specifically factoring into either her demeanor on the court or the rural sheep later even decisions that she wrote any way that that you see her gender playing out specifically\nWell I I thought it was interesting in that clip that you played I think she reflected I'm a humility I'm In how she saw herself\nAs um as as a woman on the court or that it may have something to do though with her again I noticed respect the law professors of which on one uh she she was not I'm In a staunch ideological an justice on the court and so she reached conclusions\nI'm sure has so many stories to share about Justice O'Connor professor good to have you with us again\nUh oh it was great for the first the first of all what's your response to the statement that she put out this morning I I'm Sorry what's your response to the statement that Justice O'Connor put out this morning\nOn one hand of course it's very sad to see someone that when a nose and respect that'd be so ... uh the same time you know this is a combination of a very long life or or and or the or in a row marketable remarkable career as a lawyer\nAs a politician as a justice after that as an advocate for a a for civics education she she is a remarkable\nWoman and I think she ought to be an example to us all I Do think that she's a my sense is that she's been particularly inspirational to\nTo women lawyers and by the way my guess is women lawyers on both sides of the political divide a one thing people talk about uh about diversity one thing that she highlights is a reminder which is\nA which is sometimes easy to forget that there's a huge diversity in the views of uh of women uh judges and women lawyers\nAh she was a fairly conservative Republican uh and her position on the court in a letter to be kind of a moderate conservative or I'm a voice or from my address potential prospective\nA and she also that diversity of views within herself as most of us do uh she wasn't always predictably a conservative or a or predictably liberal and or even predictably moderate\nI and I think that just reminds her of reminds us that she was a person she was the first woman justice but she was also a person with our own kind of complicated views about life and about the law and that's one of the things that I think all of us who um who worked for her loved about her\nWhat the what do you see is the most important cases where she was the deciding vote\nYou know there weren't many I think one of the thing that was the one thing that was a very near to her heart was reaffirming the rights of states under the constitution\nAnd in particular are the limits on federal power I think like pretty much all the justices on the court for the possible exception maybe of Justice Thomas but I'm not even sure about about him a I think she believed that the federal government ought to have very broad powers in many ways but\nNot on limited powers or with respect\nTo the states there are some things even sitting inside the bill of rights constraint some things that were just outside of the scope of the federal government and I think she was often not just unnecessary fifth vote for that to happen but she was also a um a a a a an influence\nOn the other justices or in that she was the one who I think helped push for a lot of these\nThese arguments I think she also I'm a ... ah had particular views about race based affirmative action she was generally highly skeptical about it in cases involving employment and contracting she was somewhat more open to it in educational though even there she thought there ought to be some limits on that and ultimately are her position\nA ended up being the position of the court because she was she was the swing swing vote there but those are just a couple of examples she had strong views about uh\nAbout religion and the law she was a backer of religious exemptions from generally applicable laws for religious objectors she lost that battle in the employment division versus Smith case uh but uh she ... I think she fought it because she\nDeeply believed in it she was also a backer of some limits although not very broad limits on the government's power to a express religious views are so she is the pioneer of the endorsements dust ah\nFor the county's entire workforce when it comes to sexual misconduct cases I don't know how that compares to other law enforcement agencies versus their total us\nApps but I'm just a number of concern you if so what plans do you have to address that\nSure the numbers any number would concern me a particularly in light of the the allegations that would be involved there we have had some of those cases are in my four years and we have addressed them very aggressively or we got right on it we put our whole team on it to be able to chase down\nThe information get the facts together and to be able to take appropriate action or we've done that in a couple of different cases when I look at the trend or since two thousand for\nA we have Eighteen thousand employees and our organization so\nYou know we as as hard as we try to try and say that you know things that were not profitable never happened uh is unrealistic things will happen and it's really a more what we do when they do and how we deal with them\nOr as we move forward so we are trending down in our\nA risk management a focus as it relates to lawsuits lawsuits take three to four or five years to be able to get through the system so we're watching very closely the major drivers of that or jeopardy involves shootings use of force incidents and then other misconduct like you mentioned with sexual harassment issues\nAh we have a comprehensive training throughout the organization we have set the tone very clearly from my first day\nAs do expectations in what we would tolerate and what we wouldn't and uh we're in a place where I'm very proud that everyone in the organization knows what's expected of them uh we have seen a you know a decrease in people relief from duty here as we move forward\nAnd we're in a place where you know it's not something you can never checked the box and say we're done but\nWe're on the ... were on the road to being the best organization I Believe in American policing\nThat county uses a quite frequently with the settlements nondisclosure agreements you think that that's a good idea or do you think that the specifics of the settlement should be made public you\nKnow I'm I'm a fan of transparency I uh I don't know enough about that topic that's something that's done by county council with the opposing counsel I don't know what the rationale is other than maybe to protect the victims\nOf this to be able to protect their identity so that people have been a victim of sexual harassment or something else or or not out there in the public eye\nOut with the women that are working for the department is there any difference in turnover I'm because that could be a red flag that that perhaps women in the department are not feeling um has welcomed or do you see any difference in the turnover between women and men on the sheriff's department\nYou know nothing that certainly is noticeable and do we make an effort to be able to interview people when they leave us exit interviews to be able to as best we can to determine why they left\nWhen any allegations of made of anything inappropriate we taken very seriously and we have risen organization for a long time\nWe have a internal affairs internal criminal investigative investigations bureau as well as ah the policy of equity throughout the organization for issues that relate to this issue or so for many years we have taken it very seriously and er I think that has set the foundation for where we are today\nWe have ah over Eighteen percent of our workforce sworn side is a female\nA much larger number on the professional staff side so we are probably in a position where we have one of the highest percentages of female employees are within the policing profession I'm very proud of that but certainly we want to continue to try and and build our numbers and be as representative as we can of of every demographic throughout the county\nSheriff McDonnell I Want to talk about um your experience versus your opponent that's something that you've I emphasize during your campaign so a draw that distinction place\nYeah you know I I come but I haven't\nBeen thirty six seven years plus in the business I've been in three organizations I rose from a a recruiting the LAPD up to number two a left there went to ah the Long Beach police department is chief and now a sheriff for four years\nI look back on my time in the command ranks and my opponent has never had a command he retired as a lieutenant so he's never managed a budget we have a three point three billion dollar budget he's never overseen training he's never overseeing discipline he's never over seen any of the basic one on one things than police command responsibilities\nSo to come into an organization that is the largest sheriff's department in the world second largest police department in the United states behind NYPD\nAnd to try and say that you're going to be able to get up to speed quickly and be able to manage an organization where over ten million people are relying on you for their safety or is not fair to him it's not fair to the organization and certainly not fair to the public throughout Los Angeles county\nDo his blame me as well the the there are other staff people that can deal with the added while he gets up to speed well\nHe'll have no credibility with those deaf people coming in relying on everybody to give them the answers to what's going on you have to come in and be in a position where you can you can take charge of an organization you have the credibility among the people that you have the privilege to lead\nBut you're able to move forward and respond to whatever comes your way and I'll tell you a day in and day out is one emergency after another that we deal with or if we deal with it effectively the public doesn't even noticed we move forward a but coming in without the experience I've been a command officer for over Twenty years\nThat's Twenty years of experience in three different organizations at every level that he has never had I look back on when I was a lieutenant in lieutenants a great spot a it's a responsible spot he was responsible in his last command for up to Eighteen people he's looking to go into an organization of Eighteen thousand people it's a very different job\nShoving Donald thank you for being

California teachers ... what do you think it's been misrepresented in ah the efforts of Mr Janice in the organization working with him\nWell one thing that's been a misrepresented is whether members um the the arrangements that the private arrangements that members have with their unions\nAre covered by the genesis and they clearly are not Janice as I said only applied to whether non members it'd be compelled to pay their fair share fees and not withstanding the forty years of press that\nThe Supreme Court in in June ... forty seven so that was a lawful\nBut let's be clear unions are exclusive representatives because they\nRepresent a majority of the workforce or it's a democratic process it's a legal process\nThat California by law requires you don't become an exclusive representative without having majority support once you have majority support those employees wanted she wants to keep a the union is representative\nBecause the union um with the\nNews that it receives from members are negotiating contracts the fans employees and disciplinary a processes were necessary um they they provide professional support they help the train teachers and nurses um\nThat that the other side of that is though that for him if you have an employee who thinks that the union isn't really serving her or his interests they don't really have any leverage doesn't this in some ways give employees leverage\nThat the union now has to make the case for why those fair share fees are are burned by the union\nThat's absolutely right and that's why I'm membership is not dropping a as some people predicted um the question is what is the what is the union provide and I think uh most most union members are realize in more than ever that\nThey need the support of their colleagues ... so they're not lost she dropped their membership enjoy um these organizations that water on ... ... but throughout the country\nRight I have less than a minute left let me go back to Mr Janice the plane had been the case so what are you hoping in the appearances you're making the effect of this will\nBe while I'm hoping to get the message out that you know the workers do have rights and they do have a choice and you know in response I have to ask okay the unions do they ask for you know that exclusive representation\nBut when did that occur did occur Twenty years ago there were twenty five thirty years ago and where is the re certification of the union because we're finding that a majority of union of public sector workers are never voted for that\nYou know they have returned researcher goes all the turnover and so why are we not uh doing a re certification or you know maybe every one or two or three years or with every contract cycle\nWill have to leave that right there are more generous with a plaintiff in the Supreme Court's Janice decision will swam of the California Policy Center and thanks to his ...

California has become the ... the other states where Republican candidates have warned that if Democrats win and said why Nevada\nTexas and Colorado it means the negative facts of life in California will make their way to those other states will talk about that narrative and how it's playing out politically elsewhere right after the news\nLive from NPR News in Washington on Lakshmi saying\nThe Mexican government appears to be looking at the caravan of an estimated seven thousand Central American migrants in humanitarian terms\nIn southern Mexico food water and medical checkups are being provided to new arrivals\nFrankly a lot of people do move to the rural parts of Nevada from California to they've said to escape that\nHow is this playing out in the senatorial race you've got\nRight it's it's kind of become you know California in that race has become kind of the bogeyman that the Republican Dean Heller is trying to trying to portray and trying to say that has really tried to link his Democratic opponent a rep Jacky Rosen really trying to link her to California um you know whether it's\nA kind of tried to point out how many donors and how much money she gets in her campaign from California donors um to um other things talking about I think on Twitter he's had\nUm you know treat an ad saying you know quote unquote we can't let California liberals take over our great state so it's been a it's been a big part of that campaign\n... uh and I'm ...

Adam lax all to the uh the Basque fry\n'em Nunez was they're kind of warning people effectively warning Republicans in Nevada that you know I've seen this first hand that you know that he had seen the effects of California's you know liberalization first hand and it's not something you that Republican should watch that happened in Nevada\nThere'll be interesting to see how how strong this message is or isn't and if if the you know California is the bogeyman ends up\nConvincing significant numbers of of a new ... to to support the Republican you have any sense from polling at this point if that that message is connecting\n[noise] not really there there hasn't been too many polls as of recently and especially um\nNothing where are the California measure the anti California message is being pushed by Republicans has really been able to be gauge um it's something that I'm really interested to see because right now that is kind of one of the key if not the key\nA messaging point for most of the big name Republicans in Nevada so it'll be really interesting to see whether or not that is enough to rile it's rolling up the base Republicans now seem to see if it'll rile up enough of the moderates leaning Republicans or you know right leaning independents\nWell and also um it ... you know it's it's gonna be interesting to see also you Democrats um because I assume they're not saying the opposite yes I Will help make this like California there they're not running on California I assume\nRight and especially if you've seen that in in the center is Jeffrey Rosen's ran a handful of ads in Nevada talking about how she has stood up to Nancy Pelosi in in the house I'm ... basically trying to they're not\nUh I Would say Democrats aren't necessarily addressing it more or less trying to not necessarily talk about it they know that they don't want to say that they're going to turn and about in California that's not something that um I don't think what method well on either side\nBut it it's it's their focus more on a I think the Trump affect their folks for things like health care and really kind of going after the tax cuts or tax cutting JOBS Act as well\n[noise] cold and thanks for being with us in describing what you're seeing in Nevada politics we appreciate it\nThank you causing Locke had is Capitol bureau chief in politics reporter for the Las Vegas Review Journal with us from uh the Colorado son political reporter and also the craft beer writer I'd love that combining the two John Frank John thank you for joining us\nThanks for having me so ah how big a theme is this being in the uh races there in Colorado\nSo it was one of the first date that Republican state viewed in the Gulf Coast\nThis race where we saw with the Republican Governors Association you played that at a moment ago was literally the Democratic candidate as a radical California particularly aiming at his policies a taxi to cut us as at all it says you know ...\nCalifornia have high taxes crazy regulations that district jobs and radical ideas like single payer health care and they're saying that our democratic candidate for governor Jared ... wants to bring those policies here to Colorado He does have some similarities in policies but this attack\nIs mostly aimed at a\nKind of fear mongering among Republicans\nI spoke to a Republican voter just on Saturday who brought this up on her own idea that hollow for ... as she called it may emerge if Democrats were the governor's race\nSo it's not quite clear how much effect independent voters in Colorado unaffiliated voters that really decide our elections here but it's definitely a rallying cry for Republicans\n... and um if there were a general sense of of Coloradans that with all the Californians that have moved there it's had a negative effect on the state of\nColorado was at a pinch point right now particularly in terms of gross or seeing our highways uh become very congested and not having a way to pay for them or expand than we are seeing a turning point for the state seems to be moving in a more liberal direction or\nWhen it's been traditionally Republican decades ago and then put a purple state for the last few election cycles and we've got a democratic candidate who's pushing pretty old a democratic ideas\nThat Republicans pointed to governor Jerry Brown signing a law mandates carbon free electricity by twenty forty five that is pretty similar\nTo a policy that the Democratic candidate for governor in Colorado has advocated throughout this campaign so there are some significant policy comparison you know whether this works is a different question it\nRemains to be seen how the Californians here in Colorado respond to this but what it does appeal to the folks who have been here a long time\nWho don't necessarily like the direction of the state's going who feel like it's changing too much with are significant growth in Colorado in Denver but one of

what are you seeing in the way of TV and radio ads and California mentions there\nYeah I mean California bad thing of long been a pretty routine practice and cut\nAll the ... and include wide races where in Texas out into\nThe offices are completely controlled by Republicans and so\nA specially in the fall election um and you know even back during the primary motivator\nAttack that you're
