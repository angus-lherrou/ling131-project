{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Oh my gosh the yes some people say the typical family of four can you see my aircraft the typical family of four well spent seven hundred and Seventy nine dollars on a new taxes and fees\nNow that's true only if they're driving mega miles in luxury cars or is all for family members\nHave cars and here's the math that's going to apply to the average Californian uh making it about a hundred and Seventy dollars a driver if you're driving the California average of about fourteen thousand miles a year and your car gets the state fuel averaging economy uh about twenty five miles a gallon\nAnd you're paying about fifty five hundred and sixty gallons of gas here at twelve cents a gallon that's going to be sixty seven dollars a year in gas tax\nNow it you know if you drive more you'll pay more in tax but that's what it is pretty average driver now added that new vehicle fees you're going to pay when you're a new your vehicle registration that's going to be twenty five dollars for an aging economy box or a hundred and Seventy five for a luxury vehicle\nSo most car owners are going to pay a new vehicle fee of about fifty dollar range um that's what state officials say and then there's one more the ... if you drive a zero emission vehicle like an electric car compressed natural gas\nYou're not buying gas so you're not paying the gas tax you still got to pay for the roads so they're hitting you without one hundred dollar is zero emission vehicles the that's new with this law\nNow I've seen signs all over the state saying but uh such and such ... project for being paid for with gas tax money but you tell me share how are those fees from the gas tax being spent any examples you can talk\nAbout I'm sure a state and local governments including metro here in LA county has been running ahead with projects funded by the new gas tax\nAnd and these vehicle fees on some construction downtown is included in that and there's some big freeway maintenance and improvement projects and you'll see that big sb one logo on one's funded by the new money\nOn and that's been a little controversial that logo because the um support is it pop six you want to repeal the gas tax are saying oh that's the state advertising campaigning um you know against our our repeal initiative\nOn ... there's a search engine you can look up it's called rebuilding dot CA dot does it's got a search engine where you can actually put in like your your county or your city um and see where the money's being spent one local example um state highway sixty seven sixty around diamond bar than we surface does it cost about two million dollars\nFor a million or not you know the other part of this argument repealing the gas tax is that people just don't cross the government to actually use the money for road repairs what's that about\n... in past years especially during the great recession legislators would move money around borrow it from this fund to cover holes in the state budget put it over there and that led to a lot of mistrust the taxes collected for one thing we get spent for something else\nSo when asked the one this law that created the new gas taxes and vehicle fees was passed it actually included a provision requiring money that was transferred away from transportation to be paid back hundreds of millions of dollars\nTo do you think then that that concern is valid given the projects that we know about that are already under way\nI'm not so much now narrowly concerning the gas tax needs vehicle fees in June California voters approved a constitutional amendment that mandates that every dollar raised in the new taxes and fees has to be spent on transportation now that doesn't fully address the arguments\nConcerning wasteful spending dentist environmental reviews can take years high salaries pensions\nGetting it those expensive items is going to call for more extensive restructuring than what prop six would provide\nNow tell me about the no on ... who's in favor of keeping the gas tax in place and how ... buses that\nAnybody who gets a single dollar from road construction [laughter]\nIs is getting into this new one six campaign construction government ... people on anybody who's living predicated on building in return roads\nLabor is also opposed to rolling back back the gas tax because thousands of jobs will be covered by five point two billion dollars in spending a year also business groups and chambers of commerce are saying no insects\nDid you speak with any voters who support the gas tax would it be saying we'll start with um\nYeah voters want to keep the gas tax argue that twelve cents a gallon isn't that much compared with what they pay to repair their vehicles when they hit potholes I'm also I spoke with ... who had moved to LA a transit advocacy group they look at the hundred and thirty billion dollar backlog in transportation maintenance\nYou don't invest in a going to pay and otherwise are going to pay for repair and pay through on your vehicles are going to pay through ingestion last\nNow a year and I spoke to a guy from Caltrans a few weeks ago and the Transportation Department is hiring something like a thousand new jobs to keep up with the projects the extra taxes are paying for I was surprised that many jobs and they were having job fairs all around the LA area he said Caltrans was moving ahead\nAnd as if the gas tax in the vehicle fees would stay in place but what if they don't if prop ... passes with all those projects just kinda just stop on\nThe money that's already been allocated for I think the rest of this partial fiscal year about three billion dollars on that we'd get spent I Believe but the five point two billion dollars a year that would come in subsequent years and they include some escalators for inflation that will go away I Would go are\nGay PCC share mcnairy breaking down the arguments for and against prop six

dad always thought we had exposure we wouldn't abuse it in the future which is what happened\nWe also did this with my step son I Am Paul in Pasadena says I'm a child psychiatrist I Want to mention the importance of brain development of alcohol in fact Paul\nLet me put you on because I raised this issue you know we understand also that\nThe brain is developing much a year later than we when than we thought um ... you know well into a person's early twenties and your thoughts on even a small exposure of alcohol do the developing brain\nThey\nActually I was trained at cedars and there's a doctor there Dr Jeffrey Wilkins and he showed me a grass one day I was at a grand rounds\nAnd he he said that if you start drinking by that signers fourteen or cheat\nVersus starting drinking after your age Twenty one\nYour chances of developing substance to these ... forty a much greater you start earlier and I always thought the H when he was just an average trend number\nBut he he made a point that brain development play the huge role in the likelihood of developing you know such as the ten minutes later on especially even car company you notice when they rent rental cars out they know that the brain doesn't ... twenty five or so you know there's a lot of\nThere's a lot to say about that if people kind of miss that important point\nYou know I'm Glad you raised at ... at issue and especially the control center of the brain my understanding from the conversations we've done on the program that that\nUh develops a year later as well and so that sort of you know the impulse control and you mentioned with driving a car rental that that you know that develops later in a child you know the only cat Viet I'd say again I'm no expert on it is is that\nUm ... when you're looking at those who start as a younger age you are going to have certain numbers of kids who are starting to drink on their own at a younger age self medicating are dealing with serious you know family trouble some problems in their lives\nAnd and I I still haven't seen a study that quite disentangle that sort of early problem drinking from that early exposure to alcohol in a different context So Paul I don't know if you have any thoughts on that but it seems to me it's important to separate those two out\nThere is something that he said about you know drinking which kids who are being supervised versus it's their\nDrinking on their own says like you are likely to bench drink but I think kids are smart enough to get that done with that information they would be more you know and making decisions about that\nKnowing that it's not just because it's it's an illegal age to drink but if elderly it's more about\nHow it is to explain to kids to take that into consideration when they're making that decision on their own\nYeah in nuts grape y miss something I've actually talked with our son about is\nThe the whole developing brain and gave him a book on what you read about the

points raking BCC I'm Larry I'm asked all great to have you with us always getting excited about segments that we're doing 'cause I feel like I learned so much and\nThis one coming up from what I've really been looking forward to it's it's a new study that looks at functional brain imaging\nOf the surgeons comparing those words less experience you're coming out of school with those who are more experienced origins and seeing how their brains light up now it's very small study of course 'cause you're putting someone into a\nMRI and having do simulated surgery is not something you're going to do with\nThousands of people nonetheless it's interesting seeing what the differences were in the parts of the brain that lit up uh in the ... the group's based on experience and then what the potential\nWith patients up that are understanding who's most suited to do this kind of high stakes um manual work like surgery joining us is a ruined Nomani\nWho's the lead author of the brain scans study a senior data scientist off for Chicago based start up called food genius or ruined thank you very much appreciate your being with us\nLike very much alert\nUs to start first of all ah just give us a thumbnail real briefly how the study was conducted\nYeah so I'm really starts with the question of what our current problems and surgical metrics for training right now and that was the premise for the entire work and we found is that all\nOut of teaching hospitals and residents currently a use subjective metrics rudimentary metrics a inconsistencies between human proper ratings so there's really a lot of work that can be done to make it much more analytical a and objective as so that was the premise of the work\nThat part of the country in recorded history and um the word is that many thousands of people\nChose not to evacuate chose to shelter in place and we're of course very concerned for them is we have details we will bring you that information right now our phones are open for you to weigh in with your questions and comments\nAbout how a functional brain imaging could be used to better understand how well someone is suited to were particular task\nUh we're talking about the potential limits of that\nAs well as as what sort of light\nHas laser light could be shined on a on this sort of skill\nLevel eight six six eight nine three tape you see see that's eight six six eight nine three five seven to two or the air talk page key PCC dot org a ruined him on and let let's talk a bit about\nYou know they want your realistically where we are here so when you're looking at the activity in the brain of the novel surgeons versus the experience hands you really can't get the skill level that way can you [noise]\nAh well you know what is important to frame this in the right context here as what we've done is really show 'em with just the case of the motor skills are very specific training to\nAh we're able to discern really the level of expertise between a novice as an expert\nOr the challenge of course is that when you go on to the are setting for example you know had a lot more factors that play a role especially when it comes to surgical competency uh stress management decision making on other higher order cognitive effects that are\nThat need to be considered you know in order to to be able to validate any other metrics beyond his motor skills um but to answer your question what would the context of just motor skill or with any specific task or that's laid out in front of a surgeon\nOr you know if if we know that that particular surgeon has been practicing and suited versus a novice that ah that it's still try and still trying to learn that ah we're we're confident that that will be able to accurately measure that\nBut if you're if you're attempting to determine between 'em to surgeons who are both you know fairly experience let's say you've got one who's got um eight years of experience another who's got Twenty years of experience doing the same task or you likely to see a difference in the brain\nSo All right and so when it comes to a simple training tax for example what you'll see is that both you know in most cases are both of those surgeons really will have a mastery of that for any attack\nAnd they'll both exhibit a you know very high activation that correlate to expert team or the challenge though is for example a lot of times many surgeons will have different techniques offers Pacific procedures yet the patient outcome or the actual outcome of the procedure a is positive\nAnd so that when will start to see differences and motorcycle expertise based on those different techniques\nAnd in and of course surgery is more than just motor skills as well because you have decision making a if things aren't routine you have a lot of different experiential factors that come into this professor Helmand are your thoughts on the potential for this\nTo get to get your qualitative information about skill level\nSo I think um you know the way that this message works is is it uses I'm kind of Martin machine learning big day trip approaches that can take you know a lot of different complicated\nMeasurements and make sense of them and try and actually correlate into this outcome and so um the way that the analysis was done in this in this work you know you you you feed it and you say right this group this group is this this group is is is is highly skilled this group is less skilled and then it does a pretty good job of classifying between the two um I I think a a\nR and is is explaining very well the fact that it it can be a lot more complicated than that to be able to get to the the true expertise of an individual\nUm so you know you could then apply this to other areas to other places where you could take the same approach you could take the data and then you can compare it to a certain outcome and see whether your algorithm can\nPredict to select between two different things based on the quality of the data are great based on the information content and the data so you know your ability to discriminate between those two things is going to really depend on\nWhether or not you can measure something that represents that skill level in the brain\nCharles in South Los Angeles you're on TALK you wanted to ask about an area other than medicine\nThanks Larry yeah curious about whether this kind of ... as they used to measure whether ... or just an aptitude a or whether that is an area that uh the technology could be used to measure of last year the government\nYeah I understand draws you work with young people and so the instinct to to know if if there is some sort of an inborn aptitude or what kinds of things build musical skill professor Hillman your thoughts on that\nSo the closest I've seen is one of my colleagues actually works on evaluating the brains of baseball players and\nWhether they're able to differentiate between a coastal it's coming towards them or ... coming towards them and can measure these miniscule changes in their brain signals and the timing of them and they're actually you know looking to use this to help people to screen for people with a natural\nTalent for for baseball and\nThen a a a level of expertise a you know professional doses amateur so I I haven't seen personally a study that looks at at musical or artistic aptitude but I think extending into those areas um would would make perfect sense given given the power of of these sort of signals in the way that they can now be interpreted\nAnd the baseball study you're talking about not me on the top of it\nOf your head do um do they show that there is a difference in neural processing for better hitters versus those who have a harder time differentiating the type of bitch\nYes absolutely and in some way to the current study they're able to differentiate between people who are a skilled skilled in in in being able to judge what's coming towards them\nYou know I Want to thank you both so much for talking about the technology in the study uh that was led by a ruined him on a yard gas of the Chicago based start up food genius\nAlso our

homeless housing\nOr this is a parcel in Fullerton west side of the city\nThat would be used to create units of of housing for those who were homeless gander provide the kinds of supportive services necessary\nFor folks to be able to safely live their daily lives but a group of residents who live not far away are very concerned what it means for their community so we'll talk about that coming up a little bit later this hour\nIt's one of many of these sorts of skirmishes we've seen in communities where longtime residents are concerned about what a housing for the homeless means to their quality of life but first we turn our attention to these shake alert pilot project now shake alert\nIs the uh early warning system for earthquakes here in California and sensors are being deployed throughout the state so that if an earthquake um begins in one part of California\nThat the alert system traveling faster than\nThe actual ground motion of the quake would give people a few seconds warning a hand with automated systems you could perhaps have elevators immediately go to the nearest floor open up to people wouldn't be trapped\nYou could have automatic gas shut off if you were concerned about a massive earthquake or public transit for example bart is rolling out a pilot program that would um enabled they're barred light rail cars a subway cars to be able to respond\nJoining us to talk about where we're at in this whole experiment of\nOf shake alert is Robert Michael do group\nA staff scientist or with the shake alert earthquake early warning program at the U.S Geological Survey earthquake science center here in Pasadena Bob thank you for being with us thank you very much she's got to be an exciting time to see these pilot projects rolling out\nAnd I'm a ... really how many of these you have underway\nSo real approximately have forty projects going in a whole variety of areas communications transportation utilities and it's really exciting time from the standpoint of these the shake alert system as actually using the signals to be able to do real things\nAnd and I know that sensors are still being cited but for some of the areas that are most um most vulnerable to a major earthquake or the sense or the central re pretty robust\nAbsolutely uh by the end of twenty Eighteen fifty percent of the system will be built out but uh currently our greatest density of sensors are in Southern California the bay area and the Seattle Tacoma region\nAlright and uh so Monday I Know bart in the bay area we built this out [noise] so what specific what's the the automated system if bart gets an alert about a a major quake somewhere that could be felt in the bay area\nYeah so the bart system slow down all of their trains to twenty seven miles per hour and that's the initial thing that happens automatically\nAnd the great thing about that is as it happens in a seamless manner the system does it on its own the operator still can make some decisions about what to do to bring the train to a safe location but the whole idea is is that it's going to be part of a seamless writer experience\nSo it's not so I'm an advanced that for example it knows based on where bart car is where the safest location would be to take it where people could get we're not to that point yet\nNo and actually you can't take people out of the loop when it comes to something like that and so there that that's why we spent so much time training and why they spent so much time training there operators is to make those those decisions to fine tune with the system does automatically and then further that decision by taking people to a safe place\nI'm also curious about utilities shut off you know particularly natural gas one of the things we're told in the event of an earthquake is don't just automatically shut off your natural gas unless you smell unless you know there's a leak and then do it because if you shut it off it may be a long time where you can get a turned back on again\nHow does that then work with this early alert system safe for heavy industrial users where a natural\nGas leak could be catastrophic but you don't want to prematurely cut off the gas how does the alert system function in that\nSo one of our major applications currently is with an engineering company in the Pacific northwest college too and they're using the shake alerts signals to shut off water vows to protect water supplies\nAnd so what they're factoring into their design to their systems is to make sure that\nUm the decisions that they're making aren't going to be\nSort of irreversible and and so this is part of the long term care and feeding of our partners is to help them make the best decisions possible so that that recovery can happen very quickly and in a case of gas lines I mean yes I mean it takes a long time to get it opened up again once it's been shut off\nIt yeah stakes are high because you have the athlete can be catastrophic usually by the same token you don't want to indiscriminately shut it off yeah and I wonder too about just general warnings for people are how far we from\nThe day where offices for example could have some sort of an alert that goes off over a speaker when an early warning\nSo that people know to get you know to under their desks crude was safer location\nSo currently that it's it's actually happening now we have within our test group for example the city of Los Angeles on shakeout day next Thursday ten Eighteen at ... am\nThey will actually be doing a test of that type where an alert will be sent over a loudspeaker and people react to that so we're not doing it sort of to the brought us public yet but it's happening inside these offices now\nAnd uh I Know it's based on the distance of how far the ground motion is from the location that receiving it but let's take a hypothetical let's say a a portion of the southern CNN dress ruptures\nHow long um what's the the lack of time between the ground motion from the quake kidding said downtown Los Angeles and the alert heading downtown Los Angeles\nSo the great thing about shake alerts as they travel at the speed of light\nAnd so it takes about up to about five seconds for the earthquake to be detected in characterized\nAnd then the messages are available for distribution by our partners to fill out this actually instantaneously yes exactly and so the one piece that we're really working on is trying to get the distribution part of it down to a short enough time so that\nWe can give folks the shortest amount of of this gives me the longest amount of time to react to to the to the alerts\nOr so in the Senate dress and our that we've been talking about something in it were of a minute before heavy shaking a arrives in in the downtown was\n... and that may not sound like much but that's a lot of warning I mean if you had a full minutes before\nA major earthquake that's that is significant amount of time to do something to put yourself in a safer position\nAbsolutely so there are various kinds of protective actions people can take like drop cover and hold on that's just one of them one of many because you can be in a whole variety of situations but also we're speaking to the large variety of automated actions that can happen when the alert reaches a server for example and takes that action to slow down that train or open up firehouse store\nAnd would you see this eventually is something that could be almost universally applied for everybody including the smartphones\nAbsolutely and that's the U.S just as goal to bring it to everybody\nWe're talking with Robert Michael ... a staff scientist in coordinator with the shake alert earthquake early warning program\nAt the U.S geological surveys earthquake science center here in Pasadena also to join us momentarily from the state governor's office of emergency services Ryan Arba we'll talk with him as well about how the whole state of California\nWhen you listen to ... you

sighting of shelters as well as long term housing for those who are homeless in Southern California\nFrom Korea town to Venice and Orange County communities\nThere's been tremendous push back to the idea to putting dozens of people who are currently in the house into long term housing with permanent support residents express a variety of concerns about having this kind of housing established in their communities\nAnd one of the places where this is this playing out is in the north of Orange County city of Fullerton key PCC orange cats\nReporter Joel rep Vogel is with us to talk about a series that she's a hearing all this week on what's happening in Fullerton Joe thanks for joining us thanks so sure what this where this location is and or what the challenges are in the sighting at their\nSure it's in the western part of ... in the neighborhood is kind of loosely called the little Chapman Atlanta park neighborhood\nAnd it's kind of just long skinny triangle piece of land between a divided busy thoroughfare unforeseen thoroughfare and some railroad tracks but you know kind of all around there are middle class neighborhoods um some kind of smaller shopping centers there is some sort of mixed industry around there\nAnd um the neighbors that live nearby when they found out about this possibility of building supportive housing in this land a a lot of them were not happy\nAnd so there are concerns are about the similar problems to what they see with homeless people on the streets and yeah and uh problems that that presents yeah\nThere is a seasonal homeless shelter not far from there and there has been a and it you know there was an encampment at one point along the railroad tracks and and so people\nHave homeless people in their lives you know the first meeting where they discuss that a lot of people stood up and talked about finding needles in the park and um you know being scared to let their kids walk to school alone and and really kind of you know very personal family problems and concerns\nAnd and so you know it makes sense that they would equate the possibility of housing with these sorts of problems with experience on a daily basis\nOne probably one of their concerns is is the level of support going to be adequate for the needs of the people that are there because\nYou know in some cases if you've got people who are dealing with serious mental illness substance abuse problems the degree of intervention required the amount of person hours to work with those individuals is very high and if that's not really going to be presented probably residents are concerned that\nIt's it's not going to match the need and you're just going to continue the problems that are new location\nI Would say the two biggest concerns that I heard was one of\nThe people that will get housing this place or not that people that we see on the street at that for some reason these people are not going to qualify because they are either criminals or you know for some reason they're not they're not going to be the ones and so they're still going to be on the street and you're going to bring more people and\nAnd the other big one is people are very concerned about\nThe kind of standard model a permanent supportive housing which is\nThat you accept people with substance abuse problems with serious mental illness and you get them housed and then you work on those problems and the idea of possibly having you know drug users and people with with alcoholism living next to you know living in their neighborhood is really concerning to some people\nWhy I'd love to hear from you if this was played out in your community I I'm really interested in hearing your thoughts\nAbout efforts to try and come to some sort of agreement of
