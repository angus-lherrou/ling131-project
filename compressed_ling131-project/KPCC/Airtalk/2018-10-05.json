things along a Republican voters know\nNext on air talks which senators votes aren't fully locked down right after the news [noise]\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Luis give ... the U.S Senate is now marching toward a final Senate vote on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court\nThis as the American bar association has announced it is revisiting it's evaluation of cabinet after his Senate Judiciary committee appearance last week NPR's Kelsey Snell reports a final Senate vote is expected Saturday evening Senate Republican\nUh we were told that he watched some of the coverage earlier today\nUm and then of course I'm Susan Collins out at three PM something or if he's not watching he'll certainly be briefed on um you know her when she sees supposed to make a press conference at three about um her decision but mostly it's confident that the White House they've been pretty confident for the past\nFew days that this was going to get through and\nI'm no reason I think the question that but of course it's not over until it's over something they learned in the health care vote which is obviously reminds a lotta people up to and the the closeness\nI Want to mention a Susan Collins did vote today to move this to the Senate floor but she said that and I should mention noon Pacific time we're talking about at noon hour time she says she will be making a statement about her for their position on judge Kavanaugh\nSo the fact that she voted to move it\nSays that he will if necessary fly back to D.C immediately after the ceremony come back on his daughter's wedding day so that he can vote in favor of confirming judge Kavanaugh that was\nKind of an open question of course Republicans still have vice president Pence who could break any time he he can vote or with the Senate of course would vote for confirmation of judge Kavanaugh so that is also potentially\nA available to Republicans with us a Capitol bureau chief Capitol Hill bureau chief for Politico John brass man John thank you for joining us\nThanks for having me so we're awaiting Susan Collins elaboration on on what the extent or limits of her yes vote on cloture today means\nA Jeff Flake seems to indicate unless you know some huge event happens he's a yes vote for Kavanaugh um but we're still waiting to hear an elaboration from Democrat Joe Manchin a any word on when when that might be issued\nNo he left the building without a speaking he went in early this morning he went into the skiff which is the sensitive compartment it it's the secure room\nWhere the cabin our report by the FBI was and he spent probably about an hour in there he walked out he wouldn't tell reporters what he was going to do so he got to the floor and then he voted yes on\nA ending with filibusters everybody yes for cloture procedural vote in\nA and then he took off and he didn't really say where he was a where what he was um [noise] what he was going to be one final confirmation I suspect I Would think you'll be a yes I mean I Would be very surprised if it was anything but a yes at this point\nUm he's clearly been leaning that way and ah you know or you know I'm a\nA really hard time seeing as a new at this point\nThe way if if a Murkowski already voted against the cloture so we can say she's the solid no on confirmation in the sense come out with a statement elaborating that\nThat um she she doesn't support he has a nomination we have Collins is a little bit unclear at this point um but she did vote for for cloture to send it\nTo the for a vote tomorrow if Collins votes no well to mentally so you have Collins and Murkowski to Republicans who would vote against confirmation but you have mentioned voting in favor of it as a Democrat\nOr then provided you get Danes flying back to vote yes then parents would be the tie breaker\nYeah so you would but I really again I again I you know senator Collins wants to be can do three o'clock east coast time but again\nYou know I bet money she'll be a yes at this point um I think you have to look at what Susan Collins faces I remember she was a new on Obamacare on repealing Obamacare and there was a huge one we all remember McKean there late Senator John McCain the thumbs down\nA but again Collins and Murkowski we're both new that's where they were they were able to defeat the effort to repeal Obamacare of Collins who's up for reelection and twenty twenty if she were to vote down Sharon on this point is everything at stake\nI mean you know\nI mean she made famous face a primary challenge to begin with but I Would guarantee you know she would be you know she votes and and she's clearly\nA you know seems like she's open to Kavanaugh she called the FBI investigation a thorough investigation um I mean I Would be surprised if she's now at this point but yes if she was\nA no and in Murkowski rains or no\nAnd I will follow with a state wide live call in shows so I'll be heard in San Francisco San Diego up and down California will take listeners' calls not just from here in Southern California but we'll hear from our fellow public radio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs that film week next coming up at noon right now we're hearing from the two candidates for Orange County sheriff\nDo can win joining us Don Don's with us as well Mr him to win is an investigator for the LA county district attorney's office Don Barnes has spent his career with the Orange County sheriff's department and is currently the under sheriff\nI think it's safe to say that many observers perhaps maybe Mr into winning self\nWere surprised that he ended up being in the run off there were three candidates\nOr Mr and when you argue believe we're the least known of the three not having hail the public or high profile position I'm and I'm under share of Barnes just barely missed I'm avoiding a runoff in and getting over fifty percent of the vote\n'em to what do you attribute this the fact that that you qualified for the runoff\nYou know thank you I'm a Larry like I said to my my in my a primary run 'em my goal is to a unite and also at the same time change the culture at the Orange County sheriff department and I talked about", "show_name": "Airtalk", "year":
