{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "She wrote about her complaints in the recent LA Times op ed deer Los Angeles you seriously need to learn how to behave in restaurants\nThat only Gregory is here now to talk about the bad the ugly and maybe even the good of LA's food lovers and also to offer advice to improve both the servers and the patrons restaurant experience will take to get to be here or you work the ... fine dining restaurant at a pizza place in the bay area what types of restaurants have you worked out here in Los Angeles\nOh lots of different types but ah I've tended to stray away from fine dining just because I\nUsed to be very formal I'm not a very small person so I'm kind of a lot of Castro pub be strode around that kind of thing so you know people that fine dining yeah that's true that's true um so that you know nice but still you know you can wear jeans and you're not going to get you know thrown out the door\nNow what kinds of differences did you notice about restaurant patriots versus the bay area when you when you started kind of getting involved in the whole thing\nSure well I I Would definitely notice kind of the ... of the eating a little bit I Would say I try to modify the menu absolutely someone asked me once if they could use the fish that was fried fish and chips\nAnd could we boil it and put it on the side of a salad she basically wanted like I think like an all he salad which we didn't have ... so it was kind of like well yes we can boil that fish but that fish is meant for frying ... so you might not enjoy it says we're\nWe're menu modern fires with ... mental better part\nOf it and I think that's kind of built in the sort of like health food culture that's down here which I think is great you know I Love a good juice for smoothie like anybody but um you know I just would recommend if you're a vegetarian maybe not going to eat it animal\nSo qualifies as bad behavior then for for LA restaurant Gore's\nI think we could all just be a little bit more kind to servers and when we walk into a restaurant they want you to have a good time you know I I Want you to have a good time and uh you know I don't want you to walk away feeling bad or that your experience was horrific\nAt the same time I think we could all just see a little bit more patients and and realize that you're there to enjoy the food and and I think this has changed a lot in the nine years I've lived here but LA restaurants it's a kind of about being\nPerhaps and then know dust and it's the layout of the restaurant and the way the decor looks and not necessarily the food\nWell my big break might be around the corner data law started on ... wrote the LA Times of the Los Angeles you seriously need to learn how to behave in restaurants out in response to your article we ought to be one Facebook to share their thoughts about the behavior of Eli servers\nLeaves you with us here's what one of our followers of Jim Hester wrote on our page judges that I read her op ed piece she forgot that her job is to serve customers customers are not there for her yes customers should be courteous\nBut there are there for the meal not for the server uh ...\nYeah I mean I I agree they're not there for the server uh you know they're there for the the food and the experience and I totally agree with that you know I feel like my main message of the peace again is or is it they'll just be nicer to each other let's understand you know and I to servers to\nRecognize that people in there to have a good time and try to facilitate that good time in a polite efficient manner and likewise for people who go out to eat recognize that\nYour server as a human feelings and thoughts and parents and aunts and uncles and uh if they're they're trying to they're trying to make you have a good time so I think it's just a two way street uh like let's I'll be nice to each other\nHuman on your time yeah I knew my cup of coffee in your article speaking of copyright about brunch patrons you don't need to keep asking me for coffee I already know you need a gallon of it but we only have so many coffee pots I'll get to you when I can out some might argue that other customers should be able to ask for coffee during brunch as many times they want\nAnd its servers were there to give the patrons good experience not the other way around ...\nIf you ask any server who works brunch they will tell you that is the worst shift um and it's chaotic and crazy and\nYeah I mean I did work at this one place where the you know it's nonstop with the coffee and it was the thing of just like you know finite resources like I could only get a coffee pot to them so much but I Would because I got\nAsked for it so much and when you're juggling you know six seven tables that's a lot of coffee and so I Know it's the morning guys but they're the coffee machine can only produce so much coffee and I do have to compete with it with other servers and I remember one time in um in like the server in this restaurant we all had a conversation like not only a\nHow much coffee do you like to get like Phil people up and they were asking like do you give them like two three four cubs I was like I just keep filling it\nOne problem I Would have with that is that I have a very delicate mix in terms of cream to splendor to coffee and then all of a sudden I've got a perfectly I'm drinking it's halfway through and all of a sudden it gets filled up again in the hole\nYeah well I always I always you know bringing the coffee but more cost more coffee I Do a you know do you need the coffee because I Know what you mean I have a sweet spot you with cream and sugar so\nYou really must really noticed all these differences because I always figured the diners are kind of the same everywhere but LA's really different\nProbably it's actually just everywhere like it's our culture of how we eat out in restaurants perhaps in the country and maybe we need to look at that and changed the way we behave altogether as a nation\nRattling road regal server comedian living in Los Angeles you wrote the LA Times op ed deer Los

so much talk about from the federal American caravan so much more it's all coming up right after the news [noise]\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Lakshmi Singh the Trump Administration is preparing to end assistance to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador countries from which thousands of people have fled in search of greater safety and paying work\nYeah I mean they should say Trump today it claimed that there were a large number of what he\nCalled middle Easterners mixed in with this group I'm I should just say that I didn't meet a single person in the middle East I'm in the dozens of interviews I've done in the last couple of days and\nMost people I talked to were poor or looking for a better opportunity in the United states or were flight fleeing violence um that has become really endemic under us\nA tweet from earlier today by President Trump a sadly it looks like ... believes the military are unable to stop the caravan heading to the southern border the United states criminals an unknown middle Easterners or mixed in\nI've alerted border patrol a military that this is a national emergency must change laws Kay thank you appreciate your being with us and providing a you're on the scene a count of of ah some seven thousand Central American migrants as they make their way through southern Mexico thank you\nTo Kavanaugh immigration so this is really about pumping up the Republican base and getting their voters out who have been somewhat discouraged\nA and a democratic our base that is very very fired up to vote in the elections his job\nAnd we're going to talk about a number of those issues you raised including Hillary Clinton's higher profile in the past couple of weeks Elizabeth Warren's\nDNA cast and more uh in fact coming up in our second hour we're going to open up the phones and ask you when you would be comfortable using a particular racial or ethnic background\nOr to talk about it with with friends or to put it in applications or or registries at how close would that relationship has to be for you to do at the DNA test of Elizabeth Warren six to ten generations back\nOr that there is a an American Indian Native American in her background\nMy question for you coming up getting our second hour as if you've ever experienced as to what point do you talk about what level of documentation would you feel or closeness that you feel you need to have\nRight now our focus on the top political issues that includes of course the disappearance of 'em you've all ... who is the dissident writer from Saudi Arabia\nWho disappeared inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul the Turkish government claims it has documentation that ... was killed there and his body dismembered and removed from the site\nThis of course leaving the Trump Administration in a difficult position a Carson Bruno I'm we're expecting I guess Turkey's report tomorrow I Believe\nOn this and um if it stock if it if it's further reinforced that um people closely involved with the Saudi involve a government and the crown prince did this how does the president need to respond to\nThis is a particularly tricky situation both for the Trump Administration but I think more broadly just for our allies in Europe or who have taken a much stronger stance than the Trump Administration has\nA but then also for players in the middle east I mean it's definitely a something where are the details are starting to unfold and it's hard to kind of make sure that we are getting the information not through the lens or filter of where that information is coming from either through turkey or through the Saudis themselves\nDoesn't make sense for us to do its own investigation because turkey has its agenda obviously a Saudi royals half their agendas makes sense for us to do an agenda I Do a a a manifestation without either agenda\nI I I Believe that there is value there especially given the fact that a Tuskegee was uh living in the United states was a columnist for the Washington Post\nAh definitely connected to the United states and the and those sort of way so there's definitely reason for the United states to do so um but also I think on setting aside just all the details but also be very a value to the Trump Administration who has been very anti press\nFrom the very beginning also to really show that the administration is stepping up the United states is taking the freedom of speech a remote depressed very seriously\nBecause there are ramifications if the administration really just doesn't\nUh follow through with this appropriately about what does that mean for the press in other locations United States but also outside the United states who may not be as favorable to criticism\nJust ended Congress take this up with the administration says it's not going to do anything\nMan that's what I was going to say which is Trump does not control all the pieces here and not just because of the global and geopolitical politics around us but also the Congress they've shown early on they slapped extra sanctions on Russia's Russia remember early in the administration\nOr when they didn't feel that this administration was doing enough and and Trump was\nA sort of just playing for students who in the entire time you have many of the senators and members of cars are very upset about us all ... of both parties is a bipartisan issue this is a very you have a you know an opaque kingdom there you have this uh been Solomon thirty three year old a prince\nBack into the political scene or at the national level\nMath your thoughts about Hillary Clinton's are coming you know resurfacing\nFor your ah\nYour your experience are you hearing I heard from a ... ah\nWell no the issue is that\nWe sort of where we go from one of ... what a lot of politicians do very very well off of counter punching having someone to go after he's an inch normally if I you know he seems like he's on office but he's actually in a very effective counter punter and he does better when he has Boogie Man that he can go after\nAnd the fact is the Democratic party at some point he's going to need to move on from the Clintons now is this maybe maybe she runs given twenty twenty I don't know ... ... may maybe Chelsea runs\nA but at some point that real but realistically that's not going to happen in twenty twenty I think the respect of the Clintons who's going to exist there's always been a fashion that fascination with what they do some of it they are a lot of it unfair but it is what it is and so when she in\nA interject herself into arguments she's just a very divisive figure now we can you can think that that's a\nWeird for good reasons for bad reasons or it's unfair but it's a reality of the situation she's probably not helpful because what she's really able to do is to galvanize the Republican base like nobody galvanize the Republican base you see these two or three or four issues that that the president's really trying to use now again we saw Washington Post poll come up Trump's up to forty seven percent\nApproval rating ... that's his highest you think that\nThe economy or what are you what do you think I think I spent I think part of it as the economy I think he's been a little bit less crazy last few weeks I think I got the cabin offing through I\nThink the bottom line is the victories of victory they did get cabin author I think voters did have some concerns even though they don't like Calvin I think they had some concerns about how that played out he's been a little bit less a sort of out there shall we say and when he does that and if people just look at the economy and he's\nAnd he's been talking more about the economy people say well you know things are really good historically good uh and so I think when he sticks to that he tends to do pretty well there's a lot of other storm clouds on the horizon here with him so he's obviously a loose cannon but\nI think as far as Hillary goes she is what he wants she's a cultural touchstone she's become almost like our own cultural issue she's her own issue and herself a it's probably not helping Democrats withdraw to mind as we're not going to get away from the Clintons as a party until there's a new nominee and twenty twenty and then the party's gonna reset and that's not going to happen for another year year and a half or ...\nMatt ... Carson Bruno with us\nAs we talk about the top political stories also wanted to ask you about uh\nThe ranking of elected officials in public places are Mitch McConnell and his wife Elaine Chao went out to dinner and uh you were arraigned over dinner there have been a number of of these insects on Nancy Pelosi had this happened to her recently\nCarson your your thoughts on this and and um you know at some point our our elected officials gonna have to you know\nCome out against this sort of thing or do you think people are just accepting this way it's going to be\nOn one side you have when you run for public office you're you have to expect that you're going to be in the public eye whether that's you know being attacked a vote your social media I'm being you know the verbally attacked in social settings and in the public\nAt the same time however we've gotten to a tenor of this sort of\nUm approach that I think could be really detrimental to to politics\nOr it could dissuade a good individuals who I'm really want to make a good impact or smart who are effective uh from actually running for office because they don't want their their lives with her family's lives drove through the mud or attacked when they're just trying to have a nice lunch or dinner with with a family or friends\nOr it could also rarely forests\nPositions to start to double down on this vicious very partisan polarization of us versus them you're the enemy I'm that good a which isn't good when you're talking about a a democratic system and and trying to get policies through that actually are helping the situation not actually trying to pick one side versus the other side\nOf the Republicans have complained that that some Democrats have even you know fuel this with comments that they've they've made that you know essentially is fair game is President Trump's fault and started it and this is how we're gonna continue what do you think about\nThat yeah I think this was going to play out from under twenty twenty I Try and I think it was actually one of the key I think it's going to be a touchstone issue for just American politics in general the course of the next couple of years which is why are we supposed to engage in politics you got so and this is happening really in all parts of culture and society social media what are you supposed to do if you don't like someone who shot\nA ... an animal over in Africa or did you threaten them and do you chase them to their lives be destroyed should they be ruined we've seen is a question around me to have seen this question around any people who get caught on cell phone cameras it's now ABC on college campuses and it's now bleeding into our public life what is you know what is a reaction to repeat someone does something that you\nPersonally morally I disagree with how are you supposed to react to that I don't know the answer to I don't think anybody does I Do think there's political risk to this because I Do think watching some of the stuff is happening around Calvin on chasing people in restaurants of chasing people down the hall and banging on the Supreme Court door\nYou know you look at the history of the last hundred years Americans don't typically like that type of stuff even though the activists\nGet very into it but I think this is going to be a big issue playing out in twenty twenty whether you're on the Obama side of when they go low we go high or their their cultures are when they go low we check them and I think this is coming to a ... I think this is going to be a big part of the Democratic primary in twenty twenty\nOr ride map Carson thank you both so much for being with us Matt Rodriguez democratic strategist Carson Bruno assistant dean Pepperdine school of public policy it's the talk on eighty nine point three K PCC coming right out but it's the triple play with Nick gay and me\nWe talked Dodger baseball the world series game one tomorrow now an update from eddy Leonard he's looking\nForward to the trio and a reminder to listeners today's the last day for online registration if you want to cast a ballot November sixth in California you can go to register to vote dot C.

these these these ... such a pleasure the two gentlemen with me were with the yesterday for our open house broadcast in the noon hour case you missed it I Hope you'll come for our next open house probably about a year from now\nBut as the triple play Nick Roman of all things considered a Martinez if take to yours truly Larry natural as we review the start of the world series tomorrow the Dodgers\nDid it game seven as there are fence woke up from what had been a home runs slumber a are facing a Boston team that won a record a franchise record\nNumber of games a team stocked with talents or with pitching to it's going to be a tough task for the Dodgers\nAnd they're going to the city tomorrow and Wednesday that invented the phrase be LA being LA that's when the Lakers Celtics yeah and then they just had a uh NBA Finals uh about ten years ago as well so ... is going to be definitely unfriendly a place for the Dodgers play\nThat one only went five the red Sox eliminating the actress who I thought were better this year than last year and now the Dodgers have to take on the red Sox Michael in Newport Beach how do you handicap the series\nYeah just first of all did a good show you guys are the I like what Mr average did during that shaken up in that game seven with this line up and you get to stay away from a TV at all that great a\nCertain extent Vegas said if you had a seven game series that is almost a pick up the gadgets political there are only a thirty cents which means Las Vegas is it's damn near a pick them so they get ... pretty good at\nAll right of course uh the Dodgers are\nThe larger medium market closer to Vegas that may have some effect on the line there too and the red Sox with a home field advantage in the series because they had the better regular season read what they want a hundred eight\nLegs James yeah yeah which is a monster very very hard to again remember that the American league was loaded with a lousy teams I mean the Baltimore Orioles were awful uh who else was royals were tear royals launcher along the way I saw or allowed seems arguably in the American Lee yeah\nAnd and so that the numbers are a little bit skewed there and I knew that that coming in I think I said one time earlier that\nComing into the playoffs the red Sox were like one game above five hundred against playoff teams are in the Dodgers were winning two at a three against playoff teams really doesn't make much difference now where we are I mean it it all depends on\nOn a a you know who is hot who's doing well who's healthy ah and and so we'll see\nHow much does the um eccentric nature of Fenway Park factor into this because my sense is that I'm In playoff series the visiting team struggle a bit with the oddities of the park\nIn two thousand for the Dodgers went to Fenway from inter league game uh enter the series that was Frank McCourt first big returned back to Boston\nAnd a lot of Dodger players especially the pictures they wanted to be on the mound is was hours before the game just to feel what it was like to have\nThat at their back they they'd never experienced it before they didn't know what it was like especially ones that have never been in the American league really\nSo they actually had to get accustomed to how it feels ... is a shoe box and it feels that way where you are right in the middle as opposed to Dodger Stadium which is very wide open and you almost feel like you're in a prairie so diverse that old dodge shaded him yeah they do have to get accustomed to it yes rise as trying to think so Chris\nTaylor he played in the American league right now right on that briefly just ... trying to think we're which Dodger route and filters well\nUh uh none of the outfielders I don't think have have have that any real significance to National League or and yeah yeah they're all I'm now in terms of hitters I mean the shadow was been there many many times in ... as well so there's a chance that they'll they'll they'll know what to do against that the pitchers and know how to\nHow to handle that and not get lured into you know wow I just pulled that ball it's gonna you know\nYears and years and years ago or land dissipate a great player for a man be paid for the St Louis cardinals went in there and people thought he was going to hit a zillion home runs in the world series did nothing\nOn the pitchers have to worry about that too because they they feel that thing right behind them so the left hand or do they pitch to avoid someone pulling it\nUm and how do they figure out exactly what happens when that thing is so ever present you haven't seen Fenway Park out there you got ticket picked look at a picture on Google Google image as it is odd if you've never seen that big giant green monster just lingering over the field it's quite a sight\nIt's weird and when you're in Boston you see how family situation like it's just wage ... an exam regularly look expansive way it's Fenway as just you know ... into the block on on which it sets\nI Wonder about the effect on shift for those who aren't baseball fan this how were you move your defensive players around to play the tendencies or Peter's where they typically hit the ball but I Wonder if the odd dimensions at Fenway does that have an effect you think on where players position themselves\n... it's it's hard to say I I think that ah you know that the number one thing that you have to just keep remembering is uh you can't look at that wall you have to look at the batter and you have to pitch the bad guy and make sure that that guy does what he doesn't want to do\nA ... and so I I don't think the daughters will change too much certainly on the left ... they're going to they're going to shift on on the left handed hitters for sure\nThere's a lot of space in right center unless there's a lot of real estate in right center in in left field the not so much because that wall just kind of just through the center\nFor you and you don't want to be tricked by by that right field line because it's actually it's kind of funky you can hit you're going to you're going to hit a home run sort of curve one and rotten eggs Johnny\nAnd and so it looks like wow there's a lot of room out there I can hit something the fence by the bullpen says very low so you know a line drive could go right over it um and so can an outfielder\nAs so you know it's it's it's a weird kind of place and and you you just hope that you you pitch as well as possible lotta left hander get real intimidated there too\nI I I think a Julio ... yeah the young pitchers come back from a having a shoulder rebuilt I think he could be a real key here now he wasn't even on the roster individual playoff series but pitched a had at least two appearances in the championship series\nNot sure he's going to be on the ... the only reason is because Scott Alexander has tons of American League experience and and so I I ... I was thinking about yeah I thought ... looked pretty good does look good and so they may have to make a decision about\nYou know he is I don't know if if Alexander was held out because he is not healthy or because they just felt it was a better match up\nBut I I Would suspect that that American League experience that Scott Alexander has would put him on the roster\nBut we'll see yeah it makes sense feat with all the other part that I'm thinking about too is that the Dodgers going to spend the next two days in Boston and I'm just thinking about all the different Laker players that I've talked to over the years about those final series in Boston I Would not eat any hotel\nI was going to be with us Jeffrey went Coby with that fact when he got food poisoning you forever no right from bring your own food allegedly from the hotel allegedly a [laughter] ... got sick and that was a playoff series graduate if if you got sick once really well the one\nGood advantage that the Dodgers have is that you know Babe Ruth does not playing and this was the other one back in sixteen\nI don't know if I ever told you destroy my great grandfather got on the train from Los Angeles to go to Chicago to see my my grandfather his son graduated from medical school rush medical school in Chicago\nAnd is it gets on the uh the train in Los Angeles sees the newspaper the babe Ruth is going to be playing at ... park uh the Yankees were in town\nSo guess what he did instead of go to his son's graduation\nWhile yeah I actually agree with him on that we ah well what am I ever get out of jail they really are our son and he ditched his son's battle school graduation rates the power of\nI probably told that story on my grandfather wasn't in listening to our dog joined eighty nine point three K PCC thank you gentlemen as always the triple play you'll be hearing from a few days\nComing up at noon on K PCC it's fresh air with Terry Gross talking with Melissa McCarthy who stars and can you ever forgive me as a biographer turned literary forgery she'll talk about the film her breakout in bridesmaids and playing Trump's former press secretary Sean Spicer on Saturday Night live\nOn November six K.

Erica Al Green the times breaking this story about the department of health and Human Services also with us from land a lamp to link legal in their D.C office\nSasha Booker thank you very much for being with us hey Larry thanks for having me on your program\nSo why your thoughts how would this affect first of all a trans Americans um would they potentially not be covered by discrimination under title nine\nYou know very very admittedly know what it does do is send the a terrible message to transgender gender knocking foreign people\nAcross the country that the government does not have their back or the department of health and Human Services memos completely completely out of step with the Supreme Court precedent in over\nFears of a case law that clearly assist apple is that sex is not defined in the way they think it does you know it's all stems from a case that the Supreme Court heard involving it wasn't a transgender woman it was just it was a woman who\nWas up for a promotion and our employers the you know you need to be more feminine you need to go to charm school like literally told her she needed to\nDo it up and she refused and she brought her case forward and her employer made the argument that says arguing that some of the sexes not it is it does not include a gender stereotypes about how a man or woman should behave but it should be strictly construed to\nBe some kind of dystopian a definition that restricts the sex so tightly that it eliminates transgender people in the Supreme Court said no that's not going to fly and since\nThat was decided in Nineteen Ninety Nineteen eighty nine was the case after case a just in the last year are we seeing several move forward that you know clearly undermines this this notion that sex can be understood that way so uh but again it does send a terrible message you know that so\nIt's more symbolic as you see a than a practical effect\nYeah exactly you know it's part of you know this administration has a clear hostility towards transgender people whether you're talking when open transgender military service a re sending the guidance for transgender students\nAre trying to remove us from the senses telling the center for Disease Control that they can't use the word transgender I mean if if that isn't clear animas\nTargeting our community I don't know what is\nYour message we're talking with Lambda Legal staff attorney Sasha Booker also with us Brad deck is president and founder of the Pacific justice Institute that's based in California but today it's good to have you with us again or do you think this would be a substantive change\nBut no actually it it wouldn't and I'm really surprised about some of the responses I just heard of the fact is a title nine has been long defined as a matter of a terms of case law as well as regulatory\nA force as well as the legal definition of sex or to be based on ... biology it wasn't and this is going on for decades it wasn't until a President Obama decided to unilaterally or somehow try to change the definition that we have this controversy the fact is the this\nLive as legislation title that was passed by the legislature by Congress signed into law by the present respected for decades um this is simply undoing\nA a an out of line a ... effort by President Obama is somehow change the law unilaterally which is totally disrespectful for our whole a legal a concept as far as um especially like as far as like case all those cases that that no there is no case law or interpreting title nine or mandating that\nRedefining sex as a matter of case absolutely not effects is quite the contrary and as far as medical protections\nThey say will people with medical conditions were like we're not talking about people who have adrenal insensitivity ... those are very very rare um that's biological and that's the term in\nA in terms of that from that and we're talking about people with a mental condition gender identity just for ya where they think of themselves differently than what\nEvery single cell in their body says what they are um that's what we're dealing with him and the issue here is what a civil rights as well um title nine was there the purpose was to protect women young girls\nTo have an equal opportunity when it comes to sports athletic competition\nThis interpretation trends that completely on its head\nAnd deprives young women for example in California young woman was\nBooted off a basketball team couldn't couldn't play basketball because a male biological males who thought he was a female but a biological melt all the advantages of masculinity of being a male\nI took her place instead that is exactly what title nine is there to prevent to protect the civil rights and opportunities of young women who have a different bodies and different uh advantages and disadvantages with regards\nTo mail or bread day is with us in the Pacific justice Institute Sasha book or you want to respond to that\nYeah I just don't understand what kids lab rats referring to the case like I read is clearly clearly shown a referring to ... to ... uh uh just two years ago you know that clearly held that I'm a ... a\nProhibiting students from using a restroom consistent with their gender identity is a violation of title nine it's pretty clear that builds on you know again decades of kids love it it's found under title seven under the Affordable CARE Act or under any previous printed sex discrimination includes a discrimination based on gender stereotypes\nAre also about his characterization of essentially the majority of cases this is the psychological condition as he described it not something that's biological\nYeah and you hear that argument a lot and and the idea is to restrict the definition so tightly that you force transgender people into the shadows a but he's wrong\nWrong both on the on the on the law is also wrong on medicine you know we've submitted many declarations from you know physicians I'm not a doctor so this is my er ... and I'm guessing it doesn't his either but you know people understand sex to be more complicated than you know the narrow myopic way that you know he's seeking to define it\nYou know sexy ... encompasses a all kinds of things like who your hormonal levels your sexual orientation or gender identity\nYour genetics you know et cetera and it's you know as you mentioned there are people with different conditions that have different chromosomal make ups but again the main point is that the slide directly into the face of twenty five years of case law that holds the sex is not interested in a way that he thinks it is\n... how would this play out here in California where there are specific protections for transgender Californians would this have any effect here\nYeah I I first have to comment on that I'm at and I know ... is not an attorney and I I totally respect that and uh but the reality is a sex has been defined for decades buy insurance regulations as ... as well as case law pursuant to title nine as being biological period President Obama\nIs the one who swore did that unilaterally a total disregard for the legal process and the concept of adoption of law as far as California goes um the state of California are would be impacted in terms of a federal funding\nA school districts specifically school districts in states that decided not to comply with with title nine are subject to losing\nFederal funding and that is something that the state of California is going to have to to weigh and whether or not which way they wanted to follow that um that uh you know it is as far as the uh the the concept of\nOf equal treatment to females at a disadvantage to females um that's the purpose of the title nine so they are not shunned off the basketball team by some what who is a biological a male I said it's hard to define as all these factors know biologically medically speaking\nUm it is is genetically speaking you're either ... or X Y or Z manifest in terms of brain development as well as sexual Oregon development a bone structural development and it's all unanimously in agreement as a mental psychological condition gender right it is for a a DNS for Dan is five\nValidate that so we need to be truthful and honest with what we're dealing with the same time we do need to have compassion understanding for those who have just for you it's a real condition forty one percent will commit suicide\nUm in their lifetime it's very serious and it\nNeeds it should not ignored as well so I say no we need to have compassion and understanding but we'd also be fair and not abused a federal law titles ... title nine it was intended to protect the civil rights of particularly okay\nI I just want to clarify you might have misheard Brad Pitt Sasha was saying uh she wasn't a doctor but she is an attorney staff attorney at Lambda Legal so I I yeah corrected\nI stand corrected on that but I assure you I'm as this matter gets a prolonged it and it is litigated um there is a the case law and and the court and the Supreme Court ah will back up the historical a definition of similar\nAs it's been defined as as it was\nIf I Need I Need to break bread daycare said the Pacific justice Institute thank you so much for being with us Sasha Booker Lambda Legal quick closing comment on where you see this going\nWhen you have a mixture of them I have no problem actually having a career path for those who want to remain in custody when it comes to the leadership supervision of the custody environment however there is no greater are proving grounds and training than actually working in patrol environment or you have to\nEncounter a lot of situations you had to do a lot of critical decision making were very few resources you're not in a controlled environment and you learn to actually manage situations real critical that as an incident as well that translates very very well when you have supervision and it costs the environment\nWe're talking with Alex be in a way that the challenger to incumbent LA county sheriff Jim McDonnell if you have questions for him you can put it on our air talk page key PCC dot org\nOr one of the central points of your candidacy is that under shark McDonnell recruitment is falling off significantly and you've got\nMany many open positions that have gone on filled the sheriff says\nThis is a problem that that isn't just that the sheriff's department every law enforcement agency is having a difficult time recruiting enough people are going to pass through all the requirements to get into law enforcement so what's your response to the point that everybody in law enforcement's having this challenge everyone has those same\nThe pressures of the our youth today really not interested in law enforcement is that they were in the past public sector has to compete with the private sector particularly when you have a very very low unemployment rate however arty ... is the on facing severe understaffed and to the point where Fifteen hundred deputies\nUnder what we're supposed to be and we're shrinking last year twenty Seventy we actually had one hundred\nEmployees less than when we started the year this year we achieved that mark\nA dubious distinction the first six months alone of twenty Eighteen so we're on pace to lose two hundred ... by the end of twenty Eighteen so we are shrinking department is directly related to Jim McDonald's mass firing spree you cannot hire and recruit people it's an organization when you're bragging about how many people you're firing\nWell but it is the firing because he sees it as as changing the culture of the organization that needs change\nNo that is straight is literally a political relations stunt all it is he's trying to create a a pile of of career heads that he's decapitated however when you look at how many cases that he's losing when these cases are challenged\nIn civil service commission is when they're challenging superior more able to peel they're firing right and they lose them and the taxpayer pays dearly because they have to pay for the time they were away from work which they were compensated if they were fired and then they have all their back with interest they get that back plus we lost their service during that time\nAnd the the court costs are enormous\nUh I also wanted to ask you about a managerial experience one of the things that the sheriff said did you pointed out that you really haven't had high level managerial experience you reach I Believe the level of lieutenant in the department long career thirty two years with the Las T\nBut if you're going to manage your department with the thousands of employees and the complexity of the county sheriff's department what are the ways that you're going to get yourself up to speed develop those managerial chops deleted from this big if you're elected\nWell I could start by saying being a military vetting being a commissioned officer in the military with thirty two years of institutional knowledge I've seen for over three decades how bad the permits being led by the executive staff and now by the current sheriff\nDoesn't take a rocket scientist figure out there's a right way to do the job and he doesn't really under ... and he likes to say oh I've only led Eighteen people out of the department which apparently doesn't understand the\nThe scope of responsibilities lieutenants on his own department because some of them like Ninety five percent of the chiefs of police throughout the entire nation have less responsibilities and a shift watch can matter it was some of our larger facilities that's how big the organization is\nBut I'll take Eighteen people lead well in the right direction versus Eighteen thousand people that wrong\nOkay but my question to you is it I mean they're still going to be a learning curve if you're if you're elected this position\nUm I don't think anybody would go into a managerial challenge like this and just you know feel right away they were up to speed so what is your plan if you were elected to get up to speed on the scope of the department\nOne is I have to recruit some talent from outside of the department expertise so we currently don't have\nI'm also going to recruit some retired executives who have left in disgust and they're willing to sacrifice a few years there already a little bit older and in age\nThey want to come back they want to help me fix the department I'm going to surround myself with a command executive staff that knows what they're doing they're going to provide me good and you know good guidance of what I'm going to do of course there's a learning curve\nAs a learning curve when a certain comedians are run as or became president United States\nAnd guess what every the buses rent on time everything happened and we were well defended\nAs becoming share if that means we're certainly answer and I will one cause we're still going to be dispatching units were still going to be investigating crimes are still going to be manager or jail systems were going to start repairing all the damage that has happened over the last Twenty years it's going to take a lot of work from a lot of people\nAnd I have a very solid vision of how we can bring this department for this reform rebuild and restore this my platform the very beginning and I've articulated each and every component of it and we're going to get the job done\nMr ... thank you for being with us we appreciate it very much thank you Alex be underway those candidates for Los Angeles county sheriff\nHe's facing the incumbent Jim McDonnell sharp McDonald is scheduled to join us as well on a one on one conversation you're listening to talk on eighty nine point three ... cc last week with the Senator Elizabeth Warren coming out with her DNA tests showing that well back in her family's history there was\nA a Native American um my question for you is if you've had maybe a family history passed down generationally about particular racial or ethnic background\nHave you talked about that if you felt confident in it have we been tested for it\nAnd uh and
