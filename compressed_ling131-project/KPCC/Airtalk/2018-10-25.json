{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "If you're going to use a hologram that picks The Likeness of celebrity that's going to implicate a different set of rights that could be owned by others\nNow here in your experience what's the biggest legal obstacle to creating holograms of deceased figures and performers\nSo if you have a the consent of the state then there's really no issue I think where we're going to see a legal issue where it's going to be interesting to\nTo see what courts do is when you have an expressive work like a motion picture that uses a celebrity because generally\nA expressive works are protected by the first amendment and so there's more leeway given as opposed to for example using the celebrity in a commercial for hamburgers\nHow close are we there that the ... how much how much more time before that we cross into that realm\nIt's really already here you saw in the uh in the new ah Star Wars movie they had a couple of ah every creations of deceased actors and you're already seeing\nA certain celebrities in studios digitizing themselves while they're young so that they can uh\nBe exploited or or a used ... computer generated images of themselves down the\nLine here that's crazy just did you digitizing yourself while you're young\nThat's right because look ... you know you're that way in in a sense if you want to be able to preserve your legacy and have roles as you get older um it's it's one way to ah to capitalize whether you're a studio or or an actor\nAnd I know that an Amy Winehouse in this case her father Mitch is a donating the proceeds from her hologram concert to the Amy Winehouse foundation is gonna help people with substance abuse I'm Aaron what are the arguments legal or not in favor of bringing these celebrities back so to speak\n[noise] look I personally wouldn't want to go see a Amy Winehouse in a hologram form is she really never liked to tour when she was on live um I Would have loved to see her then but it's it's for me it just seems distasteful um I'm sure that there's lots of people though who would go see it\nIs there an argument that you think for people maybe that had never seen her live or maybe someone young that remembers her seen her on on TV and says gosh I Wish I Wonder what it would have looked like or felt like to see her in\nPerson or is it really impersonal absolutely just to me it seems gimmicky\nYeah Jeff Bercovici UCLA in the past few years hologram performance as I've been getting kind of popular why are they taking off now you think\nWell I think they're getting cheaper to create and really I think the stage effect itself as being perfected so it's it's easier to do and bring it out to people\nI think people are more and more comfortable also with kind of the intertwining of their physical life and digital life and so it's not surprising and maybe not as distasteful for some people\nAnd and I think also people still want to go to live performances to see things that are are not on screens to enjoy it with other people so this kind of opportunity to have the best of both worlds I think is exciting for people\nJeff where do you stand morally on it though I Aaron kind of thing you wouldn't want to go see an Amy Winehouse hologram cancer what about you what we would how do you feel on on this stuff\nI I think I Would rather actually see a great concert video or something like that because of the way that it shows different aspects of the of the performance I don't really have in a moral objection to it if it's something that\nUm is consistent with the artists a style of performance in any way of being so I I'm not sure actually about the Amy Winehouse case but I think\nUm you know this is why in a lot of cases I think it's nice that the families involved because they get to think about is is this what would they would have wanted how they would have wanted their legacy to to go forward\nDoes it qualified Jeff as a performance so if I went to go see this could I say I went to see and Amy Winehouse performance\nI'm not sure I Would say that I I have a pretty broad definition of performance I think if there are\nOther musicians that are playing live if there are other folks that are their allies\nAre then absolutely I Would call the performance I think if it's just the hologram than in a sense you're seeing a screening right now\nAnd so far they've only done it with perform like one performer So Amy Winehouse all will be on tour so to speak out we had ... or ... what about bans Jeff you think we'll just see flat out just big rock bands big rock concerts are all holograms that's where this is going\nI I'm not sure I'm sure somebody's going to try it and I I think it will become maybe a little bit of a mini genre in of itself but I have a feeling that for most because it requires a certain type of staging a kind of darkness and control the situation and\nThe way that you can use these projections that are limited some of what makes a the live concert by a a full band exciting which is different perspective um movement you know you're not going to have that so I I'm not sure\nJeff ... associate dean at the UCLA school of theater film and television also attorney Aaron moss who specializes in creative content used to\nIn Burke Oscar for in Los Angeles ... thank you

Young's joining us he's been following this story very very closely it is there any thought from the sources you talk with about why none of these have fortunately detonated\nA and it is it clear that they were truly designed to go off at some point\nMore questions than answers at this point I mean you know the it's it's you're right it's come up a worthy things just sent out to intimidate where they actually intended to go off was there something needed\nAs well we're finding out from him how the FBI is likely to conduct its investigation what were the type\nOf uh of explosive substance tell the investigators\nWell the ... that would be a one of the um avenues of investigation that they would have\nEarly on and look at it as whether it is a a a low explosive such as a smokeless powder what we refer to as gunpowder or a a high explosive\nAnd with that determines start looking for sources all those types of of explosives absolutely and uh and then how\nThose explosives were meant to to explode\nA within the fought report it to be a ... pipe bombs and so there's there's actually Larry ... what we're looking at here is a two pronged a investigation and as your\nYour your your previous um got for the wall Street Journal is saying that there's a lot all of a field investigation but people on the scene trying to determine\nHow these devices got to where they are in other words or was it in fact through the mail system or war there were some a delivery people involved so that's the first aspect and then if it came through the mail\nOkay well where did it come through the mail where where they put in to the distribution system for the postal service\nAt the same time down at the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia\nI'm as they're going through these devices are they trying to pull out evidence whether it directly a implicate an individual or individuals as I say with fingerprint or DNA or\nWe're looking as they will looking at the specific components that are used\nThat information will then go back to the investigators and say hey we've got this if you will which it in the device and they're the same in all eight ten devices where could that individual gotten hurt just\nThis many of these particular components so they start running literally leach it could be all over the country of finding out where these Adams came from it it is a very detailed problematic investigation\nThat is for many many viewpoints where again you're it's forensic Lee driven if you will at this point out of ... and the laboratory\nThat they come up with the okay this is the thought that says they send it to the investigators and investigators start running with leads and that and that's how that you would benefit by oh the\nThe person or persons that have constructed these\nThe bus and you'd think if the individual or individuals were mailing them out of the same facility that would have raised red flags so you'd think will multiple places yet they arrive within a similar timeframe so wouldn't necessarily be like the person's traveling around the country mailing them you know from far distant\nPlaces so many different things to check on this I did want to ask you briefly about um the ... nighter um because if it's a device that timing device that wouldn't enable a bomber to control your head that debt ... you know where Adam intended target\nAnd instead is remotely generated you'd think they'd have to be some proximity with the arrival of the package right you have to have someone ... so I'm just curious as a practical matter how this would be expected to work\nA lot in Malibu Fifteen of which voted in June of this year now we know from time to time they are very close races that come down to a razor thin margin you know Bernie Sanders his very first race as mayor he won by ten votes\nWay back I think that was like Nineteen eighty or something like that\nYear every vote does matter and it really matters down at the lower level and that's where they think you know you two votes here in this briefing to two votes here in this briefing that's where you know this can be a problem we're really takes away the voices of people and since we live in a constitutional republic where we the people have the right\nThe duty and the responsibility to elect\nOur representatives who represent us not special interest they represent us it is critical that we have a fair and honest system where every legal vote cast is properly counted and we do not give power to those who want to commit fraud\nWe're talking with mark moisture key is an election law turning Republican candidate\nFor California's secretary of state the incumbent Democrat Alex but there will be joining us at a future time if you have questions for Mr Moore's you're you can post them on a rare talk page KP C. C. dot org or you can call and passed them through our call screeners at eight six six eight nine three KP see see\nThat's eight six six eight nine three five seven to two\nAs you're well aware of their many concerns about the integrity of voting systems here in California we don't use electronic voting systems it's it's paper um ... do you think that we have a secure enough system for actually casting and counting votes or would you attempt to bring changes to the process\nThat's a very good question that I talked to security experts what they uniformly telling me is that California and most register voters across the country do not use the highest level of security of high level of encryption\nThey are not using the level of corruption that we used to guard or money that banks used to guard the money or doctors use to guard our health care records we are cheap\nAnd as long as we are being cheap with a level of encryption that we're using on her voter databases we will never be at the place where we can move to the technology of where you can have Internet voting so in ... as long as government is going to be stingy and just do the minimum level of encryption\nNo we cannot even consider going that way it is you have to be treated like a bank\nWhere you're ... you know in our our vote is probably more important than our money most people don't think of it that way but our vote is pressures is important and it's sad that you know our government does not always put the security level into that protecting that boat\nTo where it where would that encryption need to be so you've got to polling locations ballots that are collected in Los Angeles county for example they're taking was set central location physically to have them voted is it after that point that you see the vulnerability\nWell you know in our current system you're taught you know that your question with a future now you're talking about the president and\nWhat I'm Talking about if you see any current vulnerabilities I I Know online voting creates a whole host of of a very complex issues but in terms of how California currently have you think they're any vulnerabilities now\nYes there are I mean uh I had people who are in LA county a voter\nOr the vote ... to register voters office walking down the hallway and they were just boxers upon boxes and boxes of ballots that anybody could have reached in grabbed his stuffed in their pocket and walked out that they weren't being guarded protected even inside the voter you know\nThe ... office it's you know we've got problems with the whole entire process yes his paper showed that there's an audible trail but you know many states you actually count the ballots at the precinct\nAnd before the people who were watching the votes all day before they leave and go home they've already counted those ballots and so you have a number before it gets to the central a check to place\nBut you know one of the bigger problems if we don't do enough audits of our elections and we don't do enough outside audits of our elections if you're a member of two thousand Bush Gore\nYou know every available attorney in the nation was in the state of Florida examining the recount and we saw a lot of problems and afford a legislature actually had to go make some changes\nThat in a way it acted as a outside on it two thousand and sixteen when I did in Michigan and Wisconsin there were tons of turning that were on those state watching the process and you'll Michigan had to pass some laws to make some changes to their voting system\nRight now in the state of California the current secretary of state is shunning both sides of the aisles from having any kind of outside examination of whether California is falling its own election law whether it's Donald Trump on the right wanting to examine the\nCalifornia elections or some Bernie Sanders supporters down in San Diego who looked at the fact and they said wait a second Bernie\nSanders won three out of four different methods of voting but only lost in the mail in ballots we need to look at that but that that they were stopped from being able to look at\nThat so you support a as a on a regular basis auditing of elections where what independent third party examiners would come in look at the process when the secretary of state\nHave independent investigation duties but I think that because California has a third worst elections we really need to focus on bringing some integrity backdoor elections and I think that the only way that that happens is if we actually open it up and allow some outside groups to come in and give us a blue a blue ribbon seal of approval\nI Need to wrap up our conversation we want to give you a chance to make a final statement as to why voters should support your candidacy Mr Moore sure\nMy name is mark moisture I'm ready to be your next secretary of state I Am an election law attorney as you heard and I'm here to restore integrity to our elections the counting of your ballot is not a partisan issue\nWe need integrity in our election process so that everyone is ensure that there is that their vote actually counts there's about Seventy percent of people out there does not believe that their vote matters\nAnd I'm here running for secretary of state because I Believe your vote doesn't matter and I want everybody on November ... to please get out and vote\nYesterday we were named the number one grassroots campaign grassroots support campaign in the state and so I'm going to courage you to go to my website mark moisture dot com

I I agree still would start gr Shaw or would I Would weigh Fernando balance ... [laughter]\nI I don't trust him anymore throw this group all I I think it will be better at Dodger Stadium if he pitches in one of these games because you'll have a feel for the curve ball it's very cold and if anyone has tried to throw a baseball in cold weather knows that you got to have a New York for the pitch and the cold takes that feel away so he'll be a little bit better but I don't think that's enough anymore well I\n... so for some historical perspective in in in sixty five when the Dodgers lost the first two games in Minnesota they came back here and they swept the twins\nAre and went back and eventually won that series and seven and in eighty one they lost the first two games of the series against the Yankees came back here and swept three games street a remarkable\nGame and they're all really low scoring game they were well the second one was that Minnesota series with men is\nNow the Dodgers the Dodgers whack them really ... seven to seven nothing I think with the scores and those games um yeah I Know I'm a little into\nStem cells all of this had [noise]\nSo uh you know but what what in in those two series what had to ... what happened is that game three of pitcher had to step up and and when that ball game and in Nineteen sixty five of all pitchers African facts in drysdale couldn't do it was ... who ... shut up the twins\nAnd in eighty one it was a kind of shaky Fernando but he hung in there and they ended up winning that ball game so whoever pitches tomorrow which is going to be Walker bealer\nThat guy's got I'd really pitch well and win that game or else forget it\nYeah and and so what are your feelings about\nMueller coming off his most recent outings in the playoff Dodgers aren't to get swept at home that's that's not going to happen they're going to at least when one of these games at home it probably is going to be tomorrow I I that's the one guy outside of ... that I have a ... most confidence that Walker viewers rookie\nHe maybe doesn't realize how big the moment is which I think is a good thing for this team they need someone just go out there and fire and I think he's going to do a great job but uh\nAs far as getting back to Boston it's as as confident as I was at the series one way or another would be back in Boston next week I don't know any more yeah and you think if if the Dodgers when two of the three\nGoes back to Boston what do you think are are are the odds that the Dodgers could win both games in Boston now about say yeah I'd love to say yes that I'd love to be a cheerleader and and hope and snap the thirty year the world series drought but I have to be realistic to\nMe that's that seems like it would be a tougher place to play than even Yankee Stadium for visiting team because of the way that stadium is built you were talking last\nTime we vote neck about this the fans are absolutely on top of you\nYeah well we talked to we we were fortunate to Reggie Smith the other day to play it for ... and both the Dodgers and the red Sox in the world series not going to be intimidated by you know and he uses it was a switch it on so I asked him um you know when you go into that the ... and you look at that green monster\nYou know do you start thinking wow I can hit that thing I get and he says if you do that you're going to mess up your swing and you're not going to hit anything and and he's right about that [noise]\nUm so you know you have to you ... you have to um you know stay with the same approach that we really the best approach the Dodgers could take is the one that we all like\nWhich was a game five against Milwaukee where they just peppered away and one that ball game going away with\nBase it's an ... said Sarkozy at home and on the modifications of their swaying those actually rules for the next three games the pitcher to hit so that's the one advantage to the doctors have and that may be a big advantage to\nRight we're talking with a triple play a Martinez of take to Nick Roman all things considered Larry ... with you you can share your comments about the Dodgers Red Sox World Series\nAt eight six six eight nine ... BCC or on the air talk page K. P. C. C. dot org or Tony rights on the page when Roger ... was managing the giants always said there was no one else I Choose to\nCoach a hundred and sixty two game season but he was the last person I think if I live in one\nSounds like the Dodgers have the same problem\nYeah and and here's the thing too so let's just say walk her view alert does not have a great start tomorrow I mean who who do you call I mean who who would you have confidence out of that bullpen to call in early tomorrow night if you need a few innings of over long relief or risk has stuff in the tank right now even though that you could do so yeah\nI think it would probably be him because he's looked really good and and and I know I Know the seasons out over the series isn't over but watching him and he's you know in the last couple of weeks makes me think boy next year is going to be really\nExcellent needs to stay out of the time yeah do you still both still hold your position that you don't think crush us going to opt out of his contract that's Seventy million dollars that's all he has to do nothing to get Seventy million dollars to yeah it's like winning the lottery ticket\nYeah they're just so many doubts and and uh uh you know that the health thing I think is a big concern for teams and then link the contract\nAnd then who's got them who's going to give that money uh to him there's only a handful of teams that would do with the giants might have that money in the Phillies might the Yankees are obviously always do the cubs butter those attractive places for him I don't know\nBut you know what would bug me if say he ops out and he's a free agent and the Dodgers get in a bidding war to bring 'em back\nYeah yeah that would and maybe he'll hope that's the case all that the giants and the Dodgers you know um because it isn't Bumgarner a\nFree agent no not yet or you're going to last you unfold okay Patrick coordinate with Arizona's someone is looks like the prime picture who's going to be a free agent\nAll right so that of course what's the what's there on the market may also have some a determination of what ... does or a gentleman you both sound a little like I feel a shaky about the Dodgers prospects year lets me normal\n[laughter] you know and if they win if they win tomorrow then I'm back to being wildly him in an ugly optimist like you know that goes right back [laughter]\nOr or or I'd add and I've already upset people by even mentioning a bidding war for her show with the giants the idea of seeing the image I did an oral harsh either end his career in a giant\nOh yeah which is still tough to forget I Know he came back to the Dodgers you went back to the doctor\nAlright yeah oral always be a Dodger to me All right gentlemen thanks so much it's the triple play the

News in Washington on Lakshmi Singh federal investigators are searching for the person or persons behind at least ten suspicious packages addressed to several of President Trump's critics NPR's Quil Lawrence has an update\nIf Mr Bailey doesn't like that then he's got the right as a citizen to speak up but I Would hope that he would not abandon the efforts that we've undertaken to recoup the tens of millions of dollars that the federal government is trying to withhold from our law enforcement agencies because they they want us to do their bidding and their job when it comes to\nFederal immigration deportation and that's not our job that the federal government's job and we allow them to do it under the law but we don't have to do it for them and that's why I've recently a federal court decided that the Trump Administration has California twenty nine million dollars for unlawfully withholding funds from our law enforcement\nOr he claims that instead of filing lawsuits that your office could um negotiate could have conversations with federal officials and that there are other ways of of pushing back aside from filing lawsuits respond place\nThat's what we've done and because this administration had been unwilling to listen\nWe do what we have to do uh we tried to talk to the administration for example on the clean car standards that we have nationwide that make sure that we continue to have vehicles are that are manufactured that continue to produce cleaner burning engines\nAnd this administration decided to back away from its own national standards we tried to talk to them out of it because climate changes it existential issue for everyone\nAnd they chose not to and so we have only one records left at this stage when they decide they want to violate their own uh laws and they want to violate their own agreements and so uh we have on every occasion where we can try to explain to them what they're doing wrong and what they're doing against the law\nBefore we follow suit or most of the time we have to by law do that because there's a comment period that's provided for whenever the federal government tries to change its rules\nAnd we've always participated in the comic periods ah unfortunately at this administration doesn't do a lot of listening\nAnd so we have a we do what we have to do which is at the end of the day if the Trump Administration will listen we'll take 'em to court\nWe're talking with democratic attorney general for California Javier ...\nA former congressman from the Los Angeles area\nAnd you can ask questions of him on the air talk page you can also a call and ask questions were our call screeners at eight six six\nEight nine three KP see see um what role do you see for the state attorney general when it comes to the homelessness crisis that's affecting California's major cities even even some of the smaller\nCommunities in the state is there more that your office can do to assist local jurisdictions in dealing with the problem\nWe can try to be a resource and uh be one of the partners and try to make this work a statewide\nOr we don't have direct jurisdiction over those issues most of those issues are going to be handled at the local level and to the degree that the state gets involved it will be done through the legislature and the governor\nOf but certainly my office uh we're prepared to try to be as helpful as we can in coordinating with local law enforcement and making sure that uh what is done is done legally\nBut we don't have the first day on on the issue of homelessness but having been a member of Congress who has weighed in on this issue\nFor for decades and having represented parts of LA that have Skid Row uh I've been I've been very involved in a I don't intend simply because I have now gone from being a policymaker to enforce or to stop my efforts are on the policy side to make things better I think most people now agree that when it comes to homelessness\nAre the best approach is to make sure that you get someone permanently house\nSo then you can treat all the other issues that might be involved in creating the homeless the situation for that individual whether it's a mental issue a health care issue a job training issue but if you can't give the people the stability of permanent home it makes it difficult to tackle all the other issues\nUp you've faced some criticism from Republicans over the titles of ballot propositions and I'm explaining if you would how you determine that ... that have title is uh not just legal but appropriately describes what the initiative is trying to do\nWe have a team at the department of justice that has been doing this for years where they look over the entire initiative the actual languages of language of the initiative not what the proponents her opponent say about it now how they characterize it but the actual text of\nThe initiative based on the text and what the tax actually calls for a my team my legal team then that works on these will put together a draft of the initiative language the title in summary\nOf the parameters that we have to work under are pretty pretty stiff we get a hundred total words to describe an initiative both in the title and in the summary so we have to figure out a way to crunch everything into one hundred words and still be descriptive a of a ... which which may be\nTens and hundreds of pages long\nAnd so we do the best we can buy just doing the most important purpose of the initiative and so that's how we come up with the language of someone may say to you it's a it's the um apple pie and motherhood initiative to give everyone\nA access to a home or we can't describe it that way we have to describe exactly what it does and so oftentimes proponents or or even opponents of an initiative aren't happy with the language because they'd rather describe it the way they like unfortunately we have to base it our our title in our summary in a hundred words\nA what the initiative actually said have\nYou ever because of that criticism early on gone back and the department of justice modified anything because oh you know that's a valid point we hadn't thought of the embassy or have they always stayed the same once the department as released the language\nWe have adjusted on occasion and typically it's because a work and were persuaded that ah the change of a word or phrase might give a better description of the actual language of the initiative [noise]\nAh but I Will tell you that every initiative goes through a vetting process it they all get scrubbed not just by my me or my team that gets ... by the courts and no initiative gets on the ballot or no titled and some are you an abundance should gets on the ballot for voters to look at\nUnless it's been scrub by everyone including the courts and those who complain about the language have have recourse they can go to court as many have and the ultimate language that you see in the title in summary on those ballot pamphlets\nIs based on a court having decided what the language will be not just not just me as the attorney general so every every initiative that's on to this year's ballot\nHas gone through that's growing process and so anyone who's complaining\nHad their had a chance or had their day in court and the language that you see on these ballot initiatives on the title and summary is what even a court has said is appropriate\nWe're talking with a ... year but Sarah California attorney general just to finish out his first term in office running for reelection\nFacing the challenge from Republican Steven Bailey or who is a sitting judge in northern California before his retirement ... was also a democratic\nMember of the house of representatives from Los Angeles a for a number of years before a first being appointed to the attorney general's office and uh then winning that position\nWe're talking with him about his candidacy and if you have questions where it eight six six eight nine three came PCC monkey rights on the page\nI'm a attorney general Sarah how do you plan on minimizing investigating and obtaining justice for those wrongly convicted how do you change the culture and the judicial system and penalize prosecutors and judges who deviate from the law he's talking about wrongful convictions\nI'm Mr Sarah ... and\nAnd that's an excellent question because we're always striving to figure out how we can be part of that move towards real justice at the California Department of justice like let me give you one quick example\nBail reform um for the longest time whenever a we've talked about bail we've we always think of it in terms of money so someone is accused of a crime is arrested in arraigned\nA judge will then say your trial will be set for six months from now or et cetera and the future and in order for you to be released from detention from jail you must\nPay X. amount of bail three hundred thousand dollar bill\nUm for a lot of folks even if they're innocent a paying three hundred thousand dollars and built to be released until the time of trial is impossible and so you are innocent until you're proven guilty but in this country because of money bill you could be held in prison even though you're innocent\nBecause you don't have the money and so there's a movement under way in California is part of that to remove the system of detention before trial and any guilty verdict\nTowards ah things that would detain you based on your danger to the public or danger of you fleeing the the state or the country before your trial not based on how much money you have you can be filthy rich and very dangerous to the public but you can build yourself out\nThat's not fair to the person who's dirt poor poor totally innocent\nBut it has to serve time in in in jail because he or she can't build a vet bills now been signed into law right\nI'm six of the private non profit hospitals the biggest ones\nReported annual profits ranging from Eighteen millions or a hundred and Seventy six million and this bond would provide huge hospital a hundred and thirty five million dollars regardless of profit or off so again hospital by bond completely bad no but again it's a question of equity\nShould taxpayers refunding private hospitals and is it appropriate that even the most well funded hospitals are getting a hundred and thirty five million dollars each\nWe're talking with Howard Jarvis taxpayer association legislative director David Wolf and again the Jarvis association is not taking an official position on prop for but\nDavid Wolf sharing some of his concerns about the bond measure using it this way for the funding for capital projects at children's hospitals and Louis Coons also with us from that a California children's hospital association which she chairs\nAssert do want to ask you about these 'cause you don't when we think of children's hospital here in Southern California we think a very robust institutions very high stature very large fundraising capacity um very dedicated donors I'm with large capacity to give\nAgain um what would happen if this let's say this didn't pass\nWouldn't those hospitals find other ways to raise the money to do the earthquake retrofit and to be able to handle the larger capacity patient load\nWell let me give you an example of the kinds of trade off that that are involved here so ... is very true that our hospitals do fundraising fundraise all the time um when I was at Seattle I recently\nI'm probably the on I was actually the chair of arson station I'm the I'm the president and CEO of Association He was mentioning that their entire they have twenty and ambulances and I think two helicopters that help provide you know that sort of emergency support 'em from the community to the hospital that's completely funded through an endowment from a donor\nSo those sorts of investments are going on all the time\nBut at the same time we have operationally I'm large programs that serve a a very difficult to treat populations that are predominantly covered by public programs like mad account\nAnd example there would be a you know children's hospital Oakland operates wind up to sickle cell centers in the state they cover about seven hundred and they see about seven hundred kids a year's sickle cell disease is a very complicated disease very few hematology really trained to to treat that disease state\nSince two thirds of the patient population is on Medicare now um the the cost to operate that uh sickle cell center at Oakland loses three and a half million dollars every year just for those patients so when we go to fundraise we're also going to fundraise to can basically just cover the cost of our operations\nTo ... yeah exactly I I Wonder though um and and I'm sort of putting you on the spot if they have we passed other bond measures like there's for private nonprofit general hospitals to do what what is being asked you for the children's hospital I Believe that\nThere have been district hospitals at the local level that have passed bans in the past yes\nFor this county by county sort of the things\nThat are passed because I just wondering why would it be different for a children's hospital where there are certain parts of the state where presumably uh the majority of care if not we indulge in population would be to those that are on some form of\nA public health care or where there would be a gap that would have to be filled and where would be difficult to come up with funds for capital investment says wondering what's what's different about the kids off middle than general\nActually one of the biggest difference between the children's hospitals in a community hospitals\nIs just a percentage on Medicare and the average community hospital fees more Medicare patients and Medicare it is a more balanced pay or that they pay closer to what the cost of delivering the services no Medicare patients of children's on Medicare patients that children's hospitals in ... in the state of California is a ranks\nForty eight in out of fifty states and how low the reimbursement providers is and that's part of the struggle for us as just\nWe want to be there for all families regardless of\nAbility to pay or family income\nIn order to do that we need a little bit of help to cross the bridge for this infrastructure gap that we're facing\nAlright I Need to wrap up David Wolf our drivers taxpayer associate and just a quick final word\nYeah or I Would just say this is not the first bite at the apple for these children's hospitals I'm there have been to bonds that have been approved seven hundred and fifty million in two thousand four nine hundred and eighty million in two thousand eight it might be different if this was the first bond in Twenty years the benefit of children's hospitals\nUm but it's not and I think again for the reasons I mentioned taxpayers need to be on the art on this one\n[noise] want to thank you both so much steps David Wolf our job as taxpayers and Louis Coons who's the president CEO of the California your children's hospital association
