Martinez biggest moment of this week's Saturday Night live premier happened after the camera stop rolling plus Tom Hanks is Fred Rogers give people something to smile about during a stressful new cycle let's go on a lot [noise]\nOn a show [noise]\n[noise]\nBetter there's Rebecca ... is our guide is always a little Rebecca Hi a Saturday Night live from your strong or weak and kicking off the show with a parody of a cabinet hearing for that got a lot of buzz was kind of funny or consider how serious the topic was but it wasn't most newsworthy moment of the night so that would go to Kanye West Rebecca what happened with the\nUh right well as the credits started rolling Kanye West started delivering a speech a sort of rambling speech about his support of Donald Trump or the cameras kind of way but people were in the audience including Chris Rock caught some of it and and shared it on Instagram\nThat if you're a little bit of that ramp\nThere are a very low\nYou're measuring Chris Rock reaction what's the reaction been generally the best because this point I don't know if anyone has really got surprise when Kanye West does something that can be attention grabbing\nYeah honey outrage fatigue I Would say is in full force he after appearing on the show then tweeted um something that was rather eyebrow raising about abolishing the thirteenth amendment which of course of the amendment that abolished slavery later clarified that tweet to say that thirteenth amendment is slavery in disguise meaning it never ended\nI never left Tanya what grabbing a lot of attention for himself he had been a last minute substitution for Ariana Grande day and seems to have captured a lot of people's uh uh imagination around us and all this week\nRight now let's move on to some news overseas Roman Polanski has announced that his first movie since the me too era was ushered and tell us about ... ... yes she\nIs a place he plans to start shooting accuses fall in Paris this is a political thriller about a French Jewish soldier who was wrongly accused of spying for the Germans in the Eighteen nineties\nA film about being wrongly accused from Roland plan for yes\nYes yes you know your ACT UP on that\nUm yeah you know plans he has no doubt listeners know pled guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor in Nineteen Seventy seven in this movie um plugs into some issues that I think are in the culture Polanski speaking about it and twenty twelve talked about how it was absolutely relevant because it's about the spectacle of the witch hunt\nPolanski you know we [noise] it's been a long time since since his well I guess I never really got to trial as much as a there was going to be a judgment and you decided to skip of the country he's kind of been in exile he continues to make films um others touched by the me too movement maybe don't why don't you get to keep making movies\nBut the interesting thing in this case is that this is a French producer certainly the me too movement has unfolded in a different way and France and it has here in the U.S they will be interesting to see a Polanski they're able to secure us distribution\nCharge now to another movie in the making a won't you be my neighbor I Can't do that the way it's supposed to be done yeah don't creepy coming out of my boys are about the documentary about Mr Roger's neighborhood I made a ... year but to Fred Rogers is also getting a bar picks with those ...\nYeah so a Tom Hanks is playing Fred Rogers and the film\nBased on a story times you know wrote for Esquire in the nineties\nBasically about being a cynical cranky magazine writer which I Can't imagine such a person but cynical cranky magazine writer who was assigned to profile Fred Rogers and becomes sort of a charmed by his kindness and sort of brought brought over to the the love and affection\nWe'll have for Mr Rogers no there was a picture that was released last week and it had Tom Hanks in the role with the sweater the guardian and the Internet went absolutely creators of people I think maybe and maybe it's because of what's going on in the world people are big need something to\nYeah Sony's marketing department dropped that photo right in the middle of Kavanaugh's testimony on Thursday when I think people were so so hungry for an image of a decent human being or something to be happy about it really landed well with me and with other people who are I think are in much the same emotional space at that moment\nNow as I mentioned the document or about Rogers has been a favorite among moviegoers up but documentaries in general are doing up pretty well a film called free solo is keeping up the trend or how is that fair\nYeah so last night I tried to go to the arc light to sci fri cello I live in the movies on Sunday nights because they'll get there was a call ... in the front row so\nNot going to go see a documentary about free climbing or in the front row but this movie did extraordinarily well this weekend it was on just four screens which is commonly how documentaries are rolled out it made three hundred thousand eight hundred and four dollars on those four screens for Seventy five thousand dollar per screen\nAverage uh that's the best of any movie this year not just a documentary per theater and it beats the two thousand six record held by an inconvenient truth for per theater average for a documentary why is this such a good year using\nFor documentaries well it's interesting I think it has something to do with what we were talking about what the Tom Hanks Mr Rogers movie if you look at a doctor that have done really well\nAh the number one documentaries won't you be my neighbor twenty two million RPG about ... bitter Ginsburg fourteen million\nI'm I think real life stories that are inspiring seem to really be capturing audiences uh this year there's also a lot of people who are financing documentaries who who weren't in the business just a few years ago folks like Netflix who are in increasing the quality of the dogs that are out there\nYou know there's a lot of climbing gyms in LA people when they were were you just go indoors to do rock

Pasadena dot edu\nHome broadcasts center of this is Eric ... good morning I'm Larry I'm after all\nThe FBI nearly three days in order to reopen background check of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh Democrats claimed the White House's limiting the number of people the bureau can interview but just minutes ago President Trump denied it\nWill bring you up to date on the very latest right after the news\n[noise]\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Laurie London President Trump is answering reporters' questions from the White House Rose Garden after announcing that the U.S and Canada have reached a new trade deal the U.S Mexico Canada agreements replaces the north American free trade agreement\nIn order to secure their vote and we saw that friday you know Senator Flake basically\nFloated the idea of this a weeklong FBI investigation and made it clear that that would be something that had to be done to get his vote move forward and so I think if there's push back on the scope of the investigation or who the FBI is going to talk to you this week\nThat's going to have to come from a handful of senators whose votes\nThe White House and Senate Republicans will need to push through the nomination I think if it was left of their own devices and they had the votes in hand uh they would they would have already voted for judge cap now\nSo we're talking about Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski being a highly influential senators here\n[noise] yeah and Senator Jeff flake of Arizona who you know is not up for reelection was in a very unique position and then I think the White House and Senate up you know Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell are also really hoping\nThat one or two of the Democratic senators who are up for re election this fall\nAlso where this is Mike German a fellow with the Brennan Center for justice us at NYU school of law or wasn't FBI agent for sixteen years are included in uh the responsibilities of Mr German was background investigation ... thank you for joining us\nSure that your area what what are the ways that the FBI if they find that you know some of the people they're interviewing are less than forthcoming or reluctant what are some of the ways that are FBI agents\nAh can try to elicit a former descriptions and get a new more precise answers to questions\nOr so it's it's a against the law allied with ... so uh the the seriousness of an interview a is usually give any um\nAnd it ... investigation ... investigation obviously they would have the power to serve a grand jury ... versus that's really a a a situation like a background investigation that is a typically the case\nI mean here they could go to the set of Judiciary Committee and ask for the person to be ... um but again because they're so ... that would take some time to process\nAnd that's where the other problems with this very short way to apply if there is a witness to Israel ...\nThey can just play hide the ball and not be available when the FBI is back down and and that's pretty easy to accomplish over Seventy period\nWould that typically be in the bureau's report to let's say we reach the end of the week there's someone who's been difficult to track down or um put up obstacles would that typically be provided or to the Senate Judiciary committee and the president so they'd be aware of that\nAre certainly it would be included a report that we were able to reach is people who were reportedly witnesses\nIt do you think it's likely that agents conducting this reopen check would be attempting to determine the extent of Brett Kavanaugh's drinking in high school and college\nWell certainly a that in a normal investigation when they said that they were a duty as issue on friday that seeing that it would be within the scope because that would take a call ... ... witnesses who have said they're that these events happened at parties where there was\nA significant drinking so the fact that he\nWas or was not at parties where there was a significant amount of of alcohol served would would tend to corroborate those stories where it's very limited that becomes harder and of course here we have additional out of his testimony that there was drinking or that\nYou ever drink to that to the point is a big locked out or anything like that\nIf you were interviewing professor Ford\nUh at this juncture after she provided her testimony on Thursday what are some of the questions you might ask her to attempt to corroborate or a or better understand or or or find what limits there might be in her account\nWhere I think it would be a matter of your previous guest suggested that that you would want to interview that the primary witnesses last after you've gathered all the information from all the other people\nAnd especially try nailed down specifics that can either be corroborate by another witness or by document or or other issues so it's a matter of just making sure that you're checking all the boxes that that would cages support white person's story or the others\nThey used by the failure to investigate Julie sweat next allegations they are\nExtremely serious and made under penalty of perjury and it seems to me that since she\nDid make a statement under penalty of perjury it would be worth their time to speak with her I think with respect to the sort of ripple effect of other people whose names may come to the surface really the FBI should be given the discretion to decide who they think is important and who they think is not important to talk to you that is after all their area of expertise\nWe're drawing the professor Lara ... us that school of law also with us from the Heritage Foundation ... Center for legal and judicial studies Elizabeth\nFlattery or she is also host of the SCOTUS one oh one podcast Mr Slattery thank you for being with us\nThanks for having me\nA so your thoughts about the scope of the FBI investigation what do you think makes the most sense\nI think that the the scope of the investigation that's been laid out so far is sufficient you know there there needs to be a\nA a drop dead deadline because otherwise you know it could go on it could go on forever and it's really unfair I think too I you know to all parties involved judge Kavanaugh first and foremost in addition to the women who have come forward to accuse him of of sexual misconduct\nIn the case of ... professor bass loans making the point that you know she made a declaration under oath um the allegations are very serious there they're not\nUm I'm trying to say this the right way they're not directly against her what she's describing she described witnessing things putting alcohol or drugs into beverage is the worst served at parties with a specific intent\nOf sexually assaulting women who attended those parties uh she's claiming that she saw gang rapes and like um these are very serious allegations even if she's not\nYou know claiming that um the judge Kavanaugh you're directly harmed her so if you use that and not something that should be investigated\nWell I don't think ... if if I understand correctly I don't think she identified any other witnesses who can corroborate her story and it just seems you know a little too out there for me it doesn't pass the smell test\nSo it's sort of two generalized an allegation without more specific some times locations other people and you would need to see that\nAnd yeah I think so yes professor basil on your your response to that\nI think the way to get to the bottom of it is to sit down with her and ask her those questions directly where there are witnesses that she had any corroborating evidence\nI Do feel in some ways that in a sense she's being penalized for her attorney that Michael ... such a lightning rod that the fact that he's the person representing her means that her allegations are being dismissed and I don't think that should be the case\nOf Iraq ... lawn Elizabeth flattery who's a legal fellow with the heritage foundation's me center a also with us Shawn Walsh ... Rodrigues John and want to come back to you about um you know I'm\nAbout the Republican Party and how women have been responding to these events of the past few days are you concerned as a Republican that for many women\nOr they're they're deeply offended by what they've seen over the past these past couple of days from the Judiciary Committee and an are you concerned that this is this is going to do significant harm to the party going forward\nNo actually in some respects just the opposite I think many Republican women and I think uh\nProbably moderate to conservative Democrat women say you know I have sons I have a son and high school I have a son in college or if my son were going up for a Supreme Court nomination or some sort of public service and something arises Thirty years later\nWith no proof to this day still to this they were was really covered well by the Republicans I think there's a very poor job in the hearings is that the free individuals that she put forward\nAs people could corroborate her story said either didn't happen they don't recall that don't know Kavanaugh so I think there's a lot of backlash potentially out there from people who say you know what\nI'm not sure the stores credible it should be looked at but the bottom line is should a person like this have his or her ... in this case his life destroyed as children embarrassed death threats against them so it was real issues there\nI and I hear what you're saying about the lack of cooperation nonetheless she made such a compelling\nUm a testimony in Thursday that I I think it it

Elizabeth flattery of the Heritage Foundation Laura ... University of San Francisco also political strategist John Walsh Republican Matt Rodriguez\nDemocrat or one of the of the complaints that Republicans made both Thursday and friday\nWas about uh they're not being a background check reopening of once the letter was received by professor Ford in which she alleged the sexual assault by\nBrett Kavanaugh when they were both in high school a and a lot of this centering on letter that was passed on by\nProfessor Ford's um Congress member to Senator Dianne Feinstein office Senator Feinstein said that she did not turn it over to anyone because professor Ford wanted anonymity and she didn't want to do anything that would put the professor into a bad position nonetheless\nA copy of that letter I did get out to members of news BBN people started asking questions here's what President Trump just over an hour ago a sad about the handling of this letter\nLooking Dianne Feinstein you're telling me about time Dianne Feinstein knew about this two months earlier if she wanted a a really thorough investigation when all the time in the world she didn't have to wait till after the hearing was closed essentially\nShe shares that listen I have a problem\nI have this report I'd like the FBI to look at it while we're doing the hearings we had two months no she didn't do that she wait until we were closed and then she probably leaked it but you know who am I to say what you probably did based on a very bad body language of the day but\nOh I don't know I mean the bottom line is you have to be careful because however you define one party or a party over two three four five years you can mail yourself down to try and give you when you do your murder border prep sessions kind of lines that you use the\nKind of have flexibility from my view I think you usually take it at all and so yeah you know what I did party in high school yes I did party in college I did drink a lot um but the bottom line was I never drank to the point where I didn't know what I was doing nor did I drink to the point where I blacked out\nSo I Would have been that I Would do acknowledge you drink a lot\nBut you drew the line where you stop and I just think that\nAgain I've his prep sessions with probably the White House counsel and other people probably told them to answer that way and you know in this case\nI think they're gonna try to nail him on false statements that he made I think that's the Democrats ultimate goal is I don't think they're gonna get among the Ford is you know get them by making misstatements and if he did that and said one thing about drinking and you have ten witnesses who say something else then they'll say\nWell except I mean on the black so let's say you have people that say you you know he passed out was blackout drunk um he if he doesn't have memory of that then is natural testimony would be that ever happened I mean it's sort of a yeah it's a catch twenty two there man\nYeah I I thought I I but I really do Larry I thought he was sort of we're leaving on properties of on a couple of different areas one was the drinking which just say I mean a lot of kids drink in college and you just say like what I got really hammered several times in college I don't remember all the times you know this is not going out and in my adult life and I don't I didn't do any any Kevin back\nOn the question or do you like junior year and you like to drink at all really weird exchange when White House and then you have strange exchange with a\nSharp and really and it was I just think are necessary I think his indignant nature probably worked in a statement he probably didn't need to bring that during the question the other one I thought he was somewhat unprepared for was the FBI question or he just kept kind of looking like a deer in headlights you obviously knew that question was coming any kind of reverted back to the Senate than he wouldn't answer it\nAnd there are several different answers that could be that the FBI is actually part of the executive branch in opposite you know the legislative branch are there ways from the answer but both of those I thought he looked tentative and that didn't help him a ... I I think in terms of his ... in terms of overall credibility\nYeah I I didn't understand why wouldn't you say I mean from his perspective look I'm I'm the person under consideration that's not my place to call for that\nAnd and this is totally the decision of the committee and be very direct it out I'm not obstructionist about the ... and my personal opinion about it really does and he well he sort of went\nDown that road he's sort of just said you do whatever you feel you need to do you need to be almost tossed off as though we never even considered yeah ...\nI mean the real failure on us it was Chuck Grassley not taking control of his own committee right from the start and laying it out of the few burst and honestly they really the Republicans didn't can control their own committee\nUntil um some of the Graham actually came up and said forget this I'm not letting us prosecutor go here this thing's a disaster and he took over so\nI mean the bottom line was they allowed Kavanaugh to fumble and to have Kavanaugh dictate to the committee yeah we'll have an FBI investigation done without the committee a proven that they would have been disaster too so again I blame Grassley\nElizabeth flattery the Heritage Foundation me center are your thoughts about um any concerns you add about judge Kavanaugh that were raised in his testimony\nNo you know I think he got some slack for showing emotion but you know I I Can't imagine that you know those were genuine emotions he was he was angry uh you know he's seen his\nHis reputation that he he spent a lifetime building completely trashed and and you know so I think he was right to show that anger in on the question of you know what he should have said about the FBI\nInvestigation whether it should be reopened or not you know he was kind of damned if you do damned if you don't if he said yeah I think they asked me I should reopen it then you know then it then it probably would happen if he said no then senators would say well what's he hiding so you know he\nIt was really hard for him he was in Iraq and a hard place there\nIn terms of how to answer that but I think you're right that you know he could have just said it's it's not up to me to decide whether the FBI reopen reopen the investigation\nYeah and I said you know I have nothing to hide and and um you know what whatever anyone wants checking my background that you know uh but Laura bad salon do you think that there is potential vulnerability of a judge Kavanaugh based on his statements Thursday\nI Do I mean it does seem that he may well have lied under oath\nAbout certain things that he said to the senator's what really stood out to me is not that he didn't have a right to be angry if indeed he's falsely accused it was his demeanor particularly when he was facing off against the women senators and particularly in the situation with senator club is art to turn to her and say have you ever blocked out and not nasty\n... way when it's his job interview not her job interview I thought spoke volumes and just points to real questions\nAbout his temperament and just his overall sense of entitlement to his position it's not for him to be asking questions of the senators it's supposed to go the other way and my thought listening to him was if he's this belligerent when he's sober what is he like what he's drunk\nYet it's an uncomfortable exchanged watch professor he did apologize for that exchange he came back I think there was a recess afterward did that go any way toward a assuage in your concerns\nI imagine his lawyers had talking to you with him and it was interesting that that was the only exchange that he apologized for which goes to show you how egregious it was but no it didn't switch my concerns hit over all behavior raised so many concerns for me particularly about his temperament\nAnd Sean your thoughts about the heat in his opening statement where he'd he left aside his previously prepared and released remarks and and expressed his anger his her frustration um are\nYou concerned about how we went after specific Democrats on the committee as opposed to just you know blasting the process but not specific individuals\nI'm appalled by the the line that the professors taken\nRight out of the Democratic talking points that's exactly what these others are saying it's the have you stopped beating your wife yet and\nYou know I think he's a human being and you showed some anger and frustration he didn't show some wild haired temperament like he was going to pick up a bat and start clubbing settlers in the room I I find that line is absolutely appalling find any little mcnuggets any crumb any frustrations manager had\nAnd then try and bashing what's it like a baby harp seal I it's a it's appalling demand yes you would be frustrated I mean his kids are being abused at school and so did he speak up did he go back at them you know he went back at them a little bit um and and you know what I find that to be ... what a normal human being does that\nProfessor ... said she understood the anger that if he's being falsely accused and he would do it she she was talking specifically about the way in which you know she she started brutally attacking the Democratic senators with whom he was conversing\nShe just said she's troubled by all these you know testimony there where he may have wide where I mean so the bottom line was there's issues about how much did he drank I I'm not sure that that's enough to put him into a ...\nI I Need to wrap I Want to thank you all

I'm Laurie London President Trump is celebrating what he calls the biggest trade deal in us history NPR's Scott Horsley reports the updated agreement with Mexico and Canada could give a boost to American dairy farmers and auto workers\nAnd here when we're talking about Internet services the courts have already set in the past that ... that that that's a highly technical question and where it is impossible or even impractical to distinguish between what is purely interest state and what his interstate\nThe FCC is the expert agency gets and I'm I'm quoting here gets a high level of deference and making the determination as to which it is and here the FCC is said and they've said is about other Internet services in the past and the courts have ruled in their favor\nThat it's it's just not practicable to distinguish between interest state an interstate broadband communications because as everybody knows\nYour Internet service yes you could if you live in California you could connect with the library next door but when you do you're you may well be connecting to a server that's in a ... or for that matter in another country your data your traffic your queries they go all around the world even if you think the only access in California\n... so that town like old landline communication for example which could be distinctly localized All right let me bring Ernesto foul cone Electronic Frontier foundation back in\nUm ... do you think that um there's a good chance the federal government could get to stay against California's a action on net neutrality pending a federal trial over this\nI think is the as to what the deal Jay's asserted is\nProbably the strongest argument it which is allowed the DC circuit case and the question of whether the U.S does the has authority to blight state laws to play out first is probably the strongest that but it's worth the understanding but that's not a an argument on the merits and that's not an argument to let the law says or doesn't stay and at the end of the day\nIs the DC circuit science [noise] that the U.S as he does not have authority and it's worth noting there's nothing in the law nothing in the federal law that says that the states are preempted here\nIn fact the telecommunications ... long been seen as a joint federal state partnership a structure that's why you have public utilities commission or in all of these states and that's why you've had a lot of as you noted the local\nAnd state regulations\nSo the question will be it does the U.S does he have authority where Congress has now granted the authority\nI don't think it does in it and that the next question which gets a little bit completed here uh by by my\nColleague Baron is whether the state has the power to intrude in what's called the interstate commercial activity that's a very different analysis in a very different question that would have to be revisited at a later time\nA barren ... freedom um how long do you think this is likely to take to legally resolve\nWell as Ernesto notes are gonna be a few steps here the first step is the initial injunction and I think it's pretty obvious that the department of justice is going to get that that's I don't think anybody would disagree on either side of this debate\nAnd then as he notes then you have to go to litigation on the merits now he points out that one might think that this case is linked to the pending litigation in DC over whether the FCC's latest order in which they again changed the the regulatory classification of broadband one might think that that case is relevant to this case\nI actually don't because even if the FCC's particular order here failed\nThe FCC has for for long periods of time and many other circumstances\nHas this cleaned or or prevented state regulation of broadband services if somehow which I think is extremely unlikely the\nFCC were to lose on the title one title to question they're still going to preempt state services so that case really is not going to change the outcome of this man\n[noise] gentleman I Want to thank you for sharing your opinions about uh the legal aspects of\nAnd when his new net neutrality law signed yesterday by Governor Brown that's Baron ... a president of tax freedom that tax policy think tank in DC international ...\nLegislative counsel for the Electronic Frontier foundation that digital rights group based in San Francisco joining us now Los Angeles times Sacramento bureau chief John Myers to talk about some of the other major bills that were signed yesterday by Governor Brown and John good to have you with us this morning\nThank Larry ... and let's talk about some of the ... one of them first of its kind in the country a requirement for California based corporations to laugh at least one woman on the corporate board um is expected that there'll be a challenge to this legally soon\nYou know it's a it's a good it's a good question um if you looked at the uh signing message that Governor brown a issued when he said he signed the bill and you know I should point out the listeners the governor doesn't always explain why he signs of belly always explains when he vetoes one by the signing message is kind of rare but he put us on the message out that\nThat said you know he wasn't convinced that this will hold up legally but he wanted to he wanted to push forward he thought it was the right was the right position for California to\nTo ensure that there is gender diversity on the boards of these publicly held corporations\nAnd interestingly enough he put a uh uh the seat to send a copy of his tiny message to the Judiciary Committee of the United States Senate which of course is where the judge Kavanaugh herring was last week and has been the focus of so much attention about uh the dynamics of of gender conversations in this country\nSo I think the governor and Democrats in Sacramento trying to make a a strong statement that gender diversity matters and that the the roles of women are in a in public life and corporation life should be expanded\nWe also had a governor a signing a bill that\nWould limit criminal prosecution of miners are essentially no one under the age of twelve could be criminally prosecuted is is is that am I reading that right John\nIt it it uh it dramatically writes scales back I'm\nA prosecution for juveniles with the governors signing message on this one\nI'm largely say that he understands that these young people are accused of serious crimes that district attorneys prosecutors do not bring these\nIf there isn't something serious going on but that he believes that different role needs to be um administered for a juvenile justice for people who are younger and it is not dissimilar to me Larry from the way the governor has looked at a lot of criminal justice reform issues over the course of the last few years even this weekend\nA signing a bill that limits who can be prosecuted for felony murder and in California or where before it was accomplices to the murders could be prosecuted for felony murder or the new law would say that is not the case so I think you know both of those bills plus the way that the governor has taken another look at the issue of\nUm rehabilitation and trying to to further rehabilitation rather than punishment I think this all fits in line with where he uh where he's been where he thinks California's should go\nAll right you mention that to build that limits that the so called felony murder rule for people who um aren't intending to take someone else's life but her you know part of a of a crime in which\nSomeone is killed he also signed that bill which makes it easier for people who have old uh marijuana based convictions to get that expunged you know the specifics John how that actually work because there have been earlier measures to allow people to get that expunged\nDo you know how this goes further in that area\nI Can't compare it to the to the eggs to the to the prior when Larry I'm Sorry I mean I can tell you I mean I think that you know the point here is is that we are trying to line up a state law that has existed prior to now about convictions for for um for marijuana crimes with what voters did in two thousand sixteen and legalizing marijuana\nAnd I think this is all part of an effort\nBy lawmakers to try to harmonize that and saying that you know someone who went through this in the\nPast should be treated differently than someone who is in possession of a of marijuana in some instances now I mean so I think uh I think what you see here is an evolution really about the the the examination of that\nParticular a thing of of of of of marijuana possession and I think it's going to line up to what a lot of people in California already support if you look at the way the ballot measure vote\nWhen I was just looking John at the veto rate of Governor Brown and looks like it's been pretty consistent in his years in office in this most\nRecent a stint as governor or this his highest but only by a couple of percentage points just over sixteen percent of the bills that that he vetoed it got kind of remarkable how a consistent he's been year to year\nIt is I mean and he doesn't veto a lot of bills and a number you just reference for this year for two thousand Eighteen is really a his highest rate of a percentage of vetoes in a very long time\nYou know listeners will remember the Jerry Brown of course served eight years of from Nineteen Seventy five in Nineteen eighty three and he was last the last governor as I wrote in a column for the paper on Sunday was the last governor to have one of his vetoes over written by the legislature which was back in Nineteen eighty he had a handful\nOf bills overridden then ah and I think after that the governor decided he just wasn't going to veto a lot of things I Do think a couple of things that people should take from this the first one is is that Jerry Brown has spent a lot of his time trying to work on the content of bills behind the scenes before\nThey come to his desk if there's something he doesn't like if there's a way to revise that he and his staff are negotiating with lawmakers behind the scenes so that you don't get to the showdown\nA moment and the other one is the governor has told me this in a conversation a couple of years ago that he believes in respects\nOr the legislature is a co equal branch of government and that there's a ... geology and that he is not going to step on that unless he really thinks they're on the wrong path and certainly if you look at some of the veto messages this past weekend\nHow did you resolve but one of the ways that you work through that did a judge make a decision that you agreed with their disagreed with\nForm where a pet that maybe you and your partner or a spouse wanted to you know both of you wanted it how did you resolve the issue do you have shared custody or with a pet\nWhere that was really the only way to resolve this alternate weeks or months or however you do it or if you if you got to be loved pet that both parties in the relationship wanted to\nKeep eight six six eight nine three key PCC that dates six six eight nine three\nFive seven to two you know obviously child custody is a very huge issue and very common these days to have joint custody of children uh but outcome and uh uh to say is that for a joint custody of pets when a marriage breaks up\nBut we have to start with the with the very basic premise here the court is only going to have jurisdiction to divide community property and the the the new law is still defining animals I'm a community property it hasn't taken it to the to the level of say\nUm we're no longer going to look at animals of property and we're going to look at them as we get a\nChance or you couldn't have joint custody of David ... you any more than you could have joint custody of a car but under this it sounds like the lure might be open for this\nAbsolutely the door it was so interesting about it because they thought that the court may assigned soul or joint ownership\nUm that look at it says ownership it doesn't say custody I'm so and haven't gone that far yet it's using similar language to custody provisions because the court can award solar joy\nAs the child and this is saying ... or join ownership of the pack 'em but the but the ... has to be community property so what that means this is pat how took an acquired during the marriage if this was yours before you got married\nYou get to keep it up or property\nOkay yeah that's the answer I was wondering about that if someone brings the pet into the marriage they they don't that's not community proper you relinquish any claim on the path\nAbsolutely in any in our statutes are very clear about that and this statute in fact I'm\nDefine it's not a pet animal means any animal that his community property and kept as a household hot so it was your sense of poverty if it was a pot before marriage or a pact that you received as a gift or the hair to pursue into this statute you don't even have jurisdiction to make orders what\nOr how often does this issue come up in divorce cases the viewer colleagues that you know had this as a major sticking point the unsettling of divorce\nMajor sticking point and sounding a settling a divorce has definitely come up\nMany many times um you know I Can't say that it's the reason that the case was settled um have an ... had a case where one party was willing to throw away everything over the division of the pets that\nThat's a good lawyer in comes in and and you really need to be creative and find a middle ground so as you said um you know sometimes you'll you'll just split the you'll split the you'll you'll custody casual and you'll say one we take me when we can do\nAnd and and not to work which I've seen not work out\nUm or if there's two of them you get one I got the other another way that I personally argued the issue of pet ownership is um by linking it to the children so if your parents and your children have extremely strong ties to your pets um I've\nBeen able to successfully argued that the parent with the primary custody should have the pets because it's in the message that the children can maintain that stability in familiarity one going through such a big transition\nTo society thank you so much for talking with us about this new California law the latitude and now gives to judges to consider what's in the best interest of the pet when a couple of
