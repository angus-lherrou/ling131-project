California this means that there is increasing populations in areas that are prone to burning\nAnd I would imagine that geographically speaking up probably makes these fires are hard to put out\nOh abs absolutely um we have only to look back for example of cedar fire in October two thousand three when I'm there were Fifteen deaths and discovered\nSome two hundred and Seventy three thousand acres and of course it was being fanned by Santa Ana winds\nBut I'm a lot of these homes were in canyons and they were Jason to open land open scrub labs so it may firefighting very difficult in terms of access but also to explain to the fire was was still weapon it's really hard to um address fires in the urban wild land interface\nOh you mentioned sound and you mentioned the senator wins um northern California fire October Santa Ana winds up is that a bad mix it sounds like it is\nIt is and and the one thing we have to keep in mind about October is that it is a really the the close of the the dry part of the year for California and even though often are wage don't come until sometime in December or January we basically have fuel loading in the wild land areas\nEspecially those areas that have not recently burned in the few loading is exacerbated by um how much moisture we've had in the prior wet year\nI'm so we can have a lot of vegetation going and then of course we move into that time of year when traditionally we thought Santa Ana winds I'm was going to be an operation\nWhat we have learned is that we can have Santa Ana winds virtually any time of the year I'm In the western United States\n... professor of geography at about ... studies at Cal State Northridge\nUm we also you know and I I think people when it's hot when it's very hot say there's a temperature of a hundred degrees July or August that's what I think people think well fire danger must be at its most extreme level because it's so hot but as you as you just mentioned October is the riskiest time fire isn't it\nYes and what we we look for is a shift in atmospheric patterns that this time of year when we start to get the dominance of very strong high pressure over the the Great Basin and um the difference between air that isn't high pressure area versus that that this off California coast\nWe tend to get these high velocity wins Santa Anna's here in Southern California the Diablo wins in northern California\nSo if it wasn't a myth before then the concept of fires that has\nTo be something that no one really believes with any certainty right\nRight right and and we have to look at what we called a destructive fires deadliest fires for such a large fires and and those are the categories I'm sitting at Cal Fire\nOn how they write their fires and I'm Paul October is one of the deadliest at least on record we have to look at um where are these fires occurred and many were in the urban areas or urban wild let interface will you do\nHave a growing population and that is very different than I'm going to look at fires that a large in terms of acreage like in the scene of complex fire this year\nRound but we're still going to probably go back and build right I mean we're going to go building those exact fire areas at some point even even when all common sense maybe tells us not to\nIt seems to be an inevitability I'm into a part of this is in the sale of land and people wanting to move out of a traditional urban areas\nUh at the same time a counter to that on is the donation of plans to maintain a open spaces purchase of last maintain open space that will then buffer uh-huh in marginally to these burgeoning urban areas\nOnly about thirty seconds what do you expect in the future in terms of deadly fires here in California\nI think what they see an increased and deadly fires as well as um eight which fires and those are two very different things um because we are we have certainly entered into a period of much warmer temperatures what we might term short of winters which early melting snow at higher elevations\nCounter to that can encounter to this warning trench I'm One of the things that that is being done his plans we move all the vegetation and these fuel loading areas so that is one way to try and address this problem\nI'm Leo ... is a professor of geography and environmental studies at Cal State Northridge thank you very much\nBy this going to do it

some lives here on eighty nine point three K PCC\n\nAnd welcome to the special edition of kick UDs form a debate about the future of California and who should be the next governor with John Cox and Gavin Newsom\nI'm Scott Shafer ... senior editor for politics and government and before we hear from the candidates I just wanted to let everyone know that this will not be a formal debate with the exact same questions to each candidate and strict time limits for answers that kind of thing and said it's going to be more of a wide ranging conversation\n... years ago and we never came up with successor agencies that we have specific goals and enhance infrastructure financing districts and the state taking advantage of these opportunities I once again what you heard from John is an illusory strategy where he criticizes NIH and identify problems but with all due respect doesn't have\nThe details and the strategies actually saw\nWhat are you what you heard from Avon is more government more plans to pay out money from government tax credits\nFor our plans for governments financing but if you don't really attack the cost of building the delays in building the litigation the lawsuits the impacts fees that are put on housing in the state if you don't do that what you're going to do is instill institutionalize these high rents\nI don't want rents costing three thousand dollars for a two bedroom apartment and then have government come along and subsidized people for a short time that is going to put us even more in debt and it's not addressing the problem and I have specific\nAnd I mean what is germane now is to understand more fully looks wanting to have quote unquote evolved on on same sex marriage I suddenly respect that\nBut you supported a constitutional amendment\nTo ban same sex marriage you you said you acquainted and Scott mentioned this and I haven't heard you\nAre of all on this that homosexuality leads to a beastie allergy that what you did and you quote him saying that and to quote unquote other things you you talked about transvestites isn't there a way of\nA vaccine notion that some people can choose not to be home school to stay away from a quote unquote transvestites have evolved on those specific points people the right to know that John\nI have and you know again this is all meant to take the topic away from the important things that people are worried about here in the state and that has the ability to rent a a decent apartment as a ... to talk about what else should against a screaming nation against renting as well ... ... hosted discrimination of all forms\nWere coming up on a break the real quickly for each of you which one of the represents the mainstream of California betterment Scott's\nI think I Do because I represent the people who are just trying to get by uh I wasn't putting office by billionaires I'd you know I I had to work my way up I had to say look I'm all go all the way through and and that's something that I think the people at the state and with ... with\nFifteen seconds [laughter] no I certainly think we represent the vast majority of California's that reject that John Cox is a ... a regents to Trump and Trump ism a and his long standing advocacy for causes that I don't think the vast majority of California and some ...\nAnd you're listening to the gubernatorial debate on kick you eat the I'm Scott Shafer we're going to take a very short break and we'll be right back [noise]\n\n[noise] oh\n\nAnd welcome back to ... we're talking with John Cox the Republican candidate for governor and Gavin Newsom the Democrats will switch topics and talking about criminal justice or last month Governor Brown signed a couple of bills giving the public\nUh under certain conditions more access to police personnel records and the video from police body cameras ... would you have signed either of those ...\nNo I wouldn't have and uh let me tell you I think we have a serious crime problem right here in the city now San Francisco is the number one city for property crimes and\nYou know Gavin was a mayor here for eight years or he didn't solve the homeless problem here at all and it's gotten worse and now a and not only that but Gavin was also the ah only statewide official to endorse prop forty seven which redefined a lot of ... as misdemeanor\nAnd I'll give him a chance to ... we're talking about insurance parents who those builders specifically about transparency I've told me why you wouldn't\nHave I favor transparency I certainly favorite transparency uh but I think we have to work more with our law enforcement and give them the tools and the ability to deal with a a you know this particular situations I I regret\nMean you have any in in a green that we should ask the media not to publicize the names and pictures of people who\nWants to have just grown into deflecting you're fundamentally oh I thought as issue that any commonsense gun safety\nAlthough I'm not I'm not opposed to what about background checks I'm not opposed amusing I write a this is this is a red herring and a you know this is about ... keeping up keeping reminiscent purchasing guns out of the hands of people that are mentally ill is a wonderful thing and I will certainly back that up completely alright\nWhere you've both talked about affordability and cost of living in California and so we have a listener question a look listen\nHi my name is Cindy care dynamic Akron Santa Clara California and I'd like to ask a candidate what is your position on California's Proposition ...\nIt's let's say that eliminates certain road repair and transportation finding out to have a flyer I that that don't yet on fixture kill the gas tax I'm just curious from each of them what their position at\nCalifornia proposition ... and we begin ... it's quite clear we've talked about this before you you have opposite positions on this uh you know Mr Cox about suburb supporter of driving force behind prop sick getting on the ballot you support the repeal\nA Mr new some you oppose it and I'm just wondering what what do each of you think the other one's position says about the kind of governor they\nWould be well I think it's clear ah I think given would not exercise enough control over the efficiency of our spending the Caltrans a\nCaltrans has been regularly a highlight it as one of the more inefficient uh agencies in the country it spends way more than a lot of other states to build a mile of road and uh there's a lot of contractors who make hefty contributions\nTo Gavin as well as to Mr Brown and ah and you know they build that into their cost and that the public pays for it and instead of reforming that system how would you do that\nWell we need to get the money out of politics and I'm gonna be talking about that day one on November seventh after him elected uh but you know we also need to make sure the Caltrans use it is money efficiently and you know the politicians are like Gavin uh went ahead and approved and increasing the gas tax they didn't want to do the tough job\nThe tough job would have been making Caltrans ah live within its means\nThe tough job would have been modifying sequel which which by the way it's been waved for a lot of sports stadiums uh who have connected investors\nAre but it's not been waved for road building and it's driven up the cost of housing or for housing and it's driven up cost and the people are paying for it and they can't keep doing that they are struggling unable to live in the states do to you then what would you what does it say about the kind of governor he\nWell let me I'll answer that but I Want to make some fundamental points here in San jose in San Francisco and LA of the worst road conditions in the United states of America\nOr what John just argued for us to make things worse his plan is to make things worse the fact is the legislature and the governor finally begin to address this issue in a substantive way he's talking about taking away over five billion dollars every single year for road improvements\nPublic safety improvements addressing the issue of traffic congestion which ended up itself is a hidden tax\nAnd to reconcile the fact that twenty seven other states since two thousand and Thirteen of increased uh their sales tax or rather gas taxes in an effort to improve their roads he chooses not to do that he talks about the loser the notion of efficient how to use ... or the fact is John you may not be aware of this but the entire payroll\nAt Caltrans just to point eight six billion dollars you can eliminate every single position I imagine that's the ultimate manifestation of efficiency know instill struggle to find the money or that you are taking away in advocating taking away from a proving our roads are ton of his faith\nIn our ... running a surplus right now it generates tens of billions of dollars\nFrom motor vehicle related uh sources us sales taxes on cars other things like that aren't being used we have a surplus or why are you about that guy or we'd digging into the pockets of people who are already paying\nThe highest housing prices the highest water prices the highest electricity prices in the country on what's the plan and we build the roads and we really use that old or a lot more dollars come from we're going to use money efficiently and we're ... we're going to cut good deals with contractors and\nYou know he can get an onion labor he can laugh about it because this budget has zoomed under the last eight years when Mr you know when Gavin was\nWas the governor and uh the budget has zoomed now to over two hundred billion dollars for me and they haven't been building roads\nBecause the last governor ah you're running of course you're a Republican the last Republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger or I mean you you said in your commercials that Democrats broken they broke everything that's why the states I mess but\nJerry Brown inherited a twenty six billion dollar deficit and he's leaving as you say a surplus so and part of what Arnold Schwarzenegger ran on was cutting the car tax so and the ... budget you\nGotta remember twenty tennis when Governor Brown took office\nThe whole country was in a financial disaster\nAt that point in time and so by cutting a car tax contributed to well no not necessarily no me either not housing crisis and the and the financial do though I have is that I mean well yeah but the ... budget melt meltdown and that's another issue that we need to talk about and that is the reliance on a very thin layer of people to finance this government\nAnd we've built up a huge amount of cost in this in this budget that has to be addressed and you know my Gavin is not going to address those things I'm going to have to address and because you know in the private sector I Can't afford to waste money\nHave to use every penny efficiently and that's not being done to Sacramento we're\nGoing to find more efficiency of culture and but I Want to make a point that you're emphasizing released from your question we inherited a twenty seven billion dollar budget deficit we have an eight and a half billion dollar budget surplus we've got a hundred and one consecutive months of net job growth a three point seven percent GDP Growth rate average over the last four years the lowest unemployment\nIn recorded history or California's great at three plus million jobs under governor Brown's minister ration or since two thousand ten we're proud of that record there are stubborn areas where we have to do more and do better on homelessness on housing the broader issues of cost of living I concur\nAnd the difference between myself and my opponent John Cox is we actually have strategies and plans\nTo address those issues with respect to kind of quote unquote efficiencies that culture and I can assure you that's not going to build any road or\n... years so you're saying that the money's there because there's a surplus but what happens in a downturn I mean in the gas tax is going to be generating five billion dollars for ten years so in a down those down years which are inevitable where the money comes along I think\nWe've got a certainly broaden that we've got to get a look at every expense that we in her uh we've got an audit every agency and we got to get root out the the waste in this budget and believe me there's a lot of it this budget has increased tremendously ah and ah there's a there's a tremendous amount of waste and and mismanagement that's going on this but\nAs far as we saw a much more to talk about you're listening to the gubernatorial debate on ... I'm Scott Shafer we're going to take a very short break and we will be back with Gavin Newsom ... [noise]\nHi this is Larry natural please join me at our next keeping you see the community open house Sunday October twenty first at the moment broadcast center in Pasadena\nDuring the new now where I'll be broadcasting live from air talks studio way you can come by see me an action ... facility and me keep you see the staff Andrew fellow listeners\nBring the family RSVP him get a free gift that keeps the sci fi dot org slash open house [noise] [noise]\nSometimes it seems like the news cycle is one big runaway train headed way too fast destination unknown\nI'm Mary Louise Kelly at all things considered we plan to our daily voyage carefully and take the time to see the important states along the way don't worry we'll still get you where you need to go all things considered from NPR News joined the journey\nWe dated for Ninety nine point three ...\n\nAnd we continue our conversation with the candidates for governor John Cox and Gavin Newsom I Want to say that uh before today or we reached out to a lot of reporters that we respect from places like the LA Times ... matters San Francisco chronicle Politico and our public radio partners and we got their suggestions for\nQuestions and topics and a lot of the questions you're hearing today are a reflection of their input so I Want to thank them for that\nThis question though comes from one of our listeners let's listen\nHi my name is Maria I lived in Daniel California my question to both of the ... yeah quite well they do to resolve the issue of our soul show every boat or folks you every city\nCould deal with the illegal Iranian problems that we have\nAnd we should say two to three million folks here ah who are here without documents here illegally uh who wants to go first\nWell I think public safety is the most important thing and uh I think we need to have law enforcement work together to make sure the public is safe um I've talked to a sheriff's all over the state who have told me that the sanctuary state law is an impediment\n... Jerry Brown has been taken flack from the left from the keep it in the ground a lobby fracking at about drilling in California not off the coast but in in a in the mainland of California would you reverse those policies that he's an act\nYeah I I think will tighten them up I think fracking starting to fall and so tired of Wall Street is the one leading this recognition or you've seen interest rates rise the fracking a experiment is beginning to wane a so I think that's a natural opportunity for the next governor to get a little bit more aggressive as fracking but\nAgain California is leading in almost every capacity we're creating jobs were leaning into the future uh this is California has a great uh I think foreign policy is one that I'm very proud that Governor brown has led a and boy I really hope folks are paying attention\nI Would be very cautious to revert back\nTo the normalization of de Vinci as it relates to the lack of intention analogy a and leadership around climate change California has a responsibility has an important international role to play I Am committed and passionate about that I Want to lead\n[noise] that's wonderful except that people can't afford\nTo live in this state and they're moving out and our electricity costs and our gasoline costs are pounding the average person and it's all well and good to talk about this wonderful goal that we have let's work toward it but let's not kill people in terms of their affordable lifestyle okay\nWe've got a few more minutes I Want to try and give them a couple of more topics in today's Brett Kavanaugh's first full day on the job at the Supreme Court and both of you have young daughter daughter's you have four daughters Mr Cox do you have two daughters younger [noise]\nAh but I'm Wondering like what do you think is such a bitter confirmation battle a lot of women are concerned what it means for reproductive rights and that sort of like what's your take away a from from what happened I mean what what what would you tell your daughter's a fast you're having a conversation with them\nYou know I I regret all the ... and politics today or if I have anything to say about it I'm going to try to get reforms that reduced the vis a vis in politics I think a lot of it has to do with fundraising\nAnd uh I think you saw that with a lot of the politicians in Washington on both sides a fundraising off there\nAre extreme statements and frankly you see it in this discussion with with Gavin you know trying to paint me as some you know uh as as different on so many issues and and and re characterize my positions are you know I think what we need to do is we need to take a step back\nAnd and try to get more comedy more ah you know kindness and a issue discussion in the world politics and you know I take a back seat as you mentioned a you know I have four daughters my mom was a working mom I think a doctor for it needed to be heard\nAnd and should have been bullied and uh have you voted to confirm right you know I I I'm not going to get in get in the middle of that frankly I'm focused on the issues in California but I wanted to point out that I led the recall of Bob Filner in as the mayor of San Diego because I think anybody who\nUh uses their position of power and authority to impose themselves on an under a someone who is subordinate to them or you know should be surcharge than uh you know should be removed from office frankly\nI think it's very relevant or you you say you care about the issues of California it's very relevant than Kevin ...\nBecause he could have a profound impact on Californian Californians\nOn their reproductive rights which you do not believe a woman has a right to choose regardless whether or not their rape or or had tragic and sort of incest or Kavanaugh will play an outsized role in that you've been an advocate for the repeal of the Affordable CARE Act which would have cost or in the Graham Cassidy bill one hundred and thirty eight point eight billion dollars by twenty twenty\nSeven in the state of California and that also eliminated funding for Planned Parenthood\nA and that will impact reproductive rights to access a for millions and millions of women and not only this state but across the country these things are relevant\nOr issues of private property rights issues of access to our beach in waterfront uh issues associated with our dreamers and our immigration policy a cabin I was going to play an outsized role in all those respective including presidential power after all those reasons I posed as nomination and I think it was a sad day yesterday when he got sworn in real quick\nResponse of the ones that are going on I I Will certainly appoint judges justices of the uh in California who will respect the constitution and and respect the U.S constitution and the California Constitution and try to keep the politics out of it because it's just too much of the way of politics involved it\nWe're almost at the end I Want to get both of you an opportunity to just sort of summarized what's at stake in this election and and because of the ... are going to start with you Mr Nixon and Josh will have less work\nWell I I think there's an enormous amount of saying I think you've got a good sense of where we are in key positions on the question I think for the voters is who's got the best ideas moving forward who's got the practical experience who has the capacity to deliver\nOn ideals and goals of my biggest issue again remains the issue of addressing the income and wealth disparities in the state that doesn't ... in a way that doesn't because other people success\nBut addresses these issues in a systemic way I run a campaign that's been positive our campaign commercials are not attacking my opponent or their attaching themselves to attacking problems with policy solutions and I think the most important thing and I want to just reinforce it here today the most important thing the next governor can do\nIs reconcile this fact eighty five percent of the brain is formed by the time someone's just three years old\nThe most important investment we can make\nTo address the issue of systemic poverty address the issue criminal justice reform is to begin at the beginning invest in prenatal care early headstart nurse home visits\nPreschool or that is the architecture of life and that is a disproportionate bias that I Want to bring into the work of governor and will be a top agenda find successful this November Mr Cox this election\nIs about change versus the status quo I represent change uh my opponent is for the gas tax he's for the train to know where that's a waste of money or for the taxpayers the state\nHis answer for the housing crisis uh is is a more government spending mine is to reduce the cost of housing so that people can afford to live in this state\nWe talk about education but the the schools are failing our children that as a future that we are giving up\nA I've been in the public sector or the private sector for forty years getting things done a given has been in office for sixteen years he's been the lieutenant governor for eight years never had any of these things ah that he talked about and in solving the problems\nWe need to solve the problems with the state we need to get change we need to make sure that California leaves the way an education a Ford ability or water or Iowa against water rationing ah which he is four so there's a lot of areas that people need to know that we are opposed and\nI Will make the state affordable livable again\nAll right thank you very much and I want to acknowledge that we didn't really talked about education absolutely true didn't talk about pension or water healthcare big topics lead and yet we had an hour or so ah people to go to your Web site where\nI'd be willing to have another one of these discussions it's important to have agreed to five of these in the heck it my my young for

I Would agree with Marie so we may not know anything particularly knew about these two candidates you do see how they think on their feet to a certain extent there were some questions asked a that maybe they hadn't been asked before\nUh and I think that their interaction with each other was interesting to me some of the bigger contrast came around immigration and sanctuary state\nAre you on the way out to John Cox uh said to me that he was not happy that I asked about gay marriage\nAnd you know it is wild gay marriage maybe a settled issue in some ways are there are aspects of that religious freedom for example that are still a before the courts a and I think people want to know how do you how to how ... how does the governor feel about some of these issues because it reflects what kind of judges they might have points\nFor example the kind of people they'll put on commissions and so on\nAre also I was struck by the fact that John Cox seemed a significantly more polished than\nWhen I had spoken with them before the primary election ... you can vary inexperienced a little bit flustered um seems like over the course of campaigning in these several months that his presentation is significantly smoother\nWell it isn't because they've been debating a lot [laughter]\nI can tell you that ah he would like to do more of these uh and uh you know the front runners typically don't want to do that they want to limited limit the potential for damage or for a mistake that can be used and go viral that's I think why it was on radio we would have been happy to have it on TV as well\nUh but you know I I'm not going to judge whether he was ... or a a let's leave that to somebody else I thought it was a good a back and forth between the two of them\nUm and I think you know Gavin Newsom really I think it has a more more specificity in what he says he wants to do more familiar with government than John Cox isn't that makes sense he's been in government for you know a long time so I think that was reflect\nYou know what struck me Larry ... um you know new some have struggled with dyslexia he's been very open about that and so it's one of those things where I think he's practice he had to his whole life memorize stuff like really detailed numbers and policy\nAnd you can see that and then there'll be like that that he's been doing this for a long time and that you know heat that memory um because he can't really rely on no teeny told us recently I'm political breakdown that you know he can't he\nCan't read speeches they sound terrible and so I think that that was sort of an interesting you know not not a policy issue but just in terms of style you can see that that he comes in with\nA head full of facts and figures and and direct quotes that he really can draw from\nAbout ... what was your sense of our newsroom was positioning themselves um relative to the progressive wing of California's Democratic Party versus perhaps those voters that might be more toward the center\nYou know I think the new Sam is trying to walk a fine line I mean they both are in some ways I'm Cox with more sort of a Trump versus not Trump positions um I think that you need them is trying to come across and in some ways\nI'm as a pragmatist around some of these issues but also to push what he sees as what he what he calls California values and so you know we didn't get into the health care very deeply\nBut you do you see on issues like the ... state a lot of deference to our current governor who I think is um you know\nOne of ... people across some you know the political spectrum maybe not to the far right but do you have respect for Jerry Brown and so I think that he's when when you hear him you know sort of defer to how brown has handled some issues over the last eight years I think that's a nod to the fact that he doesn't want to just come off\nAs a super far left San Francisco and that he wants to speak\nTo more moderate Democrats in and of course is that growing share of no party preference setters\nMarie so you just mentioned about the sanctuary cities to back and forth or let's start with how John Cox characterized his view\nI've talked to a sheriff's all over the state who have told me that the ... state law is an impediment\nOr to their ability to police their communities and to make sure that criminal activity is reduced uh I think if somebody's here illegally and they're engaged in criminal activity I think it's up to our public officials to to to to keep them up\nYou know you get rid of a century law that I Would get rid of the Harvard law\nWell I think we need to get the legislature to do that and and if they don't do it I think we need to get a vote of the people and\nHere's one of the ... porch contrast between myself and John Cox uh he's someone who believes very passionately and building the wall\nOr he believes that sanctuary policy should be eliminated he believes in the elimination of she refers to the chain migration which nothing more than family reunification parents in almost every opportunity Donald Trump and Trump ism and drop without an advocate in Sacramento if he becomes the next governor as it relates to the issue\nOf immigration here the facts and with respect to the question I Hope the listener or has the benefit of listening to this and that is fundamentally a the immigrants with the state or under not over under represented in the criminal justice system the fact is sexually counties\nAre not more violent more dangerous than non sexually cities and counties quite the contrary

[noise]\nYou're listening to what state wide call in after the only scheduled gubernatorial candidates debate here in California\nI'm Lorraine mantle of NPR member station KPCC Los Angeles we're just following ... San Francisco's gubernatorial debate between Republican John Cox and Democrat Gavin Newsom I'd like to hear your thoughts about the debate\nOr who you thought better presented himself and the reasons why that your analysis of it not necessarily just why you support one or the other candidate but what about this particular\nHead to head conversation affected you most and why eight six six\nEight nine three five seven to two that dark all in numbers state wide whether you were in the San Francisco bay area San Diego county Monterey Bay area or throughout the five county Southern California region eight six six eight nine three\nFive seven to two let's listen to another uh selections from the debate this one about their different policies on gun control\nAll right ... thank you we appreciate it very much he's housing reporter for Cal matters and for the California Dream project which is a collaboration of cow matters\nAs well as California public radio stations once again on this state wide call in program I heard on the PBS cake Q. E. D. and caves you we look forward to your calls with your analysis at eight six six\nEight nine three five seven to two also chance for Southern California is listening on K PCC to share their thoughts about the debate the only scheduled gubernatorial debate\nBetween Gavin Newsom and John Cox we just heard from the studios of NPR member station KCPW Q. E. D. San Francisco uh let let me take a call right here it comes from Alan in riverside\nAllan uh how did you think the candidates came across\nWell I consider myself a moderate Democrat and I don't think that to gather news represents a my views at all um I think the ... state uh issue should have been put to a vote or I think we rely too about the ah the high speed rail\nI'm only I'm voting yes on ... six\nIt's to me it's a matter of credibility and judge Kavanaugh's name was mentioned but nobody mentioned the fact that ah yeah the news some uh slept with his campaign managers life in two thousand seven um now my California values or don't think that's very cool so um\nAnd she also worked for a new system at the time he has he has apologized for that and said that he's made tremendous changes in his life since that point but\nYes that issue did not come up a during the course of the debate there were questions about John Cox a statement about\nHis values and whether they're aligned with California views of same sex marriage some of the comments that Cox had made before a about um what he said his fears were if there was such a thing as as same sex marriage to be\nLegalized I thank you Alan for that let me go back to Sean Walsh Republican\nPolitical analysts the things that are expected to drive Republicans to the polls potentially lease is\nYou know proposition six the gas tax repeal I as well as you know people that are upset about the bullet train about regulation and the like um would you expect it more on this to come up from the two particularly from Cox\nUh Larry you hit the nail on the head I mean that last caller is a prime example and that's the exact voted that Mr Cox needs to attract a moderate to conservative Democrat he's got issues with regards the high speed rail\nHe's got issues with regards to sanctuary cities or Mr Cox didn't do was just lay out in a very short but concise way of what his immigration perspective is and then hit very hard\nAt the fact that uh undocumented immigration cause billions of dollars in education cause billions more in health care cost billions more than incarceration costs\nAnd so not talking about making it clear contrast between legal and illegal immigrants\nAnd then laying that out and I think that would resonate with conservative and moderately conservative Democrat so I just think he missed a real opportunity there and then on taxes as well as on single payer health care issues what the real long term costs or\nI think if you hammer those issues hard in contrast to the fact the gab and really is a creature of public employee unions and activists the labor unions in this area he would have done better I think he just missed that opportunity\nMatt Rodriguez democratic strategist what do you think\nYeah I thought I also thought a lot more eyes what Sean us talking about I thought a Cox would push harder on sort of the outsider piece of this\nYou know God has been in office for a long time a and a lot of his path to be I mean officers paid by relatively wealthy donors and he was he was in a pretty good position and ... kind of touched on that but not really and I got to hit a lot more and being like if you like the status quo and keep going was going on but you want some changes I'm your guy and there are some risks that obviously but\nYou know Gavin as you say he kept a tie himself to Jerry Brown is very popular democratic taught her how he agreed with him he wanted to build on what he's doing he talked about some of the successes that he's had\nAs he was really going after the base and try to broaden it out a little bit he has his work on same sex marriages work on gun control he thinks it's a relatively popular in California I just thought costs would try to do more to say like you're not going to get a different result if you you know like your favorite trinity bills are too high for people spending and kids in schools is is is not good\nUh you know if if your housing costs are too high they just ran through a gas tax which is going to cost you a lot more money is an average person those are appealing message as\nOffer the types of voters talks going after but he never quite made the case that eyes and outside of here's how I can get these things done he would just say well I'm not really sure of the legislatures going to need to repeal ... or ... not going to repeal a sanctuary city law so he just didn't quite have enough specifics to match I think his outsider image and I think it's a delicate balance that you need and he wasn't able to do that\nLet's hear how the two candidates a shared their views on climate change governor Jerry Brown's efforts to put California at the forefront of responding to climate change we begin with Gavin Newsom combat\nJohn Cox uh will celebrate or at least acknowledged a enthusiastically that Donald Trump\nOr did the right thing when he pulled out of Paris I reject that and I applaud the leadership and the state of California Berkeley Governor Brown\nOr to radically changed the way we produce and consume energy ... plotters effort to get to a hundred percent renewables by twenty forty five to get to sixty percent\nRenewables by twenty thirty a and I believe California has unique grown responsibility not just nationally but internationally to lead\nA again a stark contrast in this campaign for governor someone who believes in climate change believes that it's manmade John Still is not convinced it's manmade someone who's led as a former mayor a low carbon green growth someone that will take\nA the principles and goals in the objectives that have been outlined over the last few years uh and make them real substantively\nThe goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions forty percent below Nineteen Ninety levels by twenty thirty a that is going to be a challenge I'm up for that challenge to John is not again a stark contrast televisions given life to make these political statements and I think it's for the laundry ... wonderful\nGoal to have renewable energy I'm I'm all in favor\nBut we can't cheat increasing the cost of electricity I favor nuclear power I think that can be done cleanly a natural gas uh\nCan be done ... I Believe we we could you know a use technology to ultimately a have cars that are much cleaner burning but we right now the wind doesn't always blow in the sun doesn't always shy and we need to make sure that we have a backup pose\nThat Republican John Cox proud of that you heard from Democrat Gavin Newsom and this came your way just about an hour ago on these NPR member stations here in California the only scheduled gubernatorial candidates debate\nWe have a number of calls from up and down California want to weigh in on what we all heard your particular perspective at eight six six\nEight nine three five seven to two brand in West Berkeley that's John Cox says things that are important to me the state needs to be paying attention with fiscal policies but it scares me he's so in line with Trump back in a minute\nComing up following fresh air that's coming up at noon it's BBC News hour that's at one o'clock Kim Frank's is in Brazil where the far right candidate is likely to become the next president plus will the new un warning on climate change be heated and development in Spain's baby theft scandal the world follows it to then it three on marketplace\nIn Japan thousands of companies use for an intern to address the country's labor shortage could it be violating labor and safety laws but here on keeping the seat\nGave me the the supporters include politic on the unconventional political convention of weekends at debates handles and comedy with Kathy Griffin Michael ... and more October twenty and twenty first at the convention center tickets at politicocom downtown Newark voting Cassidy and his best\nEvent space in twenty eight teams better readers of Pasadena Weekly located in Pasadena from your provide banquet rooms and catering for weddings meetings skeleton special occasions N O R events dot com\n[noise]\nWelcome to uh California Dream post debate special I'm Lorraine mantle of NPR member station KPCC in Los Angeles\nWe heard last hour the only scheduled debate between the candidates for governor Democrat Gavin Newsom Republican John Cox\nAnd now we're hearing from public radio listeners throughout California\nOur number is eight six six eight nine three five seven to two\nYou can also tweet at K.
