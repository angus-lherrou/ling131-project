{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Uh how old are you don't make a deer or beer how would they have made something like\nThat well that the question I kind of blew my mind because clearly something made\nThese and they're weird and that was the first time where I was like maybe\nMaybe while also brought kind of broke through your scientific reasoning because to be clear you you've seen the ... you're you're believer in science in rational thought so it's not like you're just someone that's always dreamt of this being true and now you're just doing a podcast about it\nNo I had like no real interest I guess you could say in big but then I found out I have this relative who was the preeminent academic experts on Bigfoot and he'd been a tenured professor of anthropology ... Grover cramps\nAnd I wanted to understand more like what would have compelled him to go down that road and what he saw and what he learned\nIn your research Laura ... any places here in Southern California or just California where people say they've seen big foot\nOkay well the most famous citing is actually in California it's from Nineteen sixty seven\nAnd you probably know the film that was shot that is the land of the ... or older Patterson gambling film a shot you know fifty one years ago now and it's just extremely shaky footage\nOf a giant hairy men like creature walking away through the woods and in the last moment it sort of turns and looks over his shoulder so that's the most famous setting and that's been bluffed creek which is\nNot far from eureka ... way up and coming up in the north um and then early this year there was a woman who was up in arrowhead and oh that's right down the street yeah it's not very far from here\nAnd she she said that she had seen\nSeveral big feet or big foot big foot and she reported the siding and then she filed a lawsuit with the California Department of fish and wildlife are fish and game saying that this species needed to be protected and she wanted she was suing them saying that they weren't doing enough to protect us endangered species\nNow you actually spent some time visiting businesses inspired by big but took place in Los Angeles right do what's it about\nSo the big foot lodge is the brainchild of a guy named Bobby green who wanted to open his first bar and wanted to do something it was a little different than the normal California bar so he wanted for this [laughter] like very mountain any national park national forest kind of a lodge feel you go inside and it's dark\nAnd there's taxidermy deer heads all over the wall\nAnd that was very deliberate sort of take you out of LA and put you in sort of a\nMountain e spooky frame of mind\nMore if they're ever came a time where before just decided to come down the mountain and say okay you know what I've done hiding I Want to be out in the world so let's just say we found proof it's their ... or ... or whatever how do you think the world would take knowing that it's real\nWell I think initially there would be a tremendous amount of excitement you know and I think that there would be a lot of people who would feel very very vindicated because I think for people who have said\nI've seen big foot I Believe in Bigfoot I'm Out looking for what they've taken a lot of ... for that um but then I think there'll be a lot of regulations that get set up to protect the species which makes sense\nUm and I think for a lot of the people who were out looking for Bigfoot now that may end up being kind of a hard thing because if you had the freedom to go out into these forests and like look for this creature and then all of a sudden everyone's saying no this is protected habitat you can't go do this anymore you know that that might be a little hard\nThat's Laura ... new podcast wild thing a series about sasquatch science and society Laura thank you very much thank you and this has been fun than if you want to find out more about the wild

member station Wu as she reports on what it's like for people in Panama City who are trying to leave the coast\nI'm oversimplifying you know what you've said when you've been on his previously but the takeaway always come away with because this is supply demand W always at this point that we just simply don't have enough housing\nAnd and that that's that's gonna be the prominent factor when it comes to a values and to availability and you see anything changing and that\nNo not really um the state has a gotten a few\nFew three through their their upgrading their arenas standards wave as be thirty five which allows developers who I have a certain share for housing units to bypass local control um but while they are sort of nibbling around the edges of the problem you know we we did an analysis not\nToo long ago unanswered question if you wanted to maintain that ... percent job growth in the state of California\nHow many building permit should you see per year and the answer is somewhere between two hundred and ten and two hundred and sixty thousand somewhere in that range right now the state's running about a hundred and twenty five thousand half that pace so it gets back to the idea that that the supply constraints um\nThat might affect people's decisions on buying\n[noise] well ... what's interesting about that comment is we got to also remember that there were cuts in the income tax I'm a stay at the at the higher levels of national federal income taxes\nAre and of course those would pass your corporations got an ... nice cat tax cut his well candidly here in a high price California or for those high income earners were talking about yeah they lost it over a year but they probably gained some back over there\nOn that they're not that got going to be that influenced and [noise] you know candidly it's it's worth noting that I'm particularly in places like California that is so supply\nA constrained are you really don't see that much of an impact of of of these sort of changes in the financing a lot of folks have been talking about a big pulled back and real estate I just started a year because these tax changes\nThat never occurred we didn't really see any market affect it wasn't until these interest rates are to tip up that things really started to slow down so I I don't see that being a big\nFactor we still have developed ... land that is on the periphery of major cities in California\nBut it seems like the demand for those suburban properties isn't what it was through the barriers to building there\nAre are too great well what's your assessment of what we're seeing in the way of of ships some white people wanting their housing how far they're willing to drive where jobs are being created how is that factoring into all of this issue of construction\nBy not sure if you're aiming at it may look out Chris I'm Sorry weigh in on that yeah you know I'm Out at\nThe UC Riverside uh now I run a Center for economic forecasting development out there along with wearing my my beacon hat and you know actually the Inland Empire right now is is the fastest growing largest economy in this larger economy in the states I met from a year over year job growth perspective and\nThe housing market out there actually has been doing spectacular and you'll see a lot of a new purchases coming and yes they are being influenced at some level by these interest rates way that LA is ... some of the some of the really the\nUpward mobility of these ... of these more inland housing market says is very strong right now and and reflects the fact that a lot of folks who are priced out of the coast are moving inland when you see that in Sacramento as well we're we're getting prices are are growing in a very solid base right now\nDo you think we are creating units it is just\nThe difficulties coming up with enough units in urban areas are and and you know maybe Stuart Gabriel you can speak to this point of\nYour what are the obstacles to you know more um housing development in some of the areas where you know there's there's opportunity vacant lots or you know a rundown homes that could where you could do a multi family housing\n\nWell the ah\nThe constraints to development than any of our coastal areas or far profound most base areas are built jail they're heavily regulated they bid regulated for some time\nIn a way on costs are so high Larry that it's very very difficult from a private developer profit maximizing perspective\nTo put any affordable product\nIn an area where lay on costs are as high as they are so that we have what appear to be almost symbolic efforts at affordable housing development in in the coastal areas\nBut truthfully it it is just Chris has indicated the\nIf you're looking for a material increments to affordable housing supply\nThose increments are going to occur where the way on costs are lower LA on costs are lower in interior areas to the state and the interior areas to the states have always been sort of a a spillover\nArea for high housing to male dog that goes so everything on the interstate eighty court or going towards sack Leno from the bay area everything going east from

at the P. R. dot org per call six to six five eight three five line three three [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nA number of California's major cities have rent control ordinance is currently on the books the idea of forces to help people who are longtime residents in rental properties be able to afford to stay in those properties even as\nThe value of those um multi unit structures go up\nThe the limits on rent control in California are largely through what's known as the Costa Hawkins rental Housing Act and it limits rent control for the city to choose to enact those policies in three major ways only applies to single family homes\nAnd the rent control cannot apply to construction a that was finished after February first to Nineteen Ninety five so properties built in the last twenty three years are not subject to rent control\nAnd third rent control or does not apply when a new rancher comes into the property so once you turns over for rent controlled unit opens up the tenant leaves new ... comes in\nThe owner of the property can set at a market rate so that's current under the Costa Hawkins but proposition ten on euro November six California ballot would do away with Costa Hawkins and would enable those cities to choose to enact rent control or two I have much more latitude in the choices that they make\nA once they were free from Costa Hawkins with us to talk about prop ten we begin with occidental college professor of politics in urban and environmental policy and representative for yes on ten beat her dryer professor good to have you with us again next or\nUh do give us the sort of what you see is the practical benefit of ten if it's passed\nA proposition ten is about local control it's giving cities in California the\nOption to decide whether they want to regulate rent to help address the affordability crisis in California rents have gone up a twice as fast as people's incomes and so I'm most Californians are renting\nA at a paying fifty percent or thirty five forty percent of their income just to keep a roof over their head so what I'm a prompt with allowed to use to do is to adopt a stronger a set of rent regulations or it would apply to a to apartment buildings that\nWere built after Nineteen Seventy eight but it would not apply to any new construction and I'm\nAs a result of that the uh you know what really hurt uh the\nThe ability of the developers to build new apartments um the the no people are saying that uh it'll hurt the supply of housing but that's not the case so it\nDoesn't apply to new construction worldwide lighted what is the date standard which what's considered\nNew ... with the date that the those are the passage of the ordinance of of that proposition and so there's ... there's ... over the country and none of them are part of new construction\nOr what do we do is it all out some of the apartments rebuild after Nineteen Seventy eight to have a rent regulations and it would allow a when words are a fair return on by the constitution they have to have a fair return on their investment and so um the cities will be able to um\nRegulate rinse they'll be able to stop rent gouging\nUm but they won't um of an impact on uh on one side or the ... to stay in business well\nWe'll talk later about what fair returned and how that's determined this applies well to counties for their unincorporated areas could they could LA county for ... for example implement this or not just cities yes All right we're talking with Peter drier occidental college professor proponents\nOf proposition tend to rent control
