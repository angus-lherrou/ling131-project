LA county sheriff Jim McDonald with us regularly scheduled visit just sharing that ... percent of the sworn deputies within the department are women\nUm obviously one would like to see that hire that you have higher\nThan other comparable law enforcement organizations and share just briefly why do you think that is that you're getting a higher percentage than say LAPD or some of the other departments [noise]\nWell I think we're in an attractive employer for a number of reasons but certainly the diversity of the positions that we have the diversity of responsibility we\nWe do what say for instance our partners at LAPD do for for a million people spread out over forty seven hundred square miles with all of the things that the public thinks of as traditional policing practices\nBut in addition we also oversee the jails and the courts the colleges the hospitals the parks search and rescue and a third of MTA\nSo when you look at the diversity of responsibilities we have those are career options that somebody can come into the organization\nDecide what suits them best for on any number of fronts whether it's scheduling whether it's just their interest in a certain kind of specialized law enforcement and be able to uh you know either have that as a career path or to be able to move around different specialties throughout their career\nAnd so I think people find that attractive and it's certainly something that we offer that beyond what I think most any other police agency in America\nSo you have a recruiter comes in and the person can say look I ideally like to work the courts have a nine to five Monday through friday job and you're able to accommodate that\nYou know people if they work work I'd have a good reputation in a and focused themselves on a certain specialty they can achieve that they can get to where they they find a is most appealing to them\nAll right John Macdonald let's talk about uh the LA county board of supervisors a yes or looking at a potential ballot measure that would give subpoena power to uh the civilian oversight commission you you've been concerned about that and express that\nUh if the board of supervisors were to do that if we're past how would you respond to that\nYou know it's it's probably going to move forward to a vote or my position on it remains the same as it was I was very supportive and I am of the civilian oversight commission\nOr their role as I see it and as it was a initially proposed was to be a bridge between the community and uh and the department and they have the inspector general to be able to answer any questions that they want to answer to work as their investigative arm if you will and so by\nI think uh giving subpoena power turns that body into an investigative body which duplicates the work of the inspector general's office and so I think we may potentially lose some of the bridge of communication and and instead refocusing duplicate the efforts that are already in place\nAnd uh I just look at that and and you know don't know what we would get a further than what we have now the inspector general has access to literally everything in the department or there's no need for subpoenas to be able to get any information and I think the inspector general himself would validate that\nAh so the I Believe that if the residents recognize the complexities of modern law enforcement and such a large and diverse community and prefer that the ultimate responsibility remain with inexperienced law enforcement professional who they elect\nNow this could could this let's say you're reelected share of let's say that this measure will pass in the future\nWould that set up a potential legal battle because you're an elected official unlike a police chief who has an appointed position so you you are an elected official you'd have this this oversight body with subpoena power could that potentially lead to a legal conflict\nYou know I'm not sure about the how that would work out certainly I Would a Sikh legal counsel from the county council on that front I'm hopeful that we don't get to a position where it is adversarial like that but I I see a going in this direction would provide a\nYou know for a more adversarial relationship than we have now and it was never intended to be adversarial was intended to be that bridge a bridge of communication between the department and our many diverse communities we have a tremendous cadre of people who come from all walks of life tremendous expertise on a number of different fields\nAnd you know the way it is functioning now I think is a is something that could be a model for other agencies across America so to take it to where\nThe inspector general is already doing the work that day or a or some would favor this EOC doing I think is both duplicate of in a redundant and that uh is unnecessary\nBefore we close I wanted to ask you about the pull over procedures peel pie\nProgram that you're involved in I'm a member when I was starting to drive and my father sitting down and explaining here's what you do if you get pulled over idle hands in plain sight don't move fast if if you need to get out of the car for some reason tell the officer asked for ... you know where all the my dad walking me through All right now\nBut I understand that's not the case with many people when they start driving so is this sort of design to give people that sense of what you do when you're pulled over\nYeah you know this is a program that ah one of our chiefs saw on TV and reached out to the two individuals who would put this program together and we met and realize that this could be a great collaboration in light of all that's going on nationwide any ability we have to be able to better communicate with people that we are out there to serve\nA it everybody wins on that one and then this particular one it's a training a protocol put together more than nine hundred high school students went through this pop training\nAnd all of those who took the cost and were surveyed\nOr Ninety four percent of those said that the presentation improve their knowledge of law enforcement's expectations of them in eighty two percent think that the costs will improve the overall relationship between law enforcement and the general community\nSo they're the reviews from that were exceptionally positive and uh I I'm hopeful that as we continue to move forward with this that it's a vehicle for communication and understanding of what each side\nIt's going through during a a typical traffic stop\nRight and and how many people are you looking at potentially coming through the program\nOh as many as we can we can do I mean this could become potentially part of driver training or it could be part of a high school ah curriculum as well and trying to be get particularly get new drivers but it applies to everyone\nYeah if only they still have driver training yeah well yeah yeah when we're coming up they are no no no longer have the [noise] All right and uh just finally want to mention that gun offenders will serve their full sentence in county jails you made that just said no no ah early release for those used a gun and the commission of grime\nYeah you know we we have ah as you know overcrowding issues and and people are leaving our custody much earlier than I think anybody would expect they would\nThere's a number of violent crimes that we keep people in custody for a hundred percent of their time we've added over fifty gun charges stood up to be able to just set the tone that is very important to our society that the gun owners should be taken seriously that people ah\nYou know what the gun violence is not going to be tolerated\nThank you so much or McDonald's good at what they're

B. B. gave me\nA and and the report it said three people went to a shelter and I applaud that one person was sent home or to family that's wonderful but seven people were moved to a waiting list well move to a waiting list is not move to having a roof\nOver your head and so I Would like to see us set up the shelter and services either before we begin intensive clean up or as we begin to intensive clean up\nAnd and I'm more concerned about people on the streets than I Am a about trash intense one of my colleagues reached out and said Andy thanks for caring more about people than you do about trash intense\nAnd that and that's totally understandable Andy but I Wonder given\nThe the fact they're so much pushback from different communities to shelters or permanent supportive housing being developed there\nIs is part of that effort of courting support or lessening opposition showing that the city is able to deal with what's going on in the streets as shelters open\nYes I Believe it is and and good management is also something that neighbors are calling for they're calling for good security they're calling for twenty four seven care and accountability and all of those things should be answered but I\nYou know it'll be interesting to see how wide the clean up is when we've only provided forty five beds and there's already a waiting list and yet we're cleaning up while they're still people\nOn the streets I I Believe the mayor and the city and the county need to declare a state of emergency for the FEMA like disaster that it is and and respond in a way that that shows that it is a disaster we we have a city\nWhere we have thousands of people living on the streets twenty five percent are under a roof Seventy five percent of people experiencing homelessness\nOr on the streets whereas in New York who came and told us to build sixty structures they have a roof over Ninety six percent of the eighty one thousand people experiencing homelessness much more\nMuch higher number than we do and they are working hard to get the four percent remaining\nOff the streets and that is the kind of heart change an action that needs to happen in LA and and we need as the New York guys that\nBreak down the door and get it done rather than this modest a step by step approach we are in a crisis\nWe're talking with Andy bales the c._e._o. of the union rescue mission on Skid Row downtown Los Angeles I'd like to hear from you your thoughts about\nThe city of Los Angeles is new enforcement efforts around Fifteen different homeless shelters to clear the streets to take individuals properties and to put it into storage overnight\nOr or I should say during the day question uh for you whether you think this is the right move or not we're at eight six six\nEight nine

thank you for being with us\nLarry thanks for having me so Jessica uh do you apply this effort of the city\nYeah it's you know I think it just hearing my good friend Andy big time that this is a very clearly that's not an us versus them where are\nWe are a weak coalition and I think we're all in this wanting to solve homelessness and move people off the street you know our members at DCA has been extremely supportive out initiatives\nLike everyone's then campaign our social service operators who are on the frontlines\nDay and night hoping\nGet people into housing and services and of course the mayor's rich home project with al ... being the first a\nTemporary shelter and that's kind of remembers worked closely with the city to ensure that it is a success and are supportive of the overall goal of building more permanent housing and temporary site to get people off the street\nWe know we need more housing we need it after we need to find innovative ways to make it cheaper we need more of an all types of housing on the spectrum and our members have been\nCommitted to working with city leaders government officials to help bring ideas and solutions\nTo the table we want to develop best practices and we think of a blow present a new opportunity to do something different we know the status quo in the way that we've handled\nAddressing homelessness has has not been successful and this being the first project of its kind you know they're going to be learning lessons from it and an an opportunity to to see what works amend and then hopefully be able to replicate and build more
