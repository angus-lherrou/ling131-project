when they go to the pharmacy counter they want more information\nAbout their cost and the types of financial assistance as available and we think that's a better approach that gives people the list

like a dollar believe it or not it sounds strange to your listeners so we're we're simply the middleman the vehicle so that members actually get their drugs\nAnd it's a struggle for us there ... drugs that we can no longer carries simply because of the costs are the escalating cost what's known as firemen ... going on at an anecdotal level I'll give you an example 'cause I'm intimately involved in this facet of the business\nYou you work for a health insurance carrier\nYes insolence influence are critical insulin are critical enough or the\nCost\nOf um you know per member per month cost the state of California nationally but the escalation of the cause of insulin just for the carriers has been going up dramatically by double digits in the past few years just as the carrier level we spend per member per month\nSomewhere between six hundred over a thousand dollars\nOn insulin and there's no way we can afford to continue to cover those costs on some of the players at zero coat it would be ideal\nBecause we want the members to take it but we just can't continue to absorb it so I really take exception to some of the comments at the former representative made because if someone on the front lines I see it every day the impact it has both a security level and on the number of Rob\n... Robert how hang on let me go back to Robbie Zirkelbach of ... your your response to the listener Robert\nYeah well I think this is exactly why\nWe need to give patients more information about their cost and not just focused on the list price 'cause then someone is a great example what people might not realize is that I'm fifty percent on average of\nThe price of insulin is actually ... back to insurance companies um that through their negotiations and yet when a patient is in need insulin and they go to the pharmacy counter or have a cup cocoa insurance\nThey're actually asked to pay the full list price\nEven though their insurance company is getting a discount of a fifty percent or more and this is why just focusing on the list price and not giving people more information about what their costs are and where the costs are actually going in the system can be very misleading\nFor mine is why we want to make sure we're providing much more comprehensive information to patients just putting a list price in an ad\nI Need to wrap up real quickly David merit of a hip to health insurance plans how would this be enforceable if the federal government said to drug manufacturers you got to do this\nWell I think there is already rules and regulations around what ah companies need to include um in their advertising in the long list of fun read where there's always the over um\nPossible side effects that's not done because they want to be helpful that's done because it's federal law so\nAdding on a a component that includes list price I think is easy to work for us it's either done or it's not um I certainly welcome Robbie and warm as I'm a new found um devotion to you know more transparency we've been calling for more transparency on how list prices are set\nUm help pricing has actually done\nRight so we we hope that we can work together to actually Sean more transparency in wars in Iraq on the price across as itself\nGentleman thank you very much that's David ... with us as well you can share your comments on the air talk page K.

challenge to Republican incumbent Steve night we'll be back with her in just\nSo you'll also get to hear his take on the district and the issues that a replay or you can also ask a question to our call screeners who were there to walk eight six six eight nine three K PCC or again the year talked page and let us know uh\nYour your thoughts about this district if you lived there and what you think are the biggest issues\nI'm One of the the issues here given that it's been historically or a Republican district is perhaps getting your constituents um hedge around the idea of baby voting for a Democrat because you're going to be tough for you to rely only on Democrats hearing with demographic shifts\nHow you've been making that case\nTo those voters that you know maybe for the first time they would want to vote for a Democrat\nShirt well first of all I say that at my dad's a lifelong Republican first time you've ever voted for a Democrat is when he voted for me in June and he's gotten all of his friends to vote for me as well\nUm but you know I think a big part of it as just saying that this these are not partisan issues that we're talking about we're talking about our values\nAbout decency about making sure that I'm a voice for this community and I said if people were not going to agree on every single thing\nBut what I can promise you that I'm going to be up front about it I'm going to listen to your perspective and I'm an I'm an ultimately take the votes that I think are best for this community based on everything that I'm hearing and I'm not going to be accountable to my party or to\nUm you know huge\nSpecial interests and and big corporate donors because I'm not taking that kind of money so um I think that that's really where we're we're finding head of the the best common ground is is about a really making sure that this is I'm somebody that they can trust and that that the truth is most people are somewhere in the middle right and that's kind of what we're approaching this campaign is\nIf you were elected to the house as part of a democratic um majority taking control of the house of representatives what would you like to see is your party's approach in the house to President Trump would you want to see a series of investigations launched\nUm would impeachment be something that you would ultimately support how how should a Democratic majority house um behave related to the president\nWell I think are we're going to if we are coming in there with the majority were coming in there with a mandate\nTo rebuild the the trust of the American people in our government and and that's really I think what we have to go in there with the approach of it's not just about you know going against President Trump it's about what are we for it and were for a few different things but the first in the most important I think is about really\nHaving a representative government and that's kind of a three pronged approached the first is campaign finance reform at the second is about addressing the corruption that we're seeing in government and that includes some of the things that we're seeing with President Trump\nAnd the third is really run voting rights and making sure that every single person actually has a a voice so at some of the first resolutions that we're going to put into place are and and take those on our around those central issues and that'll set the path and allow us to address the other issues that we're facing infrastructure healthcare\nOn and on and but in terms of the president Democrats alone are never going to be able to impeach him so it would take Republicans also getting to that point but I Do think we and we need to and we will ensure that we're investigating these issues\nAre walls or Katie Hill with us candidate for the twenty fifth congressional districts each she's the Democrats are also um immigration reform if there is a Democratic majority what would you want to see the house and move forward with\nShort a first of all we need to we can have an immigration policy that is both smart and toss 'em we need to have really we have to provide solutions that meaningful fast solutions for our dreamers for DACA recipients because we have been dragging this issue along for far too long\nAnd we need to have border security there's no doubt about that we absolutely do but we can also have compassionate at a\nAt a cat compassionate approach to immigration that includes uh making sure that people who've been living here and working here for years have an opportunity to become citizens and and that we're keeping families together this family separation thing is is just absolutely ridiculous\nYou supportive verify and making that mandatory for businesses yes All right ah kitty he'll thanks so much is final statement for you on why residents and voters of the twenty fifth street support you\nSure at this is an election that has about\nA restoring our trust in our

company more than just a department store with this catalog business yet brought the same range of projects are products to ... middle America and rural America\nAs people in big cities were able to purchase and I mentioned cat homes for example in the Sears catalog you could actually buy a house\nHave are all the parts of it delivered to your lot and then you assemble it and you got to my great

through college Sandra diamond bar said I used to work at Sears in the nineties while in college in their credit department\nWas transformative Sandra says I made um twelve dollars an hour as a bilingual customer service rep\nSuch a good job that paid well and I've had a dedicated Spanish service line which was really cool that Sandra in diamond bar Leslie in San Clemente your memory of

offering\nA serious offer services in every way imaginable all across the country ended in Canada\nIt was a um it was a community beacon if you will for all things that its customers would seek out and a Sears stores typically had lots of space and so they made that space available um so the you know the caller's\nRecollection is not unusual ...\nAnd the fact that it was an important feature in so many millions of people's lives um underscores the basis of it to be the kind of icon that it was\nJames in Santa Monica you worked at the Santa Monica Sears\nYes I worked in a garden that part of it and when I was in college in Nineteen sixty seven one of the fondest remember memories I have is waiting on Natalie Wood and bringing flowers for car showing them which\nI still remember that the state my father worked at cheers my brother worked at Sears I worked at cheers as they said it was built in Nineteen forty seven and Santa Monica and that's the year that I was born so I'd grown up this year is really a shame to see what's happening\nYeah and James real quickly you know when you worked for the company in your family members were what what was your sense of how the company was operated\nWell I don't remember exactly how is operated I Do remember that they had a wonderful stand at the\nTop corners and the kids would be taught points to the pigeons showed a it was just a place that we ... it was a family in the Nineteen sixties early sixties and uh\nLike I said it's a shame to see that building go out there they're turning the Santa Monica building into a a I don't know I'm a I'm not sure exactly\nWell yeah yeah but it's yes James James I appreciate you sharing your memories and yeah he's absolutely right that um there was a time when people go to the family would go to see her as they walk around and look a different thing visit the candy counter which was a a staple of of Sears Nancy in Long Beach what's your memory upstairs\nI grew up in the mid west and my best friend from there and I would get your catalog and we look cut out furniture your head out everything started your home than you would create our families in the mirror and spend all day with his their catalog\nWow a so Nancy it's another because the catalogs of course it wasn't just what was in them but the uses which like catalogs well put which were many and very dancey thank you for for sharing that Chris didn't end mar vista your memory of Sears\nI live in rural Indiana we we're not rich we will wait your rival of the catalog and each child in our household would be allowed to pick one out that for the school year\nWow one outfit so you must have spent a lot of time poring over those photos\nYeah a lot it's\nA well worn Sears catalog and ... yeah how exciting was it to you when you get the new one\nIt was really it was completely thrilling [laughter] it was a big Stanley event\nKristen thanks so much Chris in their mar vista yeah I think it's it is perhaps difficulty for younger listeners who haven't heard of this or didn't experience it first hand to have a sense of the cultural effective Sears stores and\nCatalogue mark Cohen I'm Justin in closing um

commonsense Mimi Walters my opponent voted for the Trump tax plan to add one point nine trillion dollars to the deficit and we saw the very day after that Trump tax plan passed\nWe saw Paul Ryan and others begin to talk about the need to cut Medicare and to cut Social Security\nSo I've spent my career studying how difficult it is for families and businesses to make ends meet and I'm going to be a champion for physical commonsense\nMimi Walters record in the last two years makes clear that she's willing to trillions to our deficit set the stage for cuts to veiled social programs and to do it all because she puts special interest in Washington and head of Orange County families\nJoining us is Katie Porter she's the Democratic candidate for the forty fifth congressional district in South Orange County uh we've invited congresswoman Mimi Walters the G O P uh income and joined us and we made repeated attempts uh and uh unfortunately have not received any response\nFrom other Walters campaign so we'll continue to pursue her campaign to see if she will come on and talk with your talk listeners I Know there's so many of you win this district who our listeners decay BCC and you want to hear from both of the candidates\nWe are working are hardest to try and get congresswoman wall Walters\nOr to join us if you know were put in a word on our behalf\nSo that we can get her to ah to

also put them on the air talk page K. P. C. C. dot org now as a college professor and attorney or you haven't held elective office before have you\nThis is my first campaign and I think that's a wonderful thing and that ain't bringing fresh ideas and fresh energy to what has to our political system and I've served the people of California for two and a half years\nWorking to help families who are facing foreclosure so I've done a lot of government service I've also testified before Congress several times on bills to make sure that predatory lenders don't cheap families and that student lenders are protected\nSo I have a lot of experience in policy but this is my first political campaign and I'm having a great time getting to talk to folks all around the forty fifth district\nWhat about a health care would you support what's um colloquially called Medicare for all her single payer health plan if you were elected to Congress is that something for which would advocate\nWhen I talked to families around the forty fifth district what I consistently here is that the current health care system is broken\nThe employer costs of employer provided coverage or crippling our businesses especially our small businesses last year the average employee or spent Fifteen thousand dollars of an employer provided coverage on premiums the average employees spent five thousand and then on top of that what we're seeing is\nFolks are getting their benefit notification for twenty Nineteen\nAnd inside that letter what they're learning from their employer is it they're going to face and out of pocket maximum that is absolutely out of reach that there is fine print that makes it impossible for them to estimate their health care costs\nAnd that they're getting fewer and fewer choices of providers so I think the status quo and health care is unsustainable and absolutely open to having a discussion about Medicare for all dollar for dollar Medicare system delivers the highest quality\nLeast expensive most efficient care that we have and a lot of small businesses that I talked to they want out of the business of providing health care for their employees and and the Medicare for all helps create an nurture your partnership\nA you of course the critics would say the problem is that Medicare exist because an artificially lower\nUm a payments to doctors healthcare providers that into private insurance makes up for and the totality system and if you remove private insurers and it was Medicare for all the system is unsustainable and lower reimbursements\nLet's talk about that so the reality that we have now is that our health care system isn't free people are paying the employers are paying employees are paying we have patients who are still after the Affordable CARE Act uninsured Mimi Walters voted to repeal the Affordable CARE Act with no replacement\nUm in place that would have caused more uninsured patients and I think when we talked about reimbursement rates we want to make sure that physicians and providers and hospitals are compensated but\nWe also have to realize that some of these institutions are profiting 'em and they're not competition in the health care market there is not transparency\nWhen you're an employee you get given a health care plan by your employer um you don't have any choice in it um and what we're seeing if for instance with big pharmaceutical companies the biggest barrier to Medicare is the fact that our Congress passed a law that prohibits\nThe government from negotiating pharmaceutical prices that's not capitalism that's not a healthy market and it's hurting the affordability of our health care system\n[noise] ah we have a question from Eli in poems um why did you side with Paul Ryan and other Republicans on the repeal of the gas tax\nSo that gas taxes a state issue I don't believe that\nPaul Ryan or any of those folks have taken a position but I'll tell you why I made the decision to oppose the gas tax is that right now in the forty fifth district we have families that are terrified about what their federal tax bill is going to be\nThey are getting hit with that state and local tax deduction limit of ten thousand dollars Mimi Walters noted for a bill that would have\nA completely eliminated the state and local tax deduction so people are hearing from their accountants they're hearing from their employers that they're going to owe more on federal tax so I don't think this is the time to be increasing state taxes\nWe all know that infrastructure is critical\nTo grilling our economy and infrastructure is important orange county's history it's one of the reasons why each county has been able to successfully compete for jobs with the LA area and across the nation I think that infrastructure investment is best made at the federal level as part of a budget plan and not made to attacks that hits\nHits people with long distance commutes like many of our Orange County families the hardest\nWe're talking with Katie Porter democratic candidate for the south Orange County forty fifth congressional district currently represented by Republican Mimi Walters once again we've reached out to her campaign and I've not heard back on her availability your willingness to join us a to answer questions about\nHer campaign want to ask you about a immigration reform a you've got a split opinion among your constituents in this district as to what they would like to see\nA greater enforcement versus a path to citizenship for those in the country illegally what what's your view of what the ideal immigration reform would look like\nFamilies in orange county know that we need to have secure borders sits in a it's an inherent part of being a nation and being a nation state and it's one of the most important things that our federal government does is to secure our borders and keep track of who's entering and who's accepting and examining the goods that are coming and going into this country\nSo I think we all know that that has to be a role that our federal government takes on\nAt the same time and the forty fifth district we seen the contributions immigrants have made to our economy to our society and there's strong support for instance in the district for ... making good on the promise that we made to dreamers we asked those young people to come forward\nTo identify themselves to work hard to stay in school to pay taxes they've kept their end of the bargain and so there's strong support in the district for the United states keeping our ended offering those dreamers a pathway to citizenship\nThe other thing I hear across range county it's such a family oriented place I'm a single working mom of three young children myself and what ... what the Trump Administration did with family separation and what they are threatening to do again with ripping parents mothers and fathers apart from young children and traumatizing those kids\nThat as a policy that is completely inconsistent with orange county's valleys\nAre also wanted to ask you a myth Porter about border enforcement so well what would you want to see in the way of additional enforcement if any\n[noise] I think it's really important that we fund the folks working at the border and that we continue to provide them with the tools in technology that they need to do a world class on border security I think what we've seen with the Trump Administration is\nAn effort to come up with ideas like this border wall that a lot of Republicans don't even support on congressional Republicans don't support because it's going to be both really expensive and really ineffective so I'd be focused on making sure that the folks at our border security have\nGreat to have access to technology that they have cutting edge intelligence tools that they're fully staffed and fully funded and that they know that the American people have their backs as they're doing that hard work of border enforcement\nDo you support mandatory you verify for employers\nI think that our entire system works best when everyone follows the rules and I think folks expect that our employers will also do their part on and take the steps that are legally required to verify\nSomeone's citizenship I also think we need to pass comprehensive immigration reform and make sure that we're providing an entry fee says legal entry visas to those workers where our businesses here in America sometimes face worker shortages that specifically\nDo you support the use of e verify as the verification tool for employers\nI think if we're providing financial support to limit the cost and the burden on businesses of adopting e verify so long as we're making it cost effective and providing support for them to transition to that I don't have a problem with an e verify system\nAim high LA aim high a flute an ass would this city be responsible for ensuring the deposits David ... can you speak to that point about uh what would back the deposits in municipal back\nYes I'm a A R work at the California public banking alliances brought us in a conversation with the department of this oversight obviously had a meeting with Jen ... uh who let us know that\nUh probably some combination of collateral assets are the way the public deposits are currently a back them in short and some form of private insurance acceptable to regulators will satisfy that need to provide that\nA Deposit Insurance and the bank of the department of business oversight will also have to oversee the safety and soundness of this bank\nAs you point out uh the the heck will need to know about this race properly it'll probably be a more conservative bank than uh the wall street firms that currently handle the city's money and crashed the economy in two thousand nine and continue to manage the economy and\nThat doesn't benefit most working people um you know when we talk about the competence of city hall first of all to be a new institution with an independent board not named by video told\nA and it'll be built with a generational mission statement to improve the lives of Angelenos and you're comparing it of course to the folks who run back like Wells Fargo defrauded thousands of their customers had to pay a massive fine\nAnd of course the people who mismanaged risk to the point of collapsing the global economy just ten years ago\nWere looking to divest city funds from those bags and create a public institution like the bank of North Dakota like the spark of networking Germany that do this perfectly well and run business banks that funds all kinds of new infrastructure that banks are the commercial banks ignored\nNow in the case of North Dakota there there's a tremendous amount of oil revenue that undergrads the state economy there rhyming Los Angeles you'd have scaled but it doesn't have a particular you know cash cow source of revenue like that\nThat's where I go to the bank of North Dakota while partially invested and things like fracking survived the the crunching prices of natural gas in two thousand twelve through two thousand sixteen really to the president\nJust fine I'd also survived the credit crisis pretty well because it wasn't over leverage into\nA ... you know mortgage backed securities and\nAnd to rebut if the collapse the major banks or the ... operating Petro dollar and make the agricultural low it makes infrastructure low student loans to small business loads emergency fund all of these are folks in the commercial banks currently you and charge government interest\nI mean over half of the money we spend on infrastructure goes to interest paid to bondholders a bank can get in the middle of that every capture some of that for taxpayers\nI wanted to ask you a question um you know one of the challenge that people working in California's legal pot industry face\nIs difficulty getting banking services because of the federal illegality what a city a bank be able to handle a the business of cannabis\nUm the federal law would still apply to the bank even if it is not federally charted chartered or has an FDIC insurance it would still be subject to those laws and you know as a public banking advocate\nAnd someone who wants to see a public banks succeed are very long term I Would say it's not a good place to to meet that need especially considering that\nThat problem will probably go away within ten years so finding a public back for that purpose isn't really the point the public big returns its value in the form of lower interest costs to the city okay and increase economic\nTo Stuart Waldman of the valley industry and in cameras association your your your response to a that claim that this this would be you know a a an opportunity for the city to save a lot of money to\n[noise] um well that assumes that it would be run\nProperly and it wouldn't lose money and a challenge that assertion um I also challenge the assertion that it would be a new instill tuition is free from political influence\nUm because there is NO PLAN we don't know what that will be a and I can assure you than\nBeing having been around LA city politics for quite some time that there will be a city council appointee on this board there will be a male role appointee and there were most likely be a a union leader appointee on this board so we won't be free from any influence\nHow ... will let me ask David ... how would you just real briefly how would you do the board because if it if it is a totally independent board then how would the city's tax payers have any sort of representation\nThere are a number of mechanisms that could go into forming a board and stewardess right that there are existing political realities that will need to be dealt with but it's up to the people of Los Angeles to demand the kind of control that they need over an independent\nBang alright demanding a neighborhood council level commissions that mean that could mean direct election or could mean appointments with approval by popular vote\nAll right I Want to thank David ... yes on ... Waldman of the valley industry and commerce association Phoenix rights on the page Wall Street banks have no interest in our public good they have a horrible track records of fraud corruption risk taking with them guarantees the status quo\nCreating our own bank finally creates the option of public accountability you can share your comments on the air taught page KP C.
