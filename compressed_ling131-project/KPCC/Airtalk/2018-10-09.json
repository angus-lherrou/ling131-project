we're joined by Oliver Wang from Seoul dash side dot com Oliver welcome back it is a pleasure as always our rights are who are we starting with because I gotta feeling I Know who this voice it but you tell me little Wayne is back with the Carter five so as the title suggests the fifth installment in his\nThe Carter series but the first albums he's put out in the quarter series in seven years and that little Wayne has just been it might have for it was like almost a decade now but he's back to this is a track called dope ...\nRedacted for review your drink snoop dog and it uses for observant listeners out there uses part of the explosive beat that Dr Dre cooked up for him and snoop back in Nineteen Ninety nine so there's not here to the past but low Wayne is back with us and the president said\nWe added just reading an article today but I never went to the end it's a sign that you know they're not going to make the nickel thanks a lot I'm not\nAnd I think what's been interesting with him is just to consider that ten years ago if you would ask who was the best rapper alive it'd be little Wayne and he has since\nLast that title to a parade of different folks including Kendrick Lamar and I've always been curious to see what happens with rappers who our previous at a certain height and what happens if the age and I am sure there is some kind of athletic [laughter]\nThere's a ... when it comes to rappers and we're kind of all arriving at this Oliver I think at the same time because\nMost of the rapper say from like the nineties on our reaching that age you know that forty or fifty is kind of age where you're going to see if they have anything left of the tank right in with Wayne I don't feel like if there has been a decline that it's been visible in the same way that you might see again with let's say aging athlete because he\nHas been I think largely outside of the public eye and the you know compared to let's say a Conyers who\nWe don't need to talk too much about has basically set his career on fire very publicly weight has been more or less in the background so for him to come back with the quarter five\nIt was unexpected to a certain degree and the album is

planning to leave the Trump Administration NPR's Windsor Johnston reports in a surprise decision Haley announced chill resigned by the end of the year\nAnd Gorsuch and Thomas might be being more originalist might take sometimes the more liberal view on certain topics when they think that's where the original meaning calls for\nA ride Eugene by like UCLA law professor also with us from Loyola Law school here in Los Angeles uh Kimberley a fall ... west ... thank you very much for being with us professor\nHappy to be here thank you how how do you see a judge Kavanaugh your especially compared with his fellow conservatives on the court with whom do you think he might have the most legal affinity\nWell I agree with professor ... that uh the labels liberal and conservative\nUm are not as helpful if the idea is to have some sense or attempt to predict a what a justice Kavanaugh's addition to the court is going to me and him because he does have a a pretty extensive record on particular topics and we have a sense\nOr such as same sex marriage uh I think that a conservative advocate or a a standard that much different than the liberal wing they say that because you can sort of expand liberty you got to be able to find that a a\nParticular a particular suited liberty interests that sort of deeply rooted in history and traditions of the country\nWhere as are the liberals are joined by Justice Kennedy will find him saying well that's the starting point but that's not the ... point we also have to look at sort of evolving suicidal needs and values in terms of emerging consensus sees about those things\nSo they were willing to expand liberty\nOr you know in the same sex marriage case was sort of a a a good example is based on sort of how they believe modern values heavy ball whereas the conservatives are low to do that\nWell I wondered though with the conservatives given the fact the country has moved so much on same sex marriage and and the fact now that it is legal across the country would you know some some case related to that made its way to the high court\nWould it be likely the even the conservative justices would would now say what was the traditional is now different because of a practice is across the country\nNo they wouldn't go there because they're looking at a you know deeply rooted traditions in American history you know stretching all the way back to the bone to I don't think you know we're we're a case we waited a same sex marriage she come to court\nI don't think they're going to overrule for example burgers ill because of the best reliance on ... so I think that that decision has created and the other hand if they're related or rights eating are you a same sex adoption example I think the conservatives are going to be very reluctant\nScandal burger fell through those related areas\nWe're talking with Margaret Thatcher's Barry McDonald Pepperdine Kimberly west foul kind of Loyola Law school Eugene Volokh UCLA law school joining us to talk about the newest justice he began today a hearing cases are on the U.S Supreme Court bench\nBrett Kavanaugh professor ... back to you um when it comes to reproductive issues\nAnd sort of you know the states are that might want to um see more restrictive sorts of measures on abortion or forms of birth control\nOr how do you think would be likely to with this new conservative majority the record might look on those kinds of efforts\nYou know really hard to tell people were confident in the ... the Casey decision that Justice Kennedy who at the time at a reputation well learned as being quite conservative or would vote to\nA completely over the weight and reject abortion rights or you know\nIt's possible that that would happen here it's also possible that or\nAt least one of the conservative justices when the justice Kevin ... Justice Roberts Justice Alito a might say a\nA look at um ... this precedent a rogue rosy wait at least in some measure uh ... shouldn't be just overturned right and that are restrictions on abortion or permissible but outright bans are not\nUm [noise] uh so it's hard to tell because forever but he whether they're originalist whether they're conservative whether they're liberal um or whether they're living institutional is there's always the question of how you reconcile your general I'd judicial principles whiz oppressed\nYou can't reconsider everything and knew in every case you got to get some weight to how much weight to give\nThat's always hard to tell until the case comes up it into a the cases decided my sense by the way I generally support is a political matter abortion rights I think they're very hard to find in the ... institution\nUm but I think a ... I think that ultimately it's probably going to be technology like various pharmaceutical or as a as an ally and of course the growing ability\nThe basic and and evidence is proven um why it's so important that for those living on the streets with serious mental illness\nServices alone or not enough if they do not as stable housing and stable housing of course is not enough if they don't have the services and what this act will do proposition to\nIs enable counties and the nonprofit providers you do such a heroic work throughout our cities in California\nTo both provide stable housing for people on the streets and to provide them with the wraparound services they need to hopefully in more instances than not in their state of homelessness and reclaim their lives\nAnd how much of this comes from a\nThe the current money allocated for services for Californians with mental illness well\nJust to break down the act for a moment twenty five percent of the money every year must be spent on prevention early intervention in innovation the remaining Seventy five percent is intended for a variety of of services for people\nWho are suffering from mental illness are not getting the help that they need and so this would set aside about a hundred and twenty million dollars a year for Thirty years\nA on a base of about two point two billion dollars and growing by the way because the fund keeps growing the repayment a would be remain the same about a hundred and twenty million dollars and so some critics say you're taking that money away from services\nAnd my response is just the opposite we're allowing the services to actually be effective\nBy combining a the majority of the money which ... which is used for services was desperately needed housing because if people are on the streets um they're just not going to be able to get better and that's undeniable\nWe're talking with Darrell Steinberg the mayor of Sacramento former Senate president pro tem of the California legislature he's proponent of proposition to one of your California ballot also with is the chair of the legislative committee for the Contra Costa county affiliate of the national alliance\nOn mental illness known as ...

goes it incredibly fast speeds um so it's different from a traditional maglev system that operate in a vacuum and so it makes it more like a spacecraft traveling on the ground to the passenger vehicles themselves are kind of like airplanes that wings they're pressurized vehicles operating a vacuum tube and at the faster\nAnd faster you want to go in speed and you would normally have to consume a lot of energy because of everything in drag\nSo by operating inside of a vacuum tube you're able to eliminate aired in any drag and go really fast speeds at very low energy costs so the reason why it saves you money is that you consume a lot lower energy costs because of the reduction aired and then he dragged me in a vacuum and you're also make medically levitating which means you don't have fictional resistance but the ground\nSo it's designed to be able to achieve top speeds up to six hundred and eighty miles per hour it's almost a thousand kilometers per hour at a very passenger comfort levels which is similar to you know trains and airlines in terms of what the acceleration\nIs you know I think back to the early a human a space a launches and mercury in and Apollo and there were questions which humans be able to tolerate this you know what would happen to the body what would mentally happened astronauts in space you have any concerns that with a hyper loop\nThat the technology could get to such a place where it's it's feasible you can send things through the too but um but you put a human in there and for some reason it doesn't work and I mean ... that a possibility\nWell no it isn't because we set our engineering design for amateurs so that the exhilaration that we use are about a quarter of the G which is basically very similar to any kind of people move or that you have at the airport so what do you need to use the accelerate over long distance to get to that nice top speed\nAnd then as compared to train travel or as compared to metro travel or air travel where you have to deal with bumping along the road along the track\nAnd turbulence in the air because you're operating within a vacuum tube that's all limited though the passenger comfort experience is accidentally significantly better than you would get from air travel so claustrophobia would be the only potential risk than it is true but if you've ever been in the London Tube um it's a very similar thing in the London Tube\nUm the distance between the outside of the rolling stock of the interior of the two but there is that you can see so there's easy ways to accommodate that as well which is used cameras which gives you a vision of what you're seeing on the outside\nAnd what are the impediments to the technology being able to be used\nSo we do have an operational ... in um north east Las Vegas it's about forty five minutes from the strip or we demonstrated that technology\nAt speeds up to four hundred kilometers per hour so from a technology perspective um we're we're almost there um the challenges that we had a head of us are actually more on the regulatory side because I Believe with a brand new form of transportation\nYou actually have to develop a new regulatory framework you've got to get it into sort of legal structure and then you have to make sure that your design is compatible with what those regulations are so\nAnd would this be above ground beneath ground or either\nIt could be either so it's actually lower cost to have it above ground and it's actually in more mentally friendly to have it as an elevated construction but for places going to urban areas are places where you have to go through the mountainous terrain\nThan you would do subterranean just like you would do for a rail system\n... with us a virgin hyper loop one based in Los Angeles Garrett ... former NASA astronaut USC professor of astronaut acts practice\nI'm looking at the different technology here you know one of the big challenges of course in in getting humans said to Mars if that if that is the goal is um the rockets size the ability to do this uh where are we at in developing ... you know aside from the human part of this\nJust the technology to get a person to bars\nI think we're actually in pretty good shape technology was a it's really more of a matter of it's kind of like what the doctor so good to just said about the hype is really more of a matter of funding and political will\nTo just make it happen um we are going to to get a large number of people to Mars which I think is a really good idea and by the way more as I think is really the place we should go it's a fantastic planet or not quite as good as this one but it's got a huge volcano it's like fifty thousand feet high it's got a Kenyan the size of the United states would be a great place to go explore\nUm and I think there's a very good chance that when we do go explore up there will find evidence of of life um existing on somewhere else in our solar system\nAnd uh when it said about way just so I don't get a lot of uh trolls on ... on Twitter I don't mean little green men what Reagan's I'm Talking about you know have you single celled organisms or stuff like that\nBut um but anyway the the technology we have a there are there are significant hurdles one of which is protecting the crew from radiation um and then of course there's just so how do we get that much Madison and have a good entry descent and landing\nA technique when we get to Mars but other stuff I think is solvable\nWith today's engineering technology and we're working on it right now it's basics in fact it's another thing is happening right here in Southern California is we're we've already broken ground on a factory in uh Long Beach or two in the port of Los Angeles where we're going to build this enormous rocket to take people to Mars\nAnd and you teach a class on a on dissent dried\nYes I teach a graduating class at USC an entry descent landing I think it's the first one on on the west coast um and I will give a great\nPlug to GPL my former employer and my former teammates in that the technologies that we demonstrate and develop the robotic space program are immediately a feed for to future human landing on Mars so the work that Senate GPL for the curiosity planning for the insight Atlantic which become another\nStudent or to them over and then march twenty twenty those demonstrations the information that we learn feeds directly forward to the human space program\nAnd professor reason I Want to give you a chance to talk a bit about where things are at educationally here that you could go to USC and actually you know study to do all this stuff there have been you know just this kind of in depth program like this\nSo that's where it was a great question I that's why I actually stepped down from a full time position as director space absence basics I'm Still a senior advisors basics but um I thought it was the right time to get into academia because you can actually\nGo out now in graduate from college with a with a graduate degree or an undergraduate degree and\nWork on a human spacecraft is going to go fly that wasn't possible as I alluded to before in the nineties when I graduated from undergrad we have the shuttle and we weren't really building any new human spacecraft that was actually going to leave the ground\nUh so you can it was a nice academic exercise to talk about things like human factors um or life support systems\nBut there was a real opportunity to go out and get a job doing it but now you have basically a blue our junior version you have a Lockheed Martin making it Ryan a Boeing making the storyline or\nThere's a whole bunch of places that students can now go and apply this knowledge I think it's a great time to go back to the universities and share what I've learned and educate a whole new crop of engineers who go out and build human spacecraft\nI'm just struck by what I'm hearing both of your enthusiasm for this and professor ... you know you've you've walked in space so [laughter]\nYou know half or maybe would describe as your about its peak and experiences someone can still excited about what you're doing with with teaching the students that as the thank you both so much appreciate your being with us\nThank you thank you so much Garret where he's been former NASA astronaut advisor to

working through it\nWell we actually ended because of the anger\nThat is in our family because it is\nReally so yeah you have to ... between yourself and your husband yeah yeah and and so give give me an idea yeah what what was there like a blow up over this or what happened to\nMe that you can forget about the human brain Thirty years later and I feel that yes a lot of us we knew we had you know I don't mind so forget it and not talk about it and then she brought it up Thirty years later and I believe\nYou get so it is a huge human\nYeah yeah so so um has that affected your other conversations with your husband because of your disagreement on this issue\nHe yes yes it can get into everything from every single job that pretty much getting her you\nKnow I mean I mean between you and your husband has this because you have such strong disagreement and different perceptions on this\nHas it affected other ways in which you relate with him yes yes yes it\nSo it's it's been hard to just confined to this 'cause that's what I was saying if you have in your household whether it's with your kids your your\nYour spouse or partner you know a strong difference of agreement on this taps into some pretty fundamental things some pretty deep emotions and it'd be hard just to contain this to this one issue alone\nA let's talk with Martha again Culver City Martha how is this affecting you and how are you coping coping with the rancor\nWell how it's affected is that it's shut it down a ... it has raised issues\nOf anger in me that I never thought I had and it is certainly raise issues between my husband and I did killer so um we finally have\nDecided to drop the white flag will and absolutely not discuss politics in our home together because we are such opposed the ideas\nIn that it is actually brought a lot of peace and then when I\nDon't I personally do my own research really\nGet myself for that I have a better understanding of what's happening so that I can make those decisions when I go to vote\n[noise] Martha ... generally with your husband do you do you generally agree more than disagree with him on politics or do you typically disagree with him\nFor each night we well you know that's a good point I Would say in the past we had a different views but we were able to come to a place of\nA understand each other but what is happening political arena since the election and now it's ... it has totally\nLet us apart politically while the point where you just cannot each about politics in the house\n... and hopefully as a little bit of time intervenes that wants to be the case and you can get back to talking about it once I'm you know you both had a chance to sort of uh\nThink about this longer but Martha thank you so much really appreciate it a Laurie ah there's on Facebook on her ear talk page no news for that I'm climbing back into the whole I dug out of after the presidential election I Will climb out to vote though that's Laurie an Facebook's Sheryl in Long Beach\nCheryl how are you dealing with this and how is it affecting if it is your social interactions\nYet at night like at that and I\nAnd seven eight and the ladies in my much younger than I just can't even talk about it anymore because every day there's a new outrage this guy was elected and so\nAfter a couple of gauge kind of forget about it and the new outrage so really unfortunately I Can't imagine that a lot of change much like he said he could probably shoot somebody and we would just say oh that's just from the Trump for something I guess\nIt also asks portions of Los Angeles county like diamond bar and parts of the San Bernardino county like Chino Hills at gale Cisneros with us the Republican who's running as young Kim this is an open seat\nI at Royce the Republican represented the district\nI decided not to run for re election if you have questions for Mr Cisneros you can put them on our air talk page at Cape PCC dot org you can also a call and ask a question through one of our call screeners at eight six six\nEight nine three key PCC on health care do you support a the the single payer plan that's called Medicare for all or just continuation of the a C a what would you like to see for federal health care\nRight now I think the most important thing is to protect the Affordable CARE Act of ... tech those that were born with preexisting conditions like like I said\nI've lived through this with my family my dad worked for the same company for twenty five years as they were downsizing\nHe lost his job and when that happened to my parents lost their insurance up my this is that the same time my dad was starting to develop diabetes he used to go down to Mexico to buy as his prescription drugs for his diabetes because it was just too expensive here in the United states of actually my dad because he's a veteran was able to start getting\nIn health care through the VA but my mom still had to go he said sixteen years without health insurance that shouldn't happen in this country I've talking to so many people I'm a mother in particular who has an eight year old daughter was born with a heart defect\nShe's worried about them removing the protection for pre existing conditions they've already spent you know a half ... half a million dollars on her health care and they're wondering if they do that\nOr if they can't afford insurance how are they gonna be able to do that so right now for me the most important thing is protecting Affordable Care act making sure that we negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to to help bring down the price of pharmaceutical\nDrugs so at this point you don't support or the so called Medicare for all\nI think it's something that we can start working towards but I think right now being practical than most the best thing that we can do right now is protect the Affordable CARE Act\nRepublicans have been trying to get rid of it they'd been chipping away at it they got rid of the individual mandate which has raised the cost of a you know of Covered California here by ten percent\nUh we need to stop that we're talking with Gil Cisneros demographic candidate for the thirty ninth congressional district\nA seat that's been held by Republican at rice once again we invited young Kim the Republican candidate for the seat to join us she's declined our request to be interviewed on the program this is a district that's pretty split although their demographic shifts that favor Democrats in recent years\nUm it wouldn't be surprised if this flips it's potentially could stay Republican as well uh I think it's fair to say it's too close to call in this race that you're in if you were to be elected in this position given the mix in the district\nWhat are the ways that you think you would be able to effectively represent your Republican constituents\nWell I'm going there to represent\nAll my constituents new I made the decision early on I was going to take any pac money a lot from corporations now for a special interests and not even from labor\nBecause when I go to Washington I don't want to serve the corporations I don't want to serve the special interests I Want to be there for the voters of the thirty ninth district we haven't had a town hall with our representative right now in over seven years of that needs to change I'm going to be out there I'm going to they're going to have access to me we are going to have town halls [noise]\nYou know one of the endorsements that I Am proud to have is with an organization called with honor\nThat is supporting Democrats they're supporting Republicans the only thing that they're the only thing that they're the similarities that they have been supporting is that there are only supporting veterans because they know these are people that have served their country once they already took an oath to support and defend the constitution and now are trying to bring 'em back\nSo they can do that again so I'm going to reach across the I'm going to work with Republicans and build those partnerships which is one of the things that's really missing in Washington is that there are no real friendships between people on different sides of the aisle\nA rock film Fullerton up is under the impression that you switched your political affiliation from Republican to democratic is that correct that's correct why do you do that\nWell when I was in the navy um a while back I just when I first time I registered to vote I registered Republican but all the issues that I Believe in a I believed in then and I believe in now like commonsense gun legislation immigration reform supporting health care\nThese are all things that I've always believed and then I kind of feel really what happened is is not so much that I left the Republican Party but the Republican Party\nJust kind of went too far to the right and didn't really represent me anymore\nAnd real quickly or in closing if you were to be elected to the house and the house becomes Democratic majority Mm what would you like to see as as one of the first things that the Democratic majority house does\nWell I Would like to see immigration reform\nI Wish we could have had that during the Obama administration that didn't get done I think that's one of the things that we need to start working on I won't need commonsense gun legislation\nOr Ninety percent of Americans want universal background checks and the only reason it's not happening is because the Republican leadership in the house has prevented from coming up to vote\nReno and costs less an issue here because we have it right right but these are things that'll pass and it needs to happen on a national level immigration reform a pass commonsense gun legislation will pass we just need a Democratic House in order to make that happen\n[noise] it's just as narrow thank you for being with us we appreciate it very much shut you very much ... narrows democratic candidate for the thirty ninth congressional district straddling\nNorth Orange County portions of Los Angeles and San Bernardino county uh one's skin young Kim is the Republican candidate for this seat November six that will be decided which one of the two goes to Congress and whether the seat stays Republican or flips democratic\nComing up on air talk how smarter dogs really will find out from a new Web researcher uh
