no but there's some such Asians bangles of course it was more about the sixties sounds that a lot of the ... and it was everything from this kind of ... top two very dark distorted music [noise]\nAnd for the groups who are key in that the bangles the dream syndicate to three o'clock in the rain parade did some shows a few years ago and now to that grew this album or listening to now which is called three by four\nAnd each of these groups did songs by the other groups so it's a tribute to this era of the early eighties but basically underground and\nAll the others did other ones who was a really great movers a lot of fun I and some substantial music came out of him for people who really were into it this is a pretty big deal but they're back doing stopping they're all celebrating each other's music and celebrating this era when there were a great community of music here in LA [noise]\n\nThree years ago says hops was in the take to studio one of the biggest\nThrills of my life to have her sitting right in front of me it was quite a quite a moment in life versus the yeah the other side is one that does Suzanne in the bangles wrote down but here it's done by the dream syndicate and Steve when\nNow for someone to say this album is going to be available first is a record store day Black Friday and did it in a November twenty third right around Thanksgiving\nAnd then it comes out for real in January and other format\nAnd this is a really fantastic album says listen to a Steve winning the dream syndicate do hero takes the fall [noise]\nRather\n\nSo awesome that they're all doing each other songs All right you know Steve what his next\nAll right well Paisley Underground maybe didn't quite get the sense of what the whole thing is it a little tongue in cheek we can get another artist your little hard to pinpoint I I wanted to listen to a woman who I've been a fan of for\nEight or ten years he's been making some of the most remarkable music mostly inventive music in LA and her name's Julio Halter let's listen to a song from her new album which is called aviary a\nHe\nOr\nShe ... what do you think we should call her music I mean I I hate to put labels on it but I think some might be wondering what is this I\nCan't put words ... uh\nI Do some of puts me in mind as some of the adventurous sides in York and Kate Bush and that's how bad it was on a national Laurie Anderson but also some of the\nThe modern contemporary classical composer people yet missing as all the Julia wolf David laying the ladder to win a Pulitzer Prizes and I really do think that this album is ambitious enough that if she lived in New York she'd\nProbably be considered for [laughter] for all that surprising to hear that that's our LA\nChip on shoulder guided thing here because she's in LA maybe she doesn't quite get the recognition she deserves [noise] um [noise] it's a remarkable album all through it and uh one of the things I Love about it about this particular one is it draws a lot on on a\n... and ... of the medieval troop adores of what's now France and Spain and Italy she's justice incredible artist who takes all these different things and and create your own sort of vision of at the one that just absolutely floored me I was listening to it in a car and\nIf it hadn't been stuck in traffic on them in fact I might have\nDriven off right off the road this is called I shall love to their two versions of it uh this is a proclamation the declaration of loving with a\nBand and loving fully in all senses of the word or this isn't too bad I have to really hold her doing I shall love to [noise]\n\nHave you were intrigued by Julia hold her she won't play in Los Angeles 'til march nights right she's touring Europe right now but she'll be march nights she is going to be doing a a finishing up or or\nRoad track with a show at the large room alright sweet tell what do we have next well we're going to change a tone again here and but it's still about love let's talk about love let's hear somebody say about always talk about ... times which\nIs in LA banned it goes back about Thirty years and they say they're finishing up their career and I was going to be her last album and called divine weeks and let's let's listen to this lead song on on their new album the ... called where all we have in the song is called fight\nLoud [noise]\nFemale member in the eighties there was a little bit happening for him is that was my memory drug you're actually why do we talked about the women the dream syndicate earlier they actually took divine weeks on under their wing and mentored them and brought them are\nAre so there's a relationship to what we started with today but the next generation divine weeks they'll see was a singer Raj ...\nOne of the guitarists detour original members they broke up and got back together a few years ago and they've carried on what they were doing it at times it was a lot of his rations to from the food sources of ideal is the power of rock and the power of love to fight through tough times so you know they were in the back of the uh\nReagan and Bush here originally is talking about well now today and whatever you were in I I think the message maybe even stronger that weren't today because remember was just so you know these are some true believers in that they you know bill is\nFirmly attached to the idea firmly committed to the idea that however tough things are however confusing things are however much hate there is out there that we can get through with\nThe world you've made idealism and optimism yeah absolutely\nOr whatever our differences are maybe this maybe there's some unity that can come through this in fact that's the great song to go out on your one that's called we're all in one and

Walter Mercator centered George Mason University He directs the trade immigration program and our thanks to Jessica Vaughan of the center for Immigration Studies in D. C. she directs policy studies for CIA yes\nYou're listening to talk on eighty nine point three ... see see coming up\nA legal debate over whether President Trump would have the ability through a an executive order to ban the automatic citizenship of children born to those in the U.S illegally you're listening to talk on tape BCC back in one minute\nSeen as one of 'em it's worse decisions of all time uh that um if you are of African ancestry or you could not be a citizen of the United states and that would be um irrespective of whether you are an ... person um or\nFree person of African ancestry so that's the ... the history that underlies the citizenship clause of the fourteenth amendment that we had a U.S Supreme Court that um was I'm not interested in protecting the rights of all I'm and I'm very much ... ruled\nI'm In a an opinion that again it took a civil war to um to overturn a that um because of your racial ancestry you could not be a citizen or so that the main point that I Am seeking to make about uh the language of the the citizenship clause is that um\nIt is very declared of of um of\nWho um who is born here you are a citizen\nBut it but I'm Still not understanding that the phrase and subject to the jurisdiction there ah how how does that does that specifically relate to those that were enslaved\nWell what I'm saying is I think is professor ... goal to cloud what I think on a day when we had the president of the United states\nMaking a very dangerous assertion it's the kind of assertion that an autocrat in a dictator would make which is that he could somehow through executive order amend the constitution professor Eastman is engaging\nI'm In a topic that would be absolutely appropriate in the law review article or an extensive discussion in a legal conference where we could talk about the peculiarities of it is absolutely true writ large that\nIf you are an undocumented um I Am non citizen or that um that you are treated differently than someone who is entered the country\nAccording to the ... the proper channels and laws that that's an overarching um accuracy\nWith respect to how our laws work\nI'm In the constitution does not change the fact that you um have entered the United states illegally but Larry I Do want to make sure that um again on a day when the rule of law is being questioned so fundamentally bad um but we don't fall prey to distraction\nWell I guess the point is though it's important to debate this because you have the president's attempt to do it then we'd like to have a sense of how courts are going to treat this right\nWell not really because what we're talking about now if we talk about the wording of the current\nCitizenship clause is ... how might a court interpret\nThat would include the Supreme Court that's not the issue that President Trump has raised by his assertion that he could through an executive order essentially repeal\nOr amend the citizenship clause itself so what I'm saying is that it's a very different conversation which professor Eastman is um is provoking which and it's a legitimate and one in a different context it's a very legitimate conversation\nTo discuss what do the word and the text of the citizenship clause itself I mean but that is not\nThe issue that has been raised by President Trump\nWhat he has raised is that the overarching interpretation the interpretation that I'm a burst in this country dictate citizenship that he can somehow change that without going through the article five amendment process is um what is um the the they incendiary assertion that President Trump\nIs a professor Rees me want to respond to that\n... this is really stunning I've never never debated this issue with somebody that was such a level of ignorance about what the conversation is about President Trump has not said you could unilaterally amend the constitution he has said that what the constitution as mean is that\nYou have to have not just birth on us soil you keep referring to that and completely acting like the word subject to the jurisdiction or not there and the subject of the jurisdiction means complete jurisdiction not partial are territorial jurisdiction and therefore by an executive order I'm going to assist that executive agencies that comply\nWith the law as written not is as law professors over the last forty\nOr fifty years of misinterpreted it to me that that not only a permissible for the president but I think it's his duty as duty under article to take care of that the laws faithfully executed\nYou said that the Supreme Court says only held otherwise that has never held in favor of granting citizenship to anybody born here without looking at the subject to the jurisdiction clause in fact the only time it is ever held on anything directly related to this was in a case called el versus Wilkins in Eighteen eighty four\nA Native American born on us soil claimed citizenship and the Supreme Court ruled\nThat he was not a citizen because he was a member of an Indian tribe and therefore owed immediate allegiance to the tribe and not in the United states right even though he was within the territory the United states he was not a citizen by virtue of the fourteenth amendment that's the only Supreme Court holding on\nAll right and and so we'll see if if the president does in fact pursued this iffy attempts to do it on the terms that the fourteenth amendment does not provide universal\nBirthright citizenship wore a takes it on in another way Johnny's went shopping university law professor Loyola Law school professor Kim west Paul cone joining us on air talk\nComing up next we'll take a look at some of the major changes occurring in countries like Brazil and Germany when it comes to politics there\nAre

Merkel announced this her fourth term would be your last\nAnd that she would not seek reelection to chair the center right Christian Democratic union um she her term comes to a close in twenty Twenty one she would not continue or to attempt to service chancellor as well\nUh an ongoing Merkel's approach a chancellor ship has become much more challenge recently as\nAs uh many Germans have grown far more concerned about the number of refugees that have been accepted in Germany over the past three years or so with us the Berlin bureau chief for the Washington Post grant\nWitty grip thank you for joining us\nIt's good to hear how how surprising was that if at all that um Chancellor Merkel said she was not going to seek to continue in that position past Twenty one ... her position had\nBeen weakening for some time it's been a very very rough year for for the chancellor she starting with elections in September of twenty Seventeen when her plate under performed\nSince then she had a very difficult time putting together a coalition government the government wants it was formed was marked by really intense feuding an inability to get things done\nAnd just in the last few weeks we've seen regional elections where\nThe city you her party has really suffered they've they've taken some hits so she was definitely on the downs weighing her her influence was waning but I think a lot of people were still caught off guard by the timing of this announcement she was someone who has said repeatedly that she was going to run for re election\nAs chair of her party at the parties conference in December obviously that's not going to happen now\nAnd he is is this you know what percentage of this would you say is about discontent over the acceptance of large numbers of refugees\n[laughter] I think that's part of it but it's not the whole story you've seen in the last few years that the CD you has faced a real challenge from it's right in the form of a\nAlternative ... Deutschland party they empty ah which has taken a second off maybe about ten twelve percent of the vote\nOn the right side from the city you but the thing he was also being hurt or from the center it's it's you see ah the Green Party which until recently had been pretty fringe in Germany now all of sudden are doing very very well in these regional elections also doing very well\nAnd national polling and a lot of the new green supporters say that they are a defectors from the CD you that they don't like the fact that the city with a as or elements of the city or pushing to the right\nAnd they are defecting to a more Progressive Party so you see the thing you really caught in between there they've always been they've stalled themselves as a center right parties under Merkel they had become much more of a truce centrist party and now they're being a hertz from both the left and the right side\nIs there someone that's an heir apparent to uncle of Merkel's position within the party who might be able to attract more support or or is this just seems pretty clear it's going to fracture German politics\n[noise] well I think that the the CD you is hoping that somehow they can read clean their status is what's called the books are tied which means people's party a party that has broadly\nAre representing the German public and and it's not necessarily just a narrow interest group but what you've seen over the last year as a real fragmentation of the political scene\nIn Germany and uh what had been a fairly stable system that was dominated by two long standing parties all of a sudden it just sticks way race in Germany\nAmong a different party at each have a particular segment of the population that they represent and it's going to be very challenging for whoever succeeds miracle\nTo recapture that\nThat broad um you know that that broad representation of the population there's going to be pressure on whoever is the successor\nTo take the party either to the right\nOr to to keep it where where America has has kept it which is to say in the center and either way they're going to be people on who are alienated by by that decision and who will will vote for for one of the other parties the fact is that the city you as been in power for very long time Thirteen Years now and\nIt's very difficult for a party that the governor for so long even though the CD you a rightly or boasts of its accomplishments which are are are many this is a country Germany that has ... in many ways never had it so good it's economically prosperous crime is quite low despite what you may hear from certain people tweeting\nAnd uh you know Germany is it by many many measures the country that has succeeding\nWent on and is there much internal debate within the CD you over whether it needs to move to the right on immigration and status of refugees\nThere is certainly a there is a ... you saw with the uh sister party of the city you see a ... year which isn't the barrier\nThey moved uh very strongly to the ride\nAnd tried to mimic the ... language on immigration that didn't work out well for them or they were punished in elections a couple of weeks ago in Bavaria but you still have an element within the CD you that would like to take that tax is a a a politician by the name of young spawn who wants to make\nThe CD you into a more true right wing party um but they're also a candidate vying to replace medical including one who's who's got the nickname many narco or who want to take a basically in the same direction that America was taking it which is to say a centrist direction\nBut to put a new face on the party so that it it's a party that's led by someone with with new approaches new blood doesn't\nHave the same kind of baggage that America will dies after Thirteen Years in power\nGrip you know I I think the sense a lot of Americans have is that there was kind of ... to us about a Merkel that allowed her to you know you have sort of a a prime leadership position within the you generally um and if that that is true is there anyone\nYou know that might be your successor who just because of Germany strong economy would have that position or not\nCertainly whoever is chancellor of Germany is is going to have a very strong position Germany is such a economic force a it's such a political horse in Europe\nSo uh you know it's it's the largest economy in Europe by far so with the with the title of chancellor of Germany comes a lot of power that being said the candidates to succeed her are all pretty low profile none of them how much of a pilot all outside of Germany\nAnd many of them are not even well known within Germany\n... wedding thank you so much appreciate your being with us in describing what's going on in German politics

hour will debate proposition six which would repeal the gas tax in Greece and the increase\nIn the vehicle license to be that would also requires voters must approve of increases involved various will debate is right after the news [noise]\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Lakshmi Singh the office of Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller is raising concerns about allegations that women were offered money to falsely accused Muller of sexual Harris meant it says the special counsel team learned of the allegations last\nA measure and that's why firefighters are police the chamber of commerce the civil engineer cities and counties are all opposed to it\nWhat ... what about cross contention that to point three billion dollars a year yes oh is gleaned from just the old gas tax that could be made available to do highway improvements\nBut that's not true that the truth is that voters just I think we're all member just this spring past club sixty nine which mandates according to the constitution\nThat those transportation dollars go to transportation projects and so I think it's a it's an attempt to just try to get voters to a mistrust of the current system when they just passed a constitutional amendment to protect those funds\nIf if California though previously had one of the highest gas taxes in the country why was so difficult if those funds were kept for a road infrastructure repair and improvements\nWhy is the so difficult for California they have enough money to do it when other states you're doing it with a lower gas tax\nOr you know who scores highest on ah the on that ratio of of roads and use of the gas tax states like North Dakota and South Dakota places that just don't have are difficult and complex transportation systems we have the fifth largest economy in the world\nTwenty percent of the goods in America enter and exit through our ports we trade with every major country in the Pacific rim more over the gas tax has been at its current level since Nineteen Ninety One\nSince then inflation and fuel economy have\nEroded the purchasing power of our gas tax dollars by fifty percent and so it's no wonder we now have a hundred and\nThirty eight billion dollar backlog in bridge and road repairs that we have to take on it's just time\nWe're talking with Matt K. to Melbourne six Carl DeMaio yes on sex if you have questions for I guess about what ... would do when it's repeal of the gasoline tax increase in the last\nThe car license fee increase we're at eight six six eight nine three K PCC that's eight six six eight nine three five seven to two where the air talk page K PCC dot org Karl just on the issue of voter approval is that a simple majority or two thirds\nApproval required it can be simple majority or if it was earmarked you could be two thirds we're already going to do an initiative that would earmark a hundred percent\nOf the gas tax and the sales tax on cars for roads and that would be a simple majority\nSo if you would actually increase that tax that would already be in place in the state constitution that would be a simple majority how was that different than sixty nine I was glad you asked that prop sixty nine\nWas written by the politicians they call it a lock box but this is what the fourth locked box that we voted on\nIts like Lucy and the football and Charlie Brown\nThey dangle rubber pears in front of us and then they take them away that they wrote the language to allow them to divert the money into the general fund if there are shortfalls there's actually two provisions and prop sixty nine that allows that plus if you notice how oh so cleverly and slightly Matt uh used as words\nYou didn't say the money was earmarked for roads which is what the voters want he said it's remarked for transportation well let's talk about that definition of transportation it includes parking wrecked programs\nFarm programs college and university grants job training programs of the union halls it also includes all of those that are examples of uh the bureaucracies that we've identified where you will have for example seven engineers at Caltrans for every one project that's active right now\nWhich the LA ... office has identified thirty five hundred engineers that are excessive at Caltrans\nOr we also have seen in LA metro here in in uh Los Angeles the a a purchase of buses\nThat are five times the cost of the national average\nBuses that actually have been documented to have performance problems\nAnd so we're buying buses at one point six five million dollars per bus at LA metro when in fact we should be paying about three hundred thousand dollars and so those examples all are piling up and and you wonder why in the world can't we fix the roads with the fourth highest gas tax in the country\nThe reality is the money's diverted and it's also wasted and we need accountability before we add to the burdens of working families who who many of these folks they're earning forty fifty thousand dollars and they're just simply not able to afford the extras NASA hundred fifty dollars and gas tax ...\nK did your response to that that what prop sixty nine did was so loosely defined what was an application of of those tax dollars to trans said that it's really kept significant amounts for making their way to road repairs\nWell it's just not just not accurate\nRead the initiative Matt Reed the initiative I hold on that go ahead of me what's that\nTruth is that voters past twenty two almost ten years ago and now prop sixty nine at the gas tax is\nIs truly in a dark
