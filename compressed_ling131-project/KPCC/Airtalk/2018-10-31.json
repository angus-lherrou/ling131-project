C. dot org Pepe rights on the page for voting by mail if I make a mistake\nOn that vote by mail ballots are putting gas for example when I meant it to be\nA no do I have to get a new ballot or I can I white out the line and corrected Pepe wandering a Neal Kelly of Orange County um how should she be aware that\nThat's a great question at the at this stage in the game because we're closer to election day I Would encourage her to a she can circle what her answer would be an ... ... ... mark on the one that she does not once\nShe can use her initials that she wanted to use an arrow to indicate that that's all out and state laws and we have a mechanism in place and all that a duplicate that ballot and recorded the correct results\nIf she's still concerned she can always go to one of our early vote servers Orange County order or a she could go to a point but it's not election day in ... but I don't want to discourage people because we see this all the time Larry where people have made mistakes on ballots they make that correction and we handle it ah with the procedure oh\nOkay very good and if someone was given a vote by mail ballot and they got preoccupied didn't didn't fill it out or whatever can they still go vote at their local polling place\nAnd and just destroy the vote by mail about or did they have to turn in that vote by mail ballot at the local polling place does that become the only way to cast their ballot\nI'm really glad you asked that question because\nIf they bring that out with them it will avoid an additional checked in procedure for so it saves time not only for us but for the vote or more importantly so bring them out with them to the point places my recommendation is they had happened to throw it away or destroy it they can certainly come in but then they go through the Chris across\nOkay dean did you want to add anything to that\nI was just I think it's funny I was gonna start exactly where and you didn't say I'm so glad that that you asked that question because\nI think it's important for voters to know that that's a\nThat's a rule in California election law called the surrender that gets referred to as the surrender rule so if you\nIf you did make a mistake and choose to go to the polling place or or just decided that you don't want to use the vote by mail ballot and want to vote at the polling place um best bet is to bring in that vote by mail about and surrender and just as Neal said you'll be able to vote or regular ballot I'm at\nThe same time we don't want to discourage people from voting if you don't have the vote by mail ballot or you forget to take with you or we're gonna we're gonna be sure you get to vote you're just going to have to go through that provisional ballot\nFor this somewhat related Diane in Hawthorne called since she's the LA county I'll ask you dean she said I was Senate ballot to vote by mail I don't remember requesting it I'd prefer to go in and cast my vote can I still do that so in that case deemed is Diane need to take in that vote by mail ballot\nThat we would encourage her to\nDo that again that will allow her to ah just fine in and vote regular ballot um which sounds like is what she wishes to do but again if she uh she has the option either way if she doesn't\nHave it with her um she can still go to that polling place or they're just going to issue her a provisional ballot a and the other thing I Would say to her is is that we can certainly provide her if she gets in touch with that we can provide her with the information on how she got lifted as they vote by mail order and if she wishes to have that removed or we're happy to accommodate that as well\nAll right we're at eight six six eight nine three KP cc eight six six eight nine three five seven to two it's your chance to talk with\nTake place in the LA county\nThough LA county plans to move to that model in a twenty twenty so we plan to roll that out in the march twenty twenty\nPresidential primary election uh and that will be augmented with and vote by mail I I think you you described it very well Larry I think it's important for people to to know that that's actually an expansion of access to voting so voting will actually be available at the vote centers\nAre over I'm at eleven day period will start opening vote centers ten days before the election as we get to the weekend before the election will open even more of those centers and um and we are\nWorking right now through a public meetings and with um with community partners to identify where the best locations are going to be for these a vote centers to to make them places that are relevant to the electorate so so there are places I got lots of e is meeting people where they are so so it's\nNot intended to be a something where it'll be difficult for the voter defined voting it's actually going to be making voting visible and I'm able to people whether out and about and ah and participating another activity\nParking please make sure there's plenty of parking because um I mean there might be locations where you'll have a lot of walking because of a high concentration of businesses but it's going to be so important to make it accessible that people have a reasonable place that they can park\nYou know that that's so true and I think that that um accessibility is a is a big part of\nThe drive to move to this new model because um whether it be parking or whether it be the accessibility features of the actual physical building um and even the the acceptable features of the voting equipment that will be in those loading locations are those are all important considerations that had been part of the design of its new model\nRobin mid Wilshire good to have you with us you have a question about signatures I understand\nYours so long ago that it registered today I'm not sure how I signed my at the ballot polling station not a family that's the way it for a vote by mail\nYou know kind of wondering how do you go to send a signature and also you know people get older your signature gyms change\nNot to ... it's a really good point that's been highly controversial in Georgia where I'm One of the counties I Believe it is a have disqualified quite a few of the vote by mail ballots because they said the signatures didn't match and so the concern um you know voting rights advocates has been\nThat you know are the are the people that are doing the comparison or they properly trained can they see some of the changes that would come by age you know what criteria used to do the signature matching suneel Kelly in orange county have how do you do what they're\nSo we do now an extensive training program wearing and the caller is is right on point because I signed my credit card state and now it looks very different from my voter registration there either\nBut you know the legislature saw a this as well and and and has recently passed a bill in the governor signed it\nAnd it's in effect for this election now which means that your signature does not match and not\nMatch at any point under certain I'm sure we are required to send you a letter and you have an opportunity to cure it by signing a form and indicating yes this is me mailed it back to us and then your ballot counts so this is a really good thing for this election and I think vastly improved that that is\nOkay so you don't even if not like you even have to work to match it you'll let the person know as long as they test yes that is my signature it's me then you'll count the ballot that's\nCorrect okay very very good\nUh let's see Jeffrey in Beverly Hills says if you have a vote by mail ballot but you do want to drop it off at your polling place on election day all day do you have to Wade through the long line of people waiting to cast their votes or can you just go up to the front of the line and drop off your vote by mail ballot dean\nA great question I Know you do not need to do wait in line you can take that directly onto the table\nAnd the poll worker will um direct you to the ballot box and again want to emphasize that in addition to the polling places on election day ah we have one hundred and fifty locations throughout the county where you could drop off the ballot any day leading up to the election and on election day and you can find those locations again on our website at Eli vote dot net\nRight quick question a city out in Whittier says both my mother and I do mail in ballots we sell 'em out together she lives in Los Angeles I live in Whittier why are the order of the candidates swapped our ballots look so different Neal\nWell that's a great question burgers or something in California called rotation where earns is\nThat candidates Roach it on the ballot depending on what location you're in by us ah we are one of the most complex rotation laws in the country and and building you're designing a valid or you'll see the complexity of that the reason for that but that's exactly\nWhat All right gentlemen I Want to thank you so much really appreciate your spending all this time with us today on TALK as you're getting your counties are all prepped for election day and

V. and I never knew whether or not the information we're being told was true or not but I Know that we were monitored by the person who hired a contract to crown third\nCrowds on demand and they would drive by kind of give us a thumbs up you know we would get reports back whether or not we were being affected and what we were doing whether we looked like we were you know lagging or talking too much to each other\nDo you do you know who the client was in this case who hired crowds on demand\n[noise] I think I Know who it is it was never absolutely confirmed okay willing to try to kind of pinpoint who the contractor was\nBut you think you do see to it was and and did they try and did did they try and convince you as to the rightness of the cause for which you were protesting or they did they not bother with that\n[noise] you know there was signage provided there were some friendship mattered that we were given that supposedly supported to claim a contractor 'em and you know people they were kinda crafty they're actors in a group you know people pursuing acting I should say\nAnd you know they were clever and their their minds that they would make up on the spot\n[laughter] it was just entertaining and I\nI really in the back of my mind always felt like this is ... for some comedy\nYeah I was gonna say definitely it it sounds like it if it borders on parity itself and everybody to your knowledge there was pay you were all compensated\nOh no we it was a compensated because there's a whole thing okay for this company would come out and\nConfront as they would share photographs they would confront it saying asking whether or not we were paid course people said that we were not they were followed and then you know it was just\n... cat kind of enterprise\nSpeak water we assumed that I'm Sorry we're short on time but what a fascinating experience so Gary south a ... as a democratic political consultant should adapt then rightly make a skeptical of some of the you know the cause protests that we see out there\nWell I think that we all we always have to approach um\nProtests with a bit of skepticism until we find out who's behind it and whether or not people who are involved in it are genuinely\nAre committed to the cause I'm you know in in a in a campaign contacts than a political campaign contacts again as I set up front you know campaigns have been paying people to do things for for for generations but\nIt it's it's it's kind of self defeating for a campaign to pay paid mercenaries to show up to bulk up the crowd or to attend a rally or to uh you know people protest because the purpose of a campaign obviously in the end is to get votes and\nIf you can't find enough committed supporters of that candidate or that cause to people protesting you have to pay complete people who are completely uninvolved Ron committed to do so it tells you something about the validity or and the power of that of that cause\nNow I'm now ... are members of labor unions will often be\nUh you go to Sacramento to protest they'll they'll\nBe you know are supporting or or against particular legislation and um I've just always assume those are people you know committed members of the union care about but is there any compensation and some of those cases are lodging your meals or things like that provided to people willing to do that\nWell there is and that's what I mentioned up front um you know I've I've conducted many many phone banks where we paid people in Pete when pizza\nOr if you show up at six o'clock at night and spend two hours on the shift at a phone bank or we're going to bring in a you know pizzas\nUm so there's there's compensation of a sword involved in political activity like this but again\nWhat is new about this is the commercialization of this process what ... what a union essentially compensates members to go to Sacramento to protest or to lobby those are those are members of the union those are not outside paid mercenaries who have no connection to the cause whatsoever and this\nBut I think takes up another step to the point where you're just basically picking people at random off the street right on the phone book\nA and paying the money to go stand someplace or against something um where they have absolutely no involvement whatsoever in the costs\nProfessor Walker just briefly you'd you'd do you think that we're going to see growth in this as a with social media there's so much coverage of these kinds of protests\nYou know I Do think we will see some growth of it and it's um you know I think you know we're now at a moment in which this term paid protesting has been weaponized I Would say by the Trump Administration just like big news has um\nAnd I think the big news has become you know an all purpose for trying to attack the legitimacy of the free press just as paid protesting is now an all purpose tool for trying to attack freedom of assembly um and now we're actually seeing this White House proposed new restrictions on a public assemblies in Washington their whole set a new rules\nThat are in front of a national park service now that would drastically changed the way that large demonstrations are treated\nSo I think we need to be thinking about this a lot but not let this problem of of distrust become much larger than it is a\nProfessor thank you for joining us Gary

bought for the Republican is represented a large swath off the coast Orange County in Congress but he's facing a very stiff challenge from businessmen hardly ...\nComing up right after the news rooted joins us to talk about his challenger was ...\nFind out how strongly that candidacy is is connecting in the county\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Lakshmi Singh federal prosecutors are upping the number of charges filed against the alleged gunman behind Saturday's mass shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh\nGrand jury has decided to indict the suspect on forty four counts up from twenty nine according to a filing in federal court in Pittsburgh eleven people were killed over the weekend to date the city is holding a second day of funerals\nOkay but you you think you could control the cost of that you don't think you'd have to increase reimbursements for those covered in that open Medicare program\nWell what we know is that Medicare actually delivers\nQuality healthcare services at approximately sixty five cents on the dollar compared to the private insurance market\nAnd they're doing that well certainly a user's healthcare users at a higher city for usage because of their age so badly she read on the crisis overall are effectively as you go out and eat the base of users within the editor\nWe're talking with democratic candidate for Congress hardly route to his district is one that historically been about as Republican is any district in the country it's coastal Orange County\nBut of course like so much of Orange County it's had demographic shifts it's a district that voted for Hillary Clinton uh back in the last presidential election there was still a Republican advantage in registration\nDespite that so I hardly route out at this is a district where clearly there's some significant antipathy toward President Trump and we even saw two years ago with Hillary Clinton winning the district\nNonetheless it's one that I'm In registration is still philosophically Republicans so what are you saying to Republican voters who might not be President Trump's supporters to attempt to get them to vote for you instead of Mr Rohrabacher\nWay we are talking about the issue so when we look at the differences between date or by myself David Walker has come out and said that homelessness is a lifestyle\nIssue I recognized as a a an issue where we want to get people back into our communities the disease citizens again\nHe has said that homeowners don't have to sell their homes to gay and lesbian even though it's against the law in California and Twenty one other states\nHe does not believe in climate change while I recognize as one of the greatest issues if not the greatest as you say he demanded it\nHe supports offshore girlie I don't uh he supports the arming training and arming of high school students to address gun violence potential which I think is the most asinine thing I've heard of politicians saying away on time and he certainly has a long relationship with Russia\nBut above all that more than ... he's simply not working he's been there Thirty years if he is only has three pieces of legislation most recently fourteen years ago so people here are hungry so real representation will support and people a person who will fight to protect\nWhether it's Medicare whether Social Security preexisting conditions show up and look on their behalf\nAnd of course in fairness Mr ... in recent years a you know it's um [laughter]\nI I shouldn't say ... years but prior to that one Democrats controlled difficult for Republicans to get stuff through um we've invited Mr ... her to join us on the program a we have invited him we've not yet received confirmation and time is running out\nFor him to join us on TALK to talk about his candidacy but I just want to assure listeners that in all of these races we invite both of the candidates to join us and in some cases uh they have declined I'm the same same way with

we're at eight six six eight nine three can't BCC\nEight six six eight nine three five seven to two you can also posted come a question on the air talk page at key PCC dot org ... so you you mentioned at the end\nThis is an area that you you strongly support a addressing climate change if you were elected to the house what federal policies would you support there\nI think the tremendous opportunity we have\nAnd I know that's a a strange way to start off a discussion on climate change but we have to address climate change so if we embrace the fact that those who addressed that are also ... young or tomorrow in the College of clean energy sectors we can make\nSouthern California the hallmark or the world and addressing climate change in creating those jobs right here and I'm committed to doing
