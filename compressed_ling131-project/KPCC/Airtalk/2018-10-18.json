{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Well one good thing is that in California we have the field act in the field act specifies that California\nPublic school buildings are built to a higher construction standard than virtually any other building in the state so there are a lot less likely to fail to begin with and an earthquake which means that our buildings will probably still be standing even if other buildings in the neighborhoods will be down\nHow much money is being put into earthquake preparedness what percentage of the budget I mean we know it's an inevitable kind of thing um but but you're wondering how much is spent on this\nIt's very low um schools actually determine for themselves which portion of their budget they they need to set aside to maintain that and there is not a lot of funding in places decentralized level\nSo each school has to decide on their own how much they want to do on this\nYeah the basics are all in place they all have the search and rescue kits the water barrels things like that that tend to stay at the school overtime and it's really just things like are replacing medical supplies that may have expired refill into water barrels smaller tasks like that\nSo the thing is though I think we all know that to not all schools in LA unified are created equal so have more resources than others so when we were kids that don't have a lot of support here at home or because of like a school funding what's being done to make sure they're saving prepared\nBecause the standards are in place for all of the schools to comply with in terms of the preparedness ah I haven't seen a lot of cases where were the schools are unable to do that and in that case they generally just reach out to a man we make an arrangement\nThat she'll barn she LA you as the executive emergencies ... thank you oh\nLos Angeles is one of the most disaster prone cities in the world vulnerable to earthquakes fires and many other disasters so it shouldn't come as a surprise that community emergency response training research started here\nDoes I teach regular people how to be first responders it's now a national program made available through the federal emergency management agency\nFEMA recently recognized ... program in Long Beach for upstanding community preparedness so take two contributor Adrian Cargill went to a mock disaster grilled the check it out\n\nIt's a typical afternoon in Southern California guys are clear the weather's warm life is good when all of the sudden the grounds starts to shake\nThis feels like the big one the one everyone has been dreading\nSeveral perfectly LA\nCars are flipped over and fires are smoldering\nWe\nYou see a six story building that looks partially destroyed black from fire in the days of the destruction you walk in [noise]\n\nOkay so it's not actually the big one this is a community emergency response training trail or sirt for short with the Long Beach fire department but it feels really real\n\nThree emergency response trainees have found a teenage boy whose pretending his right abdomen was in ... by a stick\nAnd his injuries look pretty real the trainees are learning how to suspect him to properly transport them and performed basic trash in this case they lift the boy into a chair and then down the stairs [noise]\nIt's\nChaotic just like it would be in a real disaster there's a guy with third degree burns all over his body at least that's how I look\nReally caught on fire earthquake all burned up\nThe birds are real there there were ... artists to apply fake injuries [noise] there's a lot of blood people with glass and their arms burns on their bodies\nSo that really is is designed to push them a and really make them work together as a team to come together uh provide first date or under medical disaster medical operations also provide a search and rescue operations and medical or fire suppression\nAs Catholic firefighter he's also the program manager for certain Long Beach today's drill is a combination of two full days of training\nIt's based on real life estimates of a seven point ... magnitude earthquake hitting ... a quick like that would kill around two thousand people injure another fifty thousand cause billions of dollars of damage to strike freeways and leaving the region without gas electricity and water\nEarthquakes of this magnitude historically occur every a hundred and fifty\nIt's been three hundred years since the last one Long Beach sirt is working to make sure it's community will be ready [noise]\nThe training is designed to give ordinary folks the tools to save lives like getting somebody out from under a\nCar this person is alive and I'm In a new one other person when they get the vehicle up and how you call it the body\nOn any given day in Long Beach ... says there around a hundred and twenty four firefighters on duty the city has half a million residents that's roughly one firefighter for every five thousand people he says when disaster hits they will be overwhelmed no question\nSo we will rely on volunteers that are trained insured other volunteers that are are passionate about contributing to the community to support assist those in need to be able to rally to be able to come together and do the greatest good for the British and the people in the short\nSirt is the fire departments force multiplier it's their way of training the community to be able to take care of itself in a disaster after the drill many participants say they feel empowered here's Danica pots\nAnd makes me feel like OK instead of fear being my first instinct react in a response and see okay what's our plans [noise]\nYou know I mean ... a big difference [laughter]\nTwo days ago pops will just an ordinary community member I put out a fire I say to live [noise] certain hopes up with these skills to use not\nOnly when disaster strikes but also in everyday life\nWhether [noise]\nMore than a thousand people have graduated from Sirte programs in Long Beach since they started because you just never know when the big ones coming but we do know however is that luck favors the prepared [noise]\nThat's due to contributor ...

NPR's Mara Liasson has this update\nUh if you accept the Turks interpretation that was the\nThe Saudi Government was responsible for his disappearance so it's it to some observers it's odd that we should be waiting on Saudi Arabia to carry out an investigation when they are in effect a suspect in this disappearance\nUp but that was what secretary Pompeo called for in fact ... whole statement to reporters was kind of a holding pattern it would seem to be just an appeal for patients\nAnd what was odd is within minutes of surgery at Yale walking away then we got news that the administration is actually taking some action here in that\nA treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin announced that he will not participate in that big or what was going to be a big investment conference in Riyadh this coming week\nOf the doubt dogs in the desert as it's been called a lots of business and media leaders had already pulled out up until this morning is that the treasury secretary was still saying he

mean you can't have a I won't call Saudi Arabian ally let's call it a security part\nUh allies usually share American values as well as interests Saudi Arabian us do not share common values\nAnd I think we some degree of misjudged the ground under the rubric of reform and perhaps in ... he ... in fact you may emerge as someone who is capable of changing the king but\nWith its it's masked the ruthless and a recklessness darker so\nWhich is now involve the United states\nValues and and and interest so I think we need to um have orange our own investigation the global met Nick Magnitsky Act triggered by Congress gives the inspiration a hundred and twenty days\nTo launch an investigation determine whether or not um foreign country extra\nLeader why was involved in the torture murder and violation of human rights of your mom could show she and then determine sanctions are\nWell and and you you've advised secretaries of state so for multiple administrations in in both parties hypothetically if the U.S investigation came back that the overwhelming evidence was that operatives of the Saudi Government\nTortured and killed a ... then what should the u._s. do\nWell the question is if the Saudis story a basically a students that this operation was a ... that the senior levels of the of of the Saudi leadership let's kick ... at the senior levels of the Saudi Government had no for knowledge is\nA little orchestrated or ... or or validated that I I suspect\nThis administration it'd be hard pressed to identify this as credible if we came to our own in in determination\nThat in fact based on U.S intelligence investigations in Saudi Arabia and turkey if if the end of the road if we in fact leave at senior levels of the Saudi Government then you have to face the real the real\nConundrum of whether or not you're you're prepared to impose sanctions freezing assets spending arms sales\nCertainly take in the United states military\nOut of what has proven to be a

be arrested\nProducts are Aaron David Miller as always thank you for being with us appreciate you sharing your thoughts about this and I wish you a good day thank you pleasure from the Wilson Center in Washington vice president for new initiatives Aaron David Miller who was\nAre no Larry and in fact that's what we want we don't want a change currently fire departments police departments\nAre EMTs paramedics when there's a nine one one call even if they're on a break and they're the closest\nAnd it's an emergency we want them to respond seconds can make the difference between life and death and ... eleven ensures that the closest ambulance can respond when a patient called nine one one it\nIs tablets his into law the longstanding industry practice of paying private EMTs and paramedics to remain reachable during their work breaks in case of an emergency and wishes I said just like firefighters and police\nWe should clarify that this applies to private ambulance companies because many cities these days contract with private\nAmbulance services as opposed to having their own fire departments provide the paramedic and the ambulance services also where this is Jason ... who is a registered paramedic and it's been so for twenty five years\nExecutive director of the United EMS workers which is an affiliate a of a local of and asked me which represents nearly four thousand private sector EMS workers in California that's ... thank you for being with us\n[noise] the rabbit wire you opposed to this proposition\nWell first let me say we're not opposed to anything that director Meyer just said as a matter of fact we're supportive of um a legislative process to change the California labor law um we recognize that\nProviding off duty meal periods for a private sector industry\nThat provides public safety services is not necessarily a political um the reason why we're opposed to this is this what this initiative won't change the standing practice it won't change the standing practices on training nor the mental health what this initiative is about\nIs having a liability protection clause at the very end to protect one provider who's the author of this initiative\nI'm against the liability claims 'em and potential exposure for civil lawsuits for alleged violations of the standing wage order and that's why we're\nSo I'm just clarify little bits of your concern is that um one particular company or the provides these ambulance services that they're somehow fully ... in them the fight against a lawsuit that they violated labor laws that what you're saying\nCorrect if you listen if you if you read section eight eight nine of the initiative it declares the on duty meal periods as in quote declarations of and do not alter or amend California\nLaw and shell applied to any and all actions pending on or commenced after October twenty five of twenty Seventeen alleging a violation of the California code of regulations\nSo this is an attempt not to increase the public safety and we and we 'cause we agree um that there needs to be changes and needs to be substantive changes uh that's why we have an open committee process through both houses of our legislature um but this is about that particular clause and the liability protections that they're seeking\nOkay so it just to clarify so you support the idea that private EMS employees should be on call during their break you support them being on call\nIs that what you're saying ... absolutely and we actually co sponsored a bill a few years ago um to actually give that carve out to private sector not only of the Augustus rolling but of and to fundamentally change the the wage or\nWhy didn't that make its way then successfully through the legislature\nBecause the author of this initiative um was no longer willing to speak and and collaborate with both labor committees in both houses and with other stakeholders when we were not willing to provide them this liability protection in the legislation that we were we were co sponsoring\nOkay let me go back then to Carol Meyer former director LA county emergency medical services how would you characterize the clause in the proposition that Mr ... just referenced\nWell basically it makes no sense it was good for all of us for fifty years it's good for us going forward in the union agrees with that\nSo based on a court decision they're saying that for this brief period of time it's not and so the language that has been set forward in this proposition indicates that it's back to the time that the proposition was filed\nAnd that's not unusual proposition six has a retroactive clause there are several pieces of legislation this year that were approved in Sacramento that had retroactive clauses so\nThis is about public safety and that's what we're all about as providers of enough we want to function the same way that the police departments do the fire department to do and in fact\nUm many times there are contracts with the counties where the private sector provides the transportation for the nine one one call and in some cases they're even in the same station\nAnd they would respond the same way as the firefighters are in our current day if this does not pass if prop eleven does not pass the radios for the private EMTs and paramedics have to be shut off\nAnd fire department would get up and go on the call and the EMTs would not\nWhy why did this not work its way through the legislature wire voters being asked to decide this labor issue well\nWe believe it should have been resolved in the legislature but the author never put a bee to sixty three up for final vote and in fact the union was the sponsor of the item um they wanted the courts to make the decision and stayed for there to this the court did not rule in favor\nOf banning all call breaks for private ambulance services he would ban the practice through legislation right\nSo so so you you take issue with Mr ... characterization that the union supports the employees being on call during break\nWell we're glad they support it we want him to support the bill in general\nOkay but I'm confused because I thought you were saying that the legislation the union didn't support because they prefer to have the Supreme state Supreme Court decide that the employees couldn't be on call during breaks\nWell they didn't put that forward so you'd have to ask Mr Burrell anymore about that they were the sponsor and it did not get pulled forward it was it died in the legislature\nJason ... your response\n[noise] it it actually did die in the legislature it died in committee I'm both a labor committees and both houses wanted a very collaborative 'em and joint effort on creating public policy that was good for all of the stakeholders\nAnd the author of this initiative am are as one of the larger stakeholders in the state\nUm when they walked away from the table um because we weren't able to negotiate a liability clauses that they were looking for um that collaborative process broke down and there was a large portion of the industry there was no longer represented in those conversations and what is so what specific\nLiability exposure do you want the private companies to to potentially out so we wanted we were willing\nTo allow them\nLimited retrospective liability coverage and complete perspective immunity we understand that the long standing practice of having on duty meal periods was because we provide a public safety and so we identified that there needs to be some protections because we cannot house\nOur employers in our providers in the county contractors litigated out of business but we knew that there were three current pending cases and as an individual creating\nThis group to create public policy was not willing to buy the stroke of a pain in the legislature take away the civil rights\nTo an individual or three individuals in the state to seek remedies through the civil process for grievances with their employer even even Italy I didn't want to add to any more lawsuits but we didn't want them to be able to have complete shielding and get out of what they currently even if that would potentially expose\nThese companies to ongoing um limits on on call employees during breaks because couldn't those three past cases end up in that kind of a result\nThat they are very well could have and it's it's not I'm a process that I'm a part of um so we were willing to fast track legislation through and continue working um unfortunately the author walked away from those negotiations and those discussions and and qualify the initial\nAll right I Want to thank you both for being with us telling you about proposition eleven which would uh uh require that EMS employees of private ambulance services be on call during their break periods Carol Meyer former director LA county emergency medical services Jason ...\nOne often sees it in films you see it on situation comedies on television\nAnd as writer Philip Alice describes his experience the often felt that he was from tempted to be cast into this role of the gay best friend\nOf someone who's straight what do you think about that and is it a stereotype that you see eroding or is the is there still kind of a a a a of an accessory rising is Philip ... puts it\nA with straight people who who have gay friends eight six six eight nine three key PCC or the air talk page KP C. C. dot org\nFill up you know at at at one point it might have in some uh American cultures be considered edgy to have a gay friend before the degree of widespread acceptance that we have today\nBut given the fact that I'm being algae Beatty cue is so mainstream and you know certainly in urban America today\nI Would think that this kind of stereotype just naturally you're roads are are you seeing that\nUm I think you're absolutely right that I'm sort of like a gay man you know the um the ... that that it might be perceived to be a by by sort of mainstream culture or a decade ago\nUm I think maybe ... some where we're at now with with turns because maybe while I was gay people uh that ... that I thought so I'm I'm I think maybe you're right that it's not sort of an on it's like a huge I'm\nSort of novelty or at least I Know a a A N in everyday life but uh two of the biggest films that came out this year still hot that stereotype in them so crazy Rich Asians I'm too old to boys have lot before\nThose romantic comedy both um you know quite rightly applauded for that representation of Asian parrots as um they both the church or a gay man who exists to be an emotional sounding board and to give the the main carrots or a may ...\nSo it it's still the stereotype is being pumped out into society by Hollywood\nRight a fellow bell is with us on TALK mark in Hollywood how do you experienced is\nWhy I experienced that growing up and I still experience it today I think the uh the issue that I take is when you know ... I'm Out with my group of friends might say that when women to infiltrate and it becomes an issue of concerns do meet at least start\nActing it's certainly a chance to certain my just because we're guy and I think that is\nAlso symptomatic of\nYou know how we were I mean for me um I got bullied every day and I said I Am a safety net in women and now that I've grown up I have my safety not in my group of friends which includes women\nUm but when I'm Out with my friends and I have multiple women just coming up immediately you know grabbing are touching or you know in rejecting into a private conversation\nWhy what do you think is behind that is is it they're they're trying to show that they're that they're cool or what what do you what do you think is the motivation for women to do what you're describing\nWell like I said I think as a child I was searching for safety net in a place where I didn't feel safe um you know often when I acquire out at a bar my feeling is that maybe that the same place that okay well maybe the first thing you know\nAnd and feel safe with you and they're so that's why that sort of physical affection would be shared mark I appreciate you sharing your experience a hands in eagle rock what's your experience of this\nWell I think the newly love Simon uh shows that the states that relationships between a gay character and his female friends has another side to it besides the stereotype and I think for for many gay men the reality of close\nFriendships especially with women\nHas been crucial to Shelley the interconnections between sexism and homophobia and it helped build necessary bonds that have helped infighting both again\nCons of British it boy that's beautifully said appreciate it to speaking to the importance of those friendships those relationships Haji in Pasadena you're on TALK\nHave experienced I'm being the gay best friend over the years you know helping my girlfriend's pick out dresses and doing their hair styles and those kinds of things that when I was younger but over the years I'm not sure if it's just that times have changed but these friendships there'll be bold and it\nDoesn't really have the gay best

on Lakshmi Singh the markets experiencing another sharp drop with the Dow down four hundred fourteen points to twenty five thousand two hundred Ninety two all major market indices are down one point six percent a to point two percent following news\nHousing I'm Michael you want to start us on this ...\nThis this is another attempt by the state legislature the legislature put this one on the ballot to try to deal with or of housing affordability crisis that we have in California it's it's a bit different than than the general vacation kinds of bonds revenue bond and there's already a dedicated stream of funding here and so the funds to pay the bond back\nWill come from the the revenue that already exists\nAnd is there any controversy about taking money that was designed for mental health services and transferring that into a pool of money for housing\nYeah absolutely that's at the even the road to get here this is essentially a bill that was a senator Kevin daily owns in two thousand sixteen and was challenged by a lawsuit saying you know that's not the intention of prop sixty three which is the money that is going to be used for this specific God bond measure\nAnd so there are people who are saying that you're taking money that is meant for mental health services and now creating a housing program out of it\nAnd for for mental health for national health right yeah I just remember this was the millionaire attacks that we passed proposition sixty three back in two thousand for this is not new money this is just saying that money we can now use a hundred and forty million dollars of that money to build housing for it for a mental health patience\nAnd the other point I Want to make is reiterate what Michael said\nIs that all these initiatives there either placed on the ballot by the state legislature or by signatures and this is one that's placed by the state legislature to change the law that was already voted upon the voters that they cannot change but they need your permission to be able to spend the money differently not new money to spend it differently\nSo you want to weigh in on this because it is a little different than prop one\nWell it it one there's the the same issues that that play that the that this will ultimately costs close to four billion dollars a\n... half of that will go towards the these housing programs the other half will go to interest now one thing to think about is that that's that's over a billion dollars I could have gone to mental health services that voters intended to go to mental health services that ones that go to pay off interest\nUh on on a program that they did not originally support and that that money that was taxed for people that's now money that's not going to go to my ... that's going to go to a brand new program with results that we don't yet know what that what that is um so I think that's something that has to be kept in mind that\nThis is something that's gonna be it's gonna end up costing double what what is it what it is up front it's a brand new program is taking money away from services\nAnd this is meant the mental health services act has already been under fire for ... for ever since it was passed by the state auditor by legislative anti office this money that's already being under used as it is and so now do we want to take that money and waste half of it on a interesting\nWe're talking about proposition to the bond measure melody\nRabbit just jump in there and say absolutely there have been a lot of controversy over the spending on of props sixty three but I Would add that the author of that measure uh I Darrell Steinberg who's now the mayor of Sacramento he said that it was always intended to create a program that stabilizes homeless mentally ill um homeless people\nAll right so that's proposition to next up of the third bond measure on the ballot propositions three which issues nearly nine billion dollars in bonds for water related infrastructure and environmental projects who'd like to start is on on that Katie Orr\nI can say um if you think you voted on a water bond before you have [laughter] I'm about the third one we had one and twenty four team that was fun\nSeven billion dollars and the governor came out very strong for that one there was one in the spring that we voted on for four billion dollars and that was actually an effort by lawmakers to\nKeep this proposition off of the ballot they were trying to I'm sort of doing an end run around that up but\nThey were not successful this one would be for watershed treatment habitat groundwater management a whole slew of\nA different water projects but um it's not we don't see the governor jumping in and supporting this one as we have in the past there is a feeling that the government the legislature and the government is not the ones backing\nThis measure and do we know how much of this money would go to providing a more reliable sources agriculture water in California versus urban residential use has that been delineated anyone's knowledge it seems like most of the water is for\nUm uh people people are saying that\nOne of the criticisms is that this is a giveaway to agriculture businesses and that they they are the ones that would benefit most from this specific a water projects water districts what want money for their projects than they should find a way to find them we shouldn't be making everyone in the states pay for projects that will only benefit specific places\nAll right ah Michael Evers anything quickly\nWell the other thing about this one is and again I I I spent the last couple of weeks rooting through this um and and trying to figure out the details of how this money is going to be spent\nAnd it's it's really unclear exactly what kind of trends parents oversight we as taxpayers will help with the expenditures under this under this measure the as I understand it the money basically goes to agencies and state agencies are going to allocate the funds and it's really not clear to me exactly how you tracked the money was one of one of one of the concerns I ever\nAlright that's proposition three nearly nine billion dollars water related infrastructure and environmental projects the final bond measure is proposition for one and a half billion dollars in bonds for children's hospitals a melody again Sam that\nNo I mean this one is one of the ones that doesn't have a lot of opposition its funding a\nCutting edge technology for children's hospitals that's probably a hard thing to run your opposition campaign on on\nBut you know their argument is that they treat children from low income families they're not being subsidized for some of that care and that this money is needed for seismic upgrade equipment um you know the one thing I Would add is that if like Katie said if you feel like you've voted on this before you have\nUm there were two different bonds for similar improvements ah seven hundred and fifty million bond or in two thousand four and a nine hundred and eighty million dollar bond in two thousand eight so these are things that are going before voters a you know several times in\nThe last retrofitting issue is a big thing for a lot of hospitals I Know because uh just the cost of doing it to these large facilities is is a major south your thoughts on this bond measure\nSo to take a stand against children's hospitals [laughter] you know they you know this this is one of those measures that sounds sounds good um who who's anti giving children's hospitals money uh well I

I Believe that there have been a sort of the legislature's been interested in in the past and and we're now at a point where they were waiting\nTo see if other states we're going to be interested in moving away from daylight savings time and so I think the legislatures kinda hopeful that by getting the California voters to weigh in on this one and then they will act\nThat maybe that will lead to a a large group of students can suffer and part of the challenges are California Constitution which is hundreds of pages long we continue to put a lot of things in there and this was decades ago that we did this and so now we actually have to have you vote on it to allow the legislature and Congress to take action if\nIt happens so we're just asking you not to just give them permission in case there's a national trend to change that by the way the European Union and throughout the world there's major discussion in Europe they will change of next year that we're getting rid of this and it's good consistent throughout the world and we just want to continue with\nThere are concerns historically I should say there have been concerns or in the agricultural community about this I'm a ... because of you know the darkness when kids would be going to school things like that um but ... are you aware of any sort of organized opposition to fulltime daylight saving time\nWell I I mean I think that's one of the things that would be interesting to see if it gets out of California and goes to the federal government\nWhere when everyone come down on and I honestly don't know I I ... I Do know I Will say I used to live in Indiana which had three times and was incredibly confusing so we're not we wouldn't be as bad as some places but um I I really I don't know how the federal government would\nWould take to that of course our neighbor Arizona or doesn't go on daylight saving time so they have a permanent\nPermanent time but it's not daylight savings time it's it's a standard time that they keep year round so once again that is proposition seven which is passed by voters then wouldn't allow the legislature and the governor to take this up is\nThe federal government were to make a move towards a standardizing a fulltime daylight saving time\nProposition age or would require dialysis clinic kidney dialysis clinics to issue refunds to private insurance companies a for a revenue that they take in more than Fifteen Percent a profit\nFrom the service that they provide this is a very complicated a measure I just led recently a full on debate on this and I'm Still trying to get my head around the complexities of this but part of the history is the effort of service Employees International union\nTo organize the employees at the two biggest dialysis companies the chains that are here in California\nA Michael you want to start us off on on on this or give me the harder it's going to say uh actually you know this this one I Know when you the longest I think that's why in\nFront of you know in my mind valuation of this is exactly what a what you just said which is one is incredibly complicated I've I've gone waded through this a number of times in it you'd you'd reads as if it's if it's an attempt to to begin lord of the cost or make make a dialysis treatment more affordable\nUm but I Do understand that there's a little bit of politics by which are I Wonder if some of my college might want to talk about because I'm not quite as as aware of the politics\nNow where did you you estimate for one this to share yeah I mean this is one of the lesser known initiatives no doubt you've heard the radio ads because a hundred and twenty million dollars is being spent on the lawn of ads on mostly by the dialysis clinic um who have poured a lot of money um you know you do have the backdrop of union\nUm unionizing and uh you have the backdrop of you know whether or not a health care costs should be able to\nSort of like they have been and so there's a lot of in the background going on to this one on top of the fact that it's just a very complicated measure\nSo the proponents their argument is that there would be a greater investment by these dialysis centers\nIn patient care because they're not going to want to have these rebates the private insurers for going above fifty percent and sense what they would pay their employees in providing services would count as expenses that therefore they would be more likely to invest in\nOpponents say this my will lead to dialysis clinic closures will continue on this proposition on our ...\nThis is eighty nine point three K PCC news California will reconsider life sentences for up to four thousand nonviolent third strict criminals\nBy allowing them to seek parole under a ballot measure approved by voters two years ago that's according to court documents obtained by the Associated Press today\nThe state will craft new regulations by January to include the repeat offenders in early release provisions\nThe state parole board estimates up to four thousand nonviolent third strikers could be affected however according to the director of the stand for three strikes project the ruling does not guarantee any of the offenders will get out of jail but will allow them to go before the parole board\nWell the number's gone up authorities in Florida say hurricane Michael is killed at least twenty people bringing the overall death toll to thirty Michael slammed into Florida's panhandle with one hundred fifty five mile an hour winds on October tenth\nWith hurricane force winds as far inland as southern Georgia also affecting the Carolinas and Virginia\nI'm Hattie Lynn herpes Cape you see the news [noise]\nThis is the two thousand aging voter cram session hurt on public radio stations throughout California I'm Lorraine national of NPR\nMember station KPCC in Pasadena\nWere KP cc's Crawford family for them this hour is devoted to looking at the pros and cons of California's eleven ballot measures were taking these the numerical order again in case you joined us right in the middle of this broadcast you can visit the website\n...
