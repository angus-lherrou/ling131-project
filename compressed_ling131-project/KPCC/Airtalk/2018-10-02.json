Charlie hate and the great jazz bass player and he's the brother the hidden triplets Petra Rachel and Tanya\nTheir first album was called the blue moods of Spain and I always kind of joke that moods might be deployed all might have been a joke because there was a like one move [laughter]\nThere was blue but or over the years there's been much more added to it and this album called Mandela brash and really takes a couple of different directions\nI hear a lot of gospel right there is definitely a lot of gospel I mean I say on one level they're sort of a western mysticism that's a there's a song called restrict heartburn you know the John Wayne character and then there's like some Jasmine citizen there's a Fifteen minute track called God is love which is just sounds like a tribute to his dad\nWas Josh playing standup base with his dad played one of the grapes of it uh but there's also a some real gospel I missed album and and Josh has done this before he is he's made\nExplicitly gospel music before and uh there's a song called you bring me up which really has that sort of like the gospel choir I use a great track [noise]\nWe win\nOr a dusty from something that you called Mojave Desert ... hospitals\nBut now the Death Valley All right so maybe I maybe there is a threat and we got the jets bound at the ready to me but the music shift gears would be the woman was alright er this is the Death Valley\n[noise]\n\nAll right I think\nI found something exercisers they hide out this is ... good stuff well you know when you've got a pop during the video and why is he does for this song which is called disaster if what we're after\nWe got to keep off and it you know you've got something go and he says the third album from Death Valley girl just called darkness rains and that's our pay ins at who's rain down on a Bonnie bloom garden leads is banned along with guitarists Larry ...\nBig cracks through I mean it just really yeah you can't help but not a yeah attention to this I mean they ... themselves as health ...\nReally via this song there's like a horns some horns kicking a little later in it and it gets to me it's kind of like\nThe stones excelling me these you see a ... hour\nAggression attitude romanticizing yeah it is men if not for a there is light years in right now we're\nAtmosphere moments on the album too but it's still got that medicine in it but they play it for all his work it's not a joke not met with a wink but it's also fun at the same time they really have some spirit and so this\nOne's called one less thing before I die [noise]\n\n\n\nI Love ... you're going to be a rock band you're gonna throw down with some power out early and they do All right now we're we're going\nAll right so Kate another threat I guess the ... the jazz many

little bit this is ...\nWell if the ... called crime zone and this is a song called another kind of right\n\n\nFeels like I was transported back in time so you oh yeah yeah absolutely I mean there's a combination sort of the\nSixties Wayne Shorter Herbie Hancock kind of thing but she also really draws heavily on the seventies pop fusion so jazz stuff has the crusaders and Bob James and Freddie Hubbard consultant we actually have very I mean\nWhat really makes you stand up for me though is when she switches from the acoustic over to the fender roads the electric piano which has that such a Seventy sound again that's on the crusaders Bob James kind of thing and on this album she really goes\nThat was really cool and you got another one from a ... that's ... yeah yeah let's let's focus when she plays offender roads and gets into that sort of pop sold groove that stunk groove a little bit uh this is called it's actually called groovy but that's ... that you do not oh a groovy ...

years of Brett Kavanaugh yesterday a bar fight from Nineteen eighty five and grabbed headlines\nDemocrats are looking for evidence Kavanaugh's drinking caused him to lose control Republicans argue start to focus is designed to blind the judge not be a wetter were sexual assault allegations corroborated will have the latest right after the news\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Laurie London Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell says the Senate will vote by the end of the week on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court\nTo further the investigation and to interview anybody they think is necessary now know that mark judge a classmate of\nBrett Kavanaugh will has already spoken to FBI investigators and Deborah Ramirez that is the second accuser of judge Kevin I hate 'em ... investigators but now because the only have one week obviously does limit the scope of the house are the investigation can really get it she liked but\nUm now that the the White House is authorizing\nAllow FBI investigators to investigate whenever they think is necessary\nAnd presumably there are a lot of investigators working on this given the task that they have in the amount of time available do we have any idea how many agents had been assigned to conduct interviews\nAnd making a false statement I'm a you know I think if it comes down to it and you know the Republican argument as well he probably could have been more specific about this maybe he could have disclosed a little bit more\nUh that's probably not going to be enough to to a ... and his nomination at the same time the evidence is building that he hasn't exactly been a terribly forthcoming there was a New York times article just last week\nUm that basically said straight up that some of his answers were misleading [noise] um I don't think that you can look at the totality of what he said and say that he has been completely up front about everything he's been asked about oftentimes you see\nThe political operative and him kind of massaging his answers to some degree and so uh that's really the big question here is how far is too far when it comes to that massaging\nKmart tail of the hill your your sense of uh how how this might well lead best when you know if there's if there's no direct cooperation of the alleged sexual assault or of the incident with ms Ramirez where he's alleged group exposed himself immediately in front of her if that\nIf there is a new crop ration of that what what do you think we're left with then with the decision making process\nI think as far as the decision making we come down to five senators three Republicans and two very vulnerable red state Democrats\nWho are going to be the deciding vote and I saw Senator Jeff flake was up in New Hampshire yesterday talking again both out you have an allegation and he basically said that if there's no new information that comes out there's nothing that there's no one that corroborate the story and there aren't any as an actual truth\nTo these allegations that he insinuate that he would be comfortable voting for judge Kavanaugh so I think like you said if there aren't operations story it is hard to see a way that the Republican I'm\nDon't end up those two Republicans don't end up voting than for judge Kavanaugh and I think what's interesting too is that at\nAll like Aaron was saying these small\nIt's no details that they kind of now to this narrative of cabinet or being a party guy and it's interesting that this narrative has a\nCake ... legs on both sides that Republicans are still arguing that he was um you know a a strong student and that he was academically so it's not as much as the party guy you know during his testimony he admitted it needed to\nSome of the the partying and drinking beer and um I think that's why we're seeing because Republicans are holding on to the idea that he was a more academically focused\nStudent than this party guy that they can hold on to some more of these votes um but as far as when the actual vote happens if we don't see any major\nUm any major corroboration or major developments from this FBI investigation or anything before the um that will likely happen ... wraps up on friday\nAnd I think it will be hard to see a scenario where NASA public and skills are now and that it will effectively then block the judges nomination\nKate before I let you go um could you update us on where things stand about the letter that was written by professor Ford\nA that was that you gave to her Congress member\nIt was then passed on to Senator Feinstein the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee yesterday Senator Feinstein um put out a statement about the timeline of this\nI'm very strongly denying that she or anyone in her office leaked that letter to members of the news media to them pursue ms Ford\nOr in in which ultimately ended up her identity being revealed where where do things stand with the Senate following up on what happened there\nUm and he's quite right to say that\nUm some of the studies that are on the other outcome\nAre not as strong and not as clear in terms of what we're measuring so to expand the notion of what of what we're looking at to to discuss the outcomes we seek is a great idea now that said um\nThat's not how the arguments being discussed in the press or in the public right now there are critics of the SAT and the ACT there's\nA lot of public opinion and and and maybe you might call a criticisms or biased or concerns about biases of the test and these may indeed be miss and Dr pencils ... written about those Mets\nBut ... but these are concerns as I as I read the\nThe public and the commentary about this there is still open concern in the court of public opinion I guess I Would say as to whether the tests are productive uh in many cases that's settled but the idea of studying it for a year to to look at how it performs in the system\nUh I agree with Dr council to expand the study of what else we're looking for and who else we're looking for in terms of representation in the student body makes a really good sense\nYes is in your view the standardized test\nI'm an effective check on the significance of his students grade point average me if you got a student who\nComes out with the high GPA of high school and and you know they they've got low score on one of these standardized test is that a red flag that you know perhaps that the the high grades are not indicative of actual a knowledge\nIt can be Larry but you know and that's the reason of one of the strongest arguments for the exams is that there are a bit of a level playing field or on them for the students and you can\nGet a sense of what they know can do and how you might be able to predict the success that yeah and there is a there is a great deal of great inflation out there so it helps to separate it but it's not the only way that you can look at that\nYou can look at the strength of the curriculum the success of students from that school\nOr at your institution and things like that so there are a variety of ways to do that\nAnd what are the ways if you got a student who just is not a great test taker because you are of course measuring knowledge that can be conveyed you process or the students come back with it within a fixed period of time so speed is a big\nFactor here um but that doesn't necessarily tell you the full range of knowledge or um the intellectual horse power of the student is because it's time tested so is there a way of of getting around that to to you know getting a better sense from from testing\nYes at a specific specifically there are there are extended time in our times exams for that particular purpose but to extend the conversation there's also the notion of\nUm of of whether you are determining the\nAcademic potential of a student\nWho may have lower test scores because their their academic opportunities we're uh we're less there might not be advanced courses in the school there might not be a history of of of college experience in in the students a family and so one must understand the context in which\nUm the the uh the context of the educational opportunity of any individual student and good admission policies and practices take note that context into consideration\nTo um to you know sort of just how they're looking at test scores and the other factors\nThat how how do you make that determination so you've got let's say you have a student to uh you see that there's this this knowledge gap via the test\nHow do you know whether this is like a remedial gap that that the students just going to need all kinds of help versus someone who's had this this environment that just lack enrichment that some kids get\nYou put him in you know us the or some other a high level school and they're just boy going to take off and thrive in that gap is going to close quickly how do you tell that\nWell a lot of times you look at and this is how you interrogate the context so\nSo if a student is in a school that um does not send many individuals on to college but A M M maybe has depressed grade point average is because it doesn't have the the advanced ratings that you get when you\nTake an advanced course but yet has succeeded in that school in an environment where um that opportunity is less um and then is applying to college\nHas scored perhaps modestly well um you get a sense that this is a student who has some of those factors that Dr counsel was discussing the resilience regret the determination\nUm the mental capacity or if given that opportunity and then and then you can make that adjustment and the admission process take that student and hopefully provide the support that student needs\nGentlemen I Want to thank you very much for talking with us about the University of California's announce study into the effectiveness at the uh using the SATs and ACT test\nTo determine success in college that Jerry Lewis Ito University of Southern California professor of research also associate dean and executive director of that the center for enrollment research policy in practice\nI might thanks to Nathan ...

beginning December\nA viewer's the black mirror will be asked to participate in shaping the narrative of one of the episodes Netflix planning you choose your own adventure style episode for the fifth season of the psi phi series Lucas job Bloomberg broke the story\nOr were you joins us to talk about what Netflix is thinking look as thank you for being with us\nIn February so this is a show that you know tax is very central to the side fi theme of this series you think that's part of the reason why Netflix is choosing this approach for black mirror\nI'd say it's one of the two primary reason as you say ah that the impact the technologies hat on society is something that runs through almost every major episode of black mirror you know whether it's one where you have people walking around\nOr not really an which has hundreds and hundreds of show where they get they get there at the narrative I think there should be a great experiment\nAll right so would you watch all of the potential endings\n[laughter] actually I think I Would\nAll right David I appreciate it very much yet to me that's sort of emotionally I don't know I feel that would that emotionally pulled the rug out from under\nThe conclusion I get from the episode by having because then again it reminds me of the artifice of the construction of the series but I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts eight six six eight nine three K PCC or the air talk page K PCC dot org Ryan in Long Beach what do you think\nUh you know I actually I work for a company that's a video game studio in our our CEO is like a legendary video game developer his name's David or on video games and know him and we converted his company into a company that does interactive stuff because\nWe found that people are hungry for\nContent that they feel a part of so we do we know do instead of traditional video games location based\nA feature link 'em or shorter longer experiences where the audience is actually not only choosing what happens at each stage but they're also characters in the story and ... and we got into this because we saw a movie ticket sales going down but sales for things like ...\nGoing up not just here in North America but especially in Asia so we're finding direct evidence that people are done being passive viewers and instead want to be involved in it give when their phone into the experience\nRight and when you say on location is disliked the escape room experience where those participating actually go to physically go to a particular place yeah\nAbsolutely and people you know the idea is they do the same thing they would do if they were going to be they might go to dinner first or after they go with a group of friends or they can go with strangers either way but it's like an event that the thing that they go do\nAll right Ryan I appreciate you sharing that experience those who aren't familiar with escape rooms it's a it's a social activity you typically grow go with a group of friends or co workers and you go to this a location where you're put into a room and you have to through a series of clues figure out how to move on to the next room and ultimately out\nOf of the escape project so someplace that use it as team building other times it's around a a birthday party or something like that Jonathan in West Hollywood ... what do you think of what Netflix is doing here with black mirror\nWell I I think there's a third of their own version\nOf the uh force wall that I'm ... and you know put up that allows writers to eat meat to ... watch anything you either such wide that commitment or you know that's not me and I think uh\nWhat do you start asking a interaction with the audience that breaks a forceful and eat it it\nI think over time or this is going to get tired of it because they're they're the decisions aren't being made for them and there's no ... to ... yeah\nI think in the golden age of TV when there were no behind the scenes TV shows or want to know a added a savings on DVDs that you could see what the actors and everything\nI say the stars the writers directors and these TV shows will all bigger than life much bigger than they are now\nJonathan I really appreciate your your a sense of this ah someone works in television I appreciate it Lucas Shaw of Bloomberg are your thoughts on an Jonathan's reservations\nI understand that but I also think that that some of it is just generational where you know have a lot of kids were raised on video games and raised with mobile phones and for whom the head of the fourth wall\nIf not that important big crave a certain amount of accessibility to the stars they ... the view from the characters that they love as as friends as opposed to icons\nAnd so the opportunity to engage with them in some way shape or form is just logical if you think about some of the most popular forms of entertainment on on YouTube or Snapchat um\nYou know these are these are cases where you're using or some ... to pick what happens next door to advance the story telling your own pace now those are production done generally at a smaller scale than those on Netflix\nOr but it is a sign of of how particular generations prefer to consume their entertainment\n[noise] Monique rides on the air talk page before the final season of Dexter\nThe shows and fans including me an email asking for suggested endings I replied that I'm a professional writer and I'm happy to write an ending if they want to hire me that's Monique riding on the air talk page uh let's talk next with Kyle in Anaheim ... what do you think about this would you\nBe up for customizing your ending for an episode of black mirror\nBlack beard particular if there's some really you know die or black mirror fans I could see\nHow they would like it 'cause I'm a diehard Walking Dead fish I've seen all the episodes many many times and there's some of them that are my favorites my favorite characters if I could go back and say oh if I could go to bed episode and change this thing that would be cool to be a new version of the story\nI could see the appeal black me or I don't watch personally but you know maybe there are diehards like near fans out there\nAll right I'm torpedo rights on the air talk page the show's entire essence is blind citing viewers with the unexpected\nLetting the viewer offensively choose the outcome only further elevates the experience that simply because I Would I Would think if it's the idea of blind siding than you choosing what undermine that not elevated\nAh let's take another call here a Christopher in Hollywood you're on TALK\nYeah I I'm Sorry I direct uh some be are live action are interactive experiences and um I find that that platform tends to be really good or a this\nThe choose your own adventure if you will a program but I worry that in that in narrative that you would have to stop the narratives in order to make that choice and that it actually would just take you out of the story and the less effective of an experience\nYeah Chris ... thanks very much Justin ... hill says this is like a director's cuts for movies I always love to see alternate endings a there is a market for this we go back to Andrew walling scene of a variety of quick closing thought on this in the range of views we've heard from our listeners\nWorried I mean I\nThink there is little reason for any concerns about the traditional TV narrative going away that's always going to have a place at the table I think this is just about another option coming to market that will provide a whole different kind of engagement that you might actually find yourself liking if you give it a try\nAll right gentlemen and want to thank you both so much Andrew ... co editor in chief

might factor\nInto some of the decisions depending on the life of delay steps to come after the news [noise] live\nFrom NPR News in Washington I'm Laurie London President Trump is again answering questions about Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh he spoke to reporters just before deporting the White House or Philadelphia\nI this is a case where you where you sort of one level removed from that where the question is not directly doesn't have to be arbitrator but who gets to decide whether it has to be our retreated and companies in general would rather have that decision being made by the arbitrator rather than by a court\nOn and that's what the Supreme Court is is considering in this case uh that that will be argued tomorrow\nAll right we also have an environmental case a warehouse in your company versus U.S Fish and Wildlife Service this one I have to be heard fairly soon um what is this have to do with the endangered species act\nYeah that was actually argued yet yesterday was yesterday okay\nThere yeah and and so the question is there's the animal called the ... over frog and there's only maybe two hundred of them in existence and they all are limited Mississippi\nAnd um the fish and Wildlife Service says whether endangered and um there's this area in across the border in Louisiana uh that could support them if we made some changes to the land it's privately owned but if we you know and not some trees ... the frog could live here and so the question for the court in this case is\nAh whether that private land in another state could be designated as critical\nHabitat um the court heard arguments yesterday as I said\nI feel like they're they're likely to be split on that it could be one of those where they have to re argue it with a knife justice if they can't come up with with a majority\nBut yeah and that you wonder about taking in environmental case given I'm the only having aids at the justice says and with the ideological split down the middle\nYeah no they they granted a degree to hear this case before they knew the situation what happened in fact before they knew that before most of them knew\nApparently that Justice Kennedy was retiring last year so they didn't have any particular reason to think uh they would be in a sort of situation but yes when you have a case involving the endangered species act it certainly gets your antenna up as a case that could divide the court along ideological lines\nWere talking with Greg stores Supreme Court reporter for Bloomberg News next week Greg I'm the Supreme Court scheduled to hear Neal send versus a ...\nAnd uh this looks like it has to do with custody of someone in the country illegally uh who's released from from criminal custody how does this deal with with homeland security\nYeah so ... so the way this works is if somebody is I'm In ... a state\nCrime and and that could make them susceptible to deportation 'em and they are released from custody and in some cases relief that had been living in the community for years uh the question is whether\nI'm federal immigration officials or a ... then can pick the person up and ah eventually not give them any opportunity to be a relief while the deportation proceedings are are going forward\nUm ... it's sort of touches on the whole debate over sanctuary cities and uh from from the standpoint of the Trump Administration and and federal authorities that concern is that\nA state authorities are releasing somebody from once they finish their their their criminal sentence before federal before ice officials can can't pick them up and ah so it it could be a kind of a hotly contested a ideological fight\nAll right and then ... coming up next month lamps plus versus ... and this this has to do with um arbitration agreements and and class action status is that right or class\nTurn to ... Larry because it's next month I haven't dug in okay yes is it\n... it is another arbitration case in it and it involves um a interpreting kind of boilerplate language and whether that language uh it it it is enough to to\nUm say one way or the other that that arbitration can go forward not just as a as an individual which is what companies prefer but as a class\nAll right we're talking with Greg store of Bloomberg News Greg and want to thank you for being with us and talking about some of these high profile cases with the understanding that the higher profile ones probably will be later in the term thanks very much\nSure thing a grass Dora Bloomberg News also with us University of Texas at Austin law professor Stephen Vladeck CNN Supreme Court analyst is well an editor in chief of the job security blog professor ... thank you for joining us again\nOh thanks for having to be back is always a pleasure\nWhich some of the cases that you think are are most intriguing this term\nWell I mean I think Greg Greg was right just to suggest that you know the the real story of this term hasn't been written yet I mean the court has about\nForty three cases on his docket so far there's good reason\nTo think you know it's going to end up in the seventies by the time we're done\nAnd I think it's going to be the back half of the tour where we see the real potential for blockbusters you know if the cases the court is already set to hear something like this and looking at you already talked about was Greg I'd also threw out there to gamble ... which is about something called the separate sovereign doctrine\nAnd whether the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits the states and the federal government from both prosecutors said person for the same crime historically the Supreme Court said the answer is no um and they're you know the fact that they're taking this case now suggest they might be inclined to revisit that so\nThat's a big case potentially for I think the December citizen of the court\nBut really loud and I think the you know there's a lot to play for the cases that have been granted\nIn in the case of gamble I I don't believe the arguments have been scheduled yet this Pacific gate\nOf of the arguments gamble versus the U. S. does that apply in both directions say for example you have someone\nWho hum is acquitted other states charge but then the federal government decides they want to prosecute you know we we have this uh with the Rodney King beating case for example would this apply to that we're only in the opposite direction\nNo it's both directions so the the separate sovereign doctrine um there's this long stay on the Supreme Court ah hold them\nThat for purposes of criminal prosecution the federal government and the states are separate and exercise different solvent authorities derived from different sources so the federal constitution derives from a different source than say the California Constitution um\nThere's been some real objections to the doctor in recent years Justice Ginsburg especially the kids from Puerto Rico a couple of years ago um had some had some serious concerns about the potential for unfairness in that context um and so I don't know what would happen if the court really does go back\nOn the separate sovereign stopped red is it you would see just two way street we're no longer could um state or local prosecutors are either come in after the federal government has\nTried an individual for a particular crime and you know try to try the same person that sense and vice versa Larry and I think that's you know that's an interesting sort of debate about whether that's that's a rule that makes a lot of sense to be where we are today\nSo dancing you have a liberal Justice Ginsburg who questions um the current interpretation of the amendment does this break down largely along a ideological lines or not\nYou know we'll see I mean I think this is this is the kind of issue is the kind of constitutional issue that included you could put some folks in you know sort of unusual positions I I don't I don't walk into Campbell assuming that the court's going to break down on stripped ideological lines I think\nYou know there's some degree to which we might see a split between the justices who tend to\nBe more formal list in their tradition of the criminal procedure protections in the constitution and those are tend to take a more pragmatic approach but you know Larry lock it of course all depends upon who the nine justices because you know because they're only by the time you gamble as argued which will will be will be no sooner than December um you know we'll have a full bench\nOr advertising with Steve Vladeck professor University of Texas at Austin school of law also with us from the ... Institute senior fellow in constitutional studies Ilya Shapiro who is the editor in chief of the Kato Supreme Court review a professorship hero always a pleasure thank you sir for joining us\nGood to be on and Stephen I actually debated started is ISIS and overturning precedents or last week a at his home turf and UT Austin\nThat's great that's great well glad to bring you back together so you actually coauthored enemy supporting the petition or Mr gamble here how do you see the issues playing out\nI actually haven't found anything to disagree with Steve and his analysis of gamble on anything else the course dynamics this term\nUh and uh the the the internal dynamic at the court I think he put his finger on is right there are a lot of constitutional criminal procedure cases where if the left in the right against the middle are sort of the principled against the pragmatic\nUh the places where Scalia would join with Ginsburg a and on the other side will be Robertson briar those kind of towards the middle I think you might see\nA similar dynamic here the fact that this case is\nA Mr gamble was prosecuted by and acquitted or in in federal court for of a felony possession of a firearm and then he was convicted at the same thing uh in state court seems odd and the the point of our brief was to point out\nThat originally there really wasn't a problem with this these this dual sovereign exception to the double jeopardy clause because\nA federal criminal code was largely are entirely separate from from state criminal law and now the federal code is both larger and much more overlapping of ... of state law and so the same reasons why you wouldn't want the same sovereign prosecuting you twice there's really no difference for being prosecuted for exactly the same\nBehavior uh for for essentially the same ah named crime it's just federal versus state\nYeah just mainly Canada again what they're doing is they're making candidate take our rules and the place or if anything you number or a lot of folks course ah you well know about the pharmaceutical buses where where\nAll sorts of senior citizens getting buses and they they go up into Canada to get cheaper pharmaceutical products are down maybe to Mexico to do the same thing I'm well again that's not going to be as easy it probably won't be as affordable in those places because of these changes\nIs there anything here about a environmental changes as wanting particularly with Mexico and I'm In in any sorts of tightening of environmental regulations\nNot really and you know it shouldn't be much of a surprise I mean there's some industry shouldn't has um shall we say hardly a proven it's a metal when it comes to protecting the environment in fact quite the opposite I don't see them at all being at the negotiating table worrying about that sort of thing\nAnd if they are our demands for higher wages particularly an automobile manufacturing I'm you know what what kind of effect do you see that happening how how big an increase potentially on the product\nI'm not very much because again go back to the idea that that the auto industry today is so much different than it was twenty or Thirty years ago Thirty years ago auto sector was was very labor intensive but um we replace them\nPeople with machines that streak candidate street here in the United states and so you make a labor little bit more expensive um\nYou're not really going to change things all that much the only place you really going to see a difference here is is the ... I'm Sorry the Mexican part of the production process because a lot of the very low in parts of the car production process are done in Mexico's was wages are so low there so what's going to happen in\nThat part of the auto sector a mix the Mexican factors are going to have to\nTow the line if you want some of these new minimum wage rules um that will increase the standard of living for those Mexican workers that are also make those sort of low in parts of your car a little bit more expensive and you will see that little bit in the show on the on the show and care and you'll see that a little bit more when you get into that accident and have to get replaced\nUm oh when you're in your car fixed but again\nThe numbers you're going to see our you know what it is five percent more expensive four percent more expensive to present more expensive\nNot big numbers it's certainly not going to a a a change anything dramatic\nAnd his wife got 'em as Chris ... with us on TALK shows the effect is minimal on Southern California and this is largely the same except for these these three areas as as NAFTA you see other parts of the country where it might have a bigger effect\n[noise] um again not all that much ... even in the jury side right so so we know that Canada has been a fallacious protector of of their dairy industry um this will give\nMore opportunity for American dairy companies say in the mid west ah Wisconsin for example to go up into Canada and sell products\nAnd obviously that's a good thing but remember this is a tiny part\nOf the U.S economy overall hardly a ...\nSomething that's got to move the collective needle on on wages or employment or anything else at and of course remember a Canada is not a very big market so overall is this is really more about if you will a talking points than any actual change in policy\nRight and it sounds like the the wage increase is necessarily that big a deal for Mexicans at the factories that make the parts of the cars\nAnd sure it will be for those few people who are lucky enough to have those jobs there's there's no doubt about it but uh again will move the collective need on the Mexican economy the answer is no it's just not that big of a sector\nGrass is always a pleasure thanks so much for walking us through this new trade agreement between the U.S Mexico and Canada we appreciate it\nAs always learning
