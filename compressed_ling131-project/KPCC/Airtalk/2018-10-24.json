{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Yeah my dad was a huge basketball fan when we were growing up and he always talked about that that he was there at that game you know there's a debate\nCeltics Lakers rivalry in the eighties and since then and he'd always say you know we started that chant when when we knew the Celtics were going to lose to the Sixers and go on to play the Lakers and\nYou know we we all kind of thought well that's highly unlikely but you know he talked about too much that it kinda gets ingrained in your brain\nSocial who's one of these things where you talk about it so much that you start to believe it or did you really start that she had was no one else saying those three words B. L. A.\n[noise] well we really did start the chant we were expecting the Celtics to win that game and we didn't we were falling behind in the fourth quarter and the Celtics lost and uh we figured myself and my two seats makes friends uh we had season tickets for many years\nUh it would be better for the Sixers to be that way if we could I think it was a\nIt was a show of respect for us for the Sixers\nBut it also has a show of disrespect to the Lakers I mean you're you're encouraging the team that just beat your team to beat the Knicks team I mean it was it was just a hatred of of the Lakers in Los Angeles of everything all I\nKnow there was a tremendous rivalry are back in the eighties three cities were very passionate about basketball in my opinion Los Angeles or Philadelphia and the Celtics and uh\nThe Boston Garden a was a place where the passion was a much greater I think than it is today there were no kiss cam\n... there were no T shirts being rocketed in the stands a before the game started people just stood and cheered I guess veto way worked out but I think it's been appropriate it to be a a chance against any LA team\n... let's talk about that because as you wrote to boost your started at a specific game Celtics and yelling to the Philadelphia Seventy Sixers to go on to beat LA but after that how common that this phrase become\nYeah you really see it everywhere I mean I wrote my story um when the Dodgers were in the world series against the Astros and I love it there and go and I was on the bus and I thought the LA on mark hey but you know I think my dad had patented is somehow\nYou know T shirts you see it on mug everywhere it it really proliferated than than and especially I think recently when LA teams have have really dominated and it's going to be really interesting I think ah to see how the Lakers did hear ah with with Brian James and see if that chant friends even further\nSo Joel as the inventor of beat LA why do you think this cheer went on to become so much more widespread do you think there's anything to the fact that Los Angeles maybe around the country maybe specifically in Boston is seen as a as a superficial flashy kind of place\nWell I think that's one of the reasons ah we came up with a chance in that ah the Boston Garden was a big old barn no air conditioning\nOr no cheerleaders are no Hollywood and uh the Lakers at the time with Jerry Buss and ah and pat Riley we're a very fancy a Hollywood type team and the Celtics weren't so uh\nWe'll Hollywood's down the street from the Lakers play we have to give US Customs slept with that\nI have to I just jump in here and say you know what what my dad was saying earlier about T shirt Ken and that that's probably the second thing we in our house growing up after you know we started LA just my dad and his friends really hated just kind of how\nShowy basketball became with T shirt and in in the cheerleaders and the dancers in you know some people will argue that the Lakers really started that Lakers were the first team that had dancers um the Lakers are all day or so you know I think I think it makes sense that just showing it is something that\nThat people had a problem with the kind of you know Hollywood and ... of it I'm of the Lakers and and maybe even a ballet team\nNow a lotta you tried to do your journalistic diligence to fact check your father's story my dad has told me so many stories I I don't believe a quarter of the things you said what did you end up finding when you actually went full on journalists with your dad story\nMost people think that she did start at that game that he was at um you know there's a great ESPN documentary on on the Lakers Celtics rivalry and they have a clip from that game and and the beat LA um chance and announcers I think say a kind of coming from\nThe top of the arena or the or the rafters huh yeah yeah exactly I asked him to find the ticket for the game um but unfortunately many decades ago you didn't have them but you know he and his friend had shared season ticket and so it makes sense that they would have been at the playoff game\nI didn't know what I could I ask his friends were at the or one of his friends who are at the game with them on one of us had very badly passed away um but they say you know what I'm sure I think we started to\nJoel ah we only have your word to go on here I mean are you\nAbsolutely sure that you can take credit for the beat LA chant\nI can say a myself and my two seat mates when it from this now deceased so uh we did it and uh I'm Glad people appropriated it uh we never made a penny off and I think I think it's fun\nAre now when it comes to this World Series or are you guys both rooting for the red Sox to beat LA certainly\nCertainly I Am and uh I think they're going to win it in six that's the way I think it's going to go ... what about you\nI I'm definitely rings and the red Sox I used to live in LA for six years and I will say the Dodgers are probably my number two teams but when it comes down to the Dodgers wrist Red Sox you know there's nothing like her hometown team\nThat's lead reporter Atlanta Samuels in her father jolt talking to us about the origins the beat LA Chad thanks to both of you for coming on to take to thanks\nFor having it's\nAlright and finally all across LA Dodger fans gathered at their local watering holes to watch game one of the world series ... was at the greyhound in highland park [noise]\nWhen she was there she ran into super fan Jason compost who was watching

New York here said James O'Neill NYPD Commissioner speaking to reporters live\nReporter asking question a little bit difficult to hear hopefully we'll\nJust say something broad because at a time when there's a lot of hatred and division that does not make sense to exacerbate\nLet's just say this to all public officials of all\nI think that might have been mayor de Blasio actually a next we hear a governor Andrew Cuomo [noise]\nWe at this time\nDo not have other credible and specific threats against what patients in New York City\nI Want to let all New Yorkers no you can go about your daily routine knowing the NYPD and all these other agencies are here to protect you [noise]\nIt's important to note that this is ongoing investigation as we have more information we will provide but I emphasize there is no specific threat against any other location the city at\nThat that man why de de and all of our partners have reinforced\nAre very clear visible presence at key media locations around New York city and other important location so you will see a lot more police presence that should be reassuring all New Yorkers\nMean you send something to the Clintons house it doesn't go to their houses goes to a facility while away where everything is screened and that's become standard practice with many of these high profile\nIndividuals are also with us is William Bratton is\nDirector of the national consortium for the study of terrorism and responses to terrorism known it starts at the University of Maryland ... served as director of practitioner education is an instructor at West point's combating Terrorism Center\nThank you sir for being with us we appreciate it\nWell thank you for having give us a sense of how investigators the FBI of course at this point is attempting to determine the source of the mailings\nSure so I mean as we speak to the improvised explosive devices that have been found her on their way or have already arrived at an FBI facility where a very senior and experienced bomb technicians from the FBI will break down those IDs and document what they find a for both investigative end for evidence Jerry purposes\nA similarly the packaging that the bombs were either shipped in or delivered in by hand will be similarly examined for both evidence and investigative leads and the investigation will will go very quickly from there\nThe fact that these um packages with the explosive devices have been received within about a twenty four hour period does that would that lead you to believe that we're not into the into any potential copycat phase yet\nI think that's a fair assessment if it takes time to um\nBoth obtain a precursor chemicals required to make improvised explosive devices whether those are more mundane a sources of explosives or more rare and exotic sources of explosives but it still takes some time and effort\nUm unless you happen to have these things on hand uh but the the nature of the part of the nature of the that\nAre targets in this instance suggest that this was um one one plan or plots conducted either by an individual or group and of course we don't know uh I don't I don't have any insight into that nor the um the real motivation\nOf the of the attacker or the the the plot er despite what the targets might suggest to us and I would just point people to an example for two thousand and ten a warrant individual sent 'em or\nWhat looked to be a an explosive device to a President Obama\nTo frame or husband not because of any ideological motivation um and so we really have to let this play out ah to understand that the true motive of the potential or the perpetrators\nNow fortunately none of these devices has exploded a typically these kinds of devices are are they made to to detonate upon the opening of the package or how did these these ... usually work\nOr it can be any number of ways there can be a timer associated with with the bombs so that once it has set a the bomb go off when that time or does it to go off a there can be remote detonation involving something like a cell phone or or some sort of\nA digital transmission so that they the the person conduct in the attack can control the exact moment of the attack 'em or the or the detonation\nOr they could also be a package is meant to look like explosives or that that have many of the components of explosives\nOr that have white powder to to\nCreate the president or the the um the appearance of savior anthrax but that ... that that er nurse and we're really only intended ah to have that psychological shock value as opposed to the actual explosive I'm sort of a damage\nAnd so again we have to see uh what what the nature of these explosives are this is exactly what the bomb technicians will be determining\nFor all of these are very small less than one percent\nAnd there's a lot of uncertainty and all of those estimates the fact is that in the winter a week at\nLess than ten hours of light of sunlight and that doesn't change were up for much more than ten hours so when if we shift the clocks or doesn't change how much sunlight we get it just changes when we get it and so the studies that have looked at energy use of found that while\nGoing on longer daylight saving time does result in less energy use in the evening it results in more energy hard it was just about offset\nA Sean right I Am curious about the safety issues here because\nI'm and I'm going to be kind of crude with the hours that I use just for the sake of conversation but so theoretically in the winter if we've run permanent daylight saving you'd have sunset let's say around six o'clock in Southern California instead of around five o'clock\nThat would mean if you know in in um the peak of winter you'd have\nTen hours of daylight so we wouldn't get light till around eight o'clock in the morning are you concerned about the potential if kids are going to school in the dark people driving to work in the dark a high percentage of people would beyond the move before the sun comes up\nSo there is some uncertainty there I'm a obviously depending on where where the legislature would decide to uh to to to put the clocks\nUm in terms of the a shift in periods of darkness um uh but there is clear evidence um in terms of healthcare related negative effects are regarding\nThe shift that takes place um I there is increasing on the job injuries are there's an increase in a deadly vehicle accidents from the shift so you're talking about driving in the dark\nBut we already have evidence that there are\nA significant increase uh\nIs in a deadly vehicle accidents on the Monday after the spring forward a additionally there's an increase in\nStroke risk or in the two days following a spring forward so I'm while there is some uncertainty if there is ... ... depending on what happens if this passes and the legislature a\nSet they specific time there is certainty that the effect of spring forward has negative health effects fluoride\nOh gee in Newport Beach I stole your thunder I'm Sorry she called in and wanted to make the same point about kids going to school in the winter morning in the dark gee I'm Sorry I just saw that Robert in harbor city or in LA um what do you think about the potential is going to year round daylight saving time\nWell I think we should actually go to you Alan standards on ... so that was scientifically the son of a little ... of\n'em and then like a in Europe specifically job and I know for what they lose any daylight savings time change what they do is I was\nSo we could simply says businesses have different hours you know it was just it just changed the time to match you know what's the optimum time or energy\nThat's an interesting idea so huge shift the work time instead of the clock\nI'm because yeah I think I think the challenge with Californians accepting permanent standard time is that in the summer months it would be getting dark at say seven o'clock at night instead of eight o'clock at night and I think you know many Californians look forward to the later sunset\nSo there's that additional time after work uh the people were able to enjoy Severin Borenstein your your thoughts about Roberts proposal of changing work hours instead of the clock itself\nWell actually Robert proposal Roberts you highlights exactly what I think the problem would be if we went off the current system and that is people will adapt to the fact that it gets wide at different times right now we have sort of a society wide agreement that we do that adaptation\nBy everybody on the same day changing their clocks what would happen instead is for instance schools would have winter hours and summer hours or fall and spring ours\nWhereas the daycare you take your kids to would also shifts but at a different time and buy a difference a male yeah your work hours would shift but a different time and a different them at a different point in the calendar\nAnd instead of us all doing a coordinated shift to adapt to these shorter days in the winter which are not going to change of course but the jokes that the earth instead of all adapting in a coordinated way we were the depth in uncoordinated and for people taking their kids to school and the kids to childcare\nAnd going to work I think that would be a massive headache\nOr a health effects it is true that the studies have shown that right after this spring forward we see a heart attacks and other health effects that are negative some of them have shown that actually we see positive effects and the ball back and the net effect when you met those two out I think are very uncertain\nAlright I Need to conclude with you there that Severin Borenstein director of using Berkeley's Haas school of business Energy Institute let me bring back Sean Roy LA county Medical Association president elect a final word sir on and why you think voters should support prop seven\nWell so this puts it in the hands of the legislature and just it just as you know I'm never made some very valid points um eight\nI think part of this is a cultural issue does so I grew up in Arizona\nAnd um you know to when I first moved out of Arizona to the east coast it was daylight savings time it was weird and dealing\nWith time that ... that caused a lifestyle change that was unorthodox to me and so um I I think that um as a group in California I'm\nA you know over the long term uh if people adapt to a whatever pattern is whatever time as it is adapted um\nBut the stress caused by that spring forward as what's most concerning to me\n[noise] gentleman and want to thank you both very much that Dr Xiang Roy who's the LA county Medical Association president elect\nA and

measures scene which is a tax on gross receipts for\nThe larger companies in San Francisco Kevin Bacon in San Francisco chronicle uh how did this tax measure uh get on the ballot with just a simple majority\nWell it it can on a with a simple majority but there's a there are fears that there will be legal challenges under prop Thirteen of the state law that says you need two thirds for something like this\nAh so the feeling is if it passes it'll get tangled up and some legal challenges so the proponents of really shooting for two thirds if they can get it\nRight or Jennifer ... you want to come in and comment when I ... made the point that homelessness has become more of a problem as the city has spent more on addressing the problem\nYeah I mean we had a recession in the meantime we've had a massive housing crisis up and down the west coast I Know Los Angeles is deeply familiar with it\nAnd we've seen thousands of San Franciscans losing their home and becoming homeless\nLook we had a situation where are we and you know currently are budgeted housing Ninety five hundred people um I Do this measure we know that you know it lays out exactly where the money needs to go which is what I'm Kevin mentioned at the beginning um we know that keep mentioning the accountability issue because that's something that pose well but it it it doesn't have\nAny kind of semblance in reality on what we know is right now is is that we are spending a lot of money on homelessness we're spending money on homelessness by forcing people to stay homeless or spending tremendous amounts of money and ER costs when people can't get well and they return again and again to the hospital where spending a lot of money cleaning up\nOur streets when we have four thousand people who are living without sewage without access to water and so\nThe situation means that [noise]\nYou know if we don't invest and put people into housing\nThen we're not going to move the needle on this we have you know we're going to continue having a situation where while we're able to house in our current system on turnover units about fifty people a week we're going to continue having a hundred people become homeless um due to the real is one elation that's happening so we have to invest\nIn and get really I'm ahead of this issue or we're not going to move the dial and it what big bold plan to do that\nWhat what recourse does the public has a let's say that this passes and the money that's raised\nI'm using effectively being used that you're not seeing the thousands of units constructed or rehabilitated for residency you're not seeing the number of people who are getting the the case contact with workers on a regular basis of what recourse does the public have it's if it doesn't appear the money's being well spent\nYeah so uh the the way that the measure works is that it goes into\nA specific fund or they had an oversight committee that um that basically is um you know it's required to have all the information be public and\nI'm In terms of how the spending and then it goes through the regular budgetary process where it goes through the department's into the board of supervisors and\nI'm the mayor um is um is able to approve or reject on there's plenty of public hearings and the budget process in ways for people to weigh in on but you know we it it builds on our current system of accountability on some of this money would go out to nonprofits on other of it goes through the city systems\nOn all of that has really intense level of scrutiny right in his Asians have\nTo get an independent audit the city comes in and look through the case files and see whether they're meeting a contractual obligations the funds are given out in the competitive matter so\nAll right ... just my daughter I'm Sorry to interrupt there but I'm short on time so your your response to that are about the degree of oversight with the funds if this passes\nIt we it really has over ... no no I'm asking Jess\nYeah thanks for for the appreciate it um you know our own merit let them read at her statement in opposition says that there is no reforms are accountability that are tested\nAnd that's what most of her you know the proponents of thoughts for months\nA well pushing this measure forward that this was meant so walking current funding levels it's not meant to take away um any thing that we spent currently on a budget um so I think what's most concerning is that it really takes away some of the budget flexibility that we need as a city you know obviously\nWe all agree the homeless in San Francisco the crisis is our number one issue but we also have a lot of other pressing needs that when you consider a budget for including public safety transportation and things like\nThat and I think again the the lack of flexibility that um this measure seeks to walk in you know provide a is concerning and our mayor\nWho is charged with really implemented is a new funding that that was approved a saying that herself so I really trust\nFor what Jennifer's argument is though all this public money is being spent now to mitigate the effects of people being homeless and that you know much of that of that cost could be avoided if the investment is made in housing and supportive services uh your response to that argument\nBut housing versus a national best model and don't shoot to reduce money over time as an investment\nSo again I think our side is for targeted investments to homeless or not for a blank check that doubles the homelessness budget overnight with no on the counter ... um there are alternative proposals that were presented although unfortunately uh rejected here so again um it's not that there isn't a need for an investment we just need smarter Kevin Fagan\nThe chronicle hours this polling\nIt's about fifty percent right now a newer polls are coming out soon uh but the the the public seems to be largely in support of it I mean historically you proposed taxing uh well money to businesses and you know your Joe workers object to hard\nUnless they're people who work for those ... decision are concerned what happened to effect on their paycheck um and I was also curious about the companies themselves would be effective have they been lobbying their employees on this\nI don't know how are their lobbying their employees I I Do know a mark Benny office uh he's got his he he's very\nA proactive I guess progressive in a way he approaches these things and he's he's certainly addressed homelessness here quite a lot over the years and his company is is into it a Jack Dorsey over a Twitter inch square ah he's he's firmly against it\nAh I'd say the debate they've been having public it hasn't been nasty they've just been you know politely debating\n[laughter] pointed baby that's the way to put it I Want to thank you That's Kevin bacon in San Francisco chronicle where he's he's a covering homeless issues for the paper in my thanks to

analysis already being challenged will debated coming up after the news [noise]\nLive from NPR News in Washington on Lakshmi Singh authorities in New York say there appears to be a connection between suspected explosive devices sent a top democratic political figures\nAnd the New York city area and Washington DC NPR's Joel Rose reports New York governor Andrew Cuomo says his office received one of the devices\nThat nearly three and a half million us manufacturing jobs have been lost and then in California a more than five hundred sixty thousand jobs were lost during the same period of time with that I see is founding partner at beacon economics based here in Southern California\n... ... always good to have you with us after looking at this analysis what what's your conclusion\nUh well then you know if you have to step back and you look at at that these numbers\nUm from my perspective or the conclusions drawing this report to our best problematic and candidly it it it largely mistake I'm what I think the true impact of trade with China has been on you know states all ... states may be\nA it'll so many different ways are set to start this conversation I Know when I'm not even sure where again\nWell what can we can we start first with the methodology so the using that that the net trade numbers as a way of determining that make sense to you first of all you\nKnow it doesn't because we know that the trade deficit today is much larger than it was in two thousand two thousand one and the wine is that the trade deficit it has to do with a lack of saving steak chicken or lack of savings\nDriven by our federal government which is reaching all time high in terms of its budget deficit\nBattle that in the course causes us to really consume more was one of the world ... deficit makes these numbers more dramatic that's not anything to do with China that sets a tone but the federal government\nAnd other big problem here is is that there's this presumption that somehow or other ... jobs created in the United states realistically at these parts were made here they made with far fewer workers and the ... with the higher end if you let some of it\nAnd I don't know the into functioning as modeling and how\nDoes it generally gleaming kind of analysis to a concert he sent but I think the biggest problem all ... let's step back and look at the California condor\nAcclaim here is that some of our other we have suffered because of China when right now in California we see wages rising faster than most anyplace else inside the United states and unemployment rates inside California art at record low level at this\nParticular moment in time so regardless of the ... what you might want to call it reality data acts\nOf a say would sign on our economy's doing great workers are doing great households are doing great and this of course which is the exact opposite that somehow rather we are suffering as a result of of this race\nWas quiz someone burqa beacon economics founding partner with us Robert Scott senior economist for ... which did the report um does your response to cross the skepticism about this\nI've heard of these comments before um I frankly I've been making productions\nThat are trying to trade was going to lead to a massive job losses in two thousand before we approved job their entry into the world Trade Organization and a ... study this and then I think eight reports now which are looked at this uh exposed after the fact\nUh and and frankly what's driving this trade deficit which is causing these job losses is not just some theoretical relationship between the savings and investment but in fact a it is\nUnfair trade policies most importantly a lead by currency manipulation by China over a period of fifty years China's stance or roughly four trillion dollars buying up dollar s\nThat made its currency artificially cheap\nActed like a subsidy everything that explores the U.S and attacks on everything that we would export not just China but the rest of the world\nSo a bus for that that subsidy or we would have had much more balanced true and if the trade were more balanced it will generate and support more good jobs for American workers and I think that's the key here to understanding how this has affected me on them\nBut you're bad graces argument was that if if for example those electronic and computer parts were still manufactured in California\nThe prices would be higher laughable would be sold a there'd be greater efficiency so fewer total employees would be making the same number of parts and there wouldn't be the advantage of less expensive parts that are coming from China so does does your model account for all those things\nIt does it's hard to come up with an exact counterfactual which is really starting to come up with\nTheir one of the problems you during this kind of analysis is in fact prices reports would cost more than ... ... well that means that there would be more\nDomestic calling to including more workers involved and making the products so we know we bought this is a product see China there was a fairly cheap due to the currency manipulation but they've been fairly priced we could have competed and uh that that would have generated more jobs here\nUm but I think his ... he he ... in an indirect way supported my conclusion strayed has changed the distribution of employment so what we've got as many fewer good jobs in manufacturing where most of the losses were many more low wage jobs and industries like home healthcare\nAnd retail trade and that's what happened in the economy and the last Twenty years no way to the China trade deficit\nGrass your your response to the types of jobs created here\nYeah that's that's that's simply untrue I mean most of the manufacturing jobs in the United states in the last ... technological change a columnist chapter omelet chapter economists does\nCome up with acting inclusion in an academic sense second thing is\nThe idea that we have tons of bad jobs in the United states and that's that's just not true unemployment rates are very low wages are rising at a at a solid basis once you control for the data really retail jobs aren't up retail jobs are suffering because of the Internet um\nAgain it goes back to the broader conversation which is let's let's take a look around the U.S today and ask yourself is our nation truly suffering we have a three point nine percent national unemployment rate unemployment in Los Angeles in California\nHas never been lower Larry for all for all the complaints here are the reality is if you open your eyes look around us America has never been more prosperous are busier than it is today\nIt's it's really hard for me uh to to take these numbers with any degree of series this do this doesn't forgive China some of the things that has done I mean I uh China does not like\nSarah and the global trade sandbox there restrictions on investment their wholesale theft of American intellectual property rights these are bad things and yes they do have an impact on us\nAll right I Need to interrupt because President Trump is coming out at the White House I'm In a millennia Trump is there with him as well large group of people in the room it appears that uh this another is scheduled\nA dance by the president unclear what he is going to say about the uh explosive devices that had been sent to a number of addresses along the east coast including the CNN facility at Time Warner alright millennia Trump is speaking about the events of today\nIndividuals and organizations we cannot do they know scholarly attacks and I strongly condemn all put to violence\nI'm grateful to the secret service as well as the local and federal law enforcement for all they do on a daily basis to keep us safe and encourage people across the country to to kind of over hate to say [noise]\nI Wonder how come you all to divide has ... on the prominent dissident Jason has meeting taxing the opioid crisis and more importantly to look ahead of the work still to be that\n[noise] um a lot of your Trump first lady addressing an audience at an event that had been scheduled to talk about a or the opioid crisis and how the administration is attempting to deal with that\nAnd we just heard her comments denouncing the mailing of 'em and delivery of explosive devices\nTo CNN's New York city newsroom and offices in the time Warner center also we heard earlier today that are white um\nPowder of some kind within an envelope that was included in that package with an explosive device that arrived at CNN\nThere was also a package within the parent explosive device which was intercepted at a male facility which handles mail that is addressed to bill and Hillary Clinton's home and chapel quandary York\nAlso a reports of a package addressed to the Obamas household again these all intercepted away from the actual resonances I'm and I'm there have been others as well\nLike yesterday morning or at George Soros the billionaire a supporter of of liberal causes and candidates\nAre one of the members of his staff apparently received a package actually brought it inside the gates from the mail drop a fortunately had did not detonate but authorities were called after that appeared to be some sort of a of an explosive device as well\nSo uh that is where we stand the FBI is conducting investigations that his laboratory to try and determine\nA well trained and skilled in the department to the point of\nWhere criminologist and the department are forced to go get their own training on their own dime and I think this is shameful a needs\nUm attention by the leader of the department of justice and finally we've got a special agents doing things like a a going out investigating ah I'm\nIn the you know fought in the uh um cannon ball a business as opposed to going out and chasing down drug traffickers chasing down human traffickers and as a result\nUm the level of human trafficking and a drug trafficking the traffic in the traffic in in the state has skyrocketed\nWe're talking with Republican candidate for state attorney general Stephen Bailey the incumbent Democrat happier but Sarah scheduled to join us tomorrow I'm Mr mainly I I I Wonder about the critique you made that the officers become\nToo partisan are you speaking specifically about the lawsuits that the state attorney general officers\nAgainst the Trump Administration are there other examples beyond that\nPrimarily the lawsuits the forty four I actually I think he's trying to intervene in a forty fifth a lawsuit against the federal government um it seems like every time there's a tweet out of Washington it results in a lawsuit\nNow that's a little bit uh um you know going overboard maybe\nBut the fact of the matter is the function of the office ought to be looking at protecting California\nAnd California interests in in my opinion what has happened is the attorney general has conducted himself with the idea that these are going to propel him to his next office\nAnd frankly I'm\n... you know as a judge and a former trial attorney in California\nI'm you know I Know that maybe the last place you want to be\nIs a litigated in court it makes much more sense to sit down and try to negotiate a issues that you have with your adversary and if the federal government um is in fact doing things that\nAre are not in California's interest than the first thing you do\nIs go sit down with them and see if you can't work the problem out\nUm it's not unheard of\nThat federal and state negotiations result in solutions\nCalifornia has had a mileage standards\nThat exceeded the federal mileage standards for almost fifty years and yet um when the federal government proposed changing mileage standards what was the result in California file a lawsuit as opposed to sitting down\nWith the federal government and seeing whether California could to work something out in ... as your new attorney general my focus is going to be let's negotiate talk and solve problems as opposed to running through the courthouse door\nAs the first and only a result\nSteven Bailey Republican candidate for California attorney general my guess would be that tomorrow a hobby or ... is going to argue that the Trump Administration isn't interested in talking with California\nThat it would seem no benefit in that and that the administration is is serving its supporters not being frisked Californians who see the world very differently so what's your response to that argument that\nYou'd really takes a lawsuit an effort to legally put a block in place that the conversations wouldn't produce anything that would help California\nWell I I think this is symptomatic of the fact that um the appointed incumbent has been a politician in Washington for the last twenty six years almost nothing is getting done\nOr whether you're a Republican or Democrat in Washington and what we need is a fresh voice a fresh face who can go\nUm who doesn't go to Washington with the idea that we're going to fight with them every single time I I I'm a firm believer that uh the federal government whether it's controlled by Republicans or Democrats doesn't do everything right\nAh but as a judge I Know\nThat litigation usually results and everybody being unhappy and the way to get the job done is to sit down and negotiate\nAll right let me let me break we'll continue our conversation with Republican candidate for California attorney general Stephen Bailey he was in Eldorado county superior court judge tomorrow the incumbent Democrat ... year Sarah will be with us we'll be back with more conversation right after alive update from heading Leonard
