Congress passed a law letting the big mobile phone companies partner voluntarily with the FCC and FEMA\nTo put emergency messages on your phone and most of the big companies do it took until twenty twelve to get the nationwide system all online why so long to get up and running\nWell I mean it sounds simple but it is complicated systems um you know everybody has to have the same rules it took a while they agree on those rules you know in these wireless systems can miss fire like you know the entire state of Hawaii found out yeah January remember that\nState officials sent out a warning of an impending ballistic missile I'm In January and that generated a lot of fear and anger and it also it turned out to be false\nUm the FCC investigated and concluded it was an art learning drill gone awry\nAnd also state and local authorities sending messages through these wireless wireless carrier systems sometimes to reach too many users so uh this year the FCC pastoral that'll take effect next year that says you can't over shoot the geo targeted area by more than a tenth of a mile\nOr so a national alert system how does that intersect with state or county lurch\nYeah local county and state governments can use this wireless alert system to warn the public of impending danger um in smaller areas I'm also here in California the C. H. P. issues amber alerts we're all familiar with those now these I'll use the same system and they sit down some thirty six thousand alerts over the last six years nationwide\nBut those are all targeting smaller geographic areas and and these are generally you know these lower level hazard alerts an amber alerts they can be blocked from your phone but did these presidential alert and that's what it's called because the president orders it cannot be blocked and that's the main different\nInto okay now this has a whole another layer to it because as announcement of a national alert system I got caught up in a little up President Trump pays a student\nI'm afraid so and and there are a couple of local emergency management officials were kind of Neff that this big national tests that they really needed to do is getting his political push back\nYou know we have a president who's known for his in temperate tweets and anybody who doesn't want those can just avoid Twitter\nBut this alert is showing up as an alert on the home screen of your mobile phone tweet is not a treatment not attack it it's it's an alert um in in CNN ... media correspondent brands filter he put it this way it's just a normal necessary FEMA test of technology we've had since twenty twelve\nBut the wording of the test presidential alert is problematic because only three intent Americans think the president is trustworthy\n... ... everyone's gonna use your head a little bit on that I mean it would come out regardless of who's in the oval yeah or not before we let you go to ... people are ... are going to sound more like an Amber Alert or the emergency alerts screech that we hear on broadcast channels\nThe Amber Alert I'm told and it you know I had a personal helicopter I Would just to hover over the one ten freeway this morning at eleven Eighteen to see all the cars were being back and forth as the all get the alert and about the same time and find a bullet their phones to turn it off\nIf we use every one eleven eight gene if if your phone and everyone else's phone around your freaks out don't freak out as well that drives be safe don't do anything dumb ... takes a lot of that [noise]\n[noise]\nQuite a bit of do it for ... sake to we will be back tomorrow morning at nine you can find us on Twitter at take two to three you can find each winter and it's ramp same address at a Martinez LA that at the Martinez LA are coming up next to talk with Mary ...\nGood morning coming up we have much to talk about including one of the candidates for California treasure these one of the state wide races doesn't get as much attention you'll have a chance to hear from him and his views on what he would bring to the office will also have the very latest\nOr the New York times investigative piece about President Trump and his family's finances we'll talk about how that's being received on Capitol Hill as well so what coming up\nTomorrow I Can't wait a minute as a martyr triple players back you mean Nick Roman same studio getting ready for the Dodgers game one against the Braves I'm very excited it's great that the Dodgers able to\nBecome the division winner in that game on Monday so we'll see how they're pitching matches up to the bridge quite a game last night was not\nBad right now the A's and Yankees today you know what I Would have a Twitter poll asking Dodger fans what's a successful season yeah that'd be nine percent of nine percent of hundreds and hundreds of people that have to win the world series wow okay high standard hope we can pull it off All right good to have you with us Tamara way way I've learned metal coming up next [noise]\n\nSending up at noon it's fresh air with Terry Gross talking today with Tom or a Jenkins about writing and directing her new film\nPrivate life about a couple in their forties trying to have a baby by any means necessary well their shows with story telling and then there's storytelling with a beat joined us November seventeenth for a live taping of snap judgment with host Glynn Washington\nAt the theater at ace hotel in downtown LA tickets are on sale more info at K.

conversation from USC professor of law politics and political science at McCaffrey professor it's good to have you back with us great to be here Larry leisure so\nUh first of all what um what are the gray area here about what people with the largest states can do to try and pass that I'm particularly back at the time that that this transfer occurred to try and shelter from inheritance taxes the assets of an estate\nGreat question I but I think they're even more good questions I agree with you and Scott this is a magnum opus from the New York times and like every other magnum opus that's being written I've written some of them it's unlikely to be well read but I think the but it's tremendous work and and I appreciate the efforts of you and\n[noise] All right Scott Horsley NPR White house reporter and now joining us leap forward treads professor of law focusing on a state tax a lot to University of Florida he vetted the tax documents with the New York times reporters who worked on this extensive investigation professor ... thank you for being with us\nYes or my pleasure ah\nSo I'm going how long did you spend going over all these documents\nWeather reporters mainly when over the documents the reporters for nice enough to live up to New York and I spend about two days with them a and looked at selected documents to talk to them about the investigation it was the most amazing investigation bagels soak the at hundreds of thousands of documents interviewed a lot of people uh it was an interesting all\nWell and and um how common is this the sort of the tax avoidance um process that the the Trump company and and Donald Trump and his siblings are engaged in is that is this a very common practice of wealthy people to avoid taxes\nSo it's it's set up senior uh so it was President Trump's parents that was doing it and it's not that and I I and it's not necessarily tax avoidance the very wealthy people\nUse the tax code in the favorite to reduce their tax burden up a lot of these things are legal to ask like Congress there that just that but but like X. courts\nUm and so some of this I think if you talk to some top ... ... ... and there's a date either well in the United states they'll say oh a lot of this is no big deal it might even on a I think it shot each a lot of Americans how\nHow few people we actually hacked and then those people they used their tactics that much these products and the interesting thing here is though how they the slum family as a group even with the children including President Trump\nSeemed to coordinate and really try to push the boundaries of the tax products to potentially an illegal sort of the transactions and exposes us to do some liability\nOr and and so you think they're dead pretend that potentially again the statute of limitations is his past but this could have a if detectors in the time potentially been criminal\nYes a sort of been especially\nBecause a lot of this deals with the valuation issues that the values they put on all of their top base and I noticed that uh the president's lawyers mentioned that you are experts really dealt with a lot of these issues\nSuch as that many experts in the ... doesn't ... shaped you some liability in this case the Trump families are repeat players to the ... district they type themselves and be happy and yet they understand develop the market and the values\nSo they was intentionally falsely giving ... values of these property\nTo reduce the active duty creek charitable deduction yeah that spot on the IRS\nAh and that would be legal now realize is that your limitations has run on all this\nBut when you commit a when you get false information to the the IRS and they they you know states you can you know be be open about three years uh was thought I mean they can be open to the state they can they can look back at some of the issues\nAround I appreciated leap forward trip professor University of Florida professor of law state tax law you see especially thank you for joining us he worked with the New York times investigative reporting team\nAre that are released yesterday this massive a piece about the finances of the Trump family company\nOr the tax practices of Donald Trump's parents and the Inheritance The Trump and his siblings received coming up\nWe'll talk about President Trump's rally last night his characterization of the allegations by professor Ford of the bay area\nProfessor ... thank you so much for talking with us again we really appreciate you sharing your expertise\nYou ... a professor at Radford University in Virginia criminal justice specialists and former FBI supervisory special agent in Charlottesville, Virginia and in DC uh his forthcoming book the retrieval of liberalism in policing\nComing out next month you're listening to talk on eighty nine point three [noise]\n\nAs you well know with the spate of hurricanes that we've had\nAnd uh other disasters around the world insurance companies have been hammered here in California it's of course been the state of wildfires we've had over recent years the question is\nHow our insurance companies going to be dealing with is are we going to be seeing our rates going up or they're going to be different sorts of formulas that are used by insurers\nTo attempt to model potential coming disasters with us Wall Street journal insurance reporting specialists Nicole Friedman who's just written on this whole thank\nYou for being with us thank you for having me\n[noise] so how what are the ways insurance companies are are trying to get a handle on this\nYeah so insurance companies has long of course studied natural disasters and they have a lot of climatologist since ... focus on getting out the likelihood of various disasters occurring but now the big\nQuestion is due to climate change how is the behavior of natural disasters changing\nAnd insurance companies are used to relying on past data decades of data on hurricanes in fires and tornadoes and various disasters to predict the future will look like but the big worry now is that the future will not look like in the past and so\nInsurance companies are trying to update their models to be more accurate in predicting what might happen in the future\nThat's gotta be hard because even scientific models of the effect of climate change show acceleration in these major events but I'm the ... there there is no consensus on the degree of acceleration is they're\nAbsolutely and there's a lot of different protections for example some scientists say hurricane might be more intense in the future but other studies show that hurricanes might also be less likely to make landfall they might develop in different parts\nOf the ocean and so put that together it's a little hard to know what the likelihood is of more damaging hurricanes on state of Florida\nAnd so I'm sure it's companies are really trying to figure this out and another issue is that climate forecast so very long term and insurance companies often need to know what is the likelihood and the next twelve months of an event occurring\nUh I I also wonder are are insurers able to collaborate after all on studying this or a does that get into um\nYou know I'm anti trust issues that that sort of thing or are ... do they can they not to pool resources on research\nThere is some collaboration on research and there are consultants and companies that make models that they sell these models to insurance\nCompanies and so those people also are\nHard at work at their own research but that insurance companies own kind of algorithms\nAny calculations for how they set prices are proprietary they might be relying on the same research and other companies but they might be still making different decisions about where they want to sell insurance or what prices they want to charge\nAnd then we're in the short term or is this likely what what effects is likely to have on a insurance premiums as they just respond without even having a big advance models\nRight so in the short term we haven't seen a huge effect on insurance prices yet and insurance companies say they still think that says a bit of a longer term project in figuring out the effect of climate change but we're certainly seeing\nIn areas that has been hard hit by disasters whether it's due to hurricanes are wildfires there are certain regions where some insurance companies are pulling back maybe they're less willing to renew insurance policies or they're raising the prices in regions that have already suffered from losses\nNicole thanks so much for sharing with is uh your reporting on this we appreciate it thank you for having me Wall Street journal insurance reporter Nicole Friedman with us on air talk coming

the state's treasure [laughter]\nIs that what we call it All right [laughter] I think you\nJust have\nA very weak if we can picture that sort of a pirate gesture I'm so I'm ... in in the kind of defense you think would likely be offered here what are the challenges for each side\nOh well I agree entirely with ... with what a professor lemons and\nSaid that the uh the government has to prove here not speech not advocacy as such it has to\nProve it certainly not enough or not even necessary for it to prove hatred or Semitism a little bit of it has to show that they went there\nWith the intent to riot possibly to incite arrived but looking at the David the government's affidavits the claim is they just went there to go and you can gauge and violence and groups violence that is labeled a riot\nThat's what the government has to show now the defense might for example argue that you know we went there to protest and then\nOne thing led to another and at that point maybe maybe we might have engaged in violence but that would be for state officials to prosecute us for a while we didn't we didn't travel in interstate commerce with this\nUm and ah they're [noise] the the question is is going to be or whether the government prove the intention of the same way that it has two and a lot of cases\nA lot of times you have to show that burglar for example broke into somebody's home with the intent to commit theft oh you can also find that from circumstantial evidence\nAnd sometimes there may be you know there may be emails between them and they got a search warrant for or somebody might testify or one of them I just as I said yes they told me let's go there and some people up\nAnd if the government has that evidence that absolutely a that is a that would qualify as the crime it'd be a crime of travelling to riot a within ten dry it and there'd be certainly no First Amendment defense spring aging and such as well for planning such right\nAnd ... with what makes this a federal case to travel across state lines or is there even use of of the Internet for alleged conspiratorial purposes does that make it federal jurisdiction\nIt's got to be either one travel ... candy I traveled in interested or for the commerce uses any facilities including mailed to live on radio or television\nBut I hear the government's theory is they actually did travel there they are in California they average and yet they go to Virginia in order to engage in that's the\nUCLA law professor Eugene Volokh with us Loyola Law school professor Laurie Levenson I just want to mention here briefly that in about three and a half minutes um you're going to be getting an alert on your telephone hits a referred to as a presidential alert yet he has a test\nOf the system you might have heard about it there's been a lot of news coverage of it but don't be frightened if you're a phone goes off that's coming up in just a few minutes Eighteen after the hour is when the phone alert is going to go off we're actually going to have an alert\nA similarly couple of minutes after right here on key PCC they're they're both related and they are attached to the emergency alert system but that ...\nNatural alert which you cannot a block on your phone your will be attached to that ask you let an Eighteen\nComing up very very shortly I hear a protest or by like I'm given that there is not a lot of experience in federal prosecutors doing a specific kind of case\nLike can you do you think that this might be kind of a test for how to go after extremist groups that advocate violence\nIt does seem pretty likely you're going to see the same as it used in other situations like for example there are so violent and globalization protest or John order to engage in these so called ... if they come\nAcross state orders in order to engage with prosecutors would be just as likely to force the law I guess\nI'm a prosecutors would show a traveling or you\nJust you win somewhere demonstrate and things\nAnd that's that's a challenge so that may be show show it's sometimes some of these riders leave some food\nCan often make us get professor eleven send\nA mighty prosecution in a case like this lead those who are are bent on or creating violent incidents\nTo find other ways to conspire to do that where they would not leave evidence trails\nWell maybe it seems like this individual were targeted because they're not targeted identify because frankly they've been engaging in this for other occasions that they'd gone ... other protests and then escalated into violence\nMight cashiers and angry with professor felt like that it's important to show the intent it may not just speed that they would play close sloppy and how they handled that most prosecutors to try to find an insider who is actually to get these individuals' even perhaps in part of the planning\nSo that they can share with him let the sources that that evidence that the and I do think that the prosecutors are bringing this case to send a message to other groups we won't tolerate where'd process from First Amendment speech in Dubai\nOr we're talking with Laurie Levenson lawyer you'll know law professor Eugene Volokh like UCLA a professor of law\nOr coming up just a few seconds that presidential alert which if your smartphone is on or you should be hearing it is just a test again not an actual emergency or so just one or two that will be doing our version of that\nComing up in just a couple of minutes Greg rights on the page\nThe fact that no one teeth indictments for the same crime speaks volumes the mast enemies of America given the all clear I'm against white supremacist groups Greg rights but I'm equally against all antifa members there inciting violence um Eugene Volokh quickly you know even when you're talking about extremist like this\nPeople have their own political prism that they see this through and and um what is the federal government has to be wearing

BCC I'm Lorraine ... so that's the last year to have you with us [noise] coming up a little bit later we'll talk about how\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\nThis is a test of the national emergency\nAlert system the system was developed by broadcast and cable operators voluntary cooperation with the federal emergency management agency the\nCan uh with the Governor Brown or who arguably as as applied a break from time to time on spending plans by the by the California legislature with him leaving office Gavin Newsom as the front runner the Democrat for the office your thoughts about\nThe future um expenditures in revenue for California um would you do have concerns about that\nAbsolutely I think that uh the Democratic legislature and if it if Gavin should win I think his book liberty to span would be a lot greater than Jerry Brown so I think Jerry Brown has it would make him look like a\nOr a Ronald Reagan I think compared to Gavin Newsom\nSo of you know I think Governor Brown has has done some things I don't agree with but he also has has been\nHe he's concerned about the same things that I Am as about about the deficit that could occur if we out of a downturn not Betty's the controller ... says that she thinks there's going to be a downturn in a couple of years and if there\nIs then I think the Governor Brown indicated that it would be a deficit of his biggest twenty billion dollars a year\nYou know twenty billion dollars on a budget of a hundred and twenty five billion you're talking about ten to Fifteen Percent and if you can't borrow money which you\nYou're not do you go to either raise taxes are cut expenses and I think an overnight bases the first thing you'd probably have to do is to reduce our expenses\nWhich governor Wilson did that one I was a ... see we got expenses ten percent across the board so that it's a repercussion of of of ah not having a governor in there that's that is a let's say conservative on the physical side\nWe're talking with Greg Conlin Republican candidate for California treasurer as we mentioned earlier he was partner in one of the big five accounting firms he's\nA CPA also has a law degree from the University of San Francisco and he was an appointee by then governor Pete Wilson a to a couple of a state conditions so he does have\nThat in his background John Chong um I think it was fairly early in his term actually stopped uh the payment to state legislators until a a budget was resolved the treasurer of potentially has the ability to do that to the pending court challenge\nYou would you consider such a thing as withholding payment if you felt that the legislature or worst day it entity um what's not doing its job\nI think John did that when he was controller I don't ... their treasury ... and power it's a controller though would it they usually the checks so they would be the ones that would withhold attracts and you know I think if if if that's the rule that I don't see any reason why they shouldn't be shouldn't be able to do it\nI Would also would be another plank of a of of your candidacy here where you think you would make a different side from the hers and the the state teacher pension funds other ways that you think you might have influence on the state spending and how how would you attempt to exercise that\nWell I think is it to other things one at one and it goes hand in hand has improved the credit rating I think our fourth worst credit rate is that is a disgrace and I would do everything I go out and I think the pensions would be the big issue to work hard to improve that\nNow the other issue that the rating agencies are concerned with and I and certainly I Am too is that our tax structure is so skewed\nWhere one percent of the taxpayer pay fifty percent of the personal income taxes other personal income taxes ... represents Seventy percent of the state's income\nSo when you you have one percent of the people paying fifty percent of the taxes and we have a bad and half of that is capital gains income so if we have a better use right and we have a bad year in two thousand twenty\nAnd capital gains disappear I mean we're automatically end of that twenty billion dollar deficit the Jerry Brown was concerned with\nSo you would ah advocate of less ball you of a volatile a tax policy for the state\nYes and it won't be easy we'd have to work together as a team the governor and the big five and the legislature and sit down and figure out a a reasonable solution that's that doesn't to\nPunish anybody on unduly misconduct that would be one thing and the other thing is I predict I Would like to see the governor appoints the treasure and air controller rather than have them all like the ... I Know the the populous would like to have them all liked it because of their independence\nBut on a major corporation with a hundred and twenty five billion a rabbit it was this the CFO the treasure
