{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Of the movies that have been rated which is I think close to thirty thousand right now it's a um I think largely complimentary really self report\nSo so why why are they patting themselves on the actually John 'cause you sound a little uh Africa yes so what would you give the MPAA what rating\nA given it a PG for pretty good maybe maybe an hour for sometimes ridiculous you gotta use for useful or not really I mean I think like a lot of parents I think the MBA when it starts thinking about the way it's going to rate films it has a criteria that penalize as\nLanguage and then sex but not violence I think a lot of parents reverse that completely and the thing that they're most concerned about their kids seen\nOur violence they worry a little bit about sex but language listen I've got teenage boys the music they listen to\nIf we tried to censor the language and their music would be just minutes ... minutes of silence so I'm not really worried about that but the MBA through its rating system is often very kind to violence but very harsh on any kind of swear words that kind of\nJust reflects America doesn't it we don't mind a in films at least a mass murderer I mean just a horrible horrible horrific gun violence but you show a little breast and all of a sudden you got an R rating\nWell it's not even that I mean you can think of a couple of movies that have come out in the last couple of years Billy Elliot\nA movie that every teenage kids should see it's about a boy he wants to be a ballet dancer rated R. because Billie uses a couple of F bomb\nKing's speech there was a great scene in the king's speech where King George has tried to get over a speech impediment so his vocal coaches telling him to say swear words because he's uncomfortable saying that so you say more than one F word you're almost always going to get an automatic are\nSo king's speech gets an R. and movies like taken an debt and blanket violence are PG Thirteen I think that's where a lot of people have problems with the current rate in snow in the report\nThere's also a shift you notice in movies are rated overtime something called ratings creep what's ratings creek so ratings creep\nAs this idea and it's a very important idea that what is rated PG Thirteen today would have been rated are not that long ago and it really does reflect a lot of depictions of gun violence so there was a study early last year by the American Academy of pediatrics\nThat showed that gun violence specifically in PG Thirteen films\nWhat's higher than an R. Rated films not R rated films from ten years ago\nApples to apples are rated films today PG Thirteen rated films today more gun violence in PG Thirteen rated films that an art films\nSome of it is that cartoon violence you'll see and superhero movies but that is ratings grapes that is rate increase the movies I would've gotten rated are not that long ago are now getting PG Thirteen and it's often huge amounts of violence and violence that would have been rated much more harshly a couple of years ago\nJohn do filmmakers still do this I I used to hear this I don't know how true it is but it's so there'd be a movie ... they they make a cut of the movie and then it looked like he was going to get an N. C. Seventeen or something like that and then they would cut it down or cut out certain scene out that would make it in our or maybe a PG Thirteen do does that still happen yeah it's still doesn't sometimes\nFilmmakers will put in scenes to get the NC Seventeen reading that they know they're going to cut basically look over here and leave us alone on these on these other teams all put in something that they know it was totally over the top\nKnowing that that's kind of a sacrificial lamb that they'll cut that scene and get their R rating but sometimes filmmakers will submit a film they are certain that's going to be PG Thirteen and it gets an R rating or they are very fearful it's going to be rated R. and against the PG Thirteen so often they don't really know 'cause the criteria is vague and it's really subjective\nI always felt like a stunt them you know the words ... we've got a very ... movie coming we're going to cut it now but then when the director's cut comes out on DVD then you buy that to get the scene that was missing exactly then you sell it lives right now there are now speaking of violence in movies Halloween number one movie at the box office for the second straight weekend or how well as doing\nIncredibly well I mean it is well over a hundred million dollars to pass a hundred million dollars on friday it's at a hundred and twenty six million dollars after just a week and a half in theaters\nAnd it's you know ... shows no sign of weakening and if you look at this year ... a a quiet place is the night highest grossing movie this year and a hundred and eighty eight million\nAnd it's not just that the movie is doing well it was relatively well reviewed not like get out was a year ago but it's attracting critics it's attracting repeat audiences and it's safe to say that we're going to see more horror movies and the next twelve months then probably we've seen in the past\nThirty six I mean everybody recognizes that this is a phenomenon they're gonna try to clone it we can see a lot of bad movies probably a lot of failed but uh\nYou know there'll be a lot Halloween will not go away anytime soon\nThe time it's perfect it's Halloween or Wednesday or this week and it'll probably still last through next weekend because it's Halloween as a week goes on\nRight and the other issue and I think it's worth noting is that now this is ...\nYou're not an Oscar contender but something's happening that\nHasn't happened with genre movies in a long time and that is that these movies are now competing for Oscars I think a quiet place had the chance to get maybe one or two Oscar nominations maybe a Golden Globe nominations get out obviously one of the original screenplay Oscar a year ago the movies are doing well not just at the box office but also with people like Academy Award voters\nJohn horn is host okay PCs arts entertainment show the frame you can catch it later today on every weekday at three thirty jumping lock my

Jews in American history\nReport of anti Semitic hate crimes have dramatically risen nationally over the past couple of years how did Jewish southern Californians perceived potential hostility we'll talk about it next\nLife from NPR News in Washington I'm Laurie London\nThe man accused of murdering eleven people worshipping in Pittsburgh synagogue over the weekend has been released from the hospital and has arrived at a federal court ahead of a hearing this afternoon Chris Potter of member station W E essay brings us this report from Pittsburgh\nEr and that that kind of empowering of of the those who should be ostracized and the feeling that they can say what's on their mind because uh\nYou know the ... the United states says what's on his mind and and and invokes conspiracy theories with no basis whatsoever I think in power as these guys who should be on the fringes to think that they're much more in the mainstream\nWell and and just to to push back a bit on that um\nIsn't it if people are thinking this way isn't it better\nTo to hear what you know the the um lunatic ratings are hateful words they have a sense of what we're dealing with violence is a different thing but if we're just talking about you know conspiracy theories and we're we're talking about demonizing certain people it\nAnd um you know that the congregants Seventy six year old Mr Weber who that quota I've written coming into our conversation um that's how I take this I\nValue has offered sometimes as an explanation than there was a religious basis in the aside charge which until the second that is a Vatican Council was a significant generator of anti Semitism over the past two millennia\nAh you know the for Jews in the Ukraine who lived in ... when exactly somebody to be jealous about they they were poor and impoverished and yet they were victims of the same kind of bigotry is a very complicated phenomenon I'm not quite I've been studying this for\nMost of my life I don't want to share yeah yeah it's just it's it's it's complicated the people it's I think\nIt's a lot of it has to do with people think feeling feeling their victims of looking at somebody else who could help make the world make sense of the world to them I'm not happy things aren't going by ways their if their fault\nAnd being a victim exonerate you for moral called obligations because you're the victim you're entitled to to write the world and write the world that has been on a fair to you and I think that plays a large part in in a in a Semitism\n[noise] you'll see I appreciate your call a let's talk next with

another ... June ... and\nI think it's ... it's been really important for us to raise them to identify Jersey because this is their heritage this kind of history for crimes and\nAnd I'm\nAn ... that is part of their heritage you know we still today face\nA examples of what I consider benign anti Semitism out of ignorance that it's not about you know saying that Christianity I\nCame before Judaism and I teach my children to correct these accept that nine anti Semitism because it becomes malignant\nOr David your your thoughts on that I mean is is is ignorance anti Semitism\nWell ignorance if it's ... fuels conspiracy theories and if you're looking for conspiracy as to why things are going wrong or who the hidden hand that's making the world the way it is that you don't like\nJews are as good a target as anybody else and historically have been the target of so that feels that it's it's a very complex phenomenon\nI'm I must say just to counter some of what the er the with the caller just said the fact is that I'm most metrics in the United states Jews are doing very well in terms of discrimination in terms of until the past two years in terms of hate crimes in terms of acceptance in terms of socio economic success so\nAh the ... America has been very good to the Jews and this is unfortunate a tragic incident which is kind of a a an exclamation point to say you know things haven't changed completely\nAmerica has been good to the Jews and can you imagine America without its Jewish Americans it's just it's it's unimaginable what this country with how different it would be without well if we're up to Mr ... hours\nOr I David Lehrer community advocate ... president of the nonprofit with us coming up ... the former editor in chief\nOf the Jewish journal you might have seen his op ed in the Los Angeles times yesterday in which he he shared his thoughts on the massacre on Saturday in Pittsburgh he also teaches at that sees the Annenberg School ... will be joining us\nBut um exemption for moral responsibility if you are the victim and um that you always are obligated to conduct yourself on the highest moral level you're capable of\nGeoffrey appreciate your call as always thanks very much Robin ... when you want to tackle onto what Jeffrey just set\n[noise]\nOr you know I I don't want to leave the impression that a Trump is to blame for this but I Do think we have no qualms\nAbout a attacking or or calling out Muslim leaders Islamic leaders Islamic clerics I'm Muslim a\nKings and when\nThey inspire a comment that Semitism when there's when there's terrorists attacks um\nThat they inspire and I think in this case you know our leaders have to be very very cautious about engaging and conspiracy theories because those are the kinds of things that\nYou know um create these these toxic reactions in an unstable people and um they are responsible to some extent\n... Donald Trump said today all of America\nIs in mourning I'm used to say yesterday tweeted this over the mass murder of Jewish Americans at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh we pray for those who perished\nAnd their loved ones in our hearts go out to the brave police officers who sustained serious injuries this evil anti Semitic attack is an assault on humanity it will take all of us working together to extract the poison of anti Semitism from our world we must unite to conquer eight\nThat Donald Trump in his tweets following the attack on the Pittsburgh synagogue Leo ... in West Los

appreciate the call and\nThanks very much I think you know here in in Southern California because they're comparatively rare incidents when it happens the impact is great and you're dancing we haven't

she had stopped in the street in front of a neighbor's house or somewhere and a young man you know blue pastor unhappy with their driving and yell yelled out to where I'm expletive Jew\nAnd she came in and talked about it the next day and you could still see just the astonishment and the you know the hurt the that here in Los Angeles someone would say because you know and and I wonder um\nThat even though it's isolated something like that David can be so pointed to have that experience\nCan be sharing because mercifully they're so unusual and people don't expect them to people for the most part people are civil and and tolerant and uh we accepting of the diversity that surrounds us so when some of this kind of anomalous incident happens people really find the jarring\nYeah Rob how come

giant country to Nineteen hundred incidence an\nActual is sold backseat fell by fifty percent so it it's not that common I think what is more common is if I was a federal building last night for a

I'm a regular user of Twitter for example and when there was a crackdown by Twitter on hate speech\nThere were a number of folks that followed me and who I followed back who disappeared even though I Would have to ... them progressive they were fighting the powers that be they were um\nBlack lives matter activists that for example and others who some I characterize as black identity extremist and have\nBut I didn't think were being that radical extreme but because you had a private third party coming in and saying in the name of a more civil discourse we're going to crack down on what we view as hate speech what you wind up doing oftentimes is empowering\nUm decision makers to crack down on the voices of socially marginalized dissidents socially marginalized to center you know it's going to be hard to draw a line that you can defend Larry between\n... someone like Ben Shapiro who raised a controversy when he came to see a little while ago and Jody Armour Jody Armour seeing things from a more progressive perspective but he's saying things that a certain people find just as offensive as things have been Shapiro says the support and calling ... right to the ...\n... for example to to bow down during the national anthem and some would say hey without disrespecting America and the troops and so that's hate speech and crack down on armor and crack down on anything you have to say so I'm concerned about giving anyone to to to go after anyone on this\nSo when you your ideal if you could make the world is you would ideally like it would that be a Twitter that aside from direct threats against individuals allows us essentially everything a free for all would that be your preferred\nI just don't see where else you're going to be able to draw the line between the kind of trends aggressive speech that you want to protect because it is advocating on behalf of marginalized communities and the kinds of speech that you just find hateful because they don't share your political perspective that's a slippery slope\nI cannot find a stop in space any place you you tell me to stop I'm going to say that's arbitrary that's wacky wall we're back on the slippery slope\nAnd Kelly McBride a pointer your your response to a professor armor\nWell look it's all arbitrary right I mean when you walk into a grocery store or a mall if you start doing something that the owner of that place doesn't light they will ask you to leave it if you go into a public park it's quite different right then you are protected by the first amendment\nAnd these cases you're talking not about\nA public space per se you're talking about a space that is controlled by private citizens and in those private citizens have a responsibility and this is an all or nothing right you don't have to say yes to everything or no to everything you can agree to\nUm monitor this speech and let police now when there is a credible threat\nUm which is what many of the um platforms are doing these days um you can design it so that\nSo that certain ideas are surface the less often because they are morally reprehensible you can't\nForce people in that space to encounter different ideas or you can force them to encounter ideas that are only their own we're talking about the responsibility of the individuals who control these spaces and I know that there's a lot of that right that it's not like one guy like Mark Zuckerberg controlling face but\nThat it is that it as a host of product engineers but there are values behind the environment that they create and when you create an environment with no values at all then you then you get a place where all the white supremacist show up\nWhy but I but professor armor your point is if it was Twitter you wouldn't know be widespread the the reason that gap has become a place to white supremacist because they were locked out of Twitter\nOh absolutely and you had someone um like ice cube perform ended up seats in years ago I asked him\nWhat would happen when you would sing that song F the police come straight from the underground and young brother got bad 'cause I'm brown and not the other color so police think they have the authority to kill the minority that's left the police song from in W. H. when he would say that the police would come out and arrest him\nFor saying those trends aggressive words that are clearly oppositional but they were coming from a place that was offensive to those decision makers and I'm weary about giving any decision makers that kind of authority because they are going to crack down on the marginalized dissidents not just on what we all agree to be hate speech\nBut again you're handles to oranges because the police are the government right they are the ones who are supposed to protect our free speech I'm saying that citizens\nI'm saying it wouldn't be any different even if it was USC cracking down saying we're not going to let ice cubes\nAnd also the government you know one of that\nThat's a private friends growing up they said that I Would have the same problem because you'd be having a chilling effect on dissidents beach oppositional speech coming from a marginalized\nMember of a group but what about you Kelly's point is that there if I'm if I'm following correctly is that there is a social responsibility here and the Twitter or Facebook\nHas that because it you know it's long term corrosive if you are operating a site where all kinds of pernicious attitudes or espouse all the time\nYeah I understand the social responsibility argument I'm married but also in my personal underclass I teach towards one of the things we grapple with I at this point is Mr I\nAsked them if an evil deity approaching said I'm going to give you a great gift is going to make their life much better for much of your society all I ask is a thousand victims that are going to suffer these ... would you take the gift and of course everyone would give me decide I looked askance to me that I could even make such an indecent proposal no we'd never take the gift\nThen I say distinguish back from the automobile that takes forty thousand thirty to forty thousand your lives a year and and we could save all those are just by putting governors on car engine so they couldn't go over twenty or thirty miles an hour but we're not willing to pay that price we as a society\nSpin lives all the time sometimes lost interest like First Amendment or second minutes sometimes very mundane ones are going to grandma's house a little faster on Thanksgiving in our car and do not that we have to make the knowledge that in and make those tough choices\nThat's Jody Armour as the professor of law Kelly McBride at the Poynter Institute jet McCall DePaul University Jeff want to get you back into the conversation I'm your thoughts about the comments you're hearing from both Jodie and Kelly\nWell really great comments and it just shows you know how new once this whole challenge we face is I think one of the things that's worth bringing up here is that these social media sites were basically set up as poor public forums to start with\nAnd then what we had is the operation of a public forum where people came and said a lot of stuff including stuff we didn't like that at a certain point and then I think we started going down and I certainly appreciate professor ... on this\nWe ended up with a point where somebody's got to decide well what gets in there and what's not and that's where I think the social media platforms generally have not been very transparent\nTo let us know on what basis are going to decide who gets stifled and who doesn't and you know what are the issues that they're going to stifle on and I think it is worth noting here that we're concerned today about gab\nWe protect our consumers and are working families\nWhat if any changes would you seek to make we've Covered California and the oversight of the health insurance offered through the exchange\nOnce they leave should do is I'm what I've been trying to do in the legislature expand the Affordable CARE Act to allow or immigrants\nTo pay into the Affordable CARE Act that can pay into it currently there'd be discriminated against for the simple fact that they are undocumented we know that roughly in California close to thirty percent of our immigrant population can pay into the Affordable CARE Act\nWe worked on the legislation got it up to the governor stuff got fined or we were working with the Obama administration to make that happen a and ran through the election that happened\nSo we were we have to withdraw or waiver given the fact that the Trump Administration wanted us to give them the names and information of everybody who was qualified to paying for double cataract not wanting to endanger any of our immigrant communities in California I had to withdraw it but we want to continue to push\nTo allow or immigrant to be able to pay into the Affordable CARE Act we know that they are uh end of the younger are healthier and are working and the more people that we have pay into the system would allow those of us that actually the care now\nTo be able to access to care and be able to manage the increases and our premiums given that we have more people in the\nCity now your proposal would that be revenue neutral with those paying in uh to the exchange for health insurance be covering the full cost of that or would taxpayers be taking any of that on\nNo this is absolutely there they would be able to just like everybody else pay into the exchange with their own money\nOut with the current a policy that we haven't paid some premium a schedule that we have a it would be the exact same thing you'll just allowing people who pay into the system defenses into the system with their own money without any subsidies whatsoever\nSo they wouldn't get any of the subsidies cause they wouldn't be eligible correct\nOkay so they'd they'd have to be able to absorb the full cost themselves\nExactly and what we've seen is left who I Am thirty percent of California immigrant would be able to uh Fort Japan corrupt system\nWhat are you also think about California uh offering a more barebones policies in California there's been a no backing down\nOn on having the full minimum requirements of the AC a when it began do you think that there would be any benefit to having some less expensive\nA smaller size plans\nAbsolutely Peters a benefit to how the smaller size less expensive plans the goal is to cover everybody\nYou know we've done a great job here in California of expanding care um and we have\nA seven to ten percent of folksy California\nAre still uninsured and we see that these folks tend to be folks who have multiple part time jobs\nFolks that are are immigrants and are not able to afford any care or it's so easy to figure out how we address the uniqueness of the population and there was no doubt that ... and the more affordable options for folks\nAre what how again\nGet us to ensure everybody in the state but also get people on the other option a so that they have a level of comfort of heavy he sort of insurance coverage for their them and their family\nAnd senator Lara before I let you go um when it comes to fire insurance any thoughts about that I Know California\nSome of the areas are have been re designated as higher risk fire areas that's affected in some communities availability of of insurance or not as much competition you see a role for the state they're\nAbsolutely you know what I'd done through the legislature this year is to make sure that we protect our homeowners will have been victims of tremendous fires you show them that they don't get dropped from one day to the next in terms of the all the future and\nThat gives us time so that people can we assessed rebuild their lives\nAnd then also give the data to the department of insurance so that we can see where this is happening whatever the trend and how do we avoid people just getting dropped from one day to the max while they're trying to rebuild their lives we were able to get this legislation on this year which gives are homeowners\nIn fire ravaged areas an opportunity to rebuild also we can make sure that we are all the insurance companies accountable\nAnd that they are transparent with us as we work on ... that finally or now in fire prone areas we also have to work with the local governments\nAre to make sure we understand where will they will be home we understand that there's that great eat for for housing but we also have to make sure that we're not necessarily putting people in danger as we continue to build out in these environments sensitive areas\nSenator Lara thank you so much for being with us we appreciate it Richard California senator Ricardo Lara
