S. that's the a very short a federal statute the president used the travel ban case and the Supreme Court\nUpheld it so if the president decides yeah quite apart from the policy question that that he believes the entry of the seven thousand uh migrants this caravan ah should be suspended he can do that I mean there's just no question about it\nNot actually at the border and not actually a having guns but helping with making sure that there are communications a tense medical care of things that may be needed and of course they use for troops for just logistical support as opposed to for arresting people would be permitted\nIf and when reserves have been used for that historically right\nCorrect again and hasn't happened and that often but it has happened in of course if there's a direct insurrection as you pointed out at the beginning you can use them but I don't think anybody thinks that this is any kind of invasion or insurrection\nUh ... what what kind of reception in the courts do you think a challenge to the president's move would receive because um you know obviously the the um orientation of judges can be a factor here\nWell look or they might get injunction is that the lower levels as as the challengers did at the travel ban but I think once it got Supreme Court ah the\nThe president would win the executive authority of the of the president would went out the same way it did it in the I'm a travel ban cases you know something else we have talked about that I Would just point out and I really haven't seen as mentioned in the news is the fact that uh if if state governments\nWant to help 'em the president to stop these aliens from getting across the border um there's actually a provision in federal immigration law\nThat gives the president the authority to uh in essence deputy ties state and local law enforcement officers to to help reform the police powers of of uh immigration officers if\nThere is an end of the language of the statute is an imminent mass influx of aliens or at a land border so you know if Texas decides they want to help and they offer state troopers and others the president will be able to ... them to assess\nWhile on that wouldn't likely happen here in California maybe in taxes that would happen maybe in Arizona I but I certainly can't see a here in California that the state would be willing and I assume there would be under no obligation\nThat is correct is this part of our federalist system and and that there is a\nThere's a health to that but also the you know the numbers in the caravan or you know now they're down I think to three thousand who knows what will happen when they actually get close to the border I assume there'll be a smaller amount a ... at the time and I just don't want to lose sight of the fact that the obviously those three thousand individuals come for different reasons\nBut a lot of them probably merit asylum and we have long held firm to those ideals that would say we should grant asylum those who are apparel if they're returned home\nWhat ... what about the argument though that I've seen that um since most are not requesting asylum in Mexico\nUm that ... you know that undermines the argument that it's really about safety an asylum as opposed to an economic benefit of coming to the U.S over Mexico professor a cramped are your thoughts about that\nI you know I'm sure there's mixed reasons and we don't we don't know exactly what percentage are very interested in economic asylum versus in terms of political asylum um but I don't think there's any kind of exhaustion of remedies\nA requirement that would say that they'd have to go to Mexico or Costa Rica or anyplace else\nAs opposed to the United states that's never been imposed in in Europe or in other countries either we could have a treaty with Mexico about that but obviously that's something perhaps that President Trump should strive for a book but we don't have that\nRight Mr von Spakovsky quick comment on that [noise] well\nIn fact that is the rule in Europe the European Union or as a pact called the Dublin Regulation which requires those seeking asylum in the youth to assert their claim and the first\nWe're always going to need parks were always the answer that's that's an infinite ... so this would never end or I were talking with the Andre Valencia of Los Angeles county business federation Shelley loose of he'll debate you have questions about Los Angeles county measured W\nThe parts of the tax two and a half cents per square foot of him permeable area this you know typically concrete restructure something that keeps the rainwater from being absorbed into the ground and ultimately the water table were at eight six six\nEight nine three key PCC or the air talk page K PCC dot org surely loose do you have a any ideas for let's say a Fifteen hundred square foot home\nUm you know how how much water capture system would cost for which they could get this rebate\nWell I've done it on my home and um I Would probably say I spent about five hundred dollars and a lot of my own sweat putting that in place um it really involves something like\nTurning it down to about from a rooftop so that it goes on to a yard instead of onto a driveway or onto the road it can in my case involves putting a tank in place so that we can use our own water to to what our landscaping when it's not raining so it's really there are inexpensive solutions out there\nAnd we all know that clean water in Los Angeles is forever need\nI own a home in this concrete jungle icy water flowing down my street today on the driest day there was water flowing in the gutter I Know where it's going it's going down a storm drain into a creek it's going to pollute our beaches are very good a flood control were very good at flood control although communities still suffer from flooding when it rains when we get rain in LA we get a lot\nAnd this is another benefit that we can get from allowing water to sink into the ground where it falls instead of accumulating on pavements getting dirty and polluting our rivers and ocean\nI I Want to come back to some of the uh claims that Mr Valencia has made were particularly about the fact that never ends\nAnd is it really necessary for this to be a continuing parcel tax presumably as more of these recapture systems are created the ongoing costs of maintaining would drop over time so why keep it going in perpetuity\nWe need to keep clean water at we need to always find clean water in Los Angeles and a forever taxes here because we need forever solutions to this problem\nAnd as we continue to develop continue to grow we need to maintain these projects so when we put these projects in place at some point you're going to need to clean out a tank or you're going to need to have someone\nCome and clean up the park or maintain the pipes that are in place so a maintenance that a maintenance fund that creates a workforce that can continually keep these systems functioning makes absolute sense it's a protection for these investments\nMarco in Pico Rivera said I'd like to know all the parcel tax would affect my areas it's just more affluent areas\nMarco this was a this is a county wide measures so it would be assessed on every property owner residential or commercial on what the county determines is I'm\nA non permeable and if if or whatever that square footage of the property that's him permeable water can't get through you would pay two and a half cents per square foot of that you permeable\nAmount of your property or where it eight six six eight nine three key BCC if you have questions for our gifts but\nWe're getting here short on time so I Want to give each of you a chance to to wrap up with your comments or the Andre Valencia or Europe you'll do voters to vote no on W\nYes um you know this shouldn't be in front of the voters and the first place a vis measures wrong solution um this winter plan is baseball in accurate calculations and that's the number one reason why we're opposed to it because\nThe county gave us a list of top one hundred a top landowners and the calculation of and purple surface area and the cost of rights and that and we give it to our members and not surprising Ninety five percent of those companies on that list or our members and so we reached out to the mix that hey do give us the engineers run the calculations let us know what you think\nThey all came back stand up the calculations are wrong that they had less or more impersonal surface area on their lights and so we went back to the county\nAnd said hey this is what's going on after weeks in a deliberation um they said hey you know we are we didn't make a mistake and one of the algorithms been helping the calculation of a miserable service and so I was like okay so let's go ahead and get back to record before the board vote on July seventeenth they never did and still to this day they still have it given to set up for missions\nThat uh the advocacy director of the LA county business federation the Andre Valencia they are in opposition to measure W the partial ... president appeal debate why should voters support W\nEvery year billions of gallons of water or wasted flowing off our streets taking pollution and toxins into our rivers onto our beaches costing us money to clean up\nWith measure W we have cleaner water will have more water for Los Angeles and we will have more green space in the communities that need it the most that is baked into measure W and that is what he'll the bay and many many other groups in this broad coalition support\nAll right thank you both for being with us appreciate it November sixth election Los Angeles county voters will decide on measured Wu a being a parcel tax this requires two thirds passage alright\nTwo thirds of county voters would have to support a W for it to go into effect Shelley ...
