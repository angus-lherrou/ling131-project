{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Sure usually you know the Santa Ana winds blow around things like pollen and dust and that's the culprit and those can really set up allergies but that's not necessarily the reason we're sneezing and watering right now is it\n... absolutely and actually the pollen count is at zero so it's not we can't blame the ... and the grasses and weeds this time um but it\nIs that Dr warm weather that increases mold spores increases dust mites add to that the high when\nI'm at that we've recently had fires so those high winds are carrying those mold spores that dust mites all the ash from the fires and those small little particles are what are getting into your nose and the eyes and that's what's trickery this reaction\nSo actually it's ash that's being kicked up and not as I Would normally expect like a tree blooming or something that is so nice to have\nIts not allergy we actually call it non allergic right night us or a visa motor right now so it's those fine particulate matter we called them PM ten\nPm two point five which are basically that their lesson Ted micro leaders are less than two points I made it so they can really easily get into the nose you're not looking at them you don't see them they're invisible but they're getting into your nose they're getting into your eyes and then they trigger that reaction so when you're thinking of the word ... or ...\n... knows ISIS inflammation in the nose or can jump divide us that information of the ... or the eyes so basically you're having\nAn inflammatory reaction to these little irritant particles that are getting that are getting up there\nInteresting so it's not technically even allergies as we know it I Am curious Dr if these wildfires you know a lot of them have been so long ago and we had the holy fire in orange in riverside in August but many of them are over a year old ... how is it possible that Ashton particulates are still causing us these problems well\nIt's they all settled and so when these wins kick up you can actually have ash from fires that are Ninety miles a hundred miles away um that get kicked up and are in the air so even if a fire was a year ago um you're still going to be\nBe picking up that those little fine particulate matter and remember PM ten also includes pollution also includes diesel exhaust feels that it's this perfect storm of of pollution diesel exhaust feel mold spores dust mites they're\nAll kicking off into this nice warm you know when I'm and getting ... our noses in our eyes so and really our body is thinking it's doing the right thing right because our body is trying to clear the particles so all the symptoms were having our release of inflammatory cells like his to me to try to clear\nYeah you're a tense right so that you don't get an infection I'm so truly the trick is to not have the particles\nRight if you can avoid going outside things like that but what else should people do if they do have extreme reactions are antihistamines something that would help\nYes absolutely so even though it's not\nAllergy per se so it's not and I'm\nAllergic to the grass or a tree or with the symptoms are very similar because it's a similar inflammatory cells so you know of course stay indoors keep your windows shut try to prevent exposure but\nIf you do have exposure than um do a sinus rinse um\nBut a sinus rinse does or even a nasal gar goal or renting your eyes are mouth is you're clearing those particles so you're not letting it really large and stuff you know you're going to be out all day when you come home immediately rinse your eyes rinse your nose runs the you know guard on the back of your throat get those particles out as quickly as you can\nAnd then at the symptoms have already started then of course you can do and uh his demeans even decongestants\nLike Sudafed 'em and by the way there's antihistamines\nThat are can go directly in your nose her eyes so if it's just an ice symptom you can do eye drops now they're all over the counter\nUm you can do and it has to be nasal sprays um or he can take an oil and has to me\nTo read a country we have to leave it there but I Know that you're a wealth of information and I thank you so much for joining us to talk about the allergy situation that a lot of us are suffering from turns out wildfires could be part of the reason why because of the ash in the atmosphere thank you Dr very much for being with us for hosts the LA health\nThank you bye\nFinally we want to make sure you start your weekend with a blast

have a chance at parole that's the result of Governor Brown not challenging a judge's ruling to prop fifty seven applies to three strikers two years ago said voters past\nFifty seven it gives the vendors labeled non violence of\nChance for early release now sex offenders the three time felony offenders are eligible to potential effects after the news\nLie from NPR News in Washington them Lakshmi Singh first responders in India are still removing bodies from the side of the deadly rail accident local authorities say scores of people on the outskirts of ... northern India were run over by speeding train as they were on the tracks watching celebrations during a Hindu festival\nOr what happened was in the subsequent decades is it they realize that this swept far greater than anybody thought went on it and it two thousand twelve or a reformed the three strikes law to make sure that it would apply to really the most serious people not serious nonviolent offenders\nOf voters again approved another measure forty seven two years later further\nUh letting a review again this is\nReview to make sure that only the most serious people in the mind remain behind bars in forty seven and then two years later again and proposition fifty seven expanding clarifying with that view would be so three elections in a row now California voters overwhelmingly approved\nAllowing the prison system and this just makes common sense to review the people who are encouraging who've been in there for a very long time for either right or to see who's the most safe to be released\nSo I think that the district attorney's being a little misleading first of all there are four thousand people who are currently in prison for life\nFor a non violent crimes the vast majority of those people have committed very minor crimes even after proposition thirty six there are still people in prison for shoplifting I was just in court for somebody shoplifting shampoo and there's still people in court for simple drug possession I'm Glad that an Orange County that they have\nSwiftly implemented some of these laws but other counties including\nLA are well behind and there are thousands of people waiting in bars behind bars for these very very minor crimes now regardless of what crimes they committed in the Senate strike or their prior crimes\nAll the new ruling from the governor says is that they get to go before the globe or to determine whether or not there a danger some people who've committed very minor crimes have become more dangerous in prison and are unsafe to be released I totally can see that at the same time people who've committed crimes that was considered more serious and more violent\nOr completely safe to be released because they're old they're in from their extraordinarily expensive to keep behind bars and that's why we have the case by case individual review by the pool or which by the way has an incredible track record of being able to release people who are safe\nThe track record of people being released by the pool boarded California is about one percent recidivism rate it makes perfect sense for the parole board to go through and make these individual determinations because as I said we're going to be forced to release people anyway\nSo why not release the people who are least dangerous\nAnd and why didn't proposition thirty six the three strikes reform active of six years ago why why didn't have a ... allow for the release of those individuals that you describe\nSo it did allow for their release in many cases and many down unfortunately not all counties are have the implement the\nProposition thirty six as swiftly as we would like and perhaps has been done in orange county so for example in Los Angeles county still there are several hundred cases they'll wait in the process\nPeople who still not had their day in court on the proposition thirty six so this basically supplements thirty six and says that those people can go to the global were rather than a court if that will be a fast across\nRobbery masked men are Orange County da's office do you anticipate that I'm there might be some sort of a ballot measure or something that would attempt to deal with this or or do you think that um you know this is pretty much the end of the road with the state not appealing the decision\nWell I mean there's always the potential for future legislation of ballot initiatives but in terms of this particular case and the issue of the three strikes the at the end of the road once the the governor decides not to appeal it it becomes a lot of land um let me just say though under prop thirty six\nAnd then made has to go before a judge judge is an elected official and hearing is held in open court is an adversarial process\nAnd a judge makes a decision whether someone poses an unreasonable risk to public safety that's one thing under ... fifty seven these decisions are made by a parole board in these prisons it's not open to the public necessarily these aren't elected officials and\nIn all honesty they're under pressure to release people to relieve prison overcrowding and save money that's a different\nConsideration that a judge makes when the judges district attorney whether someone is a dangerous person to be released around ...\nI I I Need I Need to break gentlemen I Want to thank you very much Mike Rowe modern do you have just quick very quick direct comment on that\nSure I just I happen to agree on this point I'd much rather than go to court that ... it's much more open process and I wish that that could be a way that this was handled\nAlright I gentleman I Need to wrap that's Michael Romano Stanford's three strikes project which he founded and directs Robert ... is with the Orange County district attorney's office he's a senior deputy da and he supervises to sell any trial attorneys court a felony panel\nSo um what sort of changes do you advocate to the tax structure and how much I'm can a controller bring to that debate\nSure well early on in my ... and I was very vocal about how inefficient our tax structure of it is for the very reasons that you just outlined Larry we were very dependent on the personal income tax and much of that now is derived from an investment related income capital gains rather than wages from work\nAnd so it creates tremendous volatility in our budget but if we're going to reform the tax structure I think we have to ask what is the purpose of the tax structure uh\nAnd in my mind it's to promote economic development sustain economic growth which then a puts into question what is the economy that we're trying to support\nAnd we're seeing tremendous changes in the economy today particularly during the last downturn the uptake of the gig economy with believe that will continue to grow up probably it during the next recession we'll see\nSome more of the of gig work thing or a taken up by those who are just seeking to to make them to make a living so when you look at the economic changes I think we have to question ah what kind of type structures going to support the job for the future given the economic change\nAgain would you support there being a attacks\nOn services as there is a good purchase well ... I I think it has to be a part in the next I think we're we're we're beyond the time now just moving around the deck chairs we have to look at the entire structure we have to look at who ultimately bears the burden and whether in fact the tax structure is going to help develop the economy for a twenty percent so\nYou you don't have an opinion on well I think it's hard on the next okay yeah uh so uh constantly you know sorority this Republican candidate for state controller what do you think of the idea of taxing services like goods\nOr I'm not a fan whatsoever of taxi services are good for the audience that are unfamiliar with that that is basically a sales tax type of\nIssue on a services the laborers from childcare to health care or from getting your hair cut to be like watching the movie downloading it all going to the movie theater it's a highly were aggressive tactic by repressive it hurts the\nOr looking class the most and with California already having one in five Californians living in poverty\nForty seven percent of California's is that are themselves working or will really struggling and when we look at the budget over the last eight years we've seen over sixty one percent growth in our budget I don't think we have a revenue problem I think you have any ... any of them and I think that's one of the\nThings that we need to look as though it's not just structure a tax cut but how about we just keep more money into people's pockets and allow them to a new things themselves instead of taking too much money from the taxpayers and now we labor times what will would clash of people who are barely hanging on and\nSo part of it it seems and you may take issue with this that but but that part of the volatility in California's taxation is the ... the progressive it he often because of the wealthiest people pay such a high percentage so is there any way that you think\nThat that volatility could be eased that isn't in some way we're aggressive from the very progressive taxation currently existing\nUh well I Believe that we if we're going to keep a state income tax I Believe we should all out obviously keep it but we should make it less\nUm you know we have the top tax a marginal tax rate and the leader now with the public impacts plan that is I've been on the federal level there is indications that a lot of the top you know earners a might be leaving the state because they only get and thousand dollar state and local tax deduction\nSo you could see additional volatility but people still want to live in the state and what we want to make sure as you know maybe we need to reexamine instead of eight Thirteen points three percent top marginal tax rate\nStart looking at becoming more competitive with other states or make sure are millionaires and billionaires state in the state in our in our\nOur economy instead of raising taxes up so high that they're going to\nLead to better you your thoughts about this how would you reform the tax or\nWell I think are just looking at one aspect of it um I mean already on this conversation I'm seeing a we we just can't do that I mean if we're just going to look at the income tax\nIt's not just the upper income earners are going to be punched in the next ... because of the federal tax changes I Would say a lot of middle income Californians are going to be a her just as well but the cap on the state and local tax deduction so you have to look at the entire system and frankly we're not doing enough for the\nMiddle of low income families are in California we have an affordability crisis here in California\nWhere I Hope we can provide some are more incentives in terms of the economic opportunities for them a there was nothing touch than the federal tax plan with respect to expanding the federal earned income tax credit which would be just an immediate boost in terms of our ah lower income working household\nAlright final statement from each of you as to why voters should support your candidacy Mr ... why should Californians vote for you for state controller\nBecause ... ... for ... needs to look at the controllers office as who will be the chief tech air watchdog\nThat they want to be a check and balance on the legislature and all on the governor\nOr somebody who has refused to take\nMoney from tax unions lobby is a special interests for operations big business none of that money it's somebody who's going to come in there and say I'm going to go ahead and represent you somebody who has a real world business experience and the integrity into the office and say\nWe can do things better that we can look instead of new taxes right from the initial issues and make California affordable for every single California and get us\nOur economy booming and put money in people's pockets\nThat are Anaheim resident Republican candidate for California state controller Constantine those ... ... a democratic uh California controller currently seeking second term in office why should voters support your return to the office\nWell there's lots more work to do I'm In California has led to the national a recovery after the great recession we our entire ninth your recovery really unprecedented so we know of of the economy will face a downturn so bracing ourselves for that that's the work and focus every day of my team at the controllers office\nAlso when we go and look ahead of the economy of California we know it's going to create a lot of changes\nWith respect to um\nHow the changing nature working and even a issues like climate change the effects of climate change are going to start to heat up more Tamara public resources as we try to deal with the effects on them so uh my job as a seeing everything through the lens of the economy these to disrupt or is the changing nature of work and climate change\nAre going to have significant impacts on revenue and our current tax system that's the conversation I Hope to legally fold\nThank you both so much both of you also speaking to the strength of the University of California system you're ...
