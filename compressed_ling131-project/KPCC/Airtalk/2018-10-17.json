{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Streets and uh and the riverbed other places primarily for safety so that\nUh thinking safety in numbers but it also makes it a\nPossibility that type is would be spread there so we are also put into place yesterday a program with our department of public health\nAnd are homeless initiative to do outreach Indian countenance a to help with clean up to get to sanitation district's to provide you know treasury skeptical so naturally pick up trash to get our animal welfare folks engaged a because many of our homeless people have patch\nWith them or to do showers a shanks you know everything that we did when we had to have a\nI have to try to say outbreak so it's kind of an all hands on time which is essentially what we're trying to do in the county now get a number of our departments to work together but the problem for us is of course we don't do sanitation in the district so we have to coordinate with ... department\nOkay they shared a do their place\nDuring the LA county supervisor she look you also want I don't want to move on now to another project the board of voted to pursue yesterday that job training for women in jail tell us about the proposed program\nWhere we have a number of women are in our um she already up it's called the ... century regional detention facility which is out near Lin wood and one of the things that we found that unemployment is very high of course among all formerly incarcerated people 'cause they\nThey have you checked the box you've been convicted of a felony and we don't want you kind of thing but a lot of it relates to the\nFact that they don't get any job skills and yet they're in jail you know often months at a time so we'll Monday job standard for men at the pictures detention center and now we're going to open one at the century regional the\nDetention facility because we also found that women are um they have a unique barrier to employment eighty percent of them are mothers they have responsibility for children they need\nA a you know a panoply of different kind of\nTraining and health so this is a two pronged program one is to an again all hands on deck to design a training program at she already has and the other is\nA a transition program you're getting out let us help you get to a job interview let us help you use the ... the uh uh facilities we already have under our workforce development\nDepartment and you know get you an interview even follow up so we're trying to do a um follow through when women get out of the jail\nAnd when women get out of jail typically if they're not financially independent they tend to go back\nYeah recidivism is very high among women who have no options and so what we're trying to do with the men as well but we haven't concentrated on the women as much yet I'm is to give you some options you know while you're there do some training\nYou I'm thirty days before you get out or do an end reach into the jail and she you know where are you going back to uh use our office of diversion and re entry or to help people figure out where are you going to live and can we help you at least a go\nLook for a job you know it's not perfect it's often very difficult to population itself\nHasn't had a lot of help but what we're trying to do in the county these days is really invested in people so we don't have to invest even more money and locking them up again\nWell yes I mean I can imagine already supervisor having job training in jail when you get out to the kind of confidence you could have been approaching an employer\nYes and we've also found that there was a very quickly growing a number of jobs in ah the sort of the food industry restaurants you know and you can the entry level at restaurants really sort of sous chefs are\nAssistant cooks or um any of these of what they called the ... arts and we're doing training at the campus Kilpatrick for our young people in the probation system and one of the programs that she already after going to be calling every arch\nThe other is we're trying to work on women should be able to do to get into the trades because a number of women you have\nThe skills or but they've never develop them\nAnd it's not that difficult at the entry level and we have many of the trade unions that have said they're interested in helping us a kind of across the board and there's a lot of great jobs coming to LA county because of all\nThe buildings were doing you know measured W passes we're going to have a lot of recycling built a we have a lot going on with a\nMeasure em and transportation so the two training\nUm programs at the idea will be calling their yards and the trades but you know we could do more I've asked animal welfare to help people trained people in the animal care there's a lot the county does and we can help them get job\nI also got to think that there's a ... a stadium coming in Inglewood and in the Olympics guide to the area soon so there will be\nLot of opportunities available now one thing that this job soon we'll be located inside the ... century regional detention facility here in LA how does that work exactly\nWell there is um a only a little space to really short of devote to it because we haven't rebuilt ... although we are going to build a build out some different kinds of space for a women they don't spend a lot of time in our jail this is not a\nPrison so we're trying to give them sort of a taste\nOf a training program get them interested and what makes it really important is not just what happens in jail but what happens in the transition and that's why we're engaging the office of diversion and re entry as well as our mental health department\nAre a public social services trying to bring it together so women can get their kids back but also have the child care they need\nTraining get a job it's not easy\nBut as I said we're kind of looking at all hands on deck here\nThat LA county supervisor she look you'll thank you very much\nThat's going to do it for to to really back up tomorrow morning at nine you could find as on Twitter at take to that I take two you can find meat

News in Washington I'm Lakshmi sang President Trump says his administration may know by the end of the week what happened in the Saudi conflict in Istanbul or Washington Post columnist or ... show was last seen alive more than two weeks ago\nThey don't want the Congress merely to do a investigation for the sake of investigation or for the sake of obstruction and we'll have to make sure\nThat we ruthlessly prioritize what we look into that we make the public case for it that we make the connection between why the issue is so important and how it affects the quota people's lives you know one of the top priorities for example\nOf a larger Cummings who will be the chair of the Government Reform and oversight committee\nIs looking into the high cost of prescription drugs why are we paying so much for prescription drugs people could see the direct impact of that issue on their lives and so we'll have to continue to make the case for why this oversight is so important\nWe're talking with Adam Schiff the ranking Democrat on the house intelligence committee represents\nI I wanted to ask you about the politicization of the ... tale a committee and I know there's some people who say well you know this is sort of um\nA fuzzy look back that while we just had some partisan differences but uh just from the reporting that I've read it seems that even the relationship you you had with\nA Republican Devin Nunes has on the committee that that has eroded significantly if Democrats take majority of of the house if you've chaired this committee what would you do to try and restore bipartisanship or would that not be a goal\nThat would absolutely be go you know I think the there are several high priorities um that I Would have in the ...\nThe first would be to restore the proper functioning of the committee the comity among committee members but also the relationship between the committee\nAnd the intelligence community ah right now because of the actions were German the intelligence community doesn't place much faith that they can share a some of the most closely held secrets with the committee and expect there'll be protected we're gonna have to restore that confidence in the community um one of the you know less told stories of our committee\nIs even with the profound differences that I've had with our chairman over the Russia investigation and over the midnight run that he did and all the rest of that stuff\nWe have continued to do all of the other committee work in a nonpartisan way ah so our annual effort is intelligence authorization bill which we put out each and every year even through the most difficult of times uh because we recognize that that important work had to continue um the oversight of all the agencies making sure the agencies were\nFollowing the law making sure they were sharing information with each other to protect the public\nOr all of that work is continue to be done uh and so\nAt least in in that respect we have continued the proper function of the committee but a very high priority my will be restoring the proper functioning of the entire committee\nNow much of this is going to be depending on who's appointed to the committee right because\nThere are number of Republicans who are retiring or we're not going to be on the committee going forward so you have confidence that the leaders of both parties since they are going to be the ones who will be a ... you know making these appointments that are the type of people that they're they're choosing are sort of\nPeople with intelligence knowledge you come from that background as opposed to more partisan types\nI Would hope so that has been historically the case in fact one of the reasons that I gravitated to the committee is that it it was among the most if not the most nonpartisan of all the committees [noise]\nUm I Would hope that um the Republican leader whoever that may be will make that a priority or it's certainly been a priority for leader Pelosi\nUm but for whatever reason the last few years um Speaker Ryan has chose to put people who are kind of partisan lawyers\nLike Trey Gowdy on the committee now that never was the case in the past um and to pick someone as a reward for their handling of the Benghazi committee or and put them on entail I think was really disastrous decision\nBy the speaker had to keep a Mr Noon as on the committee in a leadership position after\nUh that that stunt that he pulled where he went to some undisclosed location in the middle of the night claimed to have seen documents that were so sensitive and revealing of a conspiracy by the Obama administration that you had to go present them to the White House the following day\nUh and we would learn that in fact the documents he got from that undisclosed location were from the White House the undisclosed location was the White House um\nAfter something like that the speaker should have removed him um but didn't and you know you have to conclude from that that basically what Newt as has been doing has been with the approval of the Republican majority in Speaker Ryan and that that was a terrible disservice to our committee as well as the public will\nIt includes senators that goes mayors are convinced business people that group celebrities\nThere is going to be no shortage of people running for office ah for me personally I'd have to conclude that I had something different to offer I'm\nAnd I'm nowhere near even thinking about that uh but uh but I Do think that given the way Trump is completely scrambled things um that the\nTraditional career path that leads to the oval office that runs to the governorship in the Senate is no longer necessarily the lock that it once was\nCongressman thank you again as

of the shake alert to early earthquake warning system that we talked about last week\nOn air talk right now we're joined by Michael Moore LAPD chief\nTo talk about some of the biggest issues in law enforcement cheap more good to have you back\nDuring Larry [noise] let's talk first of all our Governor Brown a signing into law bill that allows for release of police investigative files\nUm that were previously blocked also calls for time specific release of um of for the video footage of controversial or shootings your response that music is again a ... a have an effect on LAPD\n[noise] well I Believe it will and sense of administrative task or at the same time I think it's going to be a positive event overall for law enforcement and as we continue to increase the transparency of our operations to the general public a\nLaw enforcement in America is many times glamour ties vilified described in many ways in Hollywood\nUh but the truth a day to day workings of it as often not seen by by members of the general public\nAh seldom do they get to see unless they're sitting on a jury pull\nA this I think this law changes is places new burdens on law enforcement in a sense of adding to that transparency providing for all the video evidence and digital evidence related to Austin involved shootings\nAnd also on sustained acts of significant misconduct or that those investigations are come to the public light and I believe that both those areas are issues of significant public interest and as we build and and strengthened the trust of our community in in our work\nUh I think that those releases will help bolster that trust\nAnd do you think that this law will enable the public to adequately look if if if you um use discipline against particular officer officers that they'll be able to look at the criteria in the public will be able to\nUm make up their own minds about what did they think that the punishment fits the misconduct\nWell you know the public when you say the public that's a very wide in in big pool and I'm sure there's many opinions in it\nAnd this will allow the public and the general sense to understand that in a sustained active serious misconduct\nWhat was the consequences to that a member of the organization and by extension evaluate the chiefs a decision and she's judgment and whether or not he or she uh was fair and measured\nA and upheld his or her obligation to a holding accountable an individual who's found have done something wrong\nAnd what it would it have the process of how you got there in in the release so wouldn't just say you you determined ex period of ... suspension or whatever the discipline is but what it also have you sort of your reasoning how you got there any mitigating factors that would go into the disciplinary process I I Believe\nIt does I as I understand the lawn again this is you know just recently passed so we'll see it's actual interpretation but at the end of the day is going to show all the interviews is going to reveal what the evidence was and wasn't a what accusations were and worked a president\nAnd the evaluation and now and again I think it's that brings the lights up on on Syria's\nActs of misconduct I Am heartened that this is\nA ... a progress in the sense of evolution is not a full so I'm opening a personnel files I think the officers do enjoy it should have some privacy interest or in their in their personal backgrounds but I think in this area of the areas that the legislature chose to focus on is the right move it does right time\nWe'll continue our

by her coming on board Mr Bronner is is has a has an at a tremendous pedigree of of a background of service to the public are both at the state and local level in my uh and now as a member of the commission I've met with him on several occasions and will continue to\nUh to to talk and discuss with him\nI'm encouraged by his initial tenor and which is to listen and and he's really asking great questions he's asking data based or oriented questions about how things operate in the organization or ice I sense they are real fairness about his desire to serve as a leader of the commission of one of the five leaders of\nOf this department and to ensure that policy and direction of the organization is well founded ah he's getting his footing as I Am and so we're kind of helping each other along in a sense of understanding this great organization of course\nA and I look forward to uh to the months and years ahead with is uh with his leadership\nThe a tragic incident at Trader Joe's in Silver Lake in fact congressman Schiff were just talking about apparently you and he spoke a on the phone after that incident where an armed gunmen ah was able to uh elude police get into the trader Joe's in Silver Lake\nOr threaten the customers inside the manager at the store came out when shots were being fired she was hit and killed by um by police fire the family as a as filed a claim against\nThe city in the LAPD and um and it's such a tragic incident at this point one of the the complaints has been that the video was selectively edited\nCan you respond to that claim about the family seems to be indicating was misleading in what shown in the video\nWhile I don't believe it was I Believe that uh and I'd asked the public just to recognize or ask recognized for their patients we came out in less than Seventy two hours after this tragic event\nWith the release of the body worn and digital and car video of a unit that was in pursuit of this gunman who had a ... who held hostage in his vehicle\nUh it is on a edited it is raw is violent and it shows the perspective of both officers that were in that unit those chasing this individual\nIt shows the actions of the gunmen firing at those officers during the course of that violent pursuit and it shows the immediate aftermath as he fled from his vehicle firing on the officers and those and those officers returning fire there\n... arguably though there are other people who are other officers that were who joined in that effort to apprehend this man\nWho joined in that effort both during the course of the pursuit in the immediate aftermath and the subsequent efforts to have him surrender or as he held hostage is for them to store all of that video footage is numbers in the hours are in the tens of videos and I've we've not released that that's part of the investigation\nThat information will be eventually released a and I believe that uh the uh what occurred here from the officers perspective what occurred here from the general snapshot of initial impression has been provided to both of the family as well as to the public at large\nAdditional information is available and will be released in the future uh this claim for damages and litigation against the city involves a now certain uh um ... result in certain consequences if you will I've got to produce Sherry obligation I've got a city attorney that is my council\nAnd as a police chief while I have an emotion to to fry be forthcoming into relief as much information as possible to this grieving father and his family I'm so I'm just\nI'm Sorry for his loss in for this tragic outcome\nBut at the same time I've got responsibilities now that they're taking legal action to ensure that protect the interests of the city and balanced than I Do believe that the initial reaction by us providing information as quickly as we did a I Would argue that it that it was an effort to be as transparent it'd be forthcoming as possible\nAnd at what point does the department put out a its its report on the actions of the officers um and and uh what was justified or perhaps could have been done differently by the officers trying to stop the man\nSo the timeline on that that entire investigation will go and be presented to me within the coming months uh it it will take up to about ten to ... months after the event is generally the general timeline so I expect to have that investigation before me a in a early spring\nThis will go before a tribunal administrate tribunal within the organization that will look at all of the up and it's all the video all of the statements physical evidence included and evaluated on a sense of the tactics of the officers they chose decision by them to draw on exhibit their firearms in their decision to use deadly force and they'll make recommendations to me\nRather those are the policy I Will then ... and make my independent recommendations to the border police mission\nThat we will result in a report that will be made public for the public does to read evaluating judge themselves it will include video snippets and other digital evidence that exists and eventually the at the commission will then meet\nIt will make their decision and it'll also include a public release of a inspector general report with much of the same information\nRecently allows just passed and the state of California effective next July that will result in the release of unedited a full comprehensive all ... ... ... all video evidence to my understanding\nWithin forty five days following all officer involved shootings that is going to be quite a task on every law enforcement agency in California not so much as ... to get it out exactly as it's not so much the tests\nOf we don't want to provide the information is just logistically pulling all that together and for him in presenting it then it will be a task for the public to bring some sense I'm encouraged by our critical incident reviews that we're publishing we now have more than ... Eighteen I think we have Eighteen or now published on our website\nThat shows the executive summary of these events if you will but again following the will of the people will just Lakers\nHave passes this law and I think that you'll see next year at this time of these criticisms much more muted it may be more critical in the sense of well we need a better context of how these things are occurring rather than just the whole cell dump and now I've got to try to find a needle in a haystack well\nIn the ... in the case of the trader Joe's incident I think it's going to be so interesting just look at the the tactics that were employed and to get a a good sense of sort of the decisions officers were making and what could be learned out of it as a result too 'cause obviously such high stakes from beginning to end in that incident\nTremendous stakes by the grace of God or no one else was was\nBeen could have been as terrible as it was the the one ... that could have been so much worse just yeah

them to do that as opposed to I'm just closing facilities I mean why why why why would they choose to spend more money on the operation of each facility\nWell they would choose to do that because if the right thing to do I mean the patience and the workers that care for patients it's the right thing to do they would choose that because they will not leave\nThe Vita and this industry would not leave this chunk of money in this state on the table for someone else to take and but the truth of the matter is it's the right thing to do that's why we have a the\nBacking endorsement of the

effect proposition ... fast\nThank you for having me Larry I'm I have been a dialysis patient for eight years\nI've never seen any of the conditions that Emmerson just spoke of or that this bill um speaks of\nBut what I Do know is when I read this bill I was absolutely horrified a because this bill has no provisions in it to do the things that he says that that they want to do\nThere is no provisions where there's there is guidance and oversight of cleaning or if there is a problem with cleaning\nThere is a no provision they always also say that they these companies make so much money and that um the money would go back to patient ... there's no provision in this bill for money to go back to patients there is not [noise]\nAlso\nIf they really really wanted to help patients they wouldn't be trying to take away services and um\nStaff members that actually help us this bill would cut out all the people that help I have a doctor for instance that comes to see me once a week that would be ... I have um a a nursing a administration that takes care of me they would cut that out\nAnd you're saying that that would be caught because it's not included in allowed over here for exactly that that that wouldn't count against\nUm what the what they could charge where someone who's to say a ... and forgive me if I'm not using the right term but the the medical technician the person who's actually administering the dialysis that would be included as opposed\nTo basically they include two people ... or two groups of people and that is the technician and the nursing\nEverything else they sang a surplus which is absolutely ridiculous all of those members of that staff um ... including the administration of the of the facility administrator or down to I'm\nA social workers and nutrition is all of those things helped me stay alive\nSo you're saying this would this incentivized apple we would incentivize hiring more technicians because of what we know first of all I Would why wouldn't it in Santa Monica facilities\nAnd it's and it has a for technicians to a pot of I mean for a for patients to one technician to a ...\nOr so and the pods are you know they're four chairs in a row basically and um\nSo there's a technician there at all times and there's also a call button if there's ever an emergency at the hands of each dialysis patient so patients don't get neglected not enough facilities that I've been I've been all over the state and\nI was getting most commonly do you go to a divvied up or I Do I go to a to B the facility in van Nuys California okay All right ah I welcome any open up the phones for you to weigh\nIn where it eight six six eight nine three key PCC\nOr the ... page K.

I mean high blood pressure are the two biggest contributors to this\nUm but it is growing and um facilities are opening\nAnd to get to the point where um you this isn't the buys um these companies from uh opening new clinics or even closing president clinics or cutting um shift I I I work so I go to the leadership through the day\nYeah All right uh well let's take less than a recall uh let's see we have Rob in the mid Wilshire district good to have you with us\nYou know I think the proponents of prop ... probably miss the big picture a way I read this or the base legislation is it's going to a return dialysis to the same kind of scenario that the classic public utility regulation was\nMore money that's put in by these are for profit operators you know the cost of their Appalachian State of the health industry basically guaranteed a Fifteen Percent rate of return at all their expenses\nIncentive for private company is more money put into the leak base so to speak it costs about ... ... more money they can expect as a rate of return and that sure that people walk away from that deal\nYeah I mean the the question is is Mr Cox raised um since that's not across the board it's only on the technicians um whether that would have a negative effect on care or\nEmerson ... let me ask you about that because I'm given how this is defined do you have any concerns that all the other a supportive services in care would be negatively affected by this\nYeah absolutely I mean this was falls in there's a fear mongering scare tactics I mean let's I was there during the amendment process during this whole amendment process medical directors a nurse managers this has already been included right but they continue to repeat these\nThese message that is not going to include it I mean it\nWhile I was looking at the legislative analysts report daily I thought yeah I thought it was not\nYou know is it ... it ... it depends ... there's two there's two things there's\nUncertainty is what the uh the state and federal regulators decide on and it the other thing is with an CERN is how the the industry would respond right um but the truth is there's more flexibility then they're willing to admit\nLet me read out of the uh this is from the state\nLegislative uh animals the voter guide a in a death on by the secretary of state's office this is uncertain\nHow ah the dialysis centers would respond if prop ... passes and it says ah the CDC owner that I'll center operator might increase allowable costs such as wages and benefits for non managerial step providing direct patient care\nIncreasing allowable costs would raise the revenue kept this what our caller robs talking about\nReducing the amount of rebates that would be all that would be their private insurers and potentially leave the owner operators better off than if they were to leave allowable costs at current levels this because the amount of revenues that the owner operators could retain would grow by more than the additional costs\nHowever it could lead to a reduction of other costs the owner operator might also reduce where possible other costs the do not count toward determining the revenue cap such as administrative overhead\nThis would not change the amount of rebates open would improve the profitability of the dialysis center so\nThat would that would seem to do it to leave that open to the interpretation of what was it ... and what is direct patient care\nYeah yeah absolutely that would leave it open for the state regulators to make to defined what that means right was it also included\nAll right we'll continue we're going to take a break we'll come back we're more listener calls we'll hear from both of our representatives pro and con on proposition\nEight where at eight six six eight nine three KP Sisi will be back one minute\nHas some of the toughest building cars in the country but certain areas are exempt from rules to protect them against storms like hurricane Michael\nThey these are the ... center of the oil and these are the and these are the concerns that we have can you imagine can you imagine if they were able to go to inspect all one hundred percent what would those quantitative evidence really looked like All right doing Cox uh\nAgain as a dialysis patient this is my life that's on the line here if I ever saw anything like that I Would not only reporters I'd be screaming into the tops of the rooms so um there is\nSome wonderful facilities here and I think that uh I Am part of one of those and I've seen many of those across the country and I talk to patients all across the country too and especially here in California\nAnd I have never seen or heard of a report like that and so once again do not take away all those things that I Need all the services that I Need because you've got to pitching match with the uh with the company\nI Want to thank you both for being with us that's Dwayne Cox no one ...
