{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Fast forward to the present things aren't looking as bright anymore of thoughts about what's been happening with probably Hollywood or maybe distance itself\nRight well the the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal ... is shining a light on aspects of this regime which\nI think people in Hollywood either may have been naive about overlooking the other way about because of the dollar signs in their eyes I'm certainly this is a not something that you would want to be in business and as a as a\nIndustry that focuses on freedom of expression theoretically way Hollywood um to do business in a country where that appears not to be a priority would be concerning\nGive us some context on Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin ... role in all this\nWell he is the millennial prince he very young and he has been on the one hand trying to make the case that he will be\nSaudi Arabia and in intern much of the middle East I'm\nAway from it sort of a comic fundamentalism toward a more sort of open spirit to the west he's really motivated by wanting to diversify the economy of Saudi Arabia which had been so dependent on oil and obviously if you're doing all sorts of other things including things in the media business you're there's other sources of money I'm coming into the country at\nThe same time that he has sort of made the case for opening the country he has internally on jak jailed prominent Saudis who disagree with him and has become a controversial figure for people who are following the the region closely\nM. C. I. back we all have business deals in the works one of those things that I Know\nA lot of people I think are taking at least publicly a wait and see attitude you know one of the conversations\nThat people had just 'cause it was a possibility of Disney opening a theme park there that is certainly something that we've not heard any progress on and and an incident like the disappearance of the show Gabe would seem to if there was any consideration would seem to shut something like that\nDown the film critic thing is really interesting to me and my Hollywood always looking for new places to film in ... with the people don't already associate with something that already exist so I ... I Wonder if things were in the works to shoot some films in Saudi Arabia that might and all of a sudden I'll be off\nRight I mean one of the interesting things that can the fatty delegation to the very impressive sort of um performance of sorts where they they gave us all brochures that were loaded luckily photographed the location is trying to make the case for people to shoot there some folks had I Know a project in the works that we will now see what happens to those products\nOr let's move on to the ongoing Harvey Weinstein ... are you wrote to about a seemingly minor development over the weekend but it actually could actually spell big troubles tell us about that\nRight well late last week a judge threw out one of the sex charges in the case against wines dean and and it happened because prosecutors admitted that will lead detective in the case had made a grave error which is that he had not passed along and interview that he did with a witness who would have um than favorable to Winston\nCredibility I mean that's got to be paramount riding agrees like this especially when it comes to a lead detective ... effect this case going forward on\nWell it's really important is that the the charge that was dropped a pertains to a woman named ... Evans a by dropping a the charges not so much Evans is credibility that they're calling into question as it is the detective that to the extent that this detective is also responsible for the five other charges that's important\nSo this could tumble completely down well it's I hate to even bring a federal workers and\nIt's possible that it could imperil the whole indictment and um it attorneys I spoke to both of those who've worked for prosecution and on the defense have expressed that this would be a ... this is a major concern it's not just oh they're going to the charges they're moving ahead on the other five if the person who helped uh\nThe da's office put together the case was keeping information from them that's problematic and it's especially interesting in New York where you have a kind of fraught history between the da and the NYPD\nYou may recall that a few years ago the NYPD had wanted the da to bring charges against Wednesday and this was before the New York times and New Yorker uh stories about him and the ... to prosecute so there had historically bend this tension\nBetween the NYPD and the d._a. over winds dean which may have led to a sort of breakdown in communication in this hugely important case\nThings could be changed but when it comes to prosecuting sexual assault cases dealing with Hollywood I mean that could change now especially with the climate there were no\nWell yeah I mean there's no question when you look at the a guilty verdict in the bill Cosby chaos that we saw as sort of a key moment\nOne thing that um I heard from attorneys who I spoke with is that you're more likely now they believe in the sort of post ... era to get juries that are open to convicting these cases have always been incredibly hard to prosecute but they may have gotten easier and ah\nThe Cosby case is one example where the defense attorney try things that had worked in the past which was to really called into question and shame the victim and um some of her witnesses and it didn't work [noise]\nAll right let's end on the box office because there were high hopes I mean like as high as it actually went into in the forties the moon ... matter no how 'bout that that's high\nNow in ready to do some troubles as we could how to do it first men do with a with a ...\nRight well so first manmade about sixteen point five million domestically as you say I think they they did have higher hopes for the universal on the movie cost about sixty million dollars to make it had\nPretty one reviews from critics it seems to be an egg awards movie being made by being inches all who of course I'm a one directing after for la la land\nIt doesn't seem to have really landed without like things I Know that was not meant to be a pun but I guess it was there isn't real competition in the marketplace right now with a star is born a continue to hold onto it sort of adult audience and also a lot of men um who who are going to see venom which a nail the male audience is important for this movie\nWas embed them continues to cut a hole habits grip on on the box office right ... goal movies a lot of people kind of didn't like underestimated yeah that is all of a sudden it or if you've taken away from first man is is this maybe maybe new to the time we're living in because\nThe movie itself has suffered through some kind of maybe some political partisan arguing\nRight well and interesting thing that happened before first man had even screen was a controversy over the inclusion of the planting of the American flag on the moon um there are if you haven't seen it there are a lot of American flags in this movie there's no question it is portrayed as at America's space team\nUh they got this done but this sort of controversy that ensued over that and they have kept away a key members of the audience that were Stanley Kubrick told the doctor to put it on Amazon themselves to I don't get back on a script\nRebecca ... to talk about the business

president said the king denied any knowledge of the disappearance of dissidents journalist or I'm all for show you the residents vacuum later wrote killers to be responsible how should the president respond to the central role of Saudi assassins will consider that right after the news [noise]\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Lakshmi Singh a joint Turkish in Saudi investigative team is searching the Saudi conflict and assemble turkey nearly two weeks after a journalist ... entered the building and apparently never came out he is feared dead\nUm and and you know blaming them for what was going on in the stock market\nYour your thoughts about this or most economists think that the Trump's comments are loco not the the actions of the Federal Reserve a again short term long term short term it's possible the stock market continue to rise for a while\nBut uh a couple of things in the long term a look very bad for our economic future one is the persistence of trade war is a Trump continues to pursue protection U.S policy\nUh and if we know anything is the trade wars killed jobs in the long run the second thing is the federal debt\nSometime within the next decade a federal debt held by the public is going to a top one hundred percent of gross domestic product we haven't been there since World War two and that was a that was a spike this is something that will persist and we'll have all kinds of bad economic consequences and there's no sign the president is serious about doing anything about it\nUp but uh the impact seems to be even greater on the Democratic side enthusiasm is increase on both sides but the increase has been greater on the Democratic side\nUh so we're likely to see higher than average turn out in the in the midterms and uh the increase seems to favor the Democrats at this point though ah one thing we learned two years ago is that it's important to hedge any production about ... election\nAnd Matt I'm you know typically when it comes to the Supreme Court as I understand it that the passion advantage is really the Republicans that Republican voters pay particular attention to the composition of the court do you feel like that shifted with Kavanaugh\nYeah I think so I think Jack is right here that there appears to be a larger enthusiasm um or a motivating issue on the Democratic side there were multiple new polls out this week\nShowing Kavanaugh was especially unpopular with women and this does appear to have some sort of spillover effect on congressional elections in ... especially in cases\nWhere the candidates have strongly defended Kavanaugh so you have a lot of people viewing cabinet or a unpopular leap viewing that the investigation didn't go far enough and now you have different candidates for Congress and especially Senate who maybe took a very strong stance defending him\nAnd I think that voters are going to be evaluating that they're going to be remembering that especially as they as some of those tag lines are put into campaign ads and you you see the senator or the house member continuing to endorse or defend Kavanaugh\nIt can be very effective because the polls that have come out have shown that I'm a voters believe that there should have been more it should've been a longer process\nAnd I don't think the issue is going to go away unlike what happened with Clarence Thomas I'm decades ago I think this is an issue that may re surface in twenty Nineteen when there's a new ... I wouldn't be surprised if I'm some in the house I Want to further the investigation perhaps look at some of these statements that\nMr Kavanaugh has made under oath and determine whether or not they were truthful or not or if there was anything to the allegations so I wouldn't be surprised if this issue continues to have some legs even after the election because it was something that people were so passionate about especially this idea that it could be settled in one week\nAll of these allegations so I'm going to continue following this and I think it it may have a little bit more or\nLess it's using 'cause I and I can't cite the source unfortunately I don't recall where I saw this but among independent voters it showed that there was less a sympathy toward Democrats in the Senate and how they handled the confirmation process than Republicans more criticism of\nOf Democrats but I'm ... and of course I'm there may not be enough independents to really make a difference but I Do you think there's any cause for concern among Democrats their map or into\nWell there certainly is to the first point that I don't think is with independence I think there is a a a sub group of conservative men the ones that President Trump was really channeling when he said it's a very hard time and that you're getting these false allegations\nI think there are people who might relate to that and see that cabinet or they feel that Kavanaugh was wrongly accused\nBut that's a subset because in the polls that we've seen even independent and conservative leaning women\nSay that they were unhappy with how the process played out and that this is not who they are choice would be a for a conservative justice um and so I think that there's a bigger downside and especially among women who may have been open to a Republican votes this may have pushed them farther away from that\nRight I'm your thoughts on that jak for we break a\nIn Port in difference between the house the Senate ah there are some states in which a this issue may have helped the Republicans in North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp who came out against Kavanaugh is running behind a republic uh Republicans may will pick up that seat\nI think it is largely reflective of name recognition and so what I Would do is interpret that through how much the voters know about these folks so for someone like Bernie Sanders\nThere's he should have universal name recognition after an extremely strong primary challenge in two thousand sixteen so for him to be considerably behind bite and that's not a great site now he has an announced he's not necessarily running but if that contingency was still as fervent for him we would have seen him higher\nOn the other hand someone like Senator Harris' from here in California\nShe's new or on the scene and so that third position in this poll might actually be a strong point she might be exceeding expectations of where she would be nationally already gaining the sort of profile so\nIt's not necessarily to say that Joe Biden is is the front runner but really where do they stand\nIn comparison to how much name recognition they have and where they should stand and I have to agree with what Jack said there at the end that I think Biden is not necessarily the candidate for the Democrats and twenty twenty even though he has many a likeable characteristics and I'm a very appealing in a number of ways\nHe's been on the stage and his job now is sort of as the elder statesman in the same way as a John Kerry to sort of a support and endorse the candidates but it's really time for someone new or to emerge someone to come onto the scene of with with fresh ideas and I think that's what you're hearing and most of the focus groups in polls on the Democratic side\nThe challenges you know all those younger folks are are quite to the left and so the question is does the party ended up potentially shooting itself in the Fort if it nominate someone who's highly progressive and and can't play in middle America\nYeah that's been the a challenge to the Democrats are grappling with right now and I think so far they've had a combination of both progressive candidates emerged and the ones who are more moderate or traditional um or mainstream and in this uh twenty teens cycle when you're looking at Senate and house\nAnd they appear to be working together they appear to all the rowing in the same direction at this point and that's good news that means there's something for everybody on the Democratic side the question will be when it comes to presidential politics if they repeat the fights\nAnd the mistakes of twenty sixteen and that they weren't able to come together as cohesive Lee\nThat will certainly be a mistake and so sometimes you can learn from those past a episodes and say going forward we need to be more United more cohesive and I think there's more energy and excitement behind some of these newer voices and newer faces which are a little bit more to the left of center\n... a ... by the way we had Elizabeth Warren coming out with the DNA Analysis over the weekend a this in response to the ridicule that she's face from President Trump has referred to was Pocahontas over claims that she has\nA American indian ancestry but I Wonder if it really helps her because\nIt could be as far as eight to ten generations back\nAnd how helpful that's really really going to be to sort of counter to criticism that she's overstating that in her background jak uh yeah I think\nThis is not an issue that's likely to change votes one way or the other or if you like Elizabeth Warren you've already decided and if you dislike or you've already decided but\nAh the more significant Elizabeth store a warrant story out of recent days is a that she has a so called war room underway a serious organization presumably\nAre preparing for a race for president in twenty twenty and this was a person that we know has a a lot of support among democratic activists so uh this is a somebody worth watching uh the back and forth between her and Trump is going to continue\nI also want to call attention to a Los Angeles times op ed written by Jack Pitney of Claremont McKenna College in which she urges Democrats if they take the house of representatives not to repeat what Newt Gingrich did\nUm you know in the uh in the middle of the Clinton presidency real real quickly your thoughts on why that would be a mistake jak\nA number one a Gingrich you got into deep ethics trouble uh that would be a assure a route to a Democrat a self immolation but also\nOn substance or the Republicans did a lot of investigation they botched the job or the ... the the the end up looking very foolish it's important to do investigations but you have to do them right you have to do them on the substance and higher season professionals to carry them out\nGentleman want to thank you both for being with us that's Claremont McKenna College is

going to be tens of billions of dollars but\nUh we don't know exactly they have the right to do that right now they didn't get as much as they wanted and I believe this is kind of how they operate\nThe second thing is they also got hundreds of millions of dollars to improve their equipment and it was clear what\nWhat what is the cause of bars is usually vegetation management or equipment that hasn't been updated got the money that they weren't happy they didn't get a bigger bailout they put in a protocol that now I Believe of taking a look at it by Cal Fire as well as you

on the legislation which is you know the legislature to literally a the rights issue bonds cover their losses in the past not huge they wanted to be able to you that you should\nBut the reason they're liable is she two fold waters because you're ... how'd you do it because they have been true in the trees around the lines and they can pass those costs on its own language and the second reason is when they put the equipment in your backyard usually enemy do me they had good they have the responsibility legally\nBecause they're condemned your back yard you take it over to maintain that equipment this debate played out in the legislature\nIt was it came down in the middle Larry that they were allowed to pass on their their costs in the past year we're allowed to get money can you were really clear the washing your shirt\nBut what they're trying to reopen make the right now you're going from\nAnd what the deal is which they show show was the risk of these fires privatized they've made billions of dollars they're regulated monopoly you Judy is a stock company and as soon as the stock company the investors have made a lot of money but when there's risk now\nThey're doing some very extreme you deviate\nFrom K. shareholders or I let me bring back\nMelissa ... of BGN a you want to respond oh I'm Sorry I I had a message that she was back with us but apparently not All right uh let me bring Sharon mcnairy K PCC infrastructure correspond and back\nSo Sharon um what do you think is going to be the upshot of this because if if this if if we're going to have you know every fall power being shot off in the state\nIs the bill that ... talking about with sb ... and it included a whole range of things that it's now requiring the utilities to do to reduce the risk\nThat their power equipment is going to cause fires and I think tomorrow if they're still on if it's not too windy I'm going to go out and see some of the equipment and stop things like insulating the wires you don't have their naked wires insulating the transformers\nYou know the fire in a ... last year last December that burn three hundred homes\nThat was only recently decided by Cal Fire that it was a Southern California Edison responsibility so kill innocent and plays towns remains of a bird's nest at the bottom of the ... and they think up a bird's nest it was invisible to the ice from the ground you know caused aligned arc over and cause the fire\nI'm ... so you know and we have seen Southern California Edison shut off power to communities um eh preemptively last December um in Idlewild\nThat community was shut down for a couple of days no power at all to keep it a you know keep the lines from starting a fire I think we're going to see more of that but Southern California Edison is put in a request the PC to spend five hundred and forty two million dollars upgrading its whole system\nAnd then there's another thing um you know why not just put the lines underground it's extremely all men out but\nIn Laguna Beach you remember where it burned like twenty four years ago the citizens of Laguna Beach you're going to vote on November six to tax themselves one extra cent in sales tax to pay the cost of underground in the utility lines run on their main evacuation rode out of there I think\nIf I only they have more success than Pasadena which

to avoid fire and whether that might affect the transmission line Sharon\nYeah and I think has to be nine and when did give the big utilities a little bit more leeway in cutting vegetation ah where they need to I mean the problem is a you know it can look like a butcher came through and just clear cut\n'em you know ... ... can you go farther out than just what's going to fall on your power lines
