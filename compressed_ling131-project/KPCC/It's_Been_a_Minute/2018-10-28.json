[noise] when was the Washington [noise] question [noise] every [noise]\n\n\nAlso there are several different types of experiences that don't fit into a preconceived boxes [noise] they have ESPN spectral travel the phenomenal to your high uncovers them to the store\nMake sure it never happens to me\n\nNorthwest Wisconsin is the epitome of the north [noise] it's a place with a tiny communities of people living\nFar apart from one another and my family had been coming to this area in the early Nineteen thirty countries would spend our summers about it\nIn the north would [noise]\nBut when you went out of your local community you are a stranger and you were a stranger like a stranger I don't\nKnow how to what's the best way to describe it it's um\nIt's it's a very it's hard to get reactions that if people in this place they're friendly enough but you don't really get close unless you're almost a local and we are still considered outsiders\nOn this one night about Twenty years ago my friend and I were coming back from a bar in Ashland, Wisconsin and we were driving really late at night and it was star less and it was pitch\n\nYou couldn't see past the headlights on on the road and even with the bright lights it was like the forest on each side with just swallowed and darkness\nSo after driving for probably thirty five forty minutes it became very apparent that we needed a rest stop and there was nothing there were no roadside parks there are no little towns [noise]\nMy friend Bob who was driving federal we could just pull off to the side now I Walk with a cane and that's not really an option for me I don't have\nA poor plumbing and I told him no way I Can't do that\nI just said please just drive fast and we'll find something to open\nAnd then when we turned down onto the new highway we came up over hill and there we could see this red right illuminated neon lights\nOn the side of the road and that was the road ...\n...\nAnd it had to the beer lives in the windows in cars in the parking lot now mind you this is like almost three o'clock in the morning and my friend Bob Said oh this is great all the locals are talking about this place because they've recently had an artist from Disney studios paint one of the big walls in a mirror\n[noise]\nAnd as we open the door there was this big dance floor that had um one of those horseshoe shaped bars and on the far wall was this mural and it was a Old West scene\nI scanned the room and there weren't a lot of people there they were like three ladies sitting to my right wrist cocktails in front of them there were a couple of guys playing pool off to my left and there was a bartender\nStanding there this young man leaning on the verge of smiling at us and everybody was looking at us like\nThey were expecting us and it was it that was something\nThat was very unlike any other bar I've walked into up north I'm usually when you walk in people turn away\n[noise]\nSo um after I came out of the bathroom Bob handed me a beer and we decided\nTo go look more closely at the mural far far\nAs we did that another young man went to the ... and that's where I notice that the jukebox with one of the old\nWorld War two Juke boxes that has the forty five vinyl records in it and it was a Butte it did not like it was born and he put a quaint and the jukebox and the record Wednesday and it started playing [noise]\n\n\nTwist again like he did last summer by Chevy checkers and he comes walking a chance as you want to dance and he's got a year in his hand and he's kind of teetering a little bit and I had the perfect excuse I just pointed to my cannon said sorry I Can't dance [noise]\nAnd we went over to the euro and\nIt was a saloon scene and on one side of it there were those swinging saloon doors there were um\nWomen sitting at a bar and there were gamblers sitting at a gambling table and it was really unusual it was it seems like it had perspective but it was really unusual garish perspective\nThe colors were very harsh it was almost like floor Lynch so it was like almost tunnel like but not quite but then\nI noticed Bob turned to his right and look behind me and then back at the painting and I said what and he said look at those guys\nAnd I started to walk towards that little spot in the creek\nAnd I I was taking my time 'cause I was calling down and I was just listening to the birds and sounds and just call me like that's all I was thinking about you know the argument I just had and what I wanted to do and should break off and all the stupid things that go through your head\nAnd\nAnd then I started realizing it got really quiet [noise] like I didn't\nHear the birds anymore in here the squirrels bouncing around the leaves and then I heard something big moving through the woods\nSemi I've seen in my head on my TV it's a dog see\nAnd then I heard voices\nAnd the first voice is a male voice and he said\nI Know I saw her going this way she couldn't have gotten that far and then the second voice comes and it's quieter and it says ... she'll hear you [noise]\nOkay so there's two men and watch now\nThey must be looking for something obviously they're they're looking for something and I kept thinking it must be adults are looking for their dogs that makes sense of course they must have lost their dog and are driving around looking for it and then I thought they wouldn't be being quiet they wouldn't try to sneak up on it they'd be whistling they'd be calling\nAnd I I stood there frozen kiss that's the kind of person I Am I'm the deer that stands in front of your car staring into your headlights and doesn't [noise]\nSeems\nLike it's still hear them coming closer to me through the woods I could hear the trees so snapping twigs as they were walking in and leave crunchy even know how long I sit there but I I was completely\nFrozen waiting for them to get to me [noise]\nI heard the other voice\nIt was distorted like like if you heard somebody talking through a closed door or or talking underwater like you could hear what you could understand kind of what they were saying but yeah the voice wasn't right\nWasn't in my head because it had like a volume in a pitch that changed that my\nThoughts don't do maybe other people started to change in in volume when they get upset but mine are very monotone so\nI could almost feel where the boys was coming from like you if you someone yells you can kind of feel where they're standing out like where the sound comes from and it was it was behind me in a little above like like it was taller than me\nIt just said go to the river now\nI don't know if I was more scared of the fact that there's some distant body voice talking to me or maybe there's a person behind me now and there's two men coming towards me in the woods I don't know which scared me more I mean I I guess I\nI listen to the voice because [noise]\nI don't know I didn't really have other options [noise]\nI took off towards the river and I was making a ton of noise 'cause I was just running as fast as I could and the voice came back right away so quiet quietly and almost ... almost like his dad we want to set it [noise]\nI got to the river was and where the sullen bank that was and I just jumped down instead of climbing down like I should've I ended up cutting my legs up in the process and\nAnd I squashed myself against the embankment and and squeeze down into the smallest Titus little\nBall I possibly could and the voice just kept saying really quietly to stay [noise]\nAnd I just sat there\nHoping that that whoever else was in the woods was just going to leave and that\nI wasn't having some kind of break down\n\nAnd I kept hearing them moving through the woods and closer and closer and then\nI could tell the it's split off because one sound was going further away and one was coming much closer and as I say I sat there that voice just kept telling me stay stay\nQuiet\nOver and over again like like it was almost trying to comfort me [noise]\nI could hear what sounded to me like [noise] like someone was right above me [noise] and I knew if I leaned out [noise] if someone was up there they'd be able to see me\nCouldn't help myself I had to look to see if something was there so I just hope that my ... just a tiny bit\nI could see the tips of these construction boots hanging over the edge of the embankment and then I could see hanging down next to them this dirty old rope just swinging there [noise]\n\nAnd I don't I don't even know if I even thought anything at that point like I was just so scared I just tilted my head back down and just try to not breeze [noise]\nI felt like ours but I Know it couldn't have been that long but it just seemed forever and even then like the voice even was completely silent like there was nothing but me hearing this man breathing above me and I guess\nHe didn't look down because he started to walk away at some point [noise]\nAnd that voice came back and it kept telling me to wait and I I I didn't want to I wanted to go so bad that I I just said well I'm already hearing voices\nHave people in the ones who the rope looking for something [laughter] just soon as me at this point and I might as well just listen so I I waited and waited\nAnd finally the voice said go now to the field golf [noise]\nWhen it was screaming at me so loud I jumped just from how loud it was and I climbed up the embankment\nAnd I ran through the woods I didn't care about being quiet torn up by foreign bushes and tree branches and everything and I saw it out to the field\nFar far far away from the cars and from the street and at this point the sun's starting to go down it's getting dark and I could\nSee the parking lot but it was so far away and I knew there was limited chance anybody on the street could see me [noise]\nThat are running and I start hearing footsteps running in the field loud so I can hear them in their first or farther away but they're much\nFaster than I Am so much faster than I Am ... barreling down on me at this point [noise] and the only thing I have is my car keys and I'm like you know what I'm not going down like this so I I put the car keys and I I did what my dad was just told me to have the ... the keys between each one of your knuckles\nI had my fist all falls off and I'm like I'm going to at least see this\nPerson I'm not going to just let them take me and I saw it around with the keys in my office footsteps or right on top of me [noise]\nAnd there was nothing nothing I\nFully expect it to see them but at least one of the men there but it was silent no no more footsteps no anything and the only thing I could think was\nThe footsteps must belong to the voice somehow [noise]\nAnd then I hear the voice again just ... at the top of his lungs that I Need to Ron right now\nAnd I immediately hear the footsteps again so I'm looking as I'm running now but I Can't see anything and the footsteps are literally and he's with me now like like something is running next to me through the fields ...\nI'm thinking of my head I'm like I don't know I guess this is how people die like I mean I have like thousands crazy thoughts running through my head because none of this makes sense yeah finally\nI write down to the field I did my car\nGot my keys in the ignition as fast as I could [noise]\nAnd I see both the cars that have been running that we're leaving are now parked in different places\nBut nobody in them I had like cuts and scrapes from you know the embankment and climbing back up all the rocks and and running through the storm bushes and I definitely remember my tires making squeeze which sounds as I backed up way faster than I should have\nAnd I I just said out of there and I used to look behind me in the rearview mirror I just kept picturing like in every bad scary movie there's that person that you see in the rearview mirror and I'm like I'm not going to have an image of them on me\n[laughter]\nNo no I don't ever wish to hear it again because I assume if I Do I'm In a really bad place I sue if I ever hear it again something really terrible what's happening I mean don't get me\nWrong if there hadn't been a voice I probably wouldn't be talking to you I Would probably be a missing persons case somewhere and somebody who's drawer\nI can only assume it meant good things I mean it got me out of there\n[noise]\n\n", "show_name": "It's Been a Minute", "year": "2018", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "28"}
