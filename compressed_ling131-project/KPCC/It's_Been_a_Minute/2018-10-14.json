[laughter]\nAnd later the best things that happens to our listeners all week first business\nLife from NPR News in Culver City California I'm Shannon been sent to clean up from hurricane Michael continues across several states at least fourteen people have died but rescuers have not yet reached some of the hardest hit areas NPR's Quil Lawrence is in Mexico Beach Florida\nOf patent it and and also it just comes up in conversation and move on\nThe young Bob Mondello mhm would that young Bob ever imagined Bob today coming out to rooms of strangers by captured imaging his husband no yeah no that that uh that was beyond the pale\nBoo boos\nThanks again to Bob Mondello will here a few more coming out story throughout the show today including some from you our listeners\nFor our lives the brief conversation\nShe said you mean to tell me you like other men and I said yes ma'am and she said why\nDidn't I didn't grow out of it and ah I'm Hal a game on the ground for more of that [noise]\n\nWant to take some time now to talk to the history of coming out day as we know it now to do that and I sat down with professor Marci Gallo hello hello how are you\nHave to go I'm great is Sam Sam Oh I'm so excited and you can call me Marcy Marcy wonderful wonderful\nMarcia even associate professor of history at the University of Nevada Las Vegas she specializes in race gender sexuality and social justice movements she told me to understand how coming out got its own day you have to understand the history of the gay rights movement\nYou might think that began in the sixties but Marcy told me the roots of this activism we can actually see them decades earlier\nYou know I Would go back to the post World War two period okay and the world war two some people say because it broke down social norms in such a huge way because remember it was a war against hate it was a war against discrimination I we were fighting the Nazis\nAnd then you see these black men come back and they fought for freedom elsewhere and they can't be treated as free people at home\nExactly exactly so the impetus for the civil rights movement there is a direct connection between the black civil rights movement and a lesbian and gay movement\nMany of the early activists were either in the civil rights movement who if they were white or black or they were working against the war in Vietnam and the other thing that's happening\nAnd I think they started to realize I'm hey you know we're a minority to mhm I'm lesbian and gay people are treated horribly and maybe it's time for us to organize and start playing for like\nYou know in speaking of coming out it is\nVery easy I think to assume that this is the thing that people always did but cultural notions of sexuality and defining sexuality have changed and there was a time when the whole the very concept of defining it are are declaring one sexuality wasn't the thing right\nNow right exactly you know for for gay folks I think the whole idea of coming out is is very much a sort of a more contemporary kind of concept when I was doing research on the first lesbian rights organization the ... leader\nWho started in fifty five Nineteen fifty five in San Francisco\nThey didn't use that term and all they didn't even require that people um announce their their sexuality any woman could join your organization but when they did refer to be talked about taking off the mask\nWhich I really I think that's such a great visual wait for the coming out stuff I think might have been a\nSort of a thing with gay men I'm In and certainly you know the the obvious connotation right is around um society like debutante coming out parties would they would be presented to society well that wasn't my world [laughter]\nAnd it was in the world ... funniest story before I was I actually was an escort for a friend to her debutante ball\nAnd you learn how to love it I was little rent attacks than it was him trying to make something happened\nThat was going to happen that grade to grade story right so that when people say coming and I'm like what do you mean like you have you done this way but it really gets popularized ... isn't sure you know is in actually in the seventies yes when Harvey Milk says you've got to come out\nAnd they gave her come out [noise]\nThat he was openly gay member of Memphis before the supervisor [noise]\nAh but this tape is him from Nineteen Seventy eight a he was marking the defeat of props six and ... that were banned gays and lesbians from teaching in schools there [noise]\nYou tell your immediate family you must tell you how you're going to have your friends how your people you work [noise]\nSo interesting because I think I think when I hear that the top of that [laughter] [noise]\nWhat we are in the children that we are in the area where every every every anywhere do\nI think he's right I think he was right about the more we were up front about who we were the more it\nWould shake up the misconceptions and to start on the personal level with family and friends and coworkers that had to start to break down some of the stereotypes about you know six sinful crazy kind of stuff that was there much attached to gay people still\nAnd so you know ten years after that\nIt was five years ago but now my relationship with my mom had gotten a lot better um\nHer and I have a lot of different ill but at the same time you know I hate the lines you know your mother but she is so my mother and now I Am in a loving wonderful\nRelationship with my heart and more than I ever could have thought I ever would have been able to have\n... uh I usually might there be no [laughter] [noise]\n[noise]\n... anger in St Clair county Illinois for sharing her story\nYou're listening to it's been a minute for NPR I'm Sam Sanders today we're exploring coming out in honor of national coming out day which was this past week on October eleventh when I came\nOut to my mother in Nineteen Ninety six or when I was around twenty six and my mother is thirty five years older than I Am then she's from the south and you know a very southern and a religious and so I was very nervous about coming out\nThat's Patrick Johnson is a share of African American studies at Northwestern University in Chicago is coming out story really highlights how different coming out can be for people of color we sat down and talk about why that's the case but first the rest of his story\nI waited till we're about to go to Barry watching late evening news and I said mom has something to tell you something I wanted to talk to you about for a long time and up and afraid to and she said\nIn a very kind of dramatic voice what have you done\n[laughter] [noise] and\nI said I haven't done anything I'm gay and then her response was really interesting she said\nYou mean to tell me you like other men [noise] and I said yes ma'am and she said why and I said well mom has been a time when you felt attracted to another woman and she sort of frowned and thought about and she said no and I said well neither have I. [laughter]\n\nWatch video that she said well if that's the way you are you know I I guess I just have to accept that you're my son and I love you but that actually wasn't the truth I mean it was true that you love me but it she wasn't quite a being truth about accepting it because\nIt would probably be another decade before she really accepted me um and that all came to a head at my commitment ceremony with my partner now husband\n... and um she wasn't going to come at initially but she decided to come and not only did she come she walked in with me and that was a real turning point for her because\nMost of the people in attendance at our commitment ceremony we're straight\nAnd in some ways I think that gave her permission for to be okay and say that\nWell when I after I came out here for instance she didn't talk to anybody about it not not even her closest friends 'cause I think there was a lot of\nShame or around it um because of uh her reputation our community and also who I was you know I'm the first\nAfrican American born in my little hometown um to receive a PHD and ... my hometown celebrated that accomplishment with giving me my own day wow what you're on TALK Hickory North Carolina okay\nAnd so you know so there was a lot of hope and dreams invested in each Patrick Johnson a but not gay ... is it all good now with our rovers yeah it's a it's a love fest\nWow I Will never forget my mother\n... I mean literally like was born and we're in a chapel kept like just pack awesome we this was before I was coming out\nAnd I don't know how it happened but I put on Brokeback Mountain when it was like happening while and I was like I'm going to hear from her and I'll never forget she watched the whole movie\nHas like oh my gosh I'm inclined to home the [noise] the movie and I look over she is ... Ryan ... and I look at her and I was like well what's the matter in this Pentecostal church organist like so saved looks at me and says and through tears like choking back tears\nWell I just don't get why those who can't be together ...\nUh so strange it was so strange anyway ... people contain multitudes even church absolutely\nHearing Patrick gel his story thinking about my own story it made me wonder why the idea of some grant coming out there's always felt to me at least like a thing that just for white people\nEspecially given what we heard from Dr Marcy Gallo earlier how the gay rights movement really grew out of the civil rights struggle of people of color and this post World war two activism also led by people of color given those roots wires coming out felt so white\nTo speak to that question you have to go back to slavery\nWhen you think about black women being raped and made to bear their masters children\nOr having their own children taken away from them or a black man being lynched or a limb being cut off for just a suspicion of looking at a white woman\nYou have the ingredients for some pretty messed up psychological and emotional trauma around once body where your sexuality\nIn particular is always under surveillance or doesn't even belong to you\nYeah well and and and like that could lead to obviously black people feeling as if their sexuality and owning their sexuality isn't really there on\nExactly so if you think about coming out of slavery into post reconstruction there was a a movement among the black middle class in particular to counter the images of black people as savages as\nThere wasn't an adoption of Victorian mores and values\nBut what that meant was adopting what is now known in in mostly academic circles as the politics of black respectability\nWhere a women for instance with you know wear gloves and long dresses and um there was a whole sense of propriety a gambling and drinking and those kinds of things were just about a\nComing is still like yes that that always gives me pause is like black people consume cleaning products writ large more than their demo yeah because you want you to make sure that you look and smell and feel clean to the wife of all of that\nYou know is if you think about the historical context is about you know making sure you present yourself in a respectable way\nWould eat Patrick Johnson he's the chair of the African American studies department at Northwestern university\nMore of our conversation after a break a black man and being on quote the down [noise] one coming out story from a transgender lives you know [noise] I'm Sam Sanders you're listening to it's been in in in the hour we'll be right back [noise]\n... from the anchor of ABC I Love both sides because Jesse's enthusiasm and excitement for gas and culture he talks about is totally catching an infectious\nBy Jesse ... this week we're talking with actress Sarah Jessica Parker in comic and writer print gathered that's I'm ...
