I'm going to science friday the world may not be logical but that doesn't mean we can't have more logical political disagree from welfare to health care a mathematician breaks it down your junior Chang author of the art of logic tells us how much it can help us agree\nOr at least disagree more hopefully\nIt's on science friday from WNYC studio\nNow on Sunday nights at seven or eighty nine point three hate PCC\nThis is eighty nine point three Cape PCC Pasadena Los Angeles or community service of Pasadena city called World War two hundred programs offer students the ability to dream\nDo learn more Pasadena dot edu from NPR I'm Sam Sanders it's been a minute\n\nPolitics right now is inescapable follows us everywhere this week there's new evidence to support that idea photos are released a reactor Christian Bale portraying Dick Cheney and an upcoming movie about Dick Cheney also a new Broadway play was announced it's all about Hillary Clinton\nI was so conflict as it when I saw the news yesterday about the Clinton play\nWho can't get away from the stuff I for one like my pop culture totally free from politics but\nAt my panel pointed out you don't always get what you want\nI have heard that a Scaramucci has put on a Broadway play about probably off Broadway okay and musical [laughter]\nWe'll give you more headlines from the ... that was an ... of that scare moved to a musical after this news\n\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Jim hawk President Trump is celebrating the confirmation of his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh who was sworn in during a private ceremony Saturday Night as NPR's Tamara Keith reports this follows a bruising fight\nI I really think that last Thursday was a a really bad day for the court\nThat that was not a person who I can see on the Supreme Court like ... ... it was\nBrazen out and out intentionally acrimonious partisanship if you remember when when Justice Ginsburg like made those comments about Trump during the campaign she actually did pull back and\nThen ... and I imagine that that was the result of a a conversation with the chief justice\nSo what's your take on all this as someone watching it but not particularly covering up\nMm it's hard to say the memory of a new cycle\nIs extremely short these days um so I I hadn't I hate to say that if I'm Brett Kavanaugh becomes the new Supreme Court justice that you know Twenty years later this moment in history won't be perceived um much differently than you know the Anita Hill hearings\nYou know fast is the thing that we kinda just shrug off now right so I hesitate to say that it will have some kind of transformative moment but I also don't discount the possibility that it will be transformative moment um I think we have to see how exactly the nomination play that\nOne big difference that I think is part of the change times is I mean remember when Justice Thomas took the bench there was only one other woman on the court and I was a a woman appointed by a Republican president Justice Sandra Day O'Connor\nUm I mean after last week right if Brett Kavanaugh joins the court he's going to be joining a court with with three justices who I mean I'm sure Justice Sotomayor has\nJust said to have had some thoughts yeah we should say here were taping this Friday morning so you might hear this after we know for sure whether Brett Kavanaugh has been confirmed for a seat on the Supreme Court are going to go next my three words or California versus Trump and I say that because\nUh the issue that I ... the most about his ended up talking about ... all you know you know I Love\nThe silence he hears me leaving the room\nAnd I'm not talking about it as a tech reporter but I'm going to make you talk about it a little bit bringing it up and talking about California because\nUh the Trump Justice Department this week sued the state of California to block California's new net neutrality law the back story is a few months ago the administration rolled back existing net neutrality rules and California in response said we'll make our own\nI think a before we go anywhere else with this I'm going to let the tech reporter tell us in a nutshell what net neutrality is so\nUh I think the line that I sent you guys with someone said to me on Twitter I I think this week last week I don't know it's always together these days um is that new net neutrality for the tech reporters and the tech lobbyists world is like the Internet version of hotel California has the issue has been going on\nFor ten plus years yeah but anyways the long story short is neutrality rules but off the books are in the summer\nAnd neutrality rules previously a established Internet service providers were not allowed to make your website blood flow where they were not allowed to charge a little extra\nFor slightly faster speeds loading speeds they weren't allowed to strike deals\nWith like Netflix to get your Netflix slightly faster than your Hulu similarly I'm In California case what California brought back our all of those rules plus an addition one other ruled that prohibited I'm like of arising from giving you access to Hulu that wouldn't count toward your data restrictions\nSo basically I'm California was saying these ISPs these service providers can't play favorites which is the basic kind of like in a nutshell ...\nI'd like to I like to describe it as how much power should your Internet service provider have over your experience\nSo then so California puts these rules in place on the state level\nThe Trump deejay sous but the bigger point for me is that this is yet\nAnother example of California showing a type of resistance to Trump that may not be the first thing that we think about when we say the word resistance like we say that word we think of people on the ground protesting but there is a resistance to the Trump White house coming from state houses\nChris what does this kind of legal resistance how effective is\nI mean a lot of it is from the ages from California a jeep Sarah it's from uh New York AG Barbara Underwood\nAlso there have been some some counties Santa Clara county in California San Francisco county you basically have always had this I mean if you remember all of Texas law suits against stop on DACA under the Obama administration has this has been\nBuilt the way for the age of the other party of the president to sort of try and say we're back to our dual sovereignty\nThey it it states trying to say we want to do our thing and we should be allowed to do so um is that more effective than protesters just on the ground saying stop Donald Trump I mean I think they're two totally different things they I think that the\nReality of what Trump has done has led to a lot of lawsuits that probably regardless of the the\nEnvironment on the ground democratic ... would have fought back against but the the fact is that in a liberal state you cannot go wrong\nAlso Alina yeah you're an old pro at this game basically I Will share three\nQuotes from the week you can guess who said it or what story I'm Talking about or a key word I'm not a stickler and the winner of this game gets absolutely nothing oh good [laughter] it's going to be great it's going to be great ready for the first one\nOkay no [laughter]\nWell here we go here we go we'll try it first quote I cannot deny that women made a great achievement over the past century there is significant progress recorded by people who study women status throughout history\nIs it something Nobel Prize early\nAh no not at all [laughter] did either of you see any headlines about a really weird article an in flight magazine oh oh my God yes this was the Drew Barrymore article\nYes you got it bad so in Egypt airs in flight magazine this month there was an interview with Drew Barrymore\nBut it turns out the entire interview seems to be fate\nI'm Sorry what like she never spoke to them and they just made it\nSo when ... Drew Barrymore is PR team said that she never did the interview a Egypt Air is not backing down from this interview they say it was conducted by the ... president of the Hollywood press association but the thing is when you read the interview the English is very\nBad and it just does not at all seem like a kind of conversation that Drew Barrymore would\nGive you two questions one is did they just interview\nSomeone else that they confused with you\nAnd if if they actually made up the whole thing then why did they make up an interview with\nDrew Barrymore there were pictures and everything yeah there were pictures\nOf birds are like they talk about Drew Barrymore before they get into the quotes from her the fake quotes from her and the articles opens up this way ... literally quote\nDespite the several unsuccessful marriages and despite the busy life of stardom but not in her life for several years the beautiful American Hollywood actress Drew Barrymore has recently decided to temporary taken unlimited vacation to play her most crucial role as mother while\nThey were they did they just look up some other Drew Barrymore and that was it was that this\nWas legit though there's a version of his article but also appeared in another Arabic publication which raises the possibility that those quotes had been translated from English to Arabic been back in ... with that just makes it even ... this is a crazy story I've seen in the last few months\nLike make your own adventure me\nToo yeah so Chris you're up ones that you would have thought for anything so proud of you [laughter] second quote is uh just tell me what it's about what the what the story keywords are the quote is sometimes your child's gender identity is actually fire\nUnlike star in the lion king hunted you'd better be prepared I'm Sorry what\nWhat story this week involves fire and babies and child's gender identity\nOh it's the guy who said the cuts were doing it was doing a gender viewing party and set the whole force our\nJob all you know that's all I have about that story that is exactly what it is he was a border patrol does that what\nHe's a border patrol and he was off duty his name is Dennis Dickey he's from Arizona and he says it was all a mistake what he wanted to do was shoot at this target that contained Tanner right which is explosive\nSo that when he shot the ... it would explode and you would see this explosion of blue or this explosion of pink and that would reveal the child's gender the explosion was too explosive it started a fire\nThat got so big fire got so big it got to name the sawmill fire nearly eight hundred firefighters had to fight this fire consumed more than forty five thousand acres of land\nI mean I cannot I definitely did that story um I Know that I just\nAsked I had no idea that there was a whole quote on the story about the gender yang fire oh\nWell so that actually was from a humor writer Erik ... he wrote kind of a purity article about this story a lot of al magazine and she kind of made us all chuckle about how absurd these into revealed parties can\nBe yeah I mean it started with cakes and then in progress into like balloon really says out of boxes flags flying in this guy and there was\nOne where this father had an alligator for the gym to reveal a party and he had a watermelon that he put in the alligators mouse\nAnd the watermelon was filled with either blue dye or pink die when the alligator bit down on the watermelon the pink or blue color would lose out of the watermelon to reveal the gender\nIs not a word I hear about ten or are you tired\nI don't get it at all and like I Want to understand and I just try to understand I don't understand that's\nA party you know it's there it's a reason to celebrate I get it I haven't read an alligator at a party but the name of it is I mean a lot of people go overboard planning parties\nSo fair play that [laughter] we're tied up and you guys are tied one to one okay [laughter]\nThis is when we were all the marbles ready okay the last quote is every night\nThe cue for donuts is unbelievable lights noises pollution and horns all Street's blocked in all cars honking at once all night\nEvery night what's that about who said that where is it\nMore than I thought you said ... what kind of on it I said don't as what kind of doughnuts which which which brand Doug\nDunkin' Donuts not Duncan crispy cream yes [laughter] yes there are there any other don't know what I mean there is either do that\nBut those are like the only do leg Shane way though I was ...\nGo get Krispy Kreme donuts made news across\nThe pond I'm a town in Ireland called Blanchard town\nA a suburb of Dublin they got a new crispy cream with a twenty four hour drive through and the twenty four hour drive through at Krispy Kreme was so rowdy they had to shut it down\nSo that quote was from a resident from this place Blanchard town talking about how the noise from the drive through line but he is Krispy Kreme donuts has been too much\n... indoor and them just Jonah it's\nNo here's the thing people would be in line for the donuts but they would keep honking their horns\n[noise] [laughter] oh I think that the army I get your call their [laughter]\nAnother residents said since the grand opening\nThey haven't had proper sleep at night are we talking about like at like at far close like Taco Bell but like they were gone for crispy cream at like three in the morning thanks so I mean if I could go get Krispy Kreme donuts twenty four hours a day I'd probably be there was word ours too but I've never in my life Hans\n... met a woman who sat in front of a crispy cream for I think close to three days\nTo be the first one in so she could get a lifetime supply of Krispy Kreme donuts for herself and her family they are good donuts they argue done for a lifetime supply\nI can get that\nGet behind that random friday night meeting the Hong my harm or I guess [laughter] um you know what this means yeah\nYour way and why might grand prize of nothing not even a crispy cream that might be around\nThis portion of the show is over and\nTo say
