Bush doing the same thing but a nicer words\nRight and doing the sort of due diligence of sitting down with a K. you know once a year or saying we care about human rights uh-huh shouldn't have jail this blogger that's bad and it's almost like you sort of go through the motions and everybody knows that it's like that thing but still it's that thing you do right now they're really the motions yeah you were going out that\nThere's a strategic reasons for why we're still literally holding hands with the Saudis yeah you know that they are a military ally\nAnd I'll tell you one reason why I said this is scary yeah you know I'm I have lived in countries where journalists are called enemies of the people and we see what happens when journalists are called enemies of the people just Thursday night at a rally you know President Trump is defending\nA congressman from Montana who attacked a journal yeah um I don't want to live in this world I don't want this world to come home in the country that I thought I was safe and\nYou're listening to it's been emitted from NPR the show where we catch up on the week that was here we are too great yesterday Karen Grigsby Bates correspondent for NPR's Code switch team and Kelly McEvers host of NPR's embedded care and do you have\nThree words uh yeah I'm kind of tired of the whole business but my three words would be it's my history what's that and that came from Senator Elizabeth Warren\nA\nStory okay it it started Monday and I'm already filled like I've been living this saga for a year for\nTwo years because candidate Donald Trump or after she mentioned I think in twenty sixteen that she had Native American ancestry that she came from Oklahoma I Believe the jirga and you know turkey territory the president's started calling her Pocahontas which\nLed her to this week on Monday releasing a five minute video that one says revealed the results of a DNA test that she took which found quote strong evidence that she has a Native American ancestry dating back six to ten generations\nI'm not enrolled and thrive in only trying to determine tribal citizenship and I understand and respect that stinks your family history is my family history\nSo basically she's saying yeah you know I have always been told this story and my family was told by my mom and dad by my mama and papa they've always said you know this is what it is and I can take it if you're bashing me don't be talking about my family yeah\nBut the strangest thing to me in this entire saga Karen is that it seems as if Senator Warren never actually consulted the Cherokee Nation before she did this yeah it has had so they had the ... yeah and as she put the video out they said actually\nWhen people use DNA to assert tribal identity your ancestry is insulting to us because that's not the method that we use that's not how old is your little thing yes now than just ... right yeah\nAnd you haven't lived this way or had the experience that we've had so it's kind of hard for you to come out and say that I interviewed a a\nSociologist who also does a lot of work with DNA at Columbia her name was Alondra Nelson and she said the problem with doing these DNA tests and then claiming oh I'm really German instead of Italian or I'm really whatever is that\nDNA is technical an identity is social exactly we can't really makes it to their running a parallel track\nAnd she got to live an entire life was a white woman mhm and get whatever you get out of that also it's like the one time we have a national\nConversation about native people they're centered on white people have bills\nWe're I mean in some ways it's like going forward how should we talk well and also the question because there was this weird thing in American culture of like I've got you know my great great grandmother was a Cherokee princess or something like that really awkward I mean people I think to say it less and less but like\nYou know is it time to just sort of reckon with all of that and like actually learn the history yeah\nWhich tribes inter married in which tribes didn't and what does that mean and what does it mean to the trap where and even if that wasn't at us and that is to say that in America probably only about five percent of us have really any native blood at ...\nUh I have three words okay they are no not yet okay what does that mean I was talking about\nBut you know that people are going to see these hopes that he's in his headlines and a lot of folks are going to say this is the reason why we need to shut down gender studies programs and ... and re studies programs and\nAnd and like you know that's going to happen\nYeah but if we if we made the decision to act entirely based on the way that bad actors might make use of our work we could never really do anything that touches a controversial issue at all just the right wing wants to misuse our work to do this\nThen it's on par with what we're exposing in in these academic departments what we're after here is the truth what we're Africa is better conversations\nYeah one of a thought experiments your hopes studies a launched me on was trying to create hypothetical hoax studies about public radio [laughter] give me a hypothetical hoax studied title about my line of work\nAbout your line we're above public radio yeah you'd have to put a catchy thing on the front I'm into like a year chose called it's been a minute so we could call it it's been a minute too long and that would be the main title a\nMuslim titled have to be something along the lines of how how well in terms of conversations on public radio perpetuate America's racial divide\nThat study I'm curious I'm curious I can\nMake it up for you [laughter] well ... oh okay\nOkay James Lindsey a thank you for speaking with me I Am sure we'll hear a lot from our listeners but I look forward to it think Sam I think\nThose are great [laughter]\n[noise]\nThanks again to James we're talking with this um [noise] I think my biggest question with all of this is All right if you're trying to push these fields to greater truth how do you get there through these lives fried raise hopes the studies if it helps I Know\nI'm so tired of hoaxes like in this post truth era like we need more troops not laugh yeah I get I get really upset about Sacha Baron Cohen and\nNow I really do like I've posing as a journalist yeah and you know the more of that we have um it just undermines the business of truth altogether I think yeah\nYou're listening to it's been a minute from NPR the show where we catch up on the week that was I'm Sam Sanders here with two guests today Kelly McEvers host of NPR's embedded in Karen Grigsby Bates correspondent for NPR's Code switch team uh I Am so happy to have you both in Studio\nHere so happy to be happy to be here it is time for my favorite game hopefully I'll say ... to ... who said that\nWhy this is your favorite thing is that yeah [laughter]\nThe rules are quite simple but the game is quite hard I should I quote in the week you have to guess who said that or at least get a key word the story I'm Talking about the winter as you know gets absolutely nothing [laughter] that's probably the best prize first quote\nFilled the center of the rolling paper with your ground candidate is distributed evenly so that your joint\nDoes not resemble a hill with a bold in the middle\nWas

legalizing marijuana for recreational use amongst all Canadians and it is a government endeavors so the government is telling the we'd at their own dispensaries and some provincial government said

sweet ... who got them okay Karen got that went up ones that\nAre next quote all of us\nRead heads in the u._k. are wildly excited\nOh because of the new royal baby yeah man I\nSaid I got to ask that I didn't know she was pregnant you know she was pregnant by her red headed husband yes there is some they'll hire foreigners that they will be a red hit again what they may be not prepared for is if

questions like well this may be black will it be redhead and I'm like it'll be rich [laughter] it doesn't matter and it was a baby\nVery very low yeah yeah so that may be per day is going to die like around looking for a picture great granted a little bit with this little brown baby on her lap\nLast quote ready okay I ain't dead snitches I'm using another word for the radio yeah [laughter] who was killed off in something this week oh oh this is Roseanne\nYea for three decades you never hear for three\nMile over here and the only reason I remember is because I was actually looking through the

moody\nSo back story um a few months ago\nHer iconic show Ryan was re booted out so that show was on the air but it was cancelled because of Roseanne Barr as frequently with race says one one we
