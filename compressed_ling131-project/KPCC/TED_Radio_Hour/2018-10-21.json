dinner but we don't always think about how that food got there or how certain forces shaped the choices we make in the supermarket\nSo then the show ideas about how we connect with food why we eat certain things and not others and with the future of food and may look or rather taste like\n[noise]\nOne thing ... showed in time Martin was health food could spark a change in every part of people's

markets your local farmers your local you know food businesses rather than we are thinking and not meaning any hum nipping to the supermarket and buy something in a plastic bags at Sloan all over the world\nBut I'm curious because like to be able to do some time more than I mean that the north of England does not have like the the greatest farmland in the world right\nWe snakes now is is very much you know it's it's absolutely ... but we just talk about food to get people talking you know because ...\nThere'll be decreasing amount of land in many parts of the world that we can grow our food on but we still need defeat us out\nSo we need to think about coming from rooftops will of course we can come and go besides the buildings when of course we kept I'm well I think it's that happened over the last nine years of people are certainly open their eyes to space and seeing their environments in a completely different way and sought to grow food on that [noise]\nBut it's fantastic so\nEven in

dot com [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] okay so fruits and vegetables in every corner and Todd more than that\nReal food right at the problem is that in most modern supermarkets especially in America that is not what we eat\nYou know it's it's sort of the hands how you define things but I Would say a minimum of forty percent of the of the stuff and Americans whose markets wouldn't really qualify as food by the\nDictionary definitions ... percent wouldn't qualify sued well if you think of food food than the definition of food is something that sustains and nurses and yeah the and the definition of nourishment is something that um increases your health\nSo if something is not increasing your health but make you ill it doesn't really need the dictionary definition of food\nIs is food writer and cookbook author Mark Bittman his most famous cookbook actually one of the best selling of all time is simply called how to cook everything do people hug you and airports [laughter] it's happened\nHad that not often but yeah it's happened anyway much as that most of what we eat today isn't real food but it wasn't always like that has not getting in on the head stage\nA hundred years ago I guess what everyone was a locavore every family how to cook usually a mom and those moms bought and prepared food it\nWas like your romantic vision of Europe [noise]\nThere was no snack food and until the twenties until Clarence birds I came along\nThere was no frozen food [noise]\nMargarine didn't exist\nWhen margarine was invented several states pass laws declaring that have had to be died tank so we all know that it was a fake\nThere were no restaurant chains needing ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic [noise]\nIn those days there was no philosophy of food you're just aids you didn't claim to be anything fats cards proteins they weren't bad or good their food you ate\nHardly anything can pay more than one ingredient because it was an ingredient the corn flakes hadn't been invented the pop tart the ... cheese whiz none of that stuff goldfish slap\nAnd again everyone aid local in New York and orange was a common Christmas presents because they came all the way from Florida\nFrom the thirties on road systems expand the trucks took the place of railroads fresh fruit began to travel more oranges became common in New York the south and west became agricultural hubs and in other parts of the country suburbs took over farmland\nThe effects of us are well known there everywhere and the death of family farms as part of this puzzle as is almost everything from the demise of the real community to the challenge of\nFinding a good tomato even in summer\nEventually California produce too much food to shift fresh so it became critical to market canned them frozen foods loss arrived convenience it was sold to produce feminist housewives as a way to cut down on housework would have cut down on the variety of food read as well many of us\nGrew up never eating a fresh vegetable I for one and I'm not kidding\nDidn't eat real spinach or broccoli till I was Nineteen who needed it to me it was everywhere what could be easier more filling her healthier for your family the boiling states but by then\nHad or already raised on naturally rather than spending their lives eating grass for which their stomachs were designed there were forced to eat sewing and corn they've troubled digesting those grains of course but that wasn't a problem for producers thanks to farm subsidies uh find\nCollaboration between agribusiness in Congress soy corn and cattle became king and chicken soon joined them on the throne\nLike that and then I'll be back in just a minute to explain why those foods has stayed so dominant for so long and why our relationship to food could be on the brink of another big change\nAnd guy rise and you're listening to the Ted radio hour\nFrom NPR an army veteran is facing a new battle with social media he

radio hour from NPR I'm Guy Raj and to on the show ideas about food a connection to it and its power to change so much\nAbout the way we live I just bought a bottle of water and I'm the label it said gluten free interest as\nWell and it is [laughter] ... says food writer Mark Bittman truth in advertising and marched in describing how over the past fifty years corn and soy and wheat had become staples of the western diet\nOne thing led to another corn and wheat and soy were easy to trade and easy to ship and easy to sell an easy to process\nAnd\nSo so how toxic as it well it causes disease number one type two diabetes K number two heart disease OK number three fatty liver disease which is actually the biggest epidemic on the planet\nAnd finally just decay so there are the for diseases where we have causation\nThere to diseases where we have correlation and so I don't talk about those much but we have correlation for sugar and cancer and sugar and dementia wow but we don't have causation yet\nBut people are working so so fruit is fine right I mean I you know I eat lots of fruit every morning so when you consume fruit you're getting the fiber with it and that's what's important is that that fiber\nNot be pulverized not be removed and of course that's a process food is you remove the fiber so basically get a whole for yeah oh yeah absolutely let's say you didn't consume a district let's say you consume that as a soda you can't metabolize it fast enough as it's coming\nAnd and so the liver has a pop off valve has a way of dealing with the access it turns that sugar into fact liver fat and we now know that it's that liver fat that drives all the chronic metabolic diseases that we have discussed except for the tooth decay\nSo what is the uh what is the daily recommended limit for like a an adult human for X. amount of sugar we should be having everyday\nWell depends on who you ask the world Health Organization originally said six teaspoons of added sugar production sounds reasonable well it is actually reasonable it's twenty five grams is not\nYou know an enormous amount but it should be enough but but they were lobbied so severely Bybee industry so they actually ended up liberalizing it from six to twelve teaspoons of sugar to\nOkay so so twelve a teaspoon today that sounds like a a lot like I Can't imagine what where the average amount sugar that an American or somebody in West consumes every day\nWe're now at Nineteen point five so you know we're consuming about fifty percent more on average than our upper limit right now\nThere are some people who are consuming thirty forty fifty teaspoons of added sugar ... so we've been sort of updating our sugar anti for many many years and of course that's why type two diabetes first became a huge problem in the Nineteen twenties and heart disease in the Nineteen thirties\nAnd then something happened in the Nineteen eighties high fructose corn syrup happened\nBut so is is corn syrup high for disclosure of worse than can sugar it's cheaper but they're both equally bad\nThey're both equally bad but if it's cheaper than it's worth and\nWhat that does is it also makes sugar cheaper because of the competition plus that was exactly at the same time the low fat directive came out of the U. S. D. A. and the FDA Nineteen Seventy seven the first dietary goals for Americans said eat less fat\nWell if you eat less fat the food tastes like cardboard the food industry knew that so what they do they pumped into sugar and now I've heard this corn syrup was cheaper so they could do it well let me give you an example of how this works ... my favorite product of all time lucky\nCharms yeah they're magically delicious Hadar right why are there marshmallows in the box 'cause they're delicious secondary by other marshmallows into the box or\nBecause they're fun to eat 'cause marshmallows or sheep and goats are expensive to take up more ruined the box and they can sell them for more wow great business strategy [noise]\n\nSo everyone says education educate the public as you get published tell what's going on except for one thing education hasn't worked for any other substance abuse the Nancy Reagan was just saying no work\nReally so where does that leave us everyone says wait a second don't tell me what to eat well you know what you've already been told what to eat\nWhere were you for the last forty years as your food supply was being changed under your nose where you're protesting then everyone says get government out of my kitchen you know I don't want my kitchen either unless there's somebody more dangerous already there\nOkay so the real question is who the hell do you want in your kitchen the government who will take your freedom and your wallet or the food industry who's already ticking your freedom your wallet and your health\nThat's your only choice\n\nSome given that choice what do we do ultimately we have to figure out how the food industry can still make money selling real food\nAnd the answers can absolutely they can but not with the current business model the food industry gross is one trillion dollars a year in the United states\nOf that four hundred and fifty billion of it is gross profit now health care costs in America total to point seven trillion dollars a year of which Seventy five percent\nIs chronic metabolic diseases of which Seventy five percent of that could be preventable if we would do something about our diet\nThat's one point four trillion dollars\nTriple what the food industry makes we spend triple cleaning up the food industry is mess than they actually make the bottom line is they're going to drive this bus till the wheels fall off the only answer\nIs real food we just have to figure out how to make it available and profitable for everyone\nAt that weight I'm assuming the sugar industry\nBut really hate you sure yeah they have in in ten words or less yeah they they love me yeah that's the way this works my job is to provide the science so that the public to make its own informed decision and then but\nNot many people are saying what you're saying I mean\nYou know look there's a lot of noise in the system for obvious reasons you've got all of these this ... of people with their own vested interests I have no vested interest other than taking care of children and seeing\nChildren get to adulthood to have a decent chance in life that's my vested interests and to be honest with you it ought to be everybody's tested interest [noise]\nSo are you just like totally anti sugar or do you like do you indulge still still a little bit\nOf course now and again the problem is\nI'm for dessert for dessert right but if you're going to have breakfast cereal with orange juice and take a priest son and a granola bar and that's all before three o'clock you know then you've got a problem\nMore\nOr less steak is a professor at the University of California in San Francisco you can see his entire talk at head that NPR dot org were back in just a minute stay with us on the show today ideas\nAbout how we connect to food I'm Guy Raz and you're listening to the Ted radio hour\nFrom NPR a face off on Facebook\nTriggered hornets now have women breastfeeding their kill on an ex radiolab\nThe teenage girl breast feeding a goat now that over two billion people are posting things on faith [noise]\nWho decides what we can see what we can't\nI have to rent that gets from either side of humankind whoa\nThat's on the next radiolab\nJoined us this afternoon for on eighty nine point three K PCC\nMore than nine hundred thousand weekly listeners turned to key PCC for their news we deliver quality programming all day every day support one hour of the programming you might find making a gift of twenty five hundred dollars AT T PC dot org slash leadership\nIs easy supporters include average in ... in the arts district Conde nast called it\nThe neighbors they far if your dreams offering a casual ... sales for a host work ... foreign aid that date night Marek E.
