under sort of brain that's how the brain works it's not\nIt isn't the survivors fault but um there's something adopted and ... and those you know in those moments of a questioning your behavior and if it's reinforced by someone you're speaking to you or by the larger context folks in the media\nPoliticians that really is devastating and can cause someone to be silent\nFor the rest of their lives and also not maybe get the help they might need or reach out to others who may be actually supportive\nWe haven't gotten the number of voices from men who has lots of been affected by sexual assault here as one voice mail that came into our inbox\nHi my name is Bernie and I'm calling from Cleveland, Ohio I hadn't really thought it happened ... years ago more than forty years ago and I did not\nGo public with my story because of\nThe crimes and pray I mean to pass that world down to my own daughter and they've got their own stories and I refused to shut up about it now because I have a granddaughter and I'm not going to have the same world aren't there her\nWell said Bernie thanks very much like it will be Bernadette rather than Bernard my mistake for paying so presumptuous butts\nRomo emailed and more I'd love to get your reaction to re male remotely emailed when I was fourteen I Would regularly group my step sister she would laugh and giggle but also say no and stop I now see how I was wrong not just a boy being a boy\nI Want to apologize to my stepsister we have a decent relationship but it's never come up\nHow do I apologize without bringing up painful memories more what would you say to her about\nOh well I'm first of all I think it's incredibly brave should take responsibility um and you know you have to you when you when you forgive when you ask for forgiveness you're asking for that person's forgiveness you give them back to power that you took from them\nAnd and I think that whether or not he's forgiven is is up to her um but I think that's a really important point because um you know\nWe're all human and we all make mistakes and some of us do you know commit terrible wrongs on one another and and you know I'm not a judge 'em but at the same time I do think that there has to be room in this conversation and in this country for some redemption\nUm you know but that only comes after a complete accounting of what you've done 'em and and frankly a is in I Believe should be in the hands of those who are wrong and um and I think in the case before us with Brett Kavanaugh\nA you know there are lots of people who say well many Seventeen year olds um have made mistakes should they be paying for it for the rest of their lives and some are first of all I'm who are not as privileged Brett Kavanaugh and and\nAlso a maybe not but that doesn't entitle you to see on the Supreme Court\nUm and so you know I Do think that there has to be a room for a ... where do we go from here right I mean we can't just village vilify one another um but at the same time there needs to be accountability going all the power back\nLouis to a few more comments before at a time Mary Ann in St Louis emailed my fear is that a confirmation for Kavanaugh will sanctioned this behavior not just for adult males but for young men\nWho are most probably more keyed into this story more than we acknowledge\nAnd lower and I wonder if we could finish with one more quick email Howard writes I've heard none of your speakers identify their abusers or attackers\nThe quantum leap Dr Ford took us to have identified her attacker I regret that none of your listeners has followed her lead to that degree although of course I honor the level of disclosure each victim choose Lauren before we have to go what about naming your attacker perhaps naming in shaming you're attacked or how do you view the impact of that\nI think you every person needs to do what's best for them uh in my case I don't know who was so there's no point um I I\nI I really think you know it's all about the violation whatever form it takes is all about having your power taken away from you so\nWhatever way you can reclaim your power\nI'm not going to judge and if that means naming that's great and if that means not naming that's also great I Do think that what Mara was talking about\nOf of ah you know a holding someone accountable you need to name someone in order to hold someone accountable and that ... not just ... in on the individual level but on the societal level and start looking at ways that we can hold people accountable without locking them up um but yeah\nLawrence Taylor founder and director of defend yourself at organization that teaches sexual violence prevention Lauren thanks for talking to us thank you Mari games on the New York times

E. N.\nA. T.
