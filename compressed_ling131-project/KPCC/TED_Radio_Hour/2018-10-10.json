{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "The tweet are you kidding me bring your opinion to working you're fired\nThe average person serious it's just a joke yeah your opinions on my place of business or you are fired so that's\nInteresting because one of the values we have at our workplaces innovation you don't bring your opinion to the table you sit back when we're in struggle trying to figure something out\nAnd you don't share you're in trouble at my workplace so I don't know what kind of business someone's running or they're not interested in the opinions of the people who work there\nBut what I can say is I Hope that we're not dependent on any innovation from that company\nWas gets one more voice mail that we got our inbox from someone who felt like they wanted to maybe be a little more open but that they had very good and legitimate reasons for armor ring up was\nI Believe I have to arm or up to a certain extent\nUm I was recently diagnosed with bipolar disease or disorder and uh it's really thrown me for a loop because prior to this yeah I was always going in with a mask off as I'm also bisexual and the place where I work\nIt's a very conservative environment in a very conservative part of the country I'm so I'd like to know what Mr Brown thinks about the\nThanks very much for having the courage to share your story I have to say I can relate to this caller I did mention of course being out but like\nEven within that you know there's ... we we know that there are L G T people but you may not know like what kind of algae beauty person you're dealing with which float in the pride parade that they will be and if you would float they were on you you had your pearls you wouldn't watch them fight like I I kind of get this there are parts of my life and I think of this person's life\nWhere it feels safe to be an armored but there is that one lock box you have and say well this piece of armor like there's no way there's no way I could share that\nSo here here's what's really important that important distinction we share get vulnerability is not disclosure\nVulnerability is I mean we've interviewed daring leaders some of the brightest people I've ever seen who disclosed very little but they are willing to show up and hard conversations they manage uncertainty they listen they problem solve they stay in things when they're uncomfortable an awkward\nThey give people honestly back even if it's hard then I've met I've met leaders who share everything and I wouldn't consider them courageous at all vulnerability is not about disclosure we share with people who've earned the right to hear our story and with whom their relationship can bear the weight of the story\nAnd so I don't think for the call her just came in and again thank you for being brave I don't think your courage at work is dependent on you disclosing anything about your identity about your diagnosis that that's not that's not what vulnerability is\nThat's not what vulnerability as I Would I Would say to this say this in cultures where we've got gone in and done deep work and there is a huge pressure to conform to be perfect to look the same act the same and think the same\nThey have the highest levels of corroded trust and the and the lowest levels of innovation\nA newer low on time but I'm curious to know you know what this journey is like for you these days you written in the books quite a bit that you are kind of a fellow traveler because you are not an expert on mattress still kind of working on this yourself how how is it how is it going at this point last year when you're on the program I ask how you do it and you're like\nOkay [laughter]\nI don't know [laughter]\nThat sounds very familiar tart fear [laughter]\nJust trying\nTo take it all in and understand it and apply it to my own life and it's this book was really\nYeah I Would say up there with parenting and partnering I'm leading has been one of the hardest things\nI've ever done and I'm an armored person you know fifth generation Texan by nature I'm just an armored person\nYou said your family models should be walking load it is often like we have cops [laughter] like it's awful like the customized term yeah yes yeah\nThat we're serious like yeah it's so I think there's a story in the book that I tell about an intervention with my leadership team with me that sad you know you're always you're always pushing these deadlines and we failed and eat them because they're unrealistic but were afraid to tell you that there are unrealistic when you propose\nThat because you get really intense and you push and push and push harder and we're not going to do it anymore and\nThis research really taught me to say okay let me think about that from it or not to send says let me think about it and I went home and thought I thought about it for a couple of days and I was like I Do that not out of ambition but out of fear and scarcity\nLike I Am comparison I look and see what other people are doing and we should be doing that and why isn't this not already and it led to a couple of weeks and the hardest conversations I've ever had with my leadership team but it changed\nUs and what a gift that you have a team that's willing to say that oh my God brave\nWhen they brown research professor at the University of Houston graduate College of

were all these were all former test pilots are almost all former test pilots these also we're all former almost all former a wartime\nPilots so it's true that everyone not just Neal that everyone around him in those first groups of astronauts in the early sixties um they came to that program with the great awareness of\nTheir proximity to death at all times uh on his job and I think that became really fascinating to me was just how they cope with that how they dealt with it felt like a lot of them dealt with it by by modern standards by not dealing with it\nBut you know how do you kind of do a day by day job that you know whether an astronaut or test pilot that in many ways could seem like a normal middle class kind of job these astronaut to their families lived a seemingly normal middle class lives um\nWith the exception that every time they went off on on on a flight or a mission or often training wheels we often forget how many just how many astronaut died training some of which we go into a in the film um you know how do you deal with the fact that you may not ever come back how do you deal with those odds how you deal with that how does your family deal\nWith uh with that yeah I mean\nAnd you know the whole point of training you know there's a there's a great engineering saying which is that engineering has the obligation of failure which means you failing failing you fail so that eventually succeed and that's all playing training is failing down here so we don't fill up their butt failing down here costs lives\nNear new was in the second ... group the new nine ah there were nine guys two of them died right and those two turned out to be the two that and it was closest with\nUm which again I think not many people knew but those aren't great out you

film first man the movie it's not only about the moon landing but also Armstrong's personal life\nAnd the death of his daughter at a young age director Damien ... explains why that laws became a central part of his movie\nOne of the things I find the most fascinating about Neal was this reluctance or even failure to to express or talk about\nHis emotions are things you know the traumas like this that he that he had been through 'em\nIn the culture of of the astronauts and test pilots and I think it's one of the coping mechanisms that they sort of relied on especially people that era there was this on unwillingness to go there and the way you sort of managed those feelings was the kind of talk them away and put them somewhere in the attic of your brain\nUm but to me actually there is something profoundly tragic poignant and cinematic about someone who the only way he can cope with those feelings that he talks the way up in the attic of his brain is through his work\nIs through flying is through the sort of\nA word lists pursuit of of of thinks that he can't even quite articulate I Love the fact that you know if you if you were to have actually been asking Neal\nWhy do you do test pilot and why why are you going to the moon he would give you answers that were very much you know sort of engineers answers I'm a it was always about problem solving and about you know kind of trying to figure out how things work\nI don't know what space exploration well\nUncovered but I don't think it'll be exploration just for the sake of exploration\nI think it'll be more of the fact that it allows us to see things that\nMaybe we should have seen a long time ago\nI haven't been able to go now\nWhat I find fascinating none of his answers what it would ever quite answer\nBut why risk your life why why do these things why why instead of just sitting at an engineering you know drop drawing pad and kind of working out the numbers why put yourself in the line where you yourself are part of that equation and if the equation go south you go south\nSo I think Josh and I just became very quickly fascinated about what drives someone to do that and what the unsaid\nUh things in that person's mind and feelings um what those are the drive\nTo new and have anything else yeah you know I was sorry to hear about your daughter\nI'm Sorry to hear a question\nWhat I what I mean are\nYou think it will have an effect\n\nA reasonable to assume that it wouldn't have some effect\nKnow because the myth has become so set in stone in some ways of these guys and how they behaved you

reaching you on a lay over at the airport and I believe you have about twenty minutes until you have to catch her next flight where exactly are you headed back from\nOn the way home from Fargo North Dakota and before that I had been in Bismarck North Dakota\nIn what took you there\nI was out there to cover the Senate race Heidi Heitkamp is probably the most vulnerable democratic incumbents running this year for reelection and the Senate\nJonathan Martin covers national politics for the time\nShe was first elected twenty twelve and it's just a very Republican leaning state nowadays so it's really gotten away from Democrats it's harder for them to win there and she's facing a challenge from Kevin Cramer ... who is the largest congressman who was also elected in twenty twelve to save your\nSo tell us about the kind of race senator Heidi Heitkamp was running there until last week\nSo senator high like a lot of red state Democrats was trying to run more of a locally oriented regional campaign\nTariffs are really bad for North Dakota there was a study out today showing the ten states will be affected by these tariffs North Dakota is number ... case law books on tariffs and so I think this is absolutely the wrong direction we should be promoting trade not disrupting at north\nDakota is a heavy AK state a lot of wheat in the north and west and a lot of soybeans toward the East I'm a sweep easier she was especially resonant because of the tariffs that the Chinese and that's a market for soybean farmers in North Dakota\nI'm Heidi Heitkamp and I approved this message China is cancelling contracts to buy soybeans North Dakota is losing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of business loan us Kevin Cramer why he supports the trade war he criticizes farmers\nThere's potential short term pain we don't have a very high pain threshold in the United states of America\nMr Kramer that trade war is costing my family a lot of money and you don't seem to care because\nShe was hoping to kind of use that to drive a wedge between Kramer in the broader electorate in state which obviously is more supportive of free trade because of the farmers need for foreign markets\nYou know it's like global as as a bad word to me I'm recognizing that we're in a global economy if no different than recognizing that the sun comes up in the east\nAnd that's been happening all year Heitkamp ... focused issue wise on tariffs and then along comes break up [noise] [noise]\nOh\nSo tell us what changes when Kavanaugh was nominated\nSo suddenly ... gym it's forced to talk about the last thing that she wants to talk\nWhich is national issues high stakes ideological issues where there is a clear better versus blue divide and where President Trump is on one side of the divide in our party is squarely on the other\nWith judge Kavanaugh's nomination the president has put women's reproductive rights and vital healthcare protections at grave grave risk for every American who cares about women's health\nAbout protections for people with preexisting conditions about civil rights labor rights el GB GQ writes\nEnvironmental right now is the time to fight now\nLook he is somebody who does not want to talk about the courtroom worse just not want to get into the ideological balance so the Supreme Court those are the losers for her ... in a state that is overwhelmingly pro Trump and heavily Republican\nSo honey can't pass the decision to me she supported Kavanaugh will improve she's on the side of the president and you know she signed with the radical liberal in Washington DC\nHotel Heidi Heitkamp decision on Kevin is something\nAnd that is where she found herself for the month of September ... going into October and so that's created real challenges for her\nSo basically she understands that the national issues that divide Republicans and Democrats are exactly the issues that she should be avoiding in his campaign\nWell any time you're talking about red versus blue you're talking about Democrat and Republican tribal part is an issue where people tend to go to their ideological corners that's a bad moment for her because she is overwhelmingly Republican\nNew out from Fox News shows Heidi Heitkamp a Republican challenger up twelve points that's quite a lead\nAnd they were supportive of confirming judge Kavanaugh support\nFor judge Brett Kavanaugh President Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court is strong in North Dakota\nThirty four percent of likely voters in North Dakota said they would be less likely to vote for Heidi Heitkamp
