{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "It is for us uh or at least you know spend some analyzing social issues they tend to be a bit more progressive\n'em and you kind of hope for that they're you know you've got people who are pushing the envelope a little bit to ask hard questions that many of us might find uncomfortable\nAnd then in the end were not bound to agree with what that particular group our church in society uh is is the organization I'm speaking of and so conservative tend not to like them very much and and other than to say you know I I like me I tend to say I'm grateful that the wrestling with these things\nI may not always agree with him but I'm really grateful for their their work in this\nSo I think we're you know we're we are having these conversations are pouring conversations unfortunately the thing that we're most divided about right now is that the nomination because we tend to be\nWe tend to be concerned for justice as a as a denomination we are concerned about I mean John Wesley are found her was that anti slavery in in areas where it was really hard to be anti slavery in England Bristol, England in particular a you know he was addressing the social issues of his time that's part and parcel being Methodist\nBut the um the issue that we're divided over most right now is not immigration about which many people would agree you know would find some common ground it's about human sexuality and so like many of the mainline churches were divided about how we see marriage and whether a same gender marriage is acceptable or not acceptable and\nAnd those divisions are largely they're they're often around both age and we find the deep south has one you know as one way of seeing things in the north in the east and the west another way of seeing things in the church and we're on the verge of\nProbably ... at least a minor division over this and our church will you took up the issue of the inclusion of algae beats the people in the church as something you wanted to deal with more specifically why was that yeah\nWell for several reasons one is I felt like we need it as the largest in sort of the leading jerks are domination help the rest of the church is\nAt least have the know what the framework is for the conversation but we also have probably eight hundred gay and lesbian people\nOr children of our members who are gay and lesbian and then when I asked a question on Sunday how many of you have a friend or family member or a co worker that you care about who's gay or lesbian and almost everybody raise their hands\nWe have to talk about this in our denomination policy put in place in Nineteen Seventy two as it was a pretty harsh policy and it's it's one that half the denomination in the United states disagrees with and so what our policy\nWell it's a it says that I'm On the positive side says uh and the word homosexuals what was used in Nineteen Seventy two so homosexual people no less than heterosexual people or people sick were worth before God so okay we all agree on that\nBut the practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching so that's the phrase\nAnd then pastors are not allowed to officiate center marriages in our own any of our properties or actually you know I met this past weekend officiate anywhere we cannot officiate and so you have communities where you have a significant gay and lesbian presence and and you have a church saying what you do\nIs incompatible Christian teaching who in essence it sort of goes along with who you are and we will not be you know we cannot be a ministry with you in this way now our churches are generally welcoming so most of our church so we want you we care about you but this is our policy but it doesn't feel very welcoming when you're told that you and your spouse are incompatible with Christian teaching\nWell I Wonder how you respond to members of the church more and more conservative who say well wait a minute\nJesus said I didn't come to make peace I came with a sword you know I came to divide you know that there are parts of the scripture\nThat are not flexible Jesus said I'm the way and the truth from the life and no one comes through the father bought by me you know and there are certain parts of the scripture that are welcoming and there are certain parts of the strip scripture that are strict on purpose and there was a point at which we as Christians have to be able to say look\nI Love you but this is what the Bible says and I can't counter avail the word of God how do you reconcile that\nYou know I think that's exactly right but part of what I've tried to teach our people is a is what is the scripture and how was it formed because if you if you say that so this is what you often hear from people what's the word of God and now you're messing with the word of God you're picking and choosing\nAnd uh and and part of what I'd say is picking and choosing is actually called interpreting\nAnd the scriptures need to be interpreted because they were you know there are sacred text but they were written by human beings we believe they're inspired by God but we don't really know exactly how that inspirational work\nThey were written by human beings in particular cultures and historical circumstances so there's two hundred and Seventy plus versus the Bible that affirming allow slavery including beating her sleep with rods as long as they don't die within two days because the slaves were property that's what it says next us\nSo we look at those passengers go yeah no not that\nThat there are other passages that over ... over shadow those but two hundred and Seventy plus of these are six passages about gay and lesbian actually six passages about some form of St John gender relationship one of which calls for you to kill gay men\nAnd nobody I Know it was killing gay men were advocating for that even though that's what the Bible says and so there's a place for us to go in there was a preacher once uh I was talking about this uh I'd written a book called making sense the Bible and I was on a national lecture on this and then he said you know you're just picking and choosing and I said well let me just ask you a question\nDo you have a pension fund and Methodist preachers love their pension fund you know do you have a pension fund well yeah of course I said let me ask you this what part of Jesus words don't store it for yourself treasures on earth did you not understand\nBecause that's a pretty clear passage and yet you've somehow managed to say no we need pension funds to even though Jesus said about the structures as alert and what you did as you interpreted so you could say you're picking and choosing where you could say you're interpreting\nHow did he had he was I'm sure you didn't liquidate his pension fund though he was such a silent [laughter]\nAnd you know I I like they're not telling people not to have a four one K. you know I'm not OK I'm saying\nI'm saying that we need to be able to take our sacred texts and we need to understand the times which was written and we need to recognize you know again let the women keeps falling in the church has the women with their heads covered there's a whole lot of these passages where we don't\nObserve those things in the same way today and we recognize that these words came within a particular cultural context and we've got it and so we inform our scripture anything we interpret the scripture in the light of our experience in the light of the tradition of the church and ... those things help us to be able to make sense and that's how it always worked after Hamilton thanks for talking to Joshua thank you it's been a joy\nAdam Hamilton is founding
