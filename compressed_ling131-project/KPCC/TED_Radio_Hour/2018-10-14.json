[noise]\nI'm Guy Raz coming up\nI Love this idea of law and the thing that translates over dreams about just as we all believe in America is what you were just in the middle to let\nYou on the road to notice changes don't give up on democracy for to deeper version of democracy in which was something that everybody can understand you to see this episode hacking the law\nFirst this news\nLive from NPR News in Culver City California I'm Janine Herb's\nFour days after hurricane Michael slammed into the Florida Panhandle search and rescue workers are still coming through the rubble searching for survivors and emergency crews are delivering badly needed aid and fears will Lawrence reports it's still unclear exactly how many people may have died there\nOne for the rich and one for everyone else let's\nTalk for a moment about what it means to be in jail even for a few days\nIt can mean losing your job losing your home jeopardizing their immigration status is amazingly losing custody of your children\nWhat's more if you're in jail on bail your four times more likely to get a justice and if you had been free and that jail sentence will be three times longer\nAnd if you are black or Latino and ... has been fat you are two times more likely to remain stuck in that jail cell and if you were white\nNow imagine is just one moment that it's used ... and you don't have the five hundred dollars to get out as someone\nComes along and\nOffers you a way I just really guilty they say you can go home back to their job just plead guilty\nYou can kiss your nights like\nThis huge anybody would do in that situation you plead guilty whether you did it or not\nYou have a criminal record that's when you follow you for the rest of your life\n\nSo we've interviewed really some really innovative thinkers about how to reform the criminal justice system um and you came upon a a really simple way to kind of hacking into kind of look at this and say wait a minute there could be simpler way to start to tackle this can you tell me how you came to that idea short\nSo uh my husband and I are actually sitting having dinner one night and many many years ago I he's also was a public defender and we were venting about watching one more client plead guilty so she could go home and my husband said you know we should just start paying bail for our clients we should start to bail fund and just start paying their mail\nAnd in that moment the idea was born we weren't sure whether we could do it we weren't sure what the results would be\nBut we knew that we had something there that if you could attack this problem at the front end we might be able to actually begin to unpack some of the injustice\nSue you we just got to work you started to raise money\nWe did so we we pitched the idea for very long time and um had a very hard time getting anybody to 'em and give us any donations for the ...\nAnd then I met Jason farm and his father Joe ... and they had a Family Foundation and they were courageous enough to be our very first donors and they gave us a donation of a hundred thousand dollars to start the Bronx freedom fund\nAnd we began to pay people's bail with that funds and what we learned is the ... nature of the bailout fund is that a dollar that you use any era can be used two or three times because of the end of a criminal case the bail comes back into the fund\nA I Would be bold enough to say that some of those dollars that the farm family gave us way back when it's probably still operating in the Bronx today\nSo when when when somebody post bail and they go to trial and their case is dismissed that bill money's returned\nTo bail money gets returned regardless of the case outcome I'm at the point of Vail is to ensure that people come back to court so if somebody comes back to court for each and every quarter parents at the end of the case where\nThere was a guilty plea whether it was a conviction or whether it was a complete a quid alert dismissal the bail money comes back so it can revolve over and over again if you create a fund\nSo how does it work I mean you you have teams of people who would go to jail and say don't plead guilty we can help push bail for you and is that how it works\nSo the most important work gets done by our local people on the ground we called bell disrupt there's many of them have been formerly incarcerated you're impacted by the criminal legal system themselves they\nOr ... on the ground to interview people in jails and what we've learned from the Bronx ... is that all you need to ensure that people come back to court is effective ways to notify them about the next court dates\nAnd to provide some support systems while they're out of jail\nConnect into services that might exist in the community so when problems come up that prevents coming back to court we can help them solve that problem\nTen years may have been paying now\nA low income residents of New York city and what we have learned how to alone at our idea\nHow the criminal legal system itself as operate it\nMoney isn't what makes people come back to\nWe know that because when the ... and pay the bail Ninety six percent of clients for trying for every quarter parents it's how awful\nEvidence that we don't need cash or ankle bracelets or unnecessary systems of surveillance and supervision we simply need court reminders and that way to come back to court\nWe learn and if they are held in jail on a misdemeanor Ninety percent of people will plead guilty but when the fund paid bell over half the cases are dismissed\nAnd in the entire history of the ... he was at a two percent of our clients have ever received a jail sentence has any [noise]\n\nUm\nIt sounds like over the course of your career and you sort of come to the conclusion that the system needs massive reform but that may be a decades long struggle in in the meantime one way to attack it is by attacking bail is by dealing with the veil issue yeah the way I like to think about it is to make while\nWe're thinking through ways Africa systemic reform to have an wild litigators litigating cases wild policy reformers are doing their work people sitting in jail self today they need a lifeline we can't ask them to sit in those cold concrete jail cells\nWhile we talk about systemic reform it takes too long so when we think about ... times when we think about the bill a project or the Bronx freedom find with the community bail fund that exist around this country\nThat has an immediate lifeline to those folks sitting in jail cells as we hope to continue to Nate and moved systemic reform forward\nWhen we think about like you know examples of criminal justice or or injustice in America you know like vigilante justice or the way people behaved in in the wild west and we thank\nGod you know one I'm civilized time like we think we were just so much more involved in in civilized and the way that we deal with this now but but we're not\nSo we're kidding ourselves um and I know that that is very hard for all of us to grapple with because all of us are implicated in what has become our criminal legal system\nUm you know we seem to have in this country an insatiable appetite for incarceration\nUh we seemed to have in this country of very harsh mentality around punishment till we have used our criminal legal system to solve social problems that we used to look at as all of our responsibilities\nInstead we have pushed it away from my consciousness and if it didn't implicate all of us but of course have done\nThat Robin Steinberg

great age that you'll see behind me they too are legal things\nI can I can do that to a legal thing I can do whatever I Want to my book or my car\nShe in a long decision made it clear that she was quite sympathetic to our arguments but ultimately felt that she was bound by the decision of a higher court in another part of of the state of New York but I Believe that she had not\nFelt that way she would likely have ruled in our favor\nYou are trying to change the law in a big way this is a big uphill battle you may not see the end of this battle\nWell just like a human rights lawyer is not going to see the end of the human rights battle the battle for human rights will continue as long as there are humans who want to explain to each other but what I'm already living to see is the beginning of the battle there really\nIsn't a battle when one sides a thing and the other side's a person there there isn't a battle the battle begins when both sides are persons and their rights begin to conflict that's the battle that I'm already beginning to see\nAnd that's the one that I was hoping to live to see and to bring about and it's happening\nThat Steven ... is the founder of the non human rights project you can watch his entire talk at ... dot com on the show today ideas about hacking the law and how we can change\nGovernment to be more fair to the people it represents\nDo you think that there are better\nThat is to democracy or do you think that in general democracy is the best way to govern ourselves [noise] I'm a big fan of democracy [laughter] this is bad headache and even though he's totally pro democracy he's actually got a big problem with elections my ideal\nOf democracy is that every person should have an equal say in the direction of the countries in the laws of that country of course this is theoretically accomplished by giving one person one vote but\nAs most people now in practice it's not a practically quality most votes a wasted many people don't vote lots of people such as migrants refugees count votes\nUm so my ideal democracy is one where the considered will of the people who's taken into account and I think elections don't achieve those ideals\nSo in your view our elections just fundamentally anti democratic [noise]\nIs fundamentally flawed in the way the practice now\nThey have a elites and they have uh money interests ... famous thinkers for centuries equated elections with aristocracy and all the ... or so I'm I'm happily putting myself within these group of people and saying you know I think elections actually fundamentally flawed\nAnd whether we can overcome that crosses I think there's basically two responses that we can take the money is to go down the populist cause the fascist roots and the other is to try to find mechanisms and modes to do democracy veteran differently\nThan the exact mechanism for fixing democracy that Brett has in mind well it's pretty radical here's bread headache on the head stage\nSo I'm going to ask you two questions I Want you to put your hands up if you agree the first question is who thinks living in a democracy is a good thing [noise] the second question is who thinks at democracies a functioning while selling it must be one politician in the audience somewhere\nNot but my point is there was a massive paradox of contradiction here\nI think there's two ways to resolve this paradox one\nIs to give up on democracy the other option I think is to fix this broken system which brings me to my ... my mind that have been lightened wants its technical name is so titian but it's common name is random selection and the id is actually\nVery simple randomly select people and put 'em in parliament\nWeight\nYou know you want to just put random people into a into a legislative body and say here you go figure figure it out\nIs that is that more or less what you're saying [laughter] um this seemingly absurd idea is actually based\nOn hundreds of experiments worldwide where this actually\nHappens happens while the Ireland is the most recent country to have randomly selected Ninety nine people to talk about the constitutional ban on abortion to talk about how they can tackle climate change to talk about other things I fix them parliament's\nThese Ninety nine randomly selected\nSample of people went through we cans of deliberation informed by experts with public input into that process and they came up with the proposal supported by around two thirds of them to abolish this constitutional ban on abortion which was then put to a referendum on about two thirds the Irish people agreed with them\nIf these people are so good at it why do we still need politicians\nHave to be honest that idea scares me I don't want the first hundred people on the phone book running the country I Want people who are steeped in policy who understand the nuances of how laws get made and to understand the consequences like that's what I Want\nSo how does a random democracy you know solve this problem elections\nDon't produce experts this is a complete jealousy otherwise we would elect our brain surgeons um yeah elections produce the people who are good at winning elections\nAnd to be good at winning election you need a massive war chest of money you need to be charismatic you need to be out to\nInspire people with digital sweets I don't I'm not sure but it doesn't mean that you're good at making policy I making so I Would actually argue that's a random representative sample with good prices informed by experts who've cause a darn have power they just have the power to get information\nUm [noise] would result in better policy of course you would potentially need these people to go through the induction process where they learn about how the system guys will how low making these made except for\nThe other option that we hand over the running of our country to a group of experts is exactly what authoritarian regimes argue China\nIn theory is run by groups of espresso yeah yeah I think it's it's a you open yourself up to the accusations ... if you say I think we should actually handed over to a tech not proceed you'll suddenly\nWell that's the thing like let me see if I understand it correctly\nIn a system that you think would have would be a better system more representative essentially you would eliminate the election that's right you get rid of people voting for elected officials you get rid of that and you would have some kind of system a lottery ... a lottery whatever it is where people are randomly selected from the population\nAnd they get a letter in the mail and they say hey you know you're going to be represented for the next two years and that\nThat's how you would do it that's how I Do a there's a lot of protests questions around there but the key thing is that it works when people do this people make trusted balance decisions and I I I think it would lead to a massive increase in trust in the in the governmental system and the decisions that are my age\nAnd we come back and just a moment red headache describes how he envisions randomly selecting leaders on the show today hacking the law I'm Guy rise and you're
