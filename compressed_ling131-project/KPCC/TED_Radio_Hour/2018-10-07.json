{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "\nFinally today our visit with another of this year's MacArthur Foundation fellowship whenever\nThe so called genius grants that you have an Eighteen class includes many artists and scientists and performers and the Reverend William Barber the second Barbara might be best known for his moral Monday protests outside of the state house in North Carolina he was among the first to draw attention to strategy that he said were suppressing the participation of poor and minority voters\nHe's like non violent protests across the country to fight poverty and racism\nAnd the Reverend William Barber the second is with us now on the line from North Carolina Thank you so much for joining us\nCongratulations to you thank you so much so how did you react when you first heard this news said you had been awarded the surprise\nWell you know you don't know it's anonymous you don't even know that follow you don't know who I'm central Maine man they call me I told him to stop playing I thought it was a prank and they said no this for real\nUh then the next thing for me it was two years I thought about all the things that my parents have done to sacrifice to all of the years of just working and trying to serve um it was kind of overwhelming and you know especially when in the work I Do\nA lot of times people are very very nasty and the criticism they say you're doing it for money you're doing it for attention and a big question your motives when the reality is you know you just want to allow people to see justice for the ... you want to see people are voting rights and people have health care and\nPeople treated right regardless of their race color creed their sexuality\nSo a gift like just as somebody else sees what you're trying to do and they want to be a part of you continue to do that work when they told me\nThat the announcement come out I was actually in custody stand with low wage workers and and\nAnd nurses and people working at McDonald's and that's what I was doing\nWe usually think of this grant that goes to people in the science and art will to stimulate creativity [noise] um so so tell me about the role that creativity place in activism\nWell you know ... in every age we know what works if people got to make a difference we know that non violent civil disobedience words we know the protest works we know that voting works but in every age is different or you have to face it the way in Eighteen hundred for as they were just trying to get the right to vote now\nAnd then the Nineteen sixties today we're trying to hold on to what we want before and then press on to what we need to see that you know we had tried to hold on to basic voting rights but we also want to get to where\nEverybody Eighteen is automatically registered they were voting as a holiday where same day registration early voting just something that happens in every state\nUh you know years ago people were fighting just to talk about the Afghan nap today we've tried to hold onto their father to a form of carrot and expanded the universal healthcare so it takes it requires a certain understanding of the times\nThey had but and I'm thinking about things like how do you get people to see these issues in a fresh way which is kind of the essence of creativity I mean some of your techniques like preaching\nA speaking writing demonstrating those are classics but you've also done things that are kind of ... like you know give me an example of kind of like a fresh way to get people to look at something that they think that they already understand\nWhat you know you read mix I mean James Brown was classic so but the rappers ... so what you do is for instance back in in the day\nThey had freedom schools in teaching what what we did with more Monday is and what we do around the country we do something to call but imposed a mall political organizing leadership Institute in some and what we do is we bring people together of all races treats colors\nAnd class then we'd say okay let's look at voter suppression as to the real numbers the Iraq\nWar data twenty six states which left those same states a hot topic these days those same state passed laws against immigrant people and gay people those same states up to that a a Medicaid expansion those same states did not union right\nSo if ... if if the same states that passed racialized voter suppression\nAnd the people that get him elected because of racialized voter suppression being used at election to hurt mostly white people\nAnd most of the poor people and we show people that empirically then they began to say oh wait a minute we're fighting the same people the same people that are tacking immigrants and uh one of the attack and just get the same people that I can help you out at once attacking voting rights and so if they are cynical about duck to be together\nWe have to be smart enough to come together that is the way in which you read mix if you will what was done in the past and you expanded into present\nSo before we wrap up here and she mentioned at the outset that this is not a lifetime achievement award this is an investment in you\nTo watch whatever it is you want to do next as you know when a MacArthur genius grant when it's previously with Lin Manuel Miranda who wrote Hamilton so you know no pressure um what what what are you going to do with the ... have you thought about it\nWell I Know what I'm going to do with life and how big wracking changes I don't see in another reason for me to be allowed to have to work on these issues of racism and poverty and ecological devastation of the ...\nAnd and and tried to be or what I called Marlin now it's all a ticket ... action\nOf deep diving into the poor people's campaign through repairs of the breach that organization I leave 'em when my church pastor Green Bay Christian Church and I don't know the ship if what we do will sold the seed of future transformation or if we will see the victim is in the current title which we live but what I Do know\nIs as for me in my house as a script to say we're going to continue to serve this call because we believe that love and justice and merge to those things are important and there's nothing more important than serving\nThe Reverend William Barber the second he's the pastor ... Christian Church in Goldsboro North Carolina He's the founder and president of a Paris of the fridge and she just hurting the author of many books and he is now and to have an Eighteen recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship a so called genius grant river Barbara thank you so much for talking to love your ...\nFor Sunday that's all things considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin you can follow us on Twitter at\nNPR ATC we are back next Saturday thank you for lifting we hope you have a great week\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from logged me and maker of go to meeting proud sponsor of the how I built this summit taking place in San Francisco at the ... center October sixteenth learn more and go to meeting dot com\n[noise] from American Jewish World Service working together for more than Thirty years to build a more just an equitable world learned more in AJ W.

[noise]\nI'm Guy rise coming up [noise]\nUltimately we're interested in understanding how life works\nEvery year I have an inkling of where we are\nWhat we need to do is figure out how the brain does have as a biological piece of machinery we now have technology that could in theory you allow an individual to upgrade their [noise]\nThis episode what makes us us first this news\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Janine hurts in upstate New York to vehicle crash involving a limousine left twenty people dead\nPolice say the limo failed to stop at an intersection crashing into an an occupied SUV before landing in a ravine everyone in the limo Eighteen adults were killed along with two pedestrians National Transportation Safety Board chair Robert Sumwalt says it's one of the worst accidents he's seen in a while\nSure to the shape of our noses that was a recent paper that was published twenty three and me just released a study a defining the associations between gene variants and whether or not you're a morning person while we're talking about the kinds of things that are out of out of the water\nCooler or on your way to get a coffee and we're beginning to understand the DNA sequences that can explain those behaviors it's it's pretty mind boggling\nWho we are what make ... ... it's why the oldest questions out there like new technology means we've never been closer to answering it in all kinds of ways that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago\nSo today on a show ideas from science psychology and philosophy about why we are who we are\n\nSo Sam Steinberg worked in the lab that developed one of the most groundbreaking innovations in gene editing you may have heard of it it's called CRISPR and Sam describe why it's such a big deal on his head fetch\nYou known for over half a century the DNA can taint the blueprints to make all living things that you know to tell us a lot about ourselves better ancestry in our traits and our disease susceptibility is\nBut there are things in the genome that you might not want to find out for example with two misspelled versions of a gene called April before your chance of developing Alzheimer's disease is more than ten times above average\nAnd with a single disease copy of the Huntington gene you virtually guaranteed Huntington's disease a devastating form of a nerve the generation\nAnd they're both of these cases there aren't currently any effective prevention\nOr treatment options and so this leaves many wondering is this information even worth knowing\nWell what if we can do more than just learned that information by reading the genome but actually rewrite the genome secure genetic diseases after source what if editing the letters of DNA wrist simple and easy is fixing typos in Microsoft Word\nThis is no longer a science fiction thanks to a new tool called CRISPR Cass nine\nIn the last three years scientists have delivered CRISPR cast lines of human cells and precisely fixed the genetic mutations that costs cystic fibrosis sickle cell anemia muscular dystrophy and Huntington's disease\nGenome editing and animals themselves is teaching us more about how cancers progress and revealing promising new drug targets and companies already raised almost a billion dollars to apply for ... as a therapy and patience\nThe CRISPR cast my technology was co invented in my PHD lab at the University of California Berkeley and many considered to be one of the biggest breakthroughs of the last couple of decades\nBut five years ago when I started my PHD was Jennifer Doudna CRISPR wasn't the technology at all [noise]\n[noise]\nSo you're saying this technology didn't even exist five years ago I mean how\nHas become a huge deal\nSo when I started my PHD and Jennifer's lab that was to any ten\nYou wouldn't find a single mention of Christopher in you know the lay media unless it was talking about a vegetable CRISPR\nAre but in the scientific literature we're really talking a few dozen articles so it was about maybe one month was coming out we now or at a point today where every day we have around five or ten articles being published I think you will will not find a biologist in the world\nThat doesn't do ... and you probably won't find many left that aren't actively using CRISPR how to study whatever biological question they go after and there are laboratories because\nUltimately we're interested in understanding how life works and if we know that DNA encodes life than what better than a tool to rewrite the DNA and study what the effects are\nOkay the technical details of how CRISPR cast nine works are complicated CRISPR for instance is an acronym for clustered regularly inter space to short\nPalin dramatic repeat and calf nine is the key protein that makes it all work but what you need to know if that CRISPR cast nine makes it easy in a relatively inexpensive to edit genes in precise ways any gene in any living thing from bacteria to people\nYou know coming back to the four letters of DNA sick about those eight hundred dictionaries filled with the same for letters and they'll imagine that you have to search for a single page and not just single page but a single letter on that page\nAnd mark that site for a change and maybe not any change but an age which is not an easy or an aide to see [noise] so for decades this was the kind of signed the sky science fiction idea that we could dream about doing but no one was going to be able to do it because it just seemed like it would never be possible\nSo that now with with CRISPR basically you can just go into the body find that chain of letters causing a disease or something and then just cut out one or two letters and replace it with with the right letter\nAbsolutely that's exactly what it does\nAnd I'll just had one ... it's not been demonstrated yet in human patients so\nIf you just said the same thing for human cells in a petri dish absolutely with human patients comes the additional challenge of getting to the right cells and that's the same challenge at every drug has to contend with this this issue of delivery and now it's just a matter of figuring out how to do that inside patience\nNow the next frontier will be really using this tool to improve human health Henry achieved his ultimate goal of sharing a genetic disease at a source at the level of you know you instead of just treating the downstream symptoms\nImagine a future use stem cell technology together with Christopher cast nine to remove disease cells from patients repair them in the lab and the transplant those corrected cells back into the body\nClinical trials are already underway that offer a cure for HIV aids by editing the DNA in blood cells taken from HIV positive patience and I suspect we're going to see more and more clinical trials with CRISPR entering the pipeline to the next few years\nWhat really got folks speaking this past year was the report in ... but for the first time ever scientists use CRISPR cast lines to edit the DNA in human embryos\nAnd unlike therapy and adult patients this would introduce heritable changes that can be passed on to subsequent generations you can imagine the controversy that this has provoked\nAnd many fear that this technology can be abused that it would usher in an Arab eugenics were designer babies were select few could pick and choose the best use for their offspring\nOthers would say a free deny unborn children a technology that could ease human suffering or radically the disease it would be immoral\nCRISPR cast line is forcing us to rethink what kind of world we want to live in [noise]\nAnd there are ... ethical issues to discuss about how we should use this technology and how it should be regulated [noise]\nThat sense turned ... when we come back in just a minute a little more about how gene editing could change who we are and how we should feel about that\nOn the show today ideas about what makes us us I'm Guy rise and you're listening to the\nHead radio our front NPR Brett\nKavanaugh's quest for a seat on the Supreme Court has become much more than a job interview and much more than a dispute about what happened one night it's raising hard questions about sex politics privilege and even about how our democracy works that we're going to ask some prominent thinkers about what this says about\nThe state of the country and if they see a way forward that's next time on all things considered from NPR News joined us this afternoon at five and eighty nine point three K PCC\nWhen big news is breaking I understand and appreciate the important heavier hearing me directly about what happened to me\nYou're coordinated and well funded effort to destroy my good name will not drive me

responsible drinking and from the any Casey foundation\nIt's that\nTed radio hour from NPR I'm Guy rise in our show today ideas about who we are what makes us us\nAnd we've been talking to ... who's been explaining how a new gene editing technology called CRISPR calf nine could make it cheap and easy to create humans you are you're basically talking like super heroes right perfect vision superhuman strength perfect SAT scores right that I ...\nI think that's that's the science fiction association of what CRISPR could allow [noise]\nWe have long lists\nOf gene variants associated with certain traits and some of those are silly like\nWhether or not you're a morning person [noise]\nBut we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated with things that might be desirable like having extra strong\nOkay just to clarify our environment is helping mould our genes\nOh obviously that is if I was brought up as an Apache or as a a a a Japanese samurai or as a a Romanian peasant and the fourteenth century there'll be differences undoubtedly compared to who I Am now\nSo we just have to Sam Sam Nunberg about you know like how being a morning person is is possibly in that it has genetic codes so so what else are we probably pointless\nSo are we know that that intelligence has a a a big charitable component which doesn't mean that it is a completely determined by our genes but it doesn't mean that some of the differences among people\nCan be attributed differences among their genes we know that that differences in personality how conscientious how agreeable how erotic how extroverted\nA are influenced by a by our Gino and even behavioral traits such as ah how like the AR you to be a smoker or an alcoholic all of them show some influence of a of our genetic and down\nAnd even though we can now prove our genomes to actually test some of these things out to eat or drink or says there's another slightly bizarre old fashioned method\nAs looking at similar\nOr to use between identical twins who are separated at birth\nBecause identical twins separated at birth share all of their genes but of course not\nTheir environments and they show that there is a a a pretty hefty statistical or influence of the genes that is if you know what one identical twin is like you can make a lot of predictions about the other one who he or she may never met who may have grown up a an ocean in at a cultural way\nMy favorite example is a a pair of twins one of whom was brought up\nA as a Catholic and not be family in Germany the other was brought up in a Jewish family in Trinidad when they walked into the lab and Minnesota they're wearing identical navy blue shirts with apple and both of them like two different buttered toast and coffee both of them kept rubber bands around there is\nBoth of them flush the toilet before using it as well as after and both of them like to I surprised people by sneezing and crowded elevators to watch them\nJohn [laughter] a story my seemed too good to be true but ah when you administer a batteries of psychological\nTests or you get the same results namely identical twin separated at birth show are quite astonishing similarities\nThat just unbelievable so then like even things like like habits or or personality quirks are more or less assigned at birth\nWell they're they're influenced at birth I wouldn't say they're assigned because um there are probably some unpredictable changes that occur as the brain and the jails and the first couple of years of life\nAh there are changes that that to unfold over the lifespan whether they are a response to outside forces or if they're just the way that the the brain spontaneously develops we don't really know yeah there are certainly ways in which anyone can be damaged if you if you undergo\nA trauma or abuse that can leave lasting scars\nBut I think there are certainly a um their statistical forces there's there's definitely pressure that makes one person different from another across the board\nYeah I mean when when you think about like who you are I mean do you do you think you're the same person that you were when when you were a child or or a teenager or in your twenties as as you are now\nI I Do see myself as basically the same kind of person I like the same music I like same foods I like the St pastimes I have I have similar kinds of interests\nAre and then and research on personality shows that there was a a a substantial amount of continuity in a person's character ah as they go through life\nBut a ... there are certain changes that I see myself that probably occurred in most people as they as they get older we get less an erotic we get nicer\nAh we get less anxious as we get older all of us but still if one person is more anxious than another at the age of twenty or he'll probably be more anxious than the other person at the age of Seventy as well even if both of them are less anxious across the board\nSending it if we are more or less the same right at twenty or at Seventy is it even possible to make big changes to it to who we are\nI think we have the capacity to change our behavior which is really what counts I I don't think that there's a lot of room to change who we are in the sense of a fundamentally nervous person becoming um constitutionally calm and uh I'd easy going\nBut certainly there are methods of say cognitive behavior therapy that are proven effective at reducing anxiety and phobias in treating depression yeah uh\nThe thing is that that those don't appeal to a some\nIf aerial immaterial soul they uh are ways of acting on our neural circuitry we kept to keep in mind that are neural circuitry so intricately complex has been shaped by evolution to interact with the world through our social\nUm mechanisms of of interacted to language to facial expression the body language that there are ways of of changing our feelings and thoughts by the old fashioned route of conversation and example and uh and and art and of\nEvidence based psychotherapy so there is the scope for for a range of behavior within the ... with a given personality type and we can probe the outside of the ... the genes make available to us\n[noise] do you when you think about what what animated person do you think that it can be figured out pretty logically or do you think that huge parts of it or just mysterious\nHuge parts of it are are certainly mysterious because the interactions are so unfathomable complex yeah there are I\nTend to a hundred billion cells in the brain connected by a hundred trillion sensors\nAnd no one can keep track of all of them even a ... in a computer simulation we also know that chance plays an enormous role above and beyond the role of either genes or environments or we can see this in identical twins who are brought up together not not the exotic cases of beer twin separated at birth but just the kind of twins at all of us know\nIf you know ... a pair of twins you know that they're they're they're they're more similar to people plucked off the street at random\nBut they're unique individuals that they you you don't confuse them when once you know and sometimes they're not friends and sometimes they're not friends are indeed a now how do you account for those differences it's not fair or genes we've not the ones they inherited from their parents there could be some uh a few mutations that each one or idiosyncratic we acquired\nA it's not there by marketing environments because they grew up into the same parents the same school the same house the same older sibs seemed younger sibs\nReally forced to the conclusion that uh there's an enormous role for\nA chance for the role of the dice in or who have become
