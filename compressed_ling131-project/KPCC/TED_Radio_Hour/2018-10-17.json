{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Programming at the podcast networks Pena plea she co hosted the podcast when Megan ... Harry Christian welcome to weigh I'm so glad to be here thanks for having me how big a deal is this for the royal family this is\nA huge deal and not just for the royal family but for the world I mean you already mentioned how important and what a huge precedent it is that we're having somebody in the royal family being born in ... knowledge to be part black\nOr as we know Meghan Merkel's mother Dorey as black making his half black and this is the first time will be at least in the modern era fully acknowledging a baby being born into the royal family who is\nA part black and then notably also the first baby being born into the royal family who was part American and possibly possibly going to have dual citizenship when the baby is born making will still technically be an American because it's a very long process to become a citizen in the u._k. so\nAh she's in the process of doing that supposedly and she says she is going to become a citizen but that usually takes much longer than the amount of time we have left before the baby will be here\nChristian I feel like this couple kind of captivated Britain and the world from the very beginning particularly\nThe wedding which I ended up watching very unexpectedly not expecting it to have any residents for me at all but it was clear even from the ceremony that there was a very strong through line related\nTo love and equality and social justice like that's been in the foreground of this relationship at least since the wedding\nOh absolutely and this is a wedding that\nIt doesn't just cross oceans across the states I mean she came into this wedding\nUh being Catholic and you know not church of England we already mentioned that she's half black\nAnd then on top of all that she is divorced she was married already there are so many things that are unprecedented about the union and it seems to scream to the world this isn't about doing what's proper or doing what's precedent it it's about doing what two people in love do\nAnd we all know that the royal family more than anything are really just the PR firm\nFor England, UK and if the PR firm is saying this is what England is now this is what the UK is now we are acknowledging that people have different backgrounds they come from different parts of the world they have different color skin\nIt is such a huge cool it is saying we are all welcome here we all can look like this we all can be the best and everybody's woke him here and the baby is just the cherry on top\nI don't think we can ignore the fact that the the British royal families also something of a distraction from whatever was the u._k. may be going through I mean there had been\nA number of terror attacks near parliament in the u._k. involving knife attacks and so on there was the attack on the concert in Manchester there's of course brags that so there is also kind of that in the background just having something a little bit of fantasy mixed in with your daily reality\nYeah I mean some people might call it distraction and some people may say it's a place to find joy sometimes the world is really hard sometimes it can be really\nDifficult and sad and overwhelming and to find a little bit of beauty or a little bit of love and all of that ... what's what's not to have you know pay attention to it it makes your heart feel just a little bit better when things are tough\nAnd in the case of this royal family in particular of Harry and Meghan and\nThere soon to be baby it's hard not to see yourself in the family in some way if you're like me are you a person of color if you're an American if you've ever been divorced I mean there's just so many things to look at that aren't just a distraction but are a little bit more like us as human beings what's\nYour sense before we got to let you go what's your sense of how this is playing with people who have a more traditional view of the monarchy I'm sure that there are I mean the idea of a divorce say having an impact on the royal family is not new you know some people I'm sure still soar over Wallace Simpson and every day\nSo you know do we have a sense that there is any pushback to this idea that this is just another sign that the monarchy ain't what it used to be\nOh absolutely and they're always going to be the haters out there they're always going to be the haters do not read the comments on the daily mail on line it will bring it is just horrible they're always going to be the haters\nReading the comments on any news Web [laughter] am I to bad it's just don't do this don't do it and it will ruin your faith in humanity\nSo yeah I mean I I just think that\nThere are going to be those who pushed back but then there are going to be those who can see the Wednesday or the love or the enjoyment of it and in the very least it's just a wonderful form of entertainment remember this is the longest running reality show family in the world this reality show family's been around over a thousand years\nAnd it's fun to watch them even if you can't quite see yourself and I'm\nGlad to hear from some of you about the issues emailed it's beautiful she's representing the best of the U. S. Christian before we let you go what is the timeline for the baby's delivery do we know what it's do\nWe know that it's due in the spring ... has said that however we don't know exactly when in the spring we do know that she had a twelve week prenatal checkup that went well but we don't know when that checkup took place a lot of people who are are I'm watching the pregnancy closely or placing their bets on an April baby but it could possibly be march so we'll see\nChristian minds are the director of nonfiction programming at the podcast network ... and co host of the podcast when making meant Harry Christian thanks for talking to us thank you so much this year was produced by Morgan givens and edited\nBy ailing Humphrey to learn more about them and the rest of the staff visit the one a dot org slash staff\nThis program comes to you from W.

rather than political issues\nI'm sure they talk about the lack of health care they talk about you know low wages and unstable jobs and things like that but there's not as much you know about Trump's specifically or about Islam or sell the arts and the things that talked about before\nAnd then I'm In the ... so far\nI think it's probably pretty obvious that without Roseanne show is not likely to be as big a ratings hit as it was before but could become a better show in some ways\nHave this show creators been forced to ask themselves what the Congress really is about and could it be that they are now going to make something that is even better than it was when it came back to the first time\nThat's a really good question I actually think it is better\nI think what I've seen so far is better than what I saw there was an ... which which I like the rest of ...\nBut I think you're right and that uh that I think the idea that they do that I think the idea that the writers do have to figure out what the show is really about the kind of happening before our eyes and now that Roseanne isn't there taking up all around\nI think out of the gate there may be curiosity in terms of what's going to look like in the ratings might be high I don't know but I think it is a better show already just because we're writing sharper and the cast has room to breathe\nLorraine Ali is the TV critic
