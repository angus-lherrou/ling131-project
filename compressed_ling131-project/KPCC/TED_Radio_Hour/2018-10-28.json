{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Because as I understand it in our experts will correct me if I got this wrong but seems under a new state law a new interpretation potentially they could not be on call\nWith ah the change in interpretation of state law that would enable them to be on call who Decatur you want to start on this one\nSure I'm an ... like you were saying in in twenty sixteen the Supreme Court ruled that um private security guards when they were on a break they were on a break they couldn't be\nI'm On call or anything like that and so the ambulance uh primarily the private ambulance industry saw this and decided that they wanted they felt like it's only a matter of time before a similar ruling a is applied to them so they're trying to get out ahead of that is basically carve out\nAs a piece of the labor law saying that their employees\nCan still receive calls while they are on break and it's similar to prop eight and that it's a really specific\nIndustry and why why wouldn't they be able to lobby the legislature to carry this I'm I'm curious this ends up as and and\nI mean ... they tried that what would I like your job and went through the legislature uh yeah I mean again it's a private a\nDispute they didn't solve it privately they took it to the legislature they didn't solve it they're now they're asking you to do it and so now remember why do we even have private ambulance drivers is because a lot of cities not like Pasadena Los Angeles where they we have our own paramedics they contract out\nAnd so our ... paramedics here in Pasadena Los Angeles don't fall under this they can be on call because they're public safety officers\nBut in cities that contract these ambulance services those\n... EMTs an ambulance drivers are not considered public safety even though they're doing exactly the same job it's because they're from the private sector that creates a challenge\nWell in it and I'm curious why the legislature there there wouldn't be sympathetic members of the legislature who would carry it on behalf of the private ambulances industry it's interesting that that didn't go anywhere\nWell you might have I mean labor groups might be opposed to that you know if they're carving out a way for re slow right and they are harming out a part of the labor law you know it might not get fired that\nThat's a ... yeah it's a logical argument that they'd be concerned well if they do with ambulance drivers than than who might be next that proposition eleven and is there are labor unions do you do you know melody if they come out against this or not I I don't think I've seen ah\nFor some odd reason I Know that the California Teachers Association is against us ... I don't know I just read that somewhere [laughter]\nTeachers are always on call [laughter] so\nUh that's proposition eleven the final measure on your California ballot proposition twelve\nSupporters of twelve say it is a natural extension of proposition to which was passed a decade ago and put new space requirements on egg laying hens on a pork as well as on cabs\nThat are being raised reveal and they say the proponents of it that this uh guarantees even more space\nFor those animals than I was in proposition to the opponents of proposition to say this is largely the work of a major um egg a supplier in California's Central valley and that they actually want to have smaller uh cages in which to ah to have a the\nThe egg laying hens a melted you want to start us on prop twelve\nYeah absolutely I this is a ballot measure that you would normally think that animal welfare groups would all jump on board and they're not um and the argument is that I\nThe amount of space currently under law for um says that ate chicken or a a hen an egg laying hens has to be able to stand up turn around and lay down now what does that constitute like what is the exact spat specks of that\nA Cajun which and it hadn't can do that um or a a a breeding pig or\nI'm a calf I'm and so this ballot measure essentially is creating those facts but I'll animal welfare groups like peta say well you know we don't agree with that space and that was never the intention of voters to give them that little up space so\nHumane society says is as good a pita and some other groups also say that are are saying that this is going to get them actually less room and that you'd be doing more for animals by not\nVoting for so in in you have major environmental groups your clubs in favor of this and I believe the natural Resources Defense council but as you say\nAnimal welfare organizations there is with the humane society to us when the sponsors of this as they were a proposition to which was passed by California voters Katie anything to add on this\nWell I think it is it's one of those examples when it is a tricky measure you know I mean you see this and you think well you know I I feel like animals should have space [laughter] but then you get into the intricacies and I think that's a lot of times the problem we have with governing by proposition\nRight you don't you don't know all the details that you really need to know\nSell your thoughts on prop twelve yeah so so we're we're in a situation here for twelve where the animal welfare groups can't decide\nIf is actually enhanced with animal welfare you have some let's say yes you have others and say you have like Peter to very strongly against it\nUm I Would I Would suggest that would just humbly recommend that if there there's a measure on the ballot that you can't wrap your head around that even animal welfare groups they can't decide if this actually has his animal welfare I'm ... now perhaps ah just can be resolved in another way I'm perhaps we can have a more deliberative process rather than have something as convoluted as a while and I have to say\nI'm for all of us on the panel like that you know all of us get asked a lot my friends and family members what about this ballot proposition what about that one and so often I just speaking for myself I don't know about the rest of you have to say you know how to read about it I hosted debates on it I've I've immerse myself on it and I'm Still\nTried to wrap my head around all the different moving pieces to it\n... your daughter do I just tell

opens people up\nWhen we laugh out loud maybe it encourages us to keep going and not just at a time and saying I'm not coming out to listen to\nThis episode painfully funny for this news\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Janine hurts in Pittsburgh vigils and interfaith services continue today in memory of the eleven people killed in a mass shooting at a synagogue yesterday morning their names were released today and the victims ranged in age from fifty four to Ninety seven and fears Quil Lawrence has more\nShow show I lost what for sure and was told that I couldn't possibly has certain shows and uh that it was a wouldn't be appropriate\nI Wonder whether I mean you describe what happened after you came out and um this long period of fear and and obviously it must have been quite painful to endure that um how were you able to withstand it I mean what do you have\nIf you get death threats it just means no phone but you have to stand for the things that you believe in you have to stay strong inside and I I don't know how else you do it I I Love that there's a T shirt and the ... when I was lost in America that said I stand on the right side of history and you have to believe that I\nGenuinely believe that equality\nFor everybody is better for the whole society [noise]\nSo after coming out and then dealing with everything that came with that Sandy's activation button was pressured again in twenty Fifteen\nThis time for women's rights\nWe decided to found a brand new political party because if the critical thing the one place women and men are absolutely equal is that the ballot box okay now we had no idea what they're doing but didn't know how complicated it wants to talk to political party I sold it can't be that difficult men have been doing it yeah [noise]\n\nDefinitely stop it by calling it the women's equality pot a at a gay and straight away people said you may\nCall it that I don't know I just thought we'd be clear I've\n[noise]\nI've been doing to me at the current you know I just [noise]\nThat as much as\nI can tell you how many times I've heard somebody say I'm not a feminist buff always think of as a button the sentence they

will [noise]\n\nHow are you able to react that way like how are you able to to joke about things that other people might just pull their hair out and get really angry and said you know explode with anger but when I\nWas I think yeah I think that the way to get people to pay attention to is to not to them and not appear like some into raging president who wants to been around with that because actually I'm not like that I perfectly normal sensible human being who wants to try and make those are the best place\nAnd I'm very interested in like keep an eye here in the u._k. if the big increase in ratings that seems to be a late night shows which are using humor as a\nWeapon or in the current political situation uh I I think the way forward and nothing is more disarming to critic then you finding them funny yeah well how do you call it a punchy whose aim is to get equality for women the women's equality politics\nWind difference you pretend I'm told in Idaho ... wrong with you [laughter] if yeah and also a life is full of things that we believe to be driven which are not true no woman ever been abroad in the sixties it was made up by a generalist\nYeah I even looked it up on the Internet and I could not find anything about\nWhat happened was a whole two of my ... young as anything but a that was a time when a Vietnam or people who didn't want to get him in the Vietnam War but in the ... and that that idea was conflated with the protests that were held at the Miss America contest\nAt the deed crown a sheep Miss America\nIt's funny but nobody's instrument of that stuff that I Would have liked to say\nGive me this is a is a thing like I suspect that you don't sit around and consciously think I Am going to use humor to advance my ideas but it just sort of your temperament is it\nThe right to say is absolutely and and I have to keep the money to buy things happen in the living up to about things that make up every day I think really this is happening now it's just\nSo hard breaking I'm so little pulling that the only thing I think you can do is you have\nTo start combining it a bit of activism but also with remembering that by human beings and we have a sense of humor I don't see any other way for and frankly because if you just something about those things you would just so they\nKnow we're in for example the women have equal representation in positions of power they looked like a very good enough at the top one hundred companies in the London stock exchange in twenty sixty one hundred companies or how many women running\nI suppose to realize that seven I'll run by men will cooled Joan [noise]\n\nJohn running hundred company [noise]\nThey're all women Jean run by men who have\n[noise]\nI saw Dave and Joan ... John okay\n[noise] why\nDoes the math on well it's not pesky business over the gender pay gap or guy in the wild do remain the same as men and that is never going to change\nWe have more women at the top in the ... with the law or the equal packed in Britain was passed in Nineteen Seventy five\nNevertheless there are still many many women who from November until the end of the year by comparison to them male colleagues are effectively working for free I in fact\nWell Economic Forum estimates that women will get equal pay\nI mean all the examples you give in your talk like more companies are run by Dave's or John are women who run companies I mean it it would be funnier if it wasn't so depressing\nI Know I Know I'm ... I'm just trying to pointed out ah you know life is uh is is has its many amusing sides to it ah I have to say I'm Mr Trump bless him has been a boon frankly a boon to address the welfare [laughter]\nThey could be depressed or you could just also find the funny side and uh so it makes me smile and I have to say when I say something and I can see the long enough for the enriched by ... and it just it ... the Greek\nDrama mosques were tragedy in comedy and they stood side by side and the Greeks knew that we should know that that in the midst of this bad that we are still human and and the sense of humor and a good love is one of the things that makes us human loved it brings you together I think that's one of those in the last night and I had some other people laughing together\nAnd I don't even know each other but with the book together by that more\nSo we just got to keep going forward [noise]\nComedians Sandy talks big she hosts the show Q.

funny ideas about how humor can make uncomfortable things a little easier to deal with\nI don't like doing radio ever unless I'm totally in control really because I have a face for TV not right now that is true this is ... she's a stand up comedian and I'm Florian around things on drunk [laughter]\nNow the reason why may soon as a little self conscious about doing radio is become a disability she has which in her stand up routine\nShe tackles head on here she is on the stage\nIs the easiest most reliable way to tell people things they don't want to hear\nYou know earlier you were you were saying that you didn't set out to be an activist or or an advocate but I mean you sometimes ended up changing people's minds right\nRight so like I've never been like okay if I'm going to talk about Palestine Israel and how people deserve equality regardless of faith\nI have to use comedy because otherwise people are going to get defensive it's more like oh I Can't tell a joke about when I was strip searched and I'm not really thinking about like this is the best way to deliver this message I'm thinking about\nThis is a really funny story I'm totally ain't get them to laugh and then it's usually not till after the show where I'm like oh my God\nSomeone just came out to me and said they didn't know that Palestinians were people they thought that was the name of a terror group\nAnd it's like it's always afterwards that I realize I've shaking someone's ground it's never my intention to go out and do that my only intention is make them laugh get on General Hospital women and\nLets me soon as I can hear her full talking to dot com\n\nOkay so may soon was just saying\nShe's not a comedian and activists being you basically use comedy is like your form of activism\nYes comedy like the best tool for that it just opens people up and what makes comedy so effective is that if you're making them laugh along the way they're going to listen to the deeper cuts stuff\nThis is Nick ... also a standup comic that gives the daughter of Iranian immigrants and as a kid her parents were retail her with stories about life during the Iran Iraq War specifically the unusual way they got through bombing range\nAnd they talked about how they would go into the\nBasement and how they would turn on the candles and how they would block out all the windows and they would be like oh\nWe would play cards with raising retail stores and then we hear a bomb and then we'd worry that it was our neighbor you know and\nThen again [laughter] so I think the human\nCapacity you know the way I'm humans get through these really terrible times is my flipping the script on themselves yeah it kind of lets you take the story back into your own hands\n... own turn flipping the script happened when she was in college right after September eleventh and the start of a wave of Islamophobia\nAnd it started becoming clearer and clearer that Islamophobia is one of those things it's not going away\nI kept thinking like oh will be will hate Muslims for like a few months and then we'll stop like I just thought that was going to be some reasonable projector [laughter]\nUm and then I never ever stop you know and um and I felt like I could you know I had a voice in my voice as an Iranian American Muslim was\nNot something that the average American has already heard\nNikki decided that the best way to disarm the haters was to make them laugh and that's\nBeen the goal is just um you know if you have\nNever had a Muslim friend um maybe my stupid face can be or Muslim friend McCain\nDoes this through what she calls social justice comedy and how it works well here's the gains explanation from the ...\nThe American population can be broken up into three main categories there's mostly wonderful people haters and Florida traveling category here are the haters\nComedian it's my goal to convert these hairs because they have a lot of things which leads to negative outcomes like a racism violence and Ted Nugent on a plane\nIs we have to reckon with the haters but there's various within this group and it's not a vision to go after all of that right so what\nI've created a highly scientific taxonomy of hate or basically took all haters I put them in a petri dish like a scientist\nFound the trolls they're the people who have quit their jobs or that they can post on Youtube videos all day long on their haters now these people will be at a stoplight they'll wait for the green and white male tree\nMost interested in is the swing hater they just\nDon't have enough information in this group I like the target was social justice comedy because\nIt makes you laugh right\nThink you enter into a state of openness and a moment of open it's a good social justice comedians can still get a whole bunch of information and if they're really skilled uh rectal exam [noise]\nFor social justice comedy it's not partisan okay this isn't political comedy is about justice and no one is against justice is negative you know what you're sitting inside of a burrito\nLike either be hearing a real like an interesting treaties on income inequality that tasted are really sophisticated poop Joe\nOkay so she wanted to do something about Islamophobia and wants to look for the swing haters\nSo me and another comedian ... decided to round up like a bunch of Muslim American comedians a month [laughter] as per usual and\nTake him around the country to places like Alabama and Tennessee and\nYou know what I mean just like places where you are accustomed to seeing like a\nBunch of friendly Muslims and so we would duty street actions we would set up like an asking moslem biz in the middle of town square\nQuestions about as long as I've been drawing just about us we run into a drawing\nReplied them with pastries so that they can feel like hey somebody's going to give me pastries doesn't have it out for me\nWhat would people get tough\nOh my gosh they could ask literally any\nSaying why do some Muslim women look like do All right\nYou can't tell who they are Rob a bank anything I've ever you know\nThat's really a good class you know so we got question like that all over the country um you know because I don't know where that job and I don't know coverage so you know so like people could ask those questions I don't\nI'm a I'm another question that was frequent was why don't Muslims denounce\nTerrorism film and why I haven't seen Muslims or not [noise] for seizing Muslim or\nWe got that everywhere and I continue to get that and my travels all over the country why don't Muslims denounce terrorism and so there's like a huge PR missteps\nThat happened and where Americans think that Muslims tone down there and I don't know how that happened because literally every Muslim I Know done\nSo I'm like did we not like this happen\nWhen we come back in the universe out explains why it's important in social justice comedy to keep it delightful shows are
