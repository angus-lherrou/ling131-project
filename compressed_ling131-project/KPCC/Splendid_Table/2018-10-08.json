[laughter]\nSo when she wrote that book she wrote a long hair and sort of games where she had these yellow legal\nYeah oh yeah I remember those yeah yeah yeah yeah [laughter]\nBut you actually helped her with it right how'd you get pressed into service\nI was about twelve I think I had a typing class in seventh grade or something I had my first typewriter and she had any type the manuscript 'cause her writing was kind of chicken scratch [laughter] so it's hard to read and I remember just\nYou know days and days typing that up and I was always like you know corrected her grammar and she had these long list you know\nPeas and water dressing well she was describing everything and I'm like in any you've got too many words in his one sentence hope ages one sentence you can't do that\nAnd try to break it up for you know so ... some of those things I remember I remember it because I just had them over and over again and I tell you I missed that I'd give anything to see her chicken scratching [laughter] but now you know never knowing that it you know she'd have such an influence on a cooking and all the farm to table movement and all that\nDid you get a sense of what her like what she wanted to do with the book was hoping for like I I read it I think a lot of people view not just as a cook book but as literature but tells a story of this community Freetown and tells the way they live in what motivated her when she was writing it\nI really think I mean she didn't necessarily talk about that to me but I got the sense of the way that she talks about the the people to feed and other people or Freetown motivated I got the sense that she really since the presence of um all of our ancestors ... you know watching her and following her and seeing what she was doing I I think that\nThat really drove I think she never forgot that I mean she never forgot how food tasted\nWhen she grew up you know fresh out of the feel she never forgot walking along behind her father is a plow the field is getting ready to plant\nA you know and behind her mother I'm In an all the things that happen all the celebrations they had I think that's why she wrote the book the way that she did she wrote it according to the seasons and the things that people would do you know one thing about her long list of things in her book you know you see painted a picture I think of what she remembered what she saw as a child\nAnd I remember when I was researching a little bit about her life ... it was so amazing to me that she wrote this incredible classic that's\nAlmost like a Journal of life and what living was like in this community are free to write and it's like you said such detail and then you realize she moved away when she was Fifteen sixteen years old ... mhm so what you said all that suffer so implanted\nYeah remember yes but I think that ... that there was always very politically astute she was always you know she was involved in all kinds of movements definitely the civil rights movement\nAnd I think again that drove her but you know I think she had the the artistic side with her cooking and ... and I don't know that she really you don't necessarily thinking I'm going to write this cookbook about our lifestyle and I'm going to make a statement I think that that was just always in her\nThe cooking was such an important part of her life but you know the politics and whatnot was too and I think\nThat I guess she ended up making a statement because she was you know talking about the lives of these people that have been through so much and really struggled to make a decent normal life for themselves\nBut that it was not just where you scratching and clawing their way to survival\nIt oh yeah no no no they made they made they made a beautiful I'm sure it was tough and probably because she was so young\nYou know even if you listen to our grandparents you know as as a young person they'd they'd probably\nVery much of that if they could she probably thought she would have seen the end result of people coming out of slavery and surviving and building this little town and and just it's just a testament to people putting things behind them and just going forward I'm looking forward\nAnd I I just think that's I think it's on ... and I think there's there's lessons they must be thousands of free towns and I think they have lessons for us today and you know they will into the future how people can come through you know God Knows what still um make a make a life and survive and reach out and touch people\nYou know you so much for me to put her in talking to you to\n\nMe no Williams from Bangor runs the child welfare project and National Conference of state legislatures\nAnd went to meet her at the train station\nAnd um look all of them down the track or the platform and finally at as everyone else it cleared out of the far far into the track I saw her approaching and she was leaned forward and dragging this very large cardboard box\nAnd I went running down to her and [laughter]\nIn the in the box she had pie dough and she knew there wouldn't be time to make pie dough over a hundred pies when she got there so she had made the pie dough in New York and frozen it and wrapped each individual\nBatch in wax paper and aluminium foil and [laughter] we got those into the car and gotten secured in a refrigerator they bought perfectly of course by the next day when it was time to start working with that and we went to the market and shop for peaches and rhubarb and blackberries and\nThe cons and other things that were needed um and then the next day we we set about cooking and um she went to me and said you know will you start rolling out the pie dough and I was I was living Tim dated to say the least and asked her to show me what she wanted\nAnd later she said to someone that you know I couldn't believe that they gave me this child to roll out of the pie dough [laughter]\nI was scared to death [laughter]\nAnd so we we ... we make callers and pies for the next two days and um biscuits and corn bread and and the dinner was that evening but it was\nIt was quiet but it was it was the most satisfying quiet you know and so much was conveyed and the silence and I don't say that she even before she already knew me she she treated me\nShe never treated me like a student you know she was interested in what I thought it didn't have that tutorial qualities she was generous and she loved cooking so much and she loved that someone else was interested in it so much and it was like an offering\nYeah it it was it ... it was extraordinary and so then after that first time it was a few months later that once we started corresponding and talking and visiting I'd been to New York to see her once and she called me and propose that she come to Atlanta for a week\nUm and that we just cook just for ourselves and so we did for that entire week you know we would go and pick her up she was staying with friends of mine and\nWe know she would I was ready to get right into the kitchen and she would always say have you had your coffee [laughter] that would be I guess I've had plenty of coffee but she would want to go sit in a coffee and we would go to a cafe or somewhere I have coffee for very long time and sometimes three hours\nAnd then we would make her way to the kitchen and we would cook and we would cook late into the evening and the first thing I ever I did ask or the other because the very first thing I'd ever had that she made that original dinner that I tried to get into the kitchen to help with the unsuccessfully [noise]\nUh I was lucky enough to attend and she had made turtle soup turtle soup I mean I was frankly little squeamish um it it seemed kind of grainy clamp it to me a little bit [laughter]\nAh but ah and I really had no idea what do you imagine but I was also very excited I mean it was certainly was exotic [noise] um when I was not at all prepared you know for what was delivered to the table and it was this clear clear\nAmber consummate that had this cloud floating on the top and the fragrance was unlike anything it was so complex and yet so simple but so nuanced and\nAnd this cloud is a little dumpling dealt with flooding on the top and that was the latest thing you ever encountered in a bad habits of turtle meat and tiny leaves a fresh time I'm folded into it\nAnd uh it remains you know one of the most and mysterious things that I ever and delicious and memorable\nAnd and meaningful now um things I ever tasted and um\n[noise] that experience was so interesting because I I'd assume because it was a complex and nuanced and mysterious and cereal and [noise]\nUm additives fail me but it it I just assume there must be a multitude of ingredients in secret steps and you know spells of and instead I mean I went ahead and and I'd gotten a turtle meat\nAnd I was like when you know what else do we need and it was you know that was about it [laughter] I mean if you needed some Sherry internal and some onion and um\nWe put it in a pot with a vast amount of water I thought and put it on very low heat and had cooked in cooking cooked and cooked and I can remember taste and after about three hours or so and being I didn't say this of course but I I was\nDisappointed I mean I thought it tasted like water [laughter]\nI I thought this is not it will be she's not going to give me this recipes you knock and already teach me how to do this [laughter] um and so I you know it's like what do you think [laughter] and she said it would just you know let's let it cook longer and so we did I mean it could for hours\nI'm and she would out a little salt and put the lid back on after we tasted and this went on for a while and I could begin to taste a little something after a few hours\nBut I was still ... suspicious [laughter] uh and then all of a sudden you know it became and and did was it was exactly what I tasted that night and uh it was extraordinary and that was quite a lesson you know that was quite a lesson\nUm and then we made the dumplings and and then there really became a\nThat that that trouble soup remains very um [noise]\nIt's symbolic is emblematic for me and in very meaningful swift every time there was a special occasion or for her birthday or or someone special was coming to visit I Would always you know if they really special than they would warrant turtle soup you know\nYeah and that's soup the way you describe it it's such a cooking of patience and the cooking of observation and that's so much of what I think I think of is Louis not ever having enough food only having read her writing\nSo much in the face of the country cooking is about observation patience with the world patients with the seasons yeah patience and wonder um\nOur sense of wonder about things you know is what really always stands out to me there was um [noise] there was a real sophistication there someone who is brilliant and sensitive and artistic and observant and had great um\nSavvy and ... you know and a degree of sophistication and at the same time there was always about her a girlish innocents that was so attractive and so powerful really that she could see\nThe moon and it was like [noise] she gave like she had never seen the moon before [laughter]\nAnd I I I feel so old and jaded and have all my entire life [laughter] but I I I Try to to be like that I Want to be like that and I guess in some ways I Am like that I mean in in the last week for life I mean when the last things I can remember was was giving her\nUm pound cake and our kitchen table and you know she'd Gaston said beautiful and um\n\n[noise] what a gift yes thank you so much and thank you Frances Mm\nMm it's got the calculus
