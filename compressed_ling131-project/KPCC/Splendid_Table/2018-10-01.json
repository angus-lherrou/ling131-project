had this system this ... which is a system that is segregated land from the ocean all up to the mountain and everything working together in this kind of\nA cycle and uh that was very much about being sustainable\nTourism came in a we needed to get materials and ingredients and that kind of just evolved that way how everything just kinda started to get input into away\nAnd and so I remember reading about a number of chefs who in the early nineties you know we're proud of this idea of the call wider regional cuisine there was just like a really on the Gucci and Sam Choi and Beverly got in and out on long\nAnd there was like a scene and I feel like people were sort of into that idea of you know working within the traditions of why I've been there for many years and working with those ingredients and\nBut I was in the nineties and they like that\nUm attention sort of went away for a while and now I feel like oh it seems like there's a new generation of young chefs or kind of picking up that\nTorch I feel like there's you know this is God's yoga ... who at a restaurant ... uh I'm In San Francisco there's definitely rowdy ... poor and I love that\nSemi on ... for three names from Philippines Japan and India [laughter] or representing this new Hawaii because he's so why do you think there's this new energy what are you guys doing that's different than what they were doing in the nineties\nUh and they know the idea of the nation is is that we are thinking about our community first and and the food that feeds our community ah we are taking a step back and doing the food that our grandmothers and aunts and uncles all all cooked and that the food that we grew up eating\nAnd putting it out there instead of trying to do something with French influence with some type of Hawaii flavor and or trying to put a spin on Hawaii food with French technique\nNowhere cooking food straight up a crowd yoga has like the best cooking technique I've ever seen in my life but still yet to food soulful\nThe food's a again inspired by his mother by his the Sunday dinners a chef ... joined spam isn't making span from scratch on the menu in San Francisco who knew that this time and age that that's what you'd be sitting in a\nMenu in San Francisco and uh\nAnd I'm looking for inspiration from a\nA whole and jeeze like the the Japanese churches I cook books in the Nineteen eighties that are made from like what she pounding grandmothers and uh I'm going to end the house and learning how they make their doubles and all that and that's where the inspiration is and then\nThe whole farm to table thing where secret connected my best friends are all farmers and are not just because of the business or whatever it is that's that's that's my family that's my community and I'm going to support that and I think that's how the food is in Hawaii with these new\nShots yeah like you said it goes back to take care of your community like you so much of a comment that I'm\nOn my pleasure man it's it's awesome I get to be here and the the big ... a little bit of the other one beer to make you for them to Milan [noise]\n\nUnion Sheldon simian chef owner of ten ... ... is a two time finalist on top chef [noise] and you can find a Hawaii influence recipe from Linda Sally that was a fireman legendary St after ... years ago north shore shrimp scare us ones have thought\n[noise] you\nKnow sharing shelter and talk about the richness of Hawaii it seems like such an obvious place to have a vibrant cuisine because all the ingredients are there right like you had this fantastic climate and rich soil and all these different cultures that come there but\nIt also made me think of the cuisine of the Farallon Islands because the fires are pretty much the opposite of Hawaii smack dab between Iceland Norway is a country of just fifty thousand people almost\nAll descendants of Vikings who landed there over a thousand years ago and they're all quick to tell you that there are more shoot them people and it is one of the most beautiful places I have ever that like honestly when the most beautiful places I could ever imagine and when you're there it's like the islands were just\nDropped into the sea just sees sheer black cliffs sticking out of the ocean and I felt the oddest feeling when I was there you know like\nWhen you go to states like Montana or Wyoming in the world just feels bigger you know like they called big sky country for a reason right and like even if you're just standing there putting gas in your car and looking at the horizon everything just feels ethically scaled and\nBeing in the pharaohs was kinda like that it's this vastness of sky and see but there's also this intense feeling that anywhere you can leave your eyes on you can just get up and walk to it's\nA magical feeling it's almost like you're just floating above the earth and\nIt was summer when I was there a few years ago what'd you say it was fifty degrees but brilliantly just incredibly green\nGlowing neon green and the effect is heightened by the fact that many of the houses had the same glowing green grass on their roofs and their walls are painted pitch black and then you realize\nAll those laws are black because they need to absorb as much as they can and the roof is grass to insulate the house as much as you can and the reason why you feel like you can just go anywhere is because there are no trees\nNo trees to block your sight line to obscure the top of the hill or this is the point I'm getting too\nTo bear fruit\nFor author intense screen and beauty the pharaohs or one of the most Baron places I've ever done in the back in the sixteen hundreds I Believe a Danish priest moved there and wrote home about it\nAnd the simplest they were still so welcoming and they still wanted to even just offer a cup of tea and I think what was really important for me was to\nIs to emphasize that these are the people who were far afield at that point that me these were people who had fled their homes had left war and persecution and terror behind and\nAlmost ... with nothing but the clothes on their back their children in their arms and yet they wound up here and we're so open to me and so generous to me\nAnd for me that's the personification of hospitality\nUm what I asked them was what is it that you remember from home and what is it that you can take from home that makes you\nFeel better on this journey and by and large what most people replied was memories of their food from home which is why the Sudanese were cooking me the dishes that they remember from home that they used to celebrate get\nSo so I think that's that's pretty much what was important to me about that chapter in what it says about people who are displaced\nWho have had all sorts of difficulties\nAnd yet can still welcome you into their hearts and open doors to you [laughter]\nJane thank you so much for talking with us [laughter]\n... thank you\nShe Mitchell is the

down with Bridget Lancaster of America's Test kitchen to learn about one of the holy grail of cooking\nHey Bridget great to have you here thanks great to be here so I got a text message the other day for my sixteen year old asking me how to poach an egg\nAnd I was I found myself stymied about how to tell her how to really do it it's so simple things that we should know and a guess what they're kind of hard well okay first of all\nKudos to your teenager if are asking how to do genetic was an aberration [laughter] it's one of those things you write we should all know how to make very basic eggs fried eggs hard boiled soft\nBoiled 'em and poached eggs a perfect poached egg has an ice cream is still a little bit runny yolk we want that we don't want that to overcooked and then the egg white around it is soft\nHillary still very tender but it doesn't have that ring of undercooked white that so often you find around poached eggs mhm\nMhm so there are all kinds of ah fables out there about swirling the water and adding vinegar and some people love to microwave what did you discover\nWe tested 'em all your retested that vortex the the swirling water ...\nUh we found that was really hard to do more than two eggs at a time for that to be reliable we also try cooking them and muffin tents you know little individual ones mhm um and the whites were nice and neat and almost look kind of like fast food ... when they came out there was so neat ...\nMuffin right at the time set way faster before the ups were cooked for\n'em and we also tried and vinegar which is you know something that people have been doing for generations and the reason why actually makes sense because it lowers the ph of the water\nAnd that causes the egg whites to set at a lower temperature that's key because egg whites traditionally will set at a higher temperature unless you all over the ph of the water of cooking\nOkay and what did you discovered to be the optimal technique that perfect\nPoached eggs every single time relies on a really kind of a strange piece of equipment and that's a call under you know just to find much colander that you use to drain pasta\nAnd that all under [laughter] gotta get the Getty out first [laughter] rocky eggs into the colander anytime you crack an egg into any\nBowl you'll find that the egg white it's kind of two different textures you have that sticker white that surrounds the ...\nAnd then outside of that you have this really liquidity watery egg whites and that's because as eggs age they start to get more and more watery so it's hard to start with fresh eggs because they'll have more of that Ficre egg white and then by cracking them into a ... time\nLet them just drain for twenty thirty seconds all that really watery egg white will just flow right away\nAnd then you pop them in boiling water seeping water where do you go from there\nSo you want to transfer the eggs to a measuring up a liquid measuring cups going to make it easy to put them in the water and we put them in six course of boiling water so big Dutch oven or a stock thoughts great at at the vinegar a little bit of salt to that helps to not only season eggs but helps the whites to set\nAnd once the water's boiling you split the eggs one by one into the water a little space between them but the lid on the pot and then turn off the heat\nSo the heat from the water and for a pot of course the lives keeping that heat inside that's enough residual heat that's going to gently poached those eggs perfectly and just three minutes\nWow and so you really just keeping them right now that's absolutely right you're just feeding them and since you're not boiling them you don't have to worry about them chattering or going all over the place or egg yolks really cracking open so it's it's pretty foolproof\nOh that sounds great and simple so beyond starting a brunch service at home what tell me other ways that you like to use poached eggs\nOf that's the beauty of poached eggs once you learn how to make them you'll find that just about everything can be a lot better and a lot teacher with egg yolk in it um I loved them over grits cheese grits with a poached egg on top ... opened the egg yolk left that run through\nI've even put them in tacos or put them in a burrito I'm a love them on a pizza slice of pizza or to start or something like that yeah it pretty much I eat them out of my hand\nIt's pretty much an instance off when you think about it it is yeah that's that's hurting we're from\nBridget thanks for telling us and thanks [noise]\nWe get Lancaster is
