corners where I thought I'd been taught fault if possible ways because the state\nSo I had no idea what to think of this piece of beef that was absolutely perfect medium rare top to bottom with no great ring around the tank he was one of the juicy is most tender things I've ever eaten\nSo that was at a cutting edge restaurant almost Fifteen Years ago for no ... on the verge of showing up in homes everywhere the equipment is getting cheaper and cheaper at you know the idea of cooking something perfectly ... times pretty it was just the\nOr from Mali burned them from America's Test kitchen is here to talk about cooking soup eat at home [noise]\nI'm always like so much for joining us thanks for having me let's start with the basics what is Suzie cooking\nSo stupid cooking is a relatively new technique to enter the land of home cooks\nThe name comes from the French for under a vacuum and that's because you seal food in plastic and then you cook this food and water bath as heated to a very precise temperature was something called the seeds circular leader which is basically an electronic stick that you put into a pot or a plastic container or something that's heat save\nAnd this stick you can program to particular temperature and it will keep that water to that temperature and then keep it there for as long as you want\nAnd so when you're cooking food sealed in plastic in this water bath the goal is to bring that food up to the exact temperature of the water bath and that's usually the surface temperature of the food so it's incredibly precise\nYeah so I remember was it was a revelation to me to learn as a kid we had to go to cooking school to learn this but a medium rare steak is a hundred and twenty five degrees and so what you know those numbers and you can say I want to be humorous steak I can set my what about the hundred twenty five\nYou put the food in the closet you put it in there and it will be medium rare for you know until you feel like eating it\nExactly and then all you need to do as a quick ... and give it that crusty brown crust that you love them and it's done it's perfect\nAlso ... gives you time back because you're putting food in the bath and then you can walk away what I like to do when I'm circulating food for dinner is make a side salad and make a thought [laughter]\nJulie romantic to say hey I'm going to circulate that are now [laughter] aren't test cooks call it swimming so they're going to go swim something right now which I think is like I like that [laughter]\nSo if you read it gives you time back which is really nice for dinner parties or just weekly dinners\nI think that gets a bad rap for being too tacky or to sciency or something that you really have to understand Celsius in Fahrenheit and time and temperature graphs et cetera but it's not it's it's incredibly simple you can put food in a Ziploc bag\nStick it in a water bath heated to the precise temperature and then you can walk away and that is really wonderful especially 'cause there's no danger of overcoming your food\nRight what's the effect of time but you said that you have a piece of beef at a hundred twenty five degrees it's always going to be video where does it matter if it stays there for twenty minutes or if it stays there for twenty four hours for instance I saw chef once advertise on their menu these short ribs were raised to be for Seventy two hours\nDoes that make a difference that if you did it for forty eight hours or fifty three hours like what is if it's presumably all the same temperature\nThat's an excellent question and I think one of the most interesting things about ... ... is that it's about temperature of course but it's also about time and even play with those two things together in ways that you can't do with traditional cooking\nYou can do some very interesting things with meat\nHeld at lower temperatures for a longer period of time for example we've been working with Chuck roast which is a relatively cheap piece of meat it has a lot of college in and has a lot of fat traditionally you would cook it at a higher temperature for a number of hours to break down that college in and get it to be really tender\nBut force feed we've been timing this check into\nA roast like shape something that looks a little bit more compact and beautiful and then we're sort of eating at at a hundred and thirty three degrees Fahrenheit for twenty four hours straight that's a long time in a relatively low temperature bath and when this thing has done\nIt is like a prime rib ah all that time in the bath keeps it bright pink it's incredibly tender and juicy it tastes be fewer than anything I've ever tasted\nAnd it's cooked perfectly evenly from an end to end and then there's also something to enzymes that are active at this lower temperature there's more of an active when you're keeping something at this low temperature it's the same that happens when your dry aging steak\nUmm so when you're doing this low temperature cooking you really are tend to rising meat and having it become more flavorful\nI have to ask you a question though [laughter]\nI was I was talking to people like oh I'm because he was interviewed and a friend of mine said you need to ask this question and that is what's the deal with cooking as you said sealed in plastic bags that is that okay to save their like normally stuff that's going to leach into our food like honestly for me I kind of feel like\nIf that is what does million so because but [laughter] not everyone is so is there anything to be afraid of with cooking in plastic like a\nRight that the question we get all the time and and I get it there is a lot of stuff out there about how plastic containing BPA which is an industrial chemical is harmful if it's heated that it can leach into the food\nThe good news is that all plastic bags that are created for sci fi or for ... sealing are incredibly safe\nAnd even better all of the good quality plastic bags like by that block the a freezer save Ziploc bags are also say they're not made with BPA they're made from polyethylene and polypropylene which have been shown to be very safe when it comes to cooking and heat and also ... isn't\nNecessarily cooking in plastic you can cook in Mason jars which are glass when you're cooking eggs they can cook right in their show\nThat's amazing so okay so aside from perfectly cooked meat and fish what other things can you play with him seafood\nSo when I started working in the lead at America as good and I really thought it was about meat and about eggs and that was kind of it but as we've been working on this book from the the science team we've been diving into recipes\nThat surprised me for example homemade yogurt and you just bring milk up to an almost boil\nTo kill bacteria out a little bit of starter which can be yogurt that you already have put it into Mason jars\nAnd then circulated at a hundred and ten degrees Fahrenheit for anywhere between five and twelve hours depending on how to pay any like your yogurt in the end of ah that's it and it's so foolproof because you don't have to worry about having it in a low a van or\nAnything like that or having to monitor a pot on the stove\nYou just put it in and then anywhere between five and told hours later you're done and it's delicious and then we've also been making ... a cool a desserts supersede is actually a thing we haven't gotten to the desert chapter yet\nWe have plans to make ... lay putting dumping all ha very excited to start testing that\nAre awesome and there are a lot of these leaders now out on the market and you guys have done a test of the best ones right\nThat's right our teasing and testing team has dove into all of us regulators that are currently out there and there are a ton of options for the home cook and they actually picked a winner which is called the jewel circulate her\nAnd it's small and it's sleek and ed is incredibly accurate it's really wonderful and about how much is the jewel so the Jews around two hundred dollars and this is much cheaper than the first generation I'm see the devices needs to be they used to be a lot thicker a lot\nSlower now they're very light very easy very fast and they work very well there are also connected to why fight and Bluetooth so the jewel works ... an app on your smartphone which is pretty convenient\nAnd they used to be like a thousand bucks for two hundred and way which he pronounces so I guess the time starts circulating they're\nLike so much for that\n[laughter] and
