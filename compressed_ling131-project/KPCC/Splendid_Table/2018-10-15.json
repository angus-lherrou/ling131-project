Florida Panhandle the base was heavily damaged and some are saying it may never be rebuilt but Florida Senator Bill Nelson is vowing to get the funding\nYeah I Want to ask you about red velvet cake for you I always thought red velvet was just a nice way of saying you know kind of blame chocolate cake with tons of red for coloring so tell us about the real history of red velvet cake\nYeah absolutely so red velvet cake started out from a larger tradition and Victorian era where there were velvet cakes and really this is just like a a way to be fancy\nAnd at least indicated that the cake had a very soft and velvety crumb you know the Eighteen hundreds of course are textured cake was a little bit more common for the day and so to have had this soft soft velvety promised you know very very appealing and then there was also simultaneously\nA devil's cake or devils food cake and this was like an intensely chocolate cake that was made with egg yolks rather than whole eggs and oftentimes coffee or something in there to this is really dark really bold flavor really dense and ...\nAnd sometime in the early ... century and I'm kind of personally pending it around say Nineteen eleven um the two ... two concepts collided and there was a recipe for a velvet cocoa cake that was published and this was kind of like a cross between a devils food cake\nAnd a little bit more of a classic concept of the velvet cake but it was neat was cocoa pattern place of chocolate so that was the biggest distinction and so then the recipe as it drifted south was often executed with butter milk and what happened was the acidity of the buttermilk\nIt doubled down on the acidity and the cake overall uh in that time period most ... Potter was not only natural it was also raw modern cocoa butter the beans arrested\nAnd that the combined effect of the subject butter milk and the acidic\nCause of pot or created to sort of density and the texture of the cake which amplified the velvet enough of it and simultaneously the the ph of the cake helped some of the color pigments in that Rocco Potter shine through a little bit more\nAnd so that's why the trick doesn't really work today when people say like oh well red velvet came from a reaction in the coup powder and you can do this at home you can't really do it at home unless you get Raul cocoa Potter because the type of cocoa you're picking up at the store is going to be a roasted product in the wrong\nFor the red didn't refer to this sort of garish food color read it was just sort of like a ... brown\nYeah absolutely a there is a food scientist in the Nineteen thirties who commented on it and she called it a red brown hue and she was trying to be very clear about the reaction it was happening that the ph of this cake batter produces a sort of reddish brown who [noise]\nUm but that's not really a very sensational story and so when newspapers are picking this up and talking about the cake because at the time the idea of a a red devil which was an alternate name for the law that cocoa cake um\nThe idea sounds great sounds read but in practice will it really just distinguish the color of this light cocoa cake from the ... of a double suitcase or this is a little bit more of a Depression era\nLike let's scale back here let's use 'cause of patterns that have chocolate let's use some old sour milk in the back of the fridge I ... you know pulling from these like little bit more thrifty ingredients\nAnd so it made all all less sensational cake but in order to make a good story out of it when newspapers would cover it they definitely played up the red aspect and kind of left off the brown aspect\nAnd then sooner or later people wanted to read because we keep hearing that was going to read\nYeah there's a recipe from like the Nineteen forties\nAnd it had like four ounces of red food coloring in there which isn't a quarter of a cup of petrochemical yeah it's pretty scary but it made an outrageously colored cake and you know from their red velvet really did take off because obviously that's a very eye catching thing\nSo tell me about your recipe for its overtake now that you've done all this research\nWas my recipe I really wanted to get back to the ... that really you know to find the original cake and I also wanted to get back to the raw cocoa powder which is a really cool thing that we can source now on websites on line and he's at a crab\nAnd so by they using Rocco pot or the the flavor comes out so much more and it's such a more interesting flavor than just a mild chocolate and I also use red wine\nTo kind of play up the ... of the rocket go powder and to also\nKind of like cash in on that chemical reaction that once upon a time made the reaction between Rocco powder and butter milk so impressive\nA red wine does something really similar while also playing up this pretty nuts cool\n... thanks so much for coming in so things for having\nDella part is the author of brings towards like tonic American desert and you'll find her recipes for red wine velvet cake and for magic key line pie on our website splendid table dot org and\nOne of the most influential woman in food you might never have heard of patience grey [noise]\nI'm Frances lamb and this is the splendid\nTable from eight PM American public media\nIn the sense of loss comes in a hotel Saturday November some of the story telling the story telling you you never heard before the world's top story tell us on one thing that by the most dangerous man\nYeah it is a remarkable cookbook and I should also add a a a very accessible one I think the recipes that tend to get reference from it or are the esoteric ones you know like Fox or something along those lines uh and I think it tends to be a book that people read and don't cook from but\nI Hope that changes and you know a couple of weeks ago at home in Vermont I did one of her pasta dishes which is just spaghetti boiled and inevitably salted water and in a large bowl you put uh some fresh caught a a before you're finished cooking you've you laid off some of the pasta water into the bowl mix it with the recall to\nDrain your noodles tough in the bowl and mix them great a little bit of nutmeg over it a ground black pepper and it's just a wonderful dish and I think that that kind of dishes sort of what are you from a weed um is all about [noise]\nWonderful thank you so much for your time [noise] thank you it's great to be here [noise]\n... the author of fasting in the ... the life of visionary food writer she's your race horses is the author of how to teach you can learn more about patients if on one of her recipes and that's one of the table dot org\nAnd ... [noise]\nEvery week we check in with her friends at America's Test kitchen and see what they're up to ... since we got like hunting American desserts on our brain we want to talk to them about the classic new backyard Boston cream pie [noise]\nWe had hot questions like these are such thing as a good one group and why the whole pie when it's obviously a cake or producer so swift Bridget Lancaster to defend Boston cream pies [noise]\nHey Bridget great to have you back thanks good to be back\nSome Boston cream pie I mean I I don't want you to feel responsible for defending Boston cream scene from Boston but I Do have a question for you first of all it's a cake so why do we call it a pie and second of all I don't think I've ever had a good piece of Boston cream pie [laughter]\nOh boy I'm well I guess I Am asking you to defend it well\nIt's so there you can have really good Boston cream pie I'm I'm like here it's really hard to find it out and bakeries that are good you know sometimes to kick his rubbery it's sweet there's so much sugar between the cake itself the sponge cake and that custard filling and then the chocolate on top\nBut the yeah Hi part of it that you mentioned is really interesting\nWe did a lot of research trying to find out exactly what they meant by pie when it came down to what we think and what food historians have told us is that the pie plate\nWas one of the most used pieces of bakery back then so they make to everything and pipe plates instead of cake pans so it was just natural the called time\nHuh okay at least that's my story empty\n[laughter] so you guys have taken this apart and re assembled this old American recipe\nFor the home cooked can you tell me what you did yeah sure at well you'd think about there's three components to Boston cream pie there's two layers of sponge cake and in between is a layer of vanilla pay strict creams so you know so far so good he's got sponge cake and got pastry cream and then they pour over this chocolate glaze\nYeah so that should be delicious and as I've said it has not always been what did you guys do to make it friendly for home cooks what we ditched the sponge cake you did\nA traditional sponge is super finicky you take eggs either whole eggs or egg yolks and you beat them with sugar until the phone me and then you had to delicately fold in a flower mixture and there was a little trapped air bubbles from\nBeating the eggs and the sugar together that's the only Lebanon that the cake gets so if you over fold into flour you're going to deflate the mixture and you're going to have a really kind of squat Boston cream pie very very a robbery at that point\nSo we switched over to something called ... milk sponge cake which is a\nLittle bit of a Betty Draper style retro recipes it couldn't be easier to make you take milk\nA little bit of butter you heat it together until the butter melts you take some eggs and sugar and you do beat that until it's nice and fluffy but then you pour in all the milk mixture and then you stir in some flour a little bit of salt and baking powder and baking powder is going to make this foolproof cakes gonna rise every single time\nAnd you do two of those are you do want to cut it in half or two of those much easier to just two of those and then the other part of this is there's some butter and the cake\nThat makes it more tender and less we you know traditional sponge doesn't have a lot of fat in it you need that fat to counter the sweetness okay so there we have the cakes known what goes on with the claim alright pastry cream there's two ways to make a traditional pastry cream again you take eggs or egg yolks and you mix it with a little bit of sugar\nAnd then you pour in hot half and half and you have to be really careful you want it to temper you want to start to thicken but you don't want it to colonel and you also don't want to undercut otherwise it can be too thin and what we found\nThere's two ways to do this to start you can add is either cornstarch or flour and flour is going to make pastry cream work every single time cornstarch is one hundred percent starch and that really does have the ability to thicken very well\nBut if you don't heat the mixture enough\nThere's some inside and the egg yolk that will actually prevent the corn starch from thickening enough so you end up with a measure that's just too thin\nAnd then also if you mix a cornstarch second ... a little too much it will start to then itself you're basically breaking down the structure and there and causing some of that moisture to worry about that flour has in addition to start\nIt has some fat some lipids and also proteins and they work as binders\nShe not only have to start from the fire but these extra powerful binders\nThat they're going to base your dream and it stays thick so it works every single time ... mean pays to creme is really scary for people so it sounds like you have absolutely eliminated that issue for us and you know here's a little hint that somebody wants taught me if you're a pastry cream hurdles a little bit it doesn't really matter you just pass it through a find massive and nobody will\nEver [laughter] okay last but not least the chocolate ...\nOh that's the easy ones so a lot of chocolate places are made from chocolate and heavy cream Newport over the cake that can be kind of dull the original recipe the Boston cream pie that was made the park or house hotel in Boston back in the Eighteen fifty\nThey mix chocolate with a fond of mixture so basically they boiled um water and sugar together until it got to the softball stage a little bit of cream in there too\nAnd then added the chocolate and it makes it very brittle almost like candy\nWe wanted something that was slice of all it was thick enough to cling to the cake and not just all poor down into the serving dish but also stay nice and stuff will be fair shiny and the key to that is just a little bit of corn syrup a little bit of corn syrup just gives it that flexibility and shy and like a\nFreshly polish pair of black hat and choose while you have to really be mystified\nThis one um is this one of those cakes pies that is better after a day's rest\nActually the whole cake can be made over a few days they can be made a couple of days in advance the patriots\nCan be made also in a couple of days in advance so he didn't want to put together this whole thing in one day that's fine\nBut after you put it together it really needs to refrigerate for at least three hours before you want to listen to it because has set up um our recipe says twenty four hours in advance but I Will definitely and sit there for forty eight hours at least I think cakes like that that has some pastry cream and um\nThey're much better any kind of desert that's really had the costs are getting much better if you give it at least one day in the French none of those recipes mhm Bridget thanks so much
