restaurant together and um I think the times that pay appreciates isn't the most is when\nWe've gone through a failure or were failing because failing together so much more fun than failing by yourself\nWe're celebrating the pair of this year's winners will the Julia Child of wars and talking with them about how they started how the world's changed and how they kept it together that's coming up on the splendid table ...\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Jim Huck President Trump is\nPlanning to tear up a thirty one year old nuclear weapons treaty that was signed by President Reagan NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has more on what it could mean\nThe ah do you feel like you're in the lifetime achievement award fees your career [noise]\nYeah that's so interesting you say that I think you know\nI think we both take it as the half life time they have a minute or two of us and we you know we both still act like we're between sixteen and twenty [laughter]\nAnd that's yeah that's sort of our our secret for at least eight young because we both you know are still so in love with this career it couldn't have worked out better for either of us and and you have I mean I think\nThe career keeps you so young or can because you also have you know kids that are between like\nEighteen and you know thirty that are working for your thirties even old shortly before so you know with so many young kids working with this and I think that just by its nature keeps you young and\nYou know and I think we're immersed in it with them and so\nJust the nature of it and also all we've also always been very hungry for learning and growing and even way back when we first started you know teaching cooking classes\nYou know even though we I think we've probably knew a fair amount of we would like study every ingredient so we would know every detail or a lot of details about a tomato and onion you know broccoli and\nI think there were there was a fear that there would be one moment of silence during a cooking [laughter] so even and you know that never happens with us because there's two of us for one and one of us really talks a lot why not [laughter] you know [laughter]\nUm I think that was really what made us um you know we did so many cooking classes before our first radio show good food\nAnd that really had preparedness for you know finishing each other's sentences and building on each other's thoughts and kind of um articulating our philosophy about food out loud and and that is a really important I think part of anyone's career anyone's you know a profession because you I think it really helps you to\nWhen you're teaching it helps you to um you know be grounded in what you really believe\nAnd you know so much I think back then was based around the French kitchen ... and so both of us through ... and then through working in\nGreat restaurants which were all French restaurants at the time and and in France and Italy and France right we both work the year Mary Sue in Paris and myself in the south of France and\nI think that training gave us technique and skills that I think was really the backbone of us being able to that explore other cuisines or at least that's how it felt to us is that there was such a great strong background in the French kitchen\nThat then when we were able to explore other cuisines we're able to take them apart in ways that I don't know that we could've if we didn't have that training\n[noise] this is super interesting 'cause I Want to get to to your cooking um because I think you're known a you know like uh when I was growing up I first heard of you through your TV show too hot tamales and I'm like okay they\nDon't act like you're so young friends at\nWork so\nWow what I was younger and my mom would I have on the show\n[laughter] right no no but I was a you know what that shows Nineteen Ninety five Ninety you know and then when it was right when Food Network\nBegan um but anyway my point is I I thought of you as being shoved through 'cause Mexican food and certainly your order grill which is your family of ah restaurants\nBut I Want to go back a bit to the Nineteen eighty one you're opening your first restaurants to be careful what you said of the stove and it gets in your cooking practically in the parking lot and running the food\nAnd you know no no not practically [laughter] we had to abide by on the ground in the parking lot where many of the customers park and we only use them at night yeah well used midnight that the daytime it was more sandwiches yeah salad yeah [laughter]\nSo you're literally cooking in the you know is this very um you know suddenly goes very by your bootstraps kind of place\nAnd yeah you get into following because you weren't cooking French cooking you were cooking is really internationally inspired food so it's interesting to hear you had classical French training what inspired you to start taking in all these other influence and this was\nEighty one right so this is not common at the time and critical chef restaurants\nYeah not at all it was actually um you know there was ... zone there is boggle opened in eighty one also no no no no\nI used to oh I oh yeah there's not opened in eighty one that's right yeah so there was a little bit of a kind of a addressed towards more um you know casual but modern and really exciting food with Wolfgang ... smuggled but\nAre you on that there was ... you know Martin's Valentino\nNot very many um restaurants that were pushing the envelope and ... yeah we decided I'm too pretty much follow our hearts you know we were a tiny restaurant with eight tables and nine stills or the bar and we cooked or whatever we loved but the first couple of years there was a lot of\nRustic sort of country French food because that's what we were drawn to much more than the nouveau cuisine and the fancy hot cuisine\nYeah we had married soon I had met at little pair okay in Chicago and he was doing very cutting edge dishes that and you know ... that was just an amazing restaurant tour so we were doing things like taking hold baby lambs and stuffing those and then\nBut I think that that they immediately thought to themselves 'cause they came back to us uh like literally the next week and said um would you do sixty Mexican inspired TV shows\nCalled cooking south of the border cha cha cha or whatever yeah like now will do the TV shows about we're not going to call it that [laughter] so we I think it was your mother who came up with too hot tamales maybe maybe we get we kept coming up with\nDifferent names and but they we came up with you I'd tamales and they went for it yeah yeah so but you know we were both I think because like Barry sue said we were so comfortable with information 'cause it was so much a part of our everyday life 'cause we always thought of ourselves as teachers to the people that with the people that work for us\nThat we just did the same thing and had\nWe were just ourselves so we weren't nervous in front of the camera so that was really may TV very easy for us we just we treated as though we're teaching a class you know with that the people in front of us\nIn those days you know re shown seldom his wife they had sort of started the network um based on he had started CNN and his idea was that every bit of programming ought to be fresh so\nYou know it's food every day you you shoot something you play it and then that's it you don't play it again or you play it three times a day at different times and it was just very\nYou know it was the wild wild west they didn't know what they were doing [laughter]\nYeah we shot six shows a day five days a week so in one week we shot thirty shelves and then we went and prepare it all the recipes and everything and so that was a big ... a lot of pre production work that we would do we get the recipes together the talking notes you know things that we wanted to make sure we didn't forget to\nLet our audience know and then we come back like a month later and do another thirty shows where they they were quick though you know they were they roll camera\nAnd then they wouldn't say cut until you're twenty five minutes in and then they never edited\nAt All right I mean they would say you know they would be showing us like the count down cut cut and weeks I think we sort of ignored and a lot of\nThe families are always the hour a day I nor did it and then it was like okay we got to go out it was but it can be a wrong but see you next time yeah [laughter] it was it\nWas pretty fun and we saw we almost thought we were on vacation because we were used to working you know from seven in the morning till eleven at night you know six days a week and in the studio\nWe'd be getting off start at seven and get off at six and we'd be like oh yeah we've got the whole night the New York any drinking yeah\nBut okay so like four years I think the show read to her tamales room so remember hundreds and hundreds of episodes you've had many restaurants or the year then Susan you actually have restaurants apart from Mary Sue as well put together you've been\nA business partnership for Thirty years\nIs it eight I think the late now thirty eight\n... ... five years into my marriage it feels like it's the only thing I've ever had only ...\nTogether and did it feel like you were in there but we're going to be together for Thirty years plus\nI'm I think it did for me anyway um it was when I met Susan we were the only two women she I was the first and she was the second ... okay and I had never met anyone that I could that was so comfortable with just to cook with it was just really very automatic and easy\nBut then you know she went her way and I went my way and I didn't really think about it or there was no conscious decision but after I'm kind of keeping in touch when we ended up in France around the same time kind of serendipitously we I think we that was when we\nUm had a couple of bottles of wine and looked out the window and there was a rainbow and we said okay let in Paris let's open a restaurant together and um you know I remember I still I got to find that no book because it had things that have had like names of restaurants like mad ... says [laughter]\nI really do feel like I didn't have any money or anything but you know I think over the years um it's been a real sometimes challenge and a real joy I think the times that uh I appreciate Susan the most is when\nWe've gone through a failure or were failing because failing together is so much more fun than failing by yourself [laughter] you can imagine and of course there's plenty of ups and downs and we've always um I think been really sensitive to each other's needs you know I've got two kids and\nCitizens you know got her partner of a long time but basically you know we're different people and when we have different needs\nSo it can't always be the same it has to change our partnership has to change\nAnd I think we both probably through each of our individual therapy you know took responsibility for you know where we were at in our lives and what we want it and I think\nThat helps because we were willing to be flexible so we allowed that openness to happen and so I think that's what helped us be able to stay great partners and\nThere's there's something so amazing about having a partner who you trust impeccably you know it doesn't mean we don't disagree or that we're always at the same page because we definitely are\nAnd sometimes we might not even completely trust each other [laughter] I Know you think we do but there are times when Hi this is brand new when they get very being out there but when we argue about things it's definitely like you know I don't trust that point of view oh yeah you know I I I think there are things like I Know\nThat no matter what like if something were to go down that we would both be there to take care of it you know we pulled together in a really strong away\nAnd we must have you know intuitively known that our skill sets were different enough that we would complement each other a lot and be able to kind of fill in the blanks which is a good thing in a bad thing because you know\nI never really have um they had to develop certain skills because Susan would always take care of that like you know coddling and babysitting the employees [laughter]\nI didn't have them [laughter] but uh you know so I um but when we leave\nAs we've matured we've both gotten better at doing what the other does also ... to just become more of a well rounded sort of individual yeah 'cause I think in the beginning we were very\nYou know we had real separate um I Love pastries I like order I like things to work I like things to happen and the flow in the way that they should Susan adores\nThe hotline the chaos and she loves the problem she loves everything falling apart [laughter] so it's just you know we're lucky that we have those complimentary skill sets\nA with what your this is such a cheesy though to him and I have my favorite things but what you're looking for ... for each other's knives for things would sharpen each other what a gift to have yeah ships friendship and congratulations\nOn cheesy I like that yeah I feel for each other's knives I think that's brilliant\nAs well like if we can when you're saying like oh we're different but we had to learn to do the things I just think oh you you sharpen your cells against one another I think that's such a key to a a creative partnership yeah so congratulations again on the award I'm Thirty
