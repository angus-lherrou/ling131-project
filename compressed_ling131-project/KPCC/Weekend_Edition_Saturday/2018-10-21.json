ineffective that despite all this money people are still thing to the United states\nAnd the program is not going to stop political forces that are dysfunctional or trying to destabilize countries in Central America that's not the purpose of the program that's for the defense department and the CIA and the White House to deal with the state department\nOr this president has been pretty open though about operating in a transactional manner he recently said at the United nations in New York few give anything to us and that is why we're taking a hard look at U.S foreign assistance um he's made it

show how she became one of the pioneers of confessional poetry\nTo call exactly Turpin of the University of Idaho and Aaron singer from Louisiana Tech or the scholars who found the Fort palms along with an essay and ... who joins me now she's an assistant professor of English at Louisiana Tech University Welcome thanks for having me so you found these works along with your colleague Zachary turban\nAnd when was the moment that you realize oh no one's seen these before\nWell that looked at them and said you know these look like sex then but they don't look like the facts and I've read\nSo even from the beginning we had a very clear idea that we might have found something special here so the next step but to reach out to other more established ... scholars\nWho hadn't seen them and that was when we got really excited and they put us in touch with her daughter and literary executor and then to great effect then who also that I I've never seen these either\nSo insects and as we said it's one of the poets that really introduced the idea of confessional poetry poetry that's personal so much about the I how did these pumps fit into that emerging style well\nI think one of my favorite thing about that then it how she kind of emerges ah almost fully formed right so she she wasn't on a childhood poetry writer you know before she even started taking a poetry class where she's writing for therapy twelve years after that she's winning the Pulitzer Prize for poetry and\nSo when these on the show is yes for development but also very much her initial poetic power\nIn Nineteen fifty seven sheep present her mother with a sort of homemade book of on and she said this was the first year of Anne Sexton you know poets and not before she even start publishing and then very shortly after I had a meteoric rise to fame\nSo I guess I'd like to know what these poems are about and something that really moved you can you give us an example\nIn some ways they're almost a young person one some of them the things\nThat I really like is her gestures toward an image and metaphor that really shape her whole career so there's this line that particularly moves me say I am the air

for class about zombies ... teaches at he's a professor of philosophy and because this is the month of goals and gargoyles we've got him on the line welcome to the program thank you for having me you've talked this class for a few years now and as I just said It's MORNING class but it wasn't always that way right\nNo it was not I actually started the class at night in fact it started at midnight\nAnd we talked about zombies and the and the ... hour\nI understand this is the most popular course Rawlins which isn't surprising how did you decide to teach a class about zombies though is this a bait and switch to get students to read Aristotle [laughter]\nNo it's not a bait and switch we actually talk about zombies I came upon the idea because I was trying to figure out what is the nature of consciousness\n... give us an example of the kinds of things that you are grappling with\nSo most\nPeople and students included take consciousness to simply be awareness but scientists are now thinking of consciousness as the result of\nThe neurological energy in our brains so in the class we go inside of the brain and we talk about the of all the brain and the owner of all of the brain\nTo give students the tools to talk about things like consciousness and freedom and responsibility\n... is the idea of a zombie or basically these kind of mindless flesh eating monsters and we're not clear how much um they're aware of the things that they're doing\nThat for exactly right yes I was a good student [laughter]\nWe often ignore the ... of the brain or what's sometimes called the reptilian brain so zombies exist in the reptilian brain in the movies and as it turns out in the real world humans have\nWhat we sometimes referred to as our zombie brain and you might think about it as auto pilot\nLike when you're driving the car and you sort of zone out and you don't even remember the way that you got to where you're going\nThat's the perfect example\nAnd the real world applications for the speculation right because there are murder cases where the perpetrator says that they zoned out and there's a big debate about how conscious they were of what they were doing\n[noise] there is a famous case called the ... parks case\nIn which he zones out and kills his father in law and almost killed his mother in law after looking into his history we find that he had a history of sleepwalking\nAnd the case is referred to as homicidal some number ... meaning homicide while sleepwalking\nThe Miami Herald profiled you this past week which is where we heard about your class and you had some advice for those of us during the coming zombie apocalypse and I count myself among them [laughter] so how should we survive\nOkay so\nIf a voluntary apocalypse hits you'll need food and water shelter and of course ammunition to fight off does on the attack and the the place that I could think of that would have plenty of it and a lot of space for you to move around as

is that patriarchy and white supremacy have hold on storytelling and other people want their chance\nI wanted to talk about transparent you're very open in your book about your decision to cast a Jeffrey Tambor or who is not a transgender woman I'm In the role of a more transparent can you talk a little bit about that decision because it received a lot of criticism at the time\nYeah well I was really ignorant about trans politics I guess first before I unpack everything that happened I I always want to say that Jeffrey Tambor his portrayal of Mara was absolutely astonishing and beautiful and Jeffrey's a fantastic actor\nBut also I was making huge mistake around trans politics by having assessment play a trans woman because for trans women they are being accused by people of quote unquote being men dressing up as women that's what makes chance on his so vulnerable and public\nSo having even\nJeffrey Tambor dressing up as a trans woman\nMay have translated to people who work in the know as this is what trans women are men dressing up as women so not only was it a problem with casting it really was a very very very dangerous dangerous thing for trans women you'd make a different decision now in casting\nPeople asking that question I think time machine questions are really odd because I couldn't go back because the world has changed so much and when I was making trans parents I myself really didn't understand my own parents ... yet\nAnd I still had so much of my parents' image in my mind of when she was presenting as assess mail that it didn't even occur to me to cast a trans woman so I think you know it is what it was and what it was was was the show was with Jeffrey in it\n[noise] ... um to temper was accused by a former crewmember and a member of the cast of sexual harassment ... with us allocations a surprise to you yeah they were\nA lot of focus has been on what happened there and we've had so much conversation since\nThose allegations happened about believing people who say they've been harassed or assaulted 'em and after the initial allegations you were really worried about the effect on the show and you wrote I knew it was over for Jeffrey and that meant more on the show or TV family my own family my parents' reputation everything\nAnd you've knowledge that one of the accusers was upset about that reaction\nI I Know you don't like to go into a time machine but what did you learn from that [noise]\nYeah I uh it was so interesting because you know I was with the people of time is up and an agitating for this notion of you know one of the things you know that I wrote on a posted as I was like saying what do we want right now in this moment I wrote you know unlock all and ...\nAnd ... stands for non nondisclosure agreements I felt that what Hollywood really needed was to make an accounting of how much money had been spent to put tape over women's mouth\nAnd then I was faced with this instance on our show where some trans women wanted to tell their story and I was confronted I think with my own trans massage name where I didn't immediately said to van and trace let's stand up and tell your story\nInstead I went a little bit into protection mode and as you said about about the show and thought about everybody's financial earnings I've thought about what the world would think of a show like transparent if it was connected with this reckoning\nWhat I needed to recognize but it took me a minute was the her I was says I'm a vote trace and van for taking their stories and being willing to say them out loud and in many ways sacrifice themselves and in retrospect yeah I Would like a time machine and that one\nWhat's your relationship with them temper now we haven't spoken in a little while [noise]\nThis is gonna keep happening my friend's artists people we admire then to come under scrutiny and it will be painful for their friends and colleagues and I wonder if you have advice now for people who are in the situation you and\nFor me this is a time for emotional tenderness towards everyone\nEspecially towards the victims who are willing to sacrifice again it's it's a very sacrificial act um and in terms of the men and the people who are being accused I think it's really about men deeply deeply deeply\nA lot of time and energy trying to understand how patriarchy protects their privilege and thinking of actual ways and tactics that they can take to begin to make up for the harm they've caused before they asked to come back that doesn't mean we don't treat them with tenderness and love\nDoes that mean the same for every ten more for you of course I mean Jeffrey Tambor as a member of my family I never want to put the ...\nJeffrey Tambor his career over the protection of trace lives that's career and Ben Barnes career I think that's what happens is as a culture where naturally patriarch also we naturally go well what about him\nAnd I think there are a lot of straight light says men have had positions of power and their expectation to continue and that power for the rest of their lives is part of what I think has some unconsciously demanding that they place their pain

I've never seen these either\nSo and ... and as you said it's one of the poets that really introduced the idea of confessional poetry poetry that's personal so much about the I how did these palms fit

I'm Jeffrey Tambor was accused by a former crew member and a member of the cast of sexual harassment ... what does allegations a surprise to you\nYeah they were a lot of focus has been on what happened there and we've had so much conversation since\nThose allegations happened about believing people who say they've been harassed or assaulted 'em and after the initial allegations you were really worried about the effect on the show and you wrote I knew it was over for Jeffrey and that meant more on the show or TV family my own family my parents' reputation everything\nAnd you've knowledge that one of the accusers was upset about that reaction\nI I Know you don't like to go into a time machine but what did you learn from that [noise]\nYeah I uh it was so interesting because you know I was with the people of time is up and an agitating for this notion of you know one of the things you know that I wrote an posted as I was like saying what do we want right now in this moment I wrote you know unlock all and ...\nAnd ... nondisclosure agreements I felt that what Hollywood really needed was to make an accounting of how much money had been spent to put tape over women's mouth\nAnd then I was faced with this instance at our show where some trans women wanted to tell their story and I was confronted I think with my own trans massage any where I didn't immediately said to van and trace let stand up and tell your story\nInstead I went a little bit into protection mode and as you said thought about the show and thought about everybody's financial earnings I'd thought about what the world would think of a show like transparent if it was connected with this reckoning\nWhat I needed to recognize but it took me a minute was the her I was so some of both trace and van for taking their stories and being willing to say them out loud and in many ways to sacrifice themselves and in retrospect yeah I Would like a time machine and that one\nWhat's

men\nDeeply deeply deeply spending a lot of time and energy trying to understand how patriarchy protects their privilege and thinking of actual ways and tactics that they can take to begin to make up for the harm they've caused before they asked to come back that doesn't mean we don't treat them with tenderness and\nLove does that mean the same for ... for you\nOf course I mean Jeffrey Tambor as a member of my family I never want to put the protection of Jeffrey Tambor his career over the protection of traits was that career and Ben Barnes career I think that's what happens is as a culture where naturally patriarchal so we naturally go well what about him\nAnd I think there are a lot of straight white says men who have had positions of power and their expectation to continue and that

what is the scene there like today I understand that the for some of the migrants were being allowed to cross into Mexico\nHave they been able to go what's going on\nIt's been a really confusing seen over the last twenty four hours or so so thousands of people went on this bridge which is the legal crossing into Mexico they were hoping Mexican authorities were going to open the gate and let them and they didn't feel like that was happening and they kept waiting and waiting and\nThen people started crossing the river into Mexico they were either swimming or getting raft\nAnd while the Mexican police stopped them from crossing the bridge or the official crossing into Mexico migrants who are crossing the river\nWithout a problem a federal police were standing right there watching them across the river and so there are now thousands here on the Mexican side people are trying to help out with food and water and things like that but it is just so many people here right now\nAnd I understand you've been speaking with some of the family\nYeah I met a couple of hundred families who are camped out on the bridge they were hiding out from the sun under hearts and they invited me to sit down with\nWith the basics do they have food and water I ask thirty one year old Brenda she breastfeed through six month old\nEveryone here I asked I only use their first names as they fear threats from

like it was in the I Know you people have a heart that you can feel never went to see your children [noise] the waiting on them for is hoping Mexican authorities will let them as\nThey say they'll do whatever is asked to them as\nLong as they are and sent back to Honduras the final destination is the U.S President Trump says they'll close the border on your good oh good to talk longer with us on the throne as Trump's hardly be tentative us in one day you will you'll be happier when good for you want to do [noise]\nSo what happens to the migrants now\nWell there are no ... of migrants here in Mexico or the ... across from extra Guatemalan border to respect the bridge but during the country now I'm standing on the highway um and I can see a multitude of people marching on the highway that comes north into Mexico from the border\nAnd they say they're going to head to the United states yes their plan is to continue as a caravan of to stick together\nAnd they say they will continue marching and yes there goes the United states\nWell less than three weeks away from the mid term here in the U.S President Trump has been talking a lot about this caravan uh he's demanding the Mexican government stop these migrants from reaching the border with the U.S saying it's more important to him in a recent trade agreement ah what's at stake for Mexico\nIt will be very interesting to see what happens here in Mexico because as we saw Mexican authorities\nOr use force to stop migrants from crossing a bridge but they did not stop them crossing the river so we don't know how Mexico's in react if they're going to block highways if they're really going to use force to block the\nCare of them are clearly they are concerned about looking like they are on board with Trump about this about not letting this curve and move freely but we don't know how they're going to react now\nSo lot indeed at stake from Mexico that's James Frederick reporting from the Guatemala Mexico border thanks so

intermediate range nuclear land base missiles\nTo the United states to the border is gang violence and so you can reduce gang violence and increase economic growth in these countries than the motivation to leave their countries toward the United states will diminish and to to cancel those programs means they're putting the\nAmerican people at risk\nWhen you look at how USAID has been deployed in the past you know often presidents\nSee it as a two pronged strategy right you on the one hand you might use enforcement you might use um other sort of more direct methods of trying to influence on other nations but on the other hand they also use aid\nThey use a usually in a more positive way in other words if we ever are now I ... it's unstable or are under attack\nBy terrorists groups or by neighboring power this hostile United States then we will try to strengthen them there are instances historically in the last Seventy years in both Republican and democratic administrations where presidents were threatened to cut off aid president\nTrump is not the first one to do that Lyndon Johnson cancel food aid to India and the middle of a food emergency in the Nineteen sixties because they were a neutral in the Cold War and he was annoyed with him so he's canceled the trip but I don't recall President Bush\nOr Clinton or President Obama actually threatened to cut off aid if countries didn't do it 'cause negative incentives don't tend to work that world\nFull disclosure you sit on the advisory board for a contractor and Central America what do you say to critics who say USAID has been ineffective despite all this money people are still thing to the United states\nAnd the program is not going to stop political forces that are dysfunctional or trying to destabilize countries in Central America that's not the purpose of the program that's for the defense department and the CIA and the White House to deal with the state department\nOr this president has been pretty open though about operating in a transactional manner he recently said at the United nations in New York few give anything to us and that is why we're taking a hard look at U.S foreign assistance um he's made it clear that he doesn't really believe in it as a tool of American interests\n[noise] well actually if you didn't I think he just propose abolishing uh\nHey ID or the state department's aid programs you see transactional yes he is and I I think these threats don't look at the actual reality of what's going on\nThat was Andrew nuts yeah she is now executive professor at

religion and family she won the Pulitzer Prize in Nineteen sixty seven and\nHad a prolific but tragically short career\nShe took her own life at the age of forty six\nNow to poetry hunters that's right that's a thing have discovered more of her works previously unknown works that show how she became one of the pioneers of confessional poetry\nTo call exactly Turpin of the University of Idaho and Aaron singer from Louisiana Tech or the scholars who found the poor palms along with an essay and Aaron singer joins me now she's an assistant professor of English at Louisiana Tech University Welcome thanks for having me so you found these works along with your colleague Zachary Turpin\nAnd when was the moment that you realize oh no one seemed these before\nWell that looked at them and said you know these look like sex then but they don't look like the facts and I've read\nSo even from the beginning we had a very clear idea that we might have found something special here for the next step is to reach out to other more ... scholars who hadn't seen them and that was when we got really excited\nAnd they put us in touch with um her daughter and literary executor and then to grade section who also that I I've never seen these either\nSo sexed and as you said it's one of the poets really introduced the idea of confessional poetry poetry that's personal so much about the I how do these pumps fit into that emerging style\nWell I think one of my favorite things about that then it how she kind of emerges uh almost fully formed right so she she wasn't on a childhood poetry writer you know before she even started taking a poetry class where she's writing for therapy twelve years after that she's winning the Pulitzer Prize for poetry and\nSaid I Want to be on the show is yes her development but also very much her initial politic power\nIn Nineteen fifty seven sheep present her mother with a sort of homemade book upon and she says this was the first year of an effect and you know poets and not before she even start publishing and then very shortly after I had a meteoric rise to fame\nSo I guess I'd like to know what these poems are about and something that really moved you can you give us an example\nIn some ways they're almost a young person one some of them\nThe things that I really like is her gestures toward a image and metaphor that really shape her whole career so there's this line that particularly moves me say I am the air I break\nOr say I am a little unwinding I Am the school that unwound while riding the sky down a and I just think that's incredibly beautiful and of occupy\nAaron singer she's an assistant professor of English at Louisiana Tech you can see those poems in the next\nIssue of the few literary journal of the University of

got him on the line welcome to the program thank you for having me\nYou've talked this class for a few years now and as I just said It's MORNING class but it wasn't always that way right\n[noise] no it was not I actually started the class at night in fact it started at midnight\nAnd we talked about zombies and the and the ... hour\nI understand this is the most popular course Rawlins which isn't surprising how did you decide to teach a class about zombies though is this a bait and switch to get students to read Aristotle\n[laughter] no it's not a bait and switch we actually talk about zombies I came upon the idea because I was trying to figure out what is the nature of consciousness\n... give us an example of the kinds of things that you are grappling with\nSo most people and students included take consciousness to simply be awareness but scientists are now thinking of consciousness\nAs the result of the neurological energy in our brains so in the class we go inside of the brain and we talk about the of all the brain and the ... of the brain to give students the tools to talk about things like consciousness and freedom and responsibility\n... is the idea of a zombie so basically these kind of mindless flesh eating monsters and we're not clear how much um they're aware of the things that they're doing that's exactly right yes I was a good student [laughter]\nWe often ignore the ... the brain or what's sometimes called the reptilian brain so zombies exist in the reptilian brain in the movies and as it turns out in the real world humans have\nWhat we sometimes referred to as our zombie brain and you might think about it as auto pilot\nLike when you're driving the car and you sort of zone out and you don't even remember the way that you got to where you're going that's the perfect example and the real world applications for the speculation right because there are murder cases where the perpetrator says that they zoned out and there's a big debate about how conscious they were of what they were doing\n[noise] there is a famous case called the can of parks case in which he zones out and kills his father in law and almost killed his mother in law\nAfter looking into his history we find that he had a history of sleepwalking and the case is referred to as homicidal some number ... meaning homicide while sleepwalking\nThe Miami Herald profiled you this past week which is where we heard about your class and you had some advice for those of us during the coming zombie apocalypse and I count myself among them [laughter] so how should we survive\nOkay so\nIf I was on the apocalypse hits you'll need food and water shelter and of course ammunition to fight off their zombie attack and the the place that I could think of that would have plenty of it and a lot of space for you to move around the Walmart so often tell people go to Wal Mart\nHunker down and fight it out for as long as you can\n... a professor of philosophy at
