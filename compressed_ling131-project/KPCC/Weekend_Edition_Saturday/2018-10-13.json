functional very loving group of people fell victim to this and it crosses all sorts of boundaries that doesn't discriminate and as\nWe were filming and people understood what are the themes of the film were we could be almost anywhere and people came out of the woodwork with their personal stories of addiction and recovery and loss and it was striking to me that it has\nUm really affected so many people if you don't know someone personally you know someone who knows someone and\nTimothy showing I think first and foremost it's what Steve said which is a conversation with people and Saturn locations were shooting and realizing that almost everyone is either affected or knew someone who was affected by this disease and um\nAnd also I Would hope for those who hopefully see it would achieve like\nThat it isn't um especially in the case of methamphetamine users quote in the film from a doctor it's not that he is a perhaps unwilling to participate in treatment options might be that he's unable in that it's not um there's this idea of willpower or a\nMisconception of willpower perhaps as being a he'll pick yourself up by your bootstraps sort of way of getting yourself that it's kind of situation and\nWhen it's much more complex than that and the greatest answers are the ones that lead you down a greater understanding of how and comprehensible this all is but that a family support and love and ultimately perseverance and within the resources that are out there one can one can persevere and get through this\nI think this is a story about love and there's a scene in which my character has to essentially turned his back on his son because\nAh he realizes it's the best thing for the rest of his family and it's the only thing he's left with it's the only thing it says only recourse at that point and it was a difficult thing because it goes against every fiber and my being as a parent\nUm and it was hard to wrap my head around the idea of turning my back on a on a child but it's true and it's I think very real and it's it's such a gray area that's the other thing I found with this\nMaterial and the story is that there are no easy answers there is no there's no happy ending\nReally there's perhaps a hopeful ending but ah as most often the case with the scenarios or it's ... it's ongoing Timothy showing me how is\nNick [noise] I think Nick is well and uh you know he himself that he's not an expert on addiction and that he found for his recovery it was almost like a finding puzzle pieces of what worked what didn't work and um and I think he's um\nI think he's well I guess I Want to speak for him but Steven I hadn't had lunch with him and do David and it's been a joy to get to spend time with them since the films promotion\nSteve grill and Timothy ...

children\nThat approach may have won over some moderates but it alienated those further to the right to conservative talk show host Laura Ingraham she blasted Yoder for supporting a democratic plan that would make it easier for migrants fleeing domestic abuse to get asylum in the United states\nThe odors that he's sympathize with the victims because his mother was a social worker here's her response on Fox News\nYour family history shouldn't be allowed to reward the president's immigration agenda and frankly imperil the party prospects in the mid term\nYoder eventually backed away from

Angeles but you're also staggered to reading your book how much stuff there isn't a great urban libraries just stuff but we shouldn't be lost in LA\nAmong the things that were lost in the fire the

librarians build the collection of their department they choose the books\nFrom their own interests and knowledge and when those disappear you don't just go and click a button and replace them all I mean many of them are books that can't be found any more\nSo for these librarians it was absolutely devastating to see the books destroyed what I thought was really interesting as many of them

about a library were partly because oh it's so exciting there's so much great stuff here\nBut some of it was being in a place that I share with other people and we're all looking for whatever it is

Snyder\nSearch and rescue efforts in the delivery of relief supplies into areas of Florida's panhandle affected by hurricane Michael's being slowed somewhat by the extensive damage NPR's David Schaper reports several roads and highways and the area remain impassable because of structural damage and debris\nMorning Scott I'm a major disaster like hurricane Michael often focuses politicians which at which you didn't Florida but President Trump chose that moment to receive Kanye West at the White House not this wasn't a private meeting like Nixon an Elvis but a a big advance with cameras and questions why\nYou know in the post Katrina era Scott the assumption has been that when a hurricane comes you focus on that\nInstead of the things aside so it was jarring when the president went ahead with his summit with Kanye West and as you say it was a major full media presence in the oval office\nBut the president's theme all week has been to keep the focus on the president\nHe's had a flurry of news availability is way more than usual in fact in the last month he's had more than in all the time previously in his presidency very flashy events campaign rallies around the country night after night and that happens just as the cable operations television news\nHas a well they've begun to lose interest in some of those rallies they're not covering them from beginning to end anymore sometimes not covering the mall at all perhaps because they do seem to be Newsweek campaign events and maybe because they've become so frequent\nDoes this week's shutting 'em stocks fell off raised questions about what it seemed to be so much good news about the economy including at historically low unemployment rate\nYes it is historically low there there was a steep and sudden sell off though in the middle of the week eight hundred points I Lived out one day another five hundred the next the Dow did recover and the other indices recovered on friday\nBut there was a chill that went through investors thinking about all the times in the past when everything seemed to be going just right until everything seemed to go completely rule so yes we have been in the middle of rosy scenario or gold Lee locks economy whichever you prefer\nAh the striking thing from a political standpoint was the president's reaction he does have his own way of dealing with crises even temporary ones and he generally denies that there's a problem and then uses the appearance of a problem as a cudgel against someone else and in this case\nThat was Federal Reserve board chairman Jerome Powell who is of course the president's own appointee [noise]\nI I feel we have to get to the disappearance and the alleged murder of ... the journalist there's been bipartisan outrage and calls for for action on Capitol Hill what can Congress actually do\nCongress can cut off a lot of our relationship with Saudi Arabia we have enormous arms deals with Saudi Arabia we have an enormous amount of trade with Saudi Arabia\nSaudi Arabia spend about twenty seven million dollars in the last year just on lobbying just in Washington DC so this is an intense relationship and all the money has to go through Congress and even if Jared Kushner is handling the main negotiations and really being our main contact point with Saudi Arabia\nIt's still Congress that has to write the checks so Congress has real power here and this is a bipartisan issue it's not just Democrats like Chris Coons it's also Republicans like Marco Rubio who are incensed over what appears to have happened to a Washington Post columnist in the embassy of\nSaudi Arabia in hunker a turkey\nAnd and the question has to be raised with his support outspoken support for Vladimir reporting for Kim Jong on a for president of the Philippines\nDoes the president send the message that dictators can do as they please\nThe president's let's be Frank came to power promising to disrupt official Washington and the way things have been done including in terms of our relationships with just about every other country\nAnd that is a promise on which the president has delivered and his base voters are delighted with it even if it gives you pause to members of Congress and people in the media and other observers Ron Elving thanks so much like he's got\nHis twelve year old David better was about to die at Texas children's

Washington on Barbara fine\nEmergency workers are still sifting through the wreckage from hurricane Michael which slammed into the Florida Panhandle Wednesday the storm is being blamed for at least sixteen death but NPR's Amy held reports officials say the number will likely rise as crews reach hard hit areas\nUm we we are cutting it we're now in that oil exporter we we dependent so heavily on them for so long but to us as an energy producer and we have other sources now it's it's a ... that is not necessary for us\nSenator Tim Kaine of Virginia thanks so much for being with us absolutely\nOr President Trump heading out on the campaign trail this week a failed he had a lot to brag about although we often didn't need a reason just to brag\nBrett Kavanaugh had his first week on the Supreme Court their results are good economic news with unemployment hitting a nearly fifty year low and Christian evangelists pastor Andrew Brunson has just been released from detention in Turkey\nThe president talked about all of this and supportive Republican candidates in Ohio last night NPR's Don ... joined just from Lebanon not far from Cincinnati Don thanks for being with us\nIndeed good morning you spent the day speaking with Trump supporters but first let's hear from the president he speaks here about how justice Kavanaugh and how he was treated\nThe way they treated him I've never seen anybody treated like that what he's done a great service because we are more energized those Republicans [noise]\nThan ever I think\nSo how does that feel on the ground on their polls that showed that Republican enthusiasm is on the upswing right now I'm In one of the redder\nParts of Ohio and here you can absolutely feel the GOP voters are animated and Kevin all the confirmation fight is the reason I was walking around downtown Lebanon and\nI met forty one year old Consuelo green she told me she voted Trump but has always been an independent voter she says she also voted for Bill Clinton for president way back when but here's her take on twenty Eighteen\nI made him the lean to actually joined the Republican Party completely\nOkay so based on what you've seen or their particular issues or things that have happened that the parties but hey I just don't agree with how the Democrats are handling things an outlandish and not wanting to sit down and listen to the other side\nAnd Scott when I pressed her she said the attacks on Kavanaugh or what pushed her over the edge\n[noise] still a as Republican operative certainly no they're they're kind of bucking a historic trends at the party in power usually loses seats in the mid term subs the president to address that\nWell it's clearly the reason he is working it so hard he's got another event tonight in in Kentucky and his practice of course is to dismiss polls that don't contain good news so he still does that I can tell you that at\nThe at the rallies people often don't know who their congressional representative is a and even if they do they'll often readily admit that they're just there to see Trump never got to read\nThe one that I live on how to deal with all the crowd you got to get off and have a real\nRepublican ticket anyway [noise]\nUm [noise] not really going to change the way I I think\nSo it's got that from last night and Lebanon it's thirty four year old Chris Miller he works as a production manager says he's a conservative ah I you know I pressed him on congressional races and he just kept saying he's there to see Trump he doesn't mind the pitch from Trump but he's not paying much attention to it\nYou do you notice any new wrinkle in the president's campaign I think we can fairly college kick\nYou said yes I mean look a lot of it feels feels really familiar but\nAs election day gets closer he's ratcheting up his rhetoric he portrays Democrats not just as opponents but as bad people and individual Democrats\nAre a bad guy and he says they want to usher in radical\nSocialism he says they want to promote crime so so you get all of that he also talked about Kanye West calling that moment this week in the oval office amazing even Steve Shabba the conservative Republican congressmen stood on the stage yesterday in Lebanon this was his district\nAnd he used part of his Ninety second longest speech to say God Bless Kanye West so look that was a moment from Trump\nAnd from the congressman and perished on gun here thanks so much pleasure\nMm\nLater today at the White House President Trump is expected to welcome in American pastor was released on Friday after two years in detention in Turkey Andrew Brunson had been at the center of a high level international lobbying campaign NPR's Scott Horsley reports\nPastor Russian was arrested in Turkey in twenty sixteen along with thousands of others as part of a round up following a failed coup attempt against Turkish president regimen type or to walk\nBrunson an evangelical Christian around a small church in Turkey has denied charges of espionage and aiding terrorist he was permitted to transfer to house arrest two months ago and finally freed altogether after a court hearing on friday\nPresident Trump was quick to cheer the decision on Twitter but he held on speaking publicly about Bronson until the bastard cleared Turkish airspace and it was on his way back to the United states\nWere very honored to have him back with us he uh\nHe suffered greatly but we're very appreciative do a lot of people a lot of people\nWith strong backing from the president's evangelical supporters the Trump Administration has lobbied hard for ... release Trump and vice president Pence repeatedly raised the issue with Turkish president or two on two months ago the U.S impose sanctions on Turkey's justice and interior ministers citing what it called the pastor's unfair and unjust attention\nTrump also doubled the terror afraid on Turkish exports of steel and aluminum\nRuns relief

several records when it came ashore this week on Florida's panhandle it was the most powerful hurricane ever in that part of Florida and brought nearly an eight foot storm surge that scenario in Appalachia cola that's at the heart of Florida's oyster industry\nNPR's Greg Allen visited the area and filed this report\nAppalachian coal is a small city just a few thousand people but it's tight knit and self reliant on friday\nTwo days after the storm makes your restaurant was in full swing on a downtown St hadn't gotten meals hamburgers sausages chicken Mac and cheese Lindsey shepherd says people in restaurants in town donated food we\n[noise] uh yeah I guess my biggest takeaway is that\nAddiction itself\nIt can happen to anyone it can happen to any family this seemingly functional very loving group of people fell victim to this and\nIt crosses all sorts of boundaries that doesn't discriminate and as we were filming\nAnd then people understood what are the themes of the film were we could be almost anywhere and people came out of the woodwork with their personal stories of addiction and recovery and loss and it was striking to me that it has\nUm really affected so many people if you don't know someone personally you know someone who knows someone and\nTimothy showing I think first and foremost it's what Steve said which is a conversation with people and Saturn locations we were shooting and realizing that almost everyone is either affected or knew someone who was affected by this disease and um\nAnd also I Would hope for those who hopefully see it would achieve like\nThat it isn't um especially in the case of methamphetamine users quote in the film from a doctor it's not that he is a perhaps unwilling to participate in treatment options might be that he's unable and that it's not um there's this idea of willpower or a\nMisconception of willpower perhaps as being a pick yourself up by your bootstraps sort of way of getting yourself it was kind of situation and\nWhen it's much more complex than that and and the greatest answers are the ones that lead you down a greater understanding of how and comprehensible this all is but that a family support and love and ultimately perseverance\nAnd within the resources that are out there one can when can persevere and get through this\nI think this is a story about love and there's a scene in which my character has to essentially turn his back on his side because\nUh he realizes it's the best thing for the rest of his family and it's the only thing he's left with it's the only thing it it is only recourse at that point and it was a difficult thing because it goes against every fiber and my being as a parent um\nAnd it was hard to wrap my head around the idea of turning my back on a on a child but it's true and it's I think very real and it's it's such a gray area that's the other thing I found with this\nMaterial and the story is that there are no easy answers there is no there's no happy ending really there's perhaps a hopeful ending but ah as most often the case with these scenarios or it's the it's ongoing\nTimothy ... how is Nick\nNick is well and uh you know he himself said he's not an expert on addiction and that he found for his recovery it was almost like I'm finding puzzle pieces of what worked what didn't work and um and I think he's um\nI think he's well I guess I Want to speak for him but Steven I hadn't had lunch with him and do David and uh it's been a joy to get to spend time with them since the phones promotion\nSteve grill and Timothy shall I may

reminded you I guess your phrase that the the many Senegalese have for death\n[noise] it was an incredible phrase which is when someone dies a library burns down meaning the person's own\nHost of memories and stories and anecdotes that we store in our minds disappears when someone dies and it struck me as being a wonderful\nWay of seeing why libraries feel like these big collective brains because they have the memories and stories of the whole culture inside them [noise]\nWe we mentioned the I'm more than a million bucks destroyed or damaged in Los Angeles but you're also staggered you're reading your book how much stuff there isn't a great urban libraries just stuff but we are so many items lost in LA\nAmong the things that were lost in the fire the library had every automobile

... some of thinking and storytelling and those end up in libraries and [noise]\nAnd to be sure there was a human cost to the employees of Los Angeles public library for the seven years that had been burned and was closed wasn't there\nIt was devastating this was the life's work of these librarians we think of libraries is just somehow\nGetting bucks but it doesn't work like that librarians build the collection of their department they choose the books\nFrom their own interests and knowledge and when those disappear you don't just go and click a button and replace them all I mean many of them are books that can't be found any more so for these\nThe ... it was absolutely devastating to see the books destroyed what I thought was really interesting is many of them suffered terrible anxiety

because oh it's so exciting there's so much great stuff here but some of it was being in a place that I share with other people\nAnd we're all looking for whatever it is that we're interested in at

into areas of Florida's panhandle ravaged by hurricane Michael though officials say the devastation is so severe trucks are having trouble getting into the most heavily damaged areas\nGood morning Scott I'm a major disaster like hurricane Michael often focuses politicians which which didn't Florida but President Trump\nWas that moment to receive Kanye West at the White House not this wasn't a private meeting like Nixon and Elvis but a a big event with cameras and questions why\nYou know in the post Katrina era Scott the assumption has been that when a hurricane comes you focus on that\nInstead of the things aside so it was jarring when the president went ahead with his summit with Kanye West and as you say it was a major full media presence in the oval office\nAbout the president's name all week has been to keep the focus on the president\nHe's had a flurry of news availability is way more than usual in fact in the last month these had more than in all the time previously in his presidency very flashy events campaign rallies around the country night after night and that happens just as the cable operations television news\nHas a well they've begun to lose interest in some of those rallies they're not covering them from beginning to end anymore sometimes not covering the mall at all perhaps because they do seem to be Newsweek campaign events and maybe because they've become so frequent\nDoes this week sudden I'm stocks off raised questions about what it seemed to be so much good news about the economy including at historically low unemployment rate\nYes it is historically low there there was a steep sudden sell off though in the middle of the week eight hundred points I Lived out one day another five hundred the next\nThe Dow did recover and the other indices recovered on friday\nBut there was a chill that went through investors thinking about all the times in the past when everything seemed to be going just right until everything seemed to go completely rule so yes we have been in the middle of rosy scenario or goldie locks economy whichever you prefer\nAh the striking thing from a political standpoint was the president's reaction he does have his own way of dealing with crises even temporary ones and he generally denies that there's a problem and then uses the appearance of a problem as a cudgel against someone else and in this case\nThat was Federal Reserve board chairman Jerome Powell who is of course the president so to ...\nI I feel we have to get to the disappearance and the alleged murder of ... the journalists there's been bipartisan outrage and calls for for action on Capitol Hill what can Congress actually do Congress can cut off a lot\nOf our relationship with Saudi Arabia we have enormous arms deals with Saudi Arabia we have an enormous amount of trade with Saudi Arabia\nSaudi Arabia spend about twenty seven million dollars in the last year just on lobbying just in Washington DC so this is an intense relationship\nAnd all the money has to go through Congress\nAnd even if Jared Kushner is handling the main negotiations and really being our main contact point with Saudi Arabia [noise]\nIt's still Congress that has to write the checks so Congress has real power here and this is a bipartisan issue it's not just Democrats like Chris Coons it's also Republicans like Marco Rubio who are incensed over what appears to have happened to a Washington Post columnist in the embassy of\nSaudi Arabia in hunker a turkey\nAnd and the question as to be raised with his support outspoken support for Vladimir Putin for Kim Jong on a for president of the Philippines there's the president sent\nThe message that dictators can do as they please\nThe president's let's be Frank came to power promising to disrupt official Washington and the way things have been done including in terms of our relationships with just about every other country\nAnd that is a promise on which the president has delivered and his base voters are delighted with it even if it gives you pause to members of Congress and people in the media and other observers Ron Elving thanks so much like he's got\nHis twelve
