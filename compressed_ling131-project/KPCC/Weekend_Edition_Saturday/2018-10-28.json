up a bit I have to say I knew\nUm at least ten of eleven fairly well\nYou have spent time with these families can you tell me what the reaction has been in the wake of this\nYeah I spent a little time yesterday I have to say with before that people really knew but these were people who hadn't heard about their relatives and they went on a sort of became clear that the news was not good um these are wonderful people good souls who are just coming to synagogue\n'cause they usually did they were synagogue was just getting started and mostly elderly people who come there are there at the beginning and you can count on them every week for coming I'm In a mentioned\nThe one woman rose in her nineties you know but she was one of the younger ones among us I have to tell you in terms of her spirit ... or ... years old\nBut she just a rose was wonderful and and um I mean and the brothers and all of them I'm just such wonderful sweet sauce and it's such a prime of their lives were taken from us\nYeah you were at you will not have to send it back at the time of the shooting that you did arrive on the scene shortly after yeah I live\nI live in the community I've grown up in Pittsburgh uh lived here for most of my life um what did you see\nWell there was a quarter and you really couldn't get close to the synagogue so basically I came down and it was right around the block from where I live and you know I I wanted\nTo try to convert people and try to do something whatever I could do and I ran into some people who were waiting to get to hear about their relatives who we know where they're\nAlso to see some people who I thought would would have been there some were delayed by traffic or was sick or whatever it might have been and didn't make it there um and uh it was just a\nYou know when it hits it hits home if it's um extra hard to deal with you spent\nTime also yesterday at a Greek center what did you tell people how do you counsel people about something like that\nYeah well I think just being there for them and letting them know that there are people there for them you hogs and letting people cry on his shoulder and just letting them know you again you're going to be there for them and um I I did have to\nTo tell one I'm a woman that her brothers [noise] a lot of her brothers who I knew at the time had been killed from what I had heard\nAnd I have to tell her that I mean that's part of families that have been so hard\nIt is very hard but it's part of I think being a rabbi um but she deserve to know what I knew at that time um as far as rather brother I I didn't know at the time we did just that know\nWhat the story was so there was an uncertainty there um there were a lot of people that are helping\nWho came to try to you know Pittsburgh is that you've heard it's a wonderful community it's not only wonderful Jewish community it's just a wonderful community we have\nA wonderful a medical facilities the police to do an excellent job politicians are good at our good leaders and the leaders of the Jewish community are strong and it also the Jewish community gets along together one with another even though we believe and maybe different kinds of things\nSo it's very special it's been a special place to grow up in a special place to raise my kids I have to say I'm\nVery grateful to have that opportunity so that that was our immediate job isn't is to comfort the mourners and to comfort the community and and to just be strong as we take each day as it comes\nFrom I chucked diamond thank you very much for speaking with us in our deepest condolences on such a very sad day\nAppreciate that and I hope it's for joyous occasion we could be together indeed okay thank you thank you Bye bye Bye bye\nTo help us make sense of something so senseless hum we are now joined by NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson um and to put this into context as well because there were package bombs sent a prominent Democrat this past week and uh this is affecting our political discourse in our political leaders good morning Mara\nHigh they're little and President Trump held a political rally in Illinois in the wake of the shooting at the tree of life synagogue what did he have to say\nYeah let me just say a few thoughts\nFirst of all my mom grew up in the Jewish community yeah Pittsburgh she's Ninety to my cousins all grew up in the world health\nAnd what we're talking about I think is the worst anti Semitic attack in us history just days after as you just said the largest assassination attempt on political leaders in us history so too\nHorrific violent acts and the president has had a lot of unifying words he has spoken out against what he's called pure evil\nBut he has followed those words with partisan attacks politics as usual at his rallies with a little less vitriol he said last night at his rally in Illinois I'm going to tone it down a little bit and he did\nBut it's also true and we're going to have a big debate about this that he has tweeted that George Soros funded the caravan\nThe George ... Berg also posted on social media the Jews were funding the caravan he particularly I was angry about the Hebrew immigrant aid society\nAnd the Kevin McCarthy the majority leader in the house has been tweeting how Soros dire and Bloomberg are trying to steal this election which is pretty coated anti Semitic language so we're going to have a big debate about\nWhether the president's words words of other people helped create this climate nobody's saying that in any way the president is responsible for what happened\nBut there is what he says and then there is what people here we're also going to have a big debate about gun control right after the incident the president said that if there had been more people with guns in the synagogue this wouldn't have happened already you've heard the Pittsburgh mayor and the governor of Pennsylvania say no that's not the answer so\nTen days nine days out from the election we've got the situation to process and try to figure out how to stop and the future\nThe mind let me just say first of all I'm so sorry I didn't realize that you had a personal connection to the synagogue is of course that's not the synagogue just in the community to the community I mean you mentioned that there are of course many ramifications a mid term elections are just over a week away\nWe'll be offensive this past week affect the elections and if so how\nWell I don't know I think the easy answer the quick answer is to say that the trajectory of this election is pretty well set\nA house looks like it's trending to the Democrats the Senate looks like it's trending to the Republicans\nBut it might have some effect\nI mean this once again through us gun violence into the political debate some people might be reminded of how they felt after the Parkland shootings may be that would have an effect\nI'm One of the effects that I think this will happen as the pipe bomb story had is that\nIt makes it harder for the president to control the narrative because we're not talking about cabinet and the caravan as much as we're talking about the pipe bomber and the synagogue shooter and he has actually complained about that he said that\nHe'd been looking at in momentum and now this bomb thing happened and that's all the media is talking about if you've been listening to special coverage from NPR News\n\nI'm neuron with these headlines

giants scholastic and he's telling the story of how he fell in love with the book\nWhat I could relate to so strongly was this idea that maybe there's something inside of you that nobody else can see\nHe knew that it was the kind of story that speaks very particularly to children that makes everybody feel seen\nThe idea of hidden identities and\nThe goodness and rightness of who you or is not necessarily mirrored in society I mean this is a theme running through Harry Potter it would have been a huge things in my life as a little gay kid growing up and\nThere isn't much that as explicitly gay and Harry Potter\nLiving new at the time he was taking a risk on an unknown author and Sean read that wasn't selling that well\nThere was no market for hardcover children's fiction fantasy was not

book it wasn't just like the tune dirty readers and you know the class it was the whole class\nAnd appeal to a huge variety of readers but it does reflect every reader the three main characters in the books are white and the experience of the British boarding school magic or not is a fairly narrow one\nLevine acknowledges this but says that what the series did do was create a whole new generation of readers of all backgrounds who would go on to become writers and editors themselves\nAll of my editors now where people who had grown up loving Harry Potter and that love sparked this idea I Want to make books\nI connected to the friendship I Love that there is a threat of I'm very young people having the power to make a difference and that was my in\nCape Feldman is one of those editors she's

University of Wisconsin she says fewer than ten percent of books feature characters of color or are written by non white authors and there's not a lot of variety in those books she says they're often historical narrative about slavery or civil rights\nWhat we don't see a lot of with diversity are books like Harry Potter a dinner just pure fantasy and in fact those are the kind of books that African American children for example really are clamoring for\nBut Horning is hopeful and just over the last couple of years there have been some breakout titles like last year's dread nation by just

percent increase in anti Semitic incidents in K. through twelve classrooms in schools across the United states\nBefore we get to why you think this is happening when you say anti Semitic incidence ... what do you discussing\nWhen we're talking about an anti Semitic incident at a at a school in a classroom and a K. through twelve\nIt's everything from a ... a swastika on a bathroom wall to instances in a and most recently in a western state where a a a student um made very callous and cold references related to the\nTo the death of Jews and the Holocaust as part of a Valentine's Day project and so it really takes all different shapes informs just three weeks ago here in northern Virginia\nA I was at the Jewish community center in Fairfax where Nineteen swastikas where spray painted on the side of a really a community center where people come to exercise and and hold community based events so it really takes all forms\nWhy do you think this is happening now\nI think a couple of things that ... in in the recent years I'm there has been a normalization of hate and extremism both online and off line that the normalization of rhetoric\nAnd from the highest levels of re tweets of individuals' like David Duke from posts in and re statements that are associated with white nationalist in this country has had almost become normal or part of a a a global discourse\nIn addition to that ah the political divide in this country has become so toxic and when combined with the normalization of this type of hate speech in anti Semitism has really led to a volatile atmosphere that we've seen play out just in the past week\nAlso this week or a bomb was delivered to the home of George Soros is also Jewish we've seen a lot of trafficking of conspiracy theories about him on mainstream conservative TV news like Fox even\nCorrect and in fact in a ... a deal recently released some reporting\nUm that goes back in ... a lot of the conspiracy theories and they have their roots in anti Semitic conspiracy theories as well this is something that we've unfortunately seen play out\nUm both in the all find an online space as some of the most vitriolic or anti Semitic attacks against source and others have really come out in the past year or two and it's something that you deal will remain constant in vigilant in combating on a day in and day out basis\nOr we should also say this shooter um was also trafficking in these conspiracy theories he apparently believe that the cat on coming from Central America which has been repeatedly discussed at by the president and others I was being sponsored by Jewish organizations\nCorrect uh one of the Jewish organizations that was mentioned and some of his his post as high as an organization this tremendous work on on

in a larger context than your political label what they discovered they often like each other and can actually work well together and that's the hope of how we get out of where we are today\nAgree with Carolyn I'm I Do think though that we have to consider the power dynamics um so\nThe president of the United states has a uniquely powerful position to amplify the messages that he's sending out in ways that that the rest of us don't I also think we need to think about the impact of this rhetoric\nOn immigrant community in the United states there is research documenting that pernicious health effects people are afraid to send their kids to school they're afraid to go to the doctor um and so\nYou know we think about rhetoric and language and how it's how all of us need to take

in in the recent years I'm there has been a normalization of hate and extremism both online and off line that the normalization of rhetoric\nAnd from the highest levels of retreats of individuals' like David Duke from posts in and re statements that are associated with white nationalist in this country has had almost become normal or part of a a a global discourse\nIn addition to that uh the political divide in this country has become so toxic and when combined with the normalization of this type of hate speech and anti Semitism has really led to a volatile atmosphere that we've seen play out just in the past week\nAlso this week or a bomb was delivered to the home of George Soros is also Jewish we've seen a lot of trafficking of conspiracy theories about him on mainstream conservative TV news like Fox even\nCorrect ... and in fact in a ... a deal recently released some reporting\nUm that goes back in ... a lot of the conspiracy theories and they have their roots and anti Semitic conspiracy theories as well this is something that we've unfortunately seen play out\nUm both in the ... flying an online space as some of the most vitriolic or anti Semitic attacks against ... and others have really come out uh in the past year or two and it's something that you deal will remain constant in vigilant in combating on a day in and day out basis\nI we should also say this shooter um was also trafficking in these conspiracy theories the apparently believe that the cat on coming from Central America which has been repeatedly disgusted by the president and others are was being sponsored by Jewish organizations\nCorrect uh one of the Jewish organizations that was mentioned and some of his his post was highest an organization this tremendous work on on refugees and ... as well as the Anti Defamation league I mean there were several posting comments in his open source social media um\nThere were many victims in this case a that we're in Pittsburgh and beyond and it's up to us as a global community of citizens and organizations to remain vigilant and push back against all forms of anti Semitism discrimination and bigotry and we're committed to doing\nSo George ... senior vice president for programs at the Anti Defamation league thank you so much for coming in thank you\nAnd not to Brazil voters there are choosing their next president and the outcome could fundamentally change the political landscape of the region leading in the polls ahead of today's final run off is ... he's a far right congressman who admires the Brazilian military dictatorship that came to power in the sixties\nAnd ruled for over two decades but when I was a retired army captain who has a team of retired military advisors NPR's Philip Reeves is in Rio de Janeiro and he joins us\nNow good morning holding 'em I can hear you on the street their helicopters obviously overhead lots of security voting began what are you seeing [noise]\nWell yeah I'm outside of school in West in Rio it's used as a voting station\nThey it's a mild grey day off from the media had to go there I had a it's a pretty tranquil Sunday Morning there's not much sense of this being a momentous day which it is for Brazil Latin America but people have been wondering in many of them wrapped\nIn a in Brazil national flag on\nThis has been a very ugly campaign um can you just fill us and unwind motions are running so high [noise]\nWhile indeed it has I mean there'll be lots of ... and politically motivated attacks so I'm against the algae beat the community and attacks are threats against ... so\nThis election is about anger and it's about the uh many people are voting for those who are angry at the left is with his party that ruled Brazil to eat in the last Fifteen Years president Luiz ... Lula da Silva who was president much of that time is now in jail for corruption\nAnd during the later stages of the Workers Party government that was a terrible recession\nWas the start of a humiliating huge corruption scandal\nAnd the impeachment of loot isn't that the gentleman Rousseff\nAt the same time opponents of bumps and NATO are angry and fearful about him at his record\nOf intolerance as you know he's a he's an infamous for making sexist racist remarks and they're worried about what his presidency might bring\nAnd yet the polls say that he will win how much trustee putting in those numbers [noise]\nWell about a week ago he had an Eighteen point lead in the polls and he looked pretty unassailable ah his opponents than and that would that have the workers' party has\nBeen making headway in the last few days on the eve of election polls have the gap between them around ten points which means it's still pretty unlikely that dies you can win but not impossible\nI we only have a few seconds left what about the concerns there that democracy itself isn't listening\nAnd they see Democrats protesting and view that as hounding politicians 'em and they say that there has been many inflammatory messages coming from the left and they lay the blame on them is this an endless cycle of what about is a huge both looked at this um how do you litigate this it is so hyper part is now\nI definitely we run into people it's probably ten to twelve percent on the far right and eight to ten percent on the far left the researchers tell us who have no interest in closing this divide who want to feed this divide but that leaves a full Seventy five or eighty percent of us\nWho when we are put in a different context with the purpose of stepping back and taking a look at\nWho are you in a larger context than your political label what they discovered they often like each other and can actually work well together and that's the hope of how we get out of where we are today\n[noise] I agree with Carolyn I'm I Do think though that we have to consider the power dynamics um so the president of the United states has a uniquely powerful position to amplify the messages that he's sending out in ways that that the rest of us don't I also think we need to think about the impact of this rhetoric\nOn immigrant community in the United states there's research documenting that pernicious health effects people are afraid to send their kids to school they're afraid to go to the doctor um and so\nYou know we think about rhetoric and language and how it's how all of us have to take responsibility to the past it we also need to account for those whose lives are being deeply affected by it right now\n[noise] Carolyn Lukens fire executive director of the national Institute for civil discourse at the University of Arizona and ... assistant professor of sociology at Washington University in St Louis and ... thank you for having us thank you\nBefore the shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh we asked listeners to call in and tell us where they find connection at this moment when the nation is so very divided\nMany of the responses we got we're reminder of how difficult that connection is defined right now some of you wrote that you long for those kinds of places but these days common ground is hard to find but there were a few bright spots\nEvery week I have regularly scheduled conversations with seniors we call it\nHeather ... is an outreach librarian at the bay county public library in Panama City Florida she says they talk about everything and anything including politics at one assisted living facility the club is especially diverse deeply conservative Floridians liberal New Englanders transplants from Europe\nAnd that group where we are happy to see one another and so eager to talk we won't soldier on through any topic that comes up we had some heated moments that we started from Jeff in time to wander together to the dining room for lunch\nMany people called in and sided houses of worship as places where they find common ground and the feeling of community we are thinking today of the tree of life cynical and the community score\n\nCheese\nHe\nGoes oh\nGeez\n\nOh\n\nYou're listening to weekend edition from NPR News it's not every day that scientists announced a new season but that's what ocean

like\nNone of those hypoxia season hits the west coast every summer and can last from a couple of days to a few months you can cover a few square miles old thousands of square miles and there's even video of it and the reefs with dead creatures littering the sea floor\nChan who's now co chair of the California hypoxia tossed boss says the question is why why is this happening\nOne of the more fundamental reason is that the ocean is warmer now and ... holds less auction and then the second part is that a warmer surface ocean it acts as an insulating blanket\nScientists say climate change is behind this the oceans have been absorbing nearly all the rising heat from greenhouse gas emissions and is projected to grow even warmer in coming decades Oregon State university oceanographer jak boss thinks the higher temperatures are also slowing ocean tolerance and that if we could see under the waves it'd be more concerned\nAs an analogy you think about the summer when the guys were filled with smoke covered the whole city northwest right that's a huge area when we used to think about hypoxia in the ocean we think about little areas but now what we're looking at is out in the ocean
