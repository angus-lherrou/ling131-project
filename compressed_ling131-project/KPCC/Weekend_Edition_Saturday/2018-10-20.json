C. A.\nAnd to ensure that the insurance markets work more properly and that we can lower premiums and deductibles for everyone but\nBottom line not let me ask does that mean you would vote against repeal it\nMeans that I Would vote to replace the Affordable CARE Act which with measures that fix it um\nBut I mean if there was a vote to repeal you would vote no\nI'm a strictly on a on a on a vote of if that were the choice before us which I don't think we would hypothetically have that's correct but I think it's important to recognize what the Democrats want to do and what they're real agenda is is the single payer scheme which would make\nIllegal employer provided health insurance it would double our taxes\nAnd it would create a death spiral with debt and deficits into the future and every single country that has a nationalized system like this has annual debates as to what they can afford to pay and what they will cover so these debates don't go away if you handle all the control over

Americans of regardless of political opinion here at home and I do think\nThat um it's a very complicated issue for us\nUm we've got thirty seconds left complicated in in that the Saudis have so much money invested here\nNow and complicated in that we have a major regional ah adversary and that part of the world is Iran and the Saudis are lined with us against the Iranian or\nA exploits in the

marsh thanks so much for being with us\nThank you for having me what do you need no\nWell the educational needs of our students are still taking a back seat to just the humanitarian needs that they have just a basic food shelter clothing water and just the basic life\nYeah do you have anything resembling a timeline as to when you may reopen the schools\nWe hope maybe mid November if you saw the devastation that is really an aggressive timeline because so many of our schools don't have power or running water or electricity or any of those Internet service any of those things you wouldn't normally see a out of school we do want to make sure all of our seniors graduate\nOn time and that most of our students are able to promote next grade level so to be able to do that way to start as soon as we can for sure\nMr mosh how do you handle the fact that I'm I'm sure a lot of students are are in families who have lost their homes and and they're staying with relatives or had to move to other places and uh the districts must be all mixed up by now\nIt really isn't for most of our communities we have basically thirty six schools about twenty six thousand students in our school district and there are several cities within our county and\nWithin each of those cities the school is oftentimes the hub of that community especially for a lot of our students that school knowing what the community but that one state plays that they could rely on because oftentimes the home life of our kids\nAs pretty rough and so we're trying the best we can to rebuild those communities through rebuilding our schools as fast as we can but for a lot of our students it'll\nTake years to get them back to where they were before the hurricane hit\nDo you have any schools that escaped damage or or or at least having been hurt so badly that you you can't use them\nWe have between six to twelve of that argues well here's the dilemma we're coming up with the schools that are severely damaged we can't use because they don't have power electricity bill schools that were damaged or not they use that shelters for the time being and and maybe for the CEO of a future\nMr most I gather that despite or maybe even because of the considerable losses if you've had challenges you have um there's still going to be a football game Saturday Night\n[laughter] yes there will Scott and I have

C. A.\nAnd to ensure that the insurance markets work more properly and that we can lower premiums and deductibles for everyone but\nThe bottom line of ... let me ask you does that mean you would vote against repeal\nIt means that I Would vote to replace the Affordable CARE Act with with measures that fix it um\nAnd I mean if there was a vote to repeal you would vote no\nI'm a strictly on a on a\nOn a vote of if that were the choice before us which I don't think we would hypothetically have that's correct but I think it's important to recognize what the Democrats want to do and what they're real agenda is is the single payer scheme which would make illegal employer provided health insurance it would double our taxes and it would create a\nDeath spiral with debt and deficit into the future and every single country that has a nationalized system like this has annual debates as to what they can afford to pay and what they will cover so these debates don't go away if you hand all the control over to the government\nI I'm sure Democrats would say or at least a lot of Democrats who say they certainly are in favor of a national health care system that way but I Do have to move on to uh to the death of your mouth or show sure of what do you think of the Saudi explanation it's\nA very lame a it's an outrage what they've done\nA they their actions have been deeply offensive I think to a Americans of regardless of political opinion here at home and I do think that it's a very complicated issue for us\nUm we've got thirty seconds left complicated in in that the Saudis have so much money invested here\nNow and complicated in that we have a the major regional a adversary in that part of the world is Iran\nAnd the Saudis are aligned with us against the Iranian or a exploits in the middle east and so this is what makes it very difficult but I think we have to speak plan linked to the Saudis and tell them that this is going to change our relationship\nRepresentative John fashionable thanks so much for being with us thank you my pleasure\nOn weekend edition Sunday tomorrow with loaded with thousands of Central American migrants are trying to make their way to the United states will hear from reporter James Frederick was talking to migrants who were stalled in the border of Guatemala and Mexico you can tune in tomorrow by asking your smart speaker to play NPR or your member station by name\nImmigrant advocates along with the American civil liberties union and the bus drivers you can deliver two hundred thousand sign petitions to greyhound bus headquarters downtown Dallas on friday is\nAnd ... from member station ... reports the group is demanding companies stop allowing border patrol agents onto their buses to question passengers about their citizenship\nGathered in downtown Dallas part the protesters said greyhound has the right to refuse border patrol agents from boarding or buses without a warrant or probable cause the campaign called transportation not deportation accused US Customs and border patrol agents\nOf violating passengers constitutional rights by asking that they proved their US citizenship\nIn a speech to the crowd Texas Democrat walking ... says the practice is happening\nIn heavily Hispanic areas and beyond border checkpoint\nDoing something that they don't have\nThey're subject to any of that [noise]\nThey're subjecting a\nRacial profiling\nAfter a series of speeches to groups fought several blocks to greyhound headquarters carrying boxes and sign petitions Tricia Martina senior vice president for greyhound's legal department read a statement for CEOs ... bleach\nCBP officers do not ask permission to board are but\nWe do not want to put our driver safety our past years at ... at that are a little\nMore protests are planned in the coming weeks for NPR News I'm Stella Chavez in Dallas\n\nWhole new\nRole\nOh\n\nAnd you're listening to NPR in it\nAnd this is eighty nine point three K PCC I'm Tammy Trujillo stick with us here on your K PCC weekend there's a lot had at Tennessee New Yorker radio our legal endless today Jeffrey to interview Sally gates the acting attorney general fired by President Trump when she wouldn't defend Trump's travel ban\nIt's toxic to vent about the impact of Trump on her career and on American politics that's coming up this morning at ten on the New Yorker radio hour here on eighty nine point three K.
