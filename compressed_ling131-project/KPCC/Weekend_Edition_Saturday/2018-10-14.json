[noise]\n\nFeet locked Egyptian pounds speaking for the government\nI think the approach was not a language is an important element or for integration and I think if one takes that approach language skins are being required\nTo follow the courses to follow the pluses starting with school and all the the even more so the level of university that lots of university says I'm sure many of the young as a participant in the conversation to discussions with would agree with\nThat provide courses in English language because I'm an English is the still the most widely spoken language and then more and more universities in Austria that off the list\nWhat do you make of this the implications of this language proficiency legislation sounds rotten\nFor me this question of the language test is an example for ... beeper they said for the understanding that you need to know the language of the company you want to listen\nBlocked by some people these languished tastes are used to reduce the number of people coming in and said don't like\n[noise] okay thank you [noise]\nWe are very close to the end of the program but I just want to ask a question myself having listened to on the power we talked about the challenges and the problems that this country faces as inevitably you do in in an open society when you look to the future and that sort of spectrum between pessimism an optimism\nWhere are you and why\nThey are to model rushing if us liberal buddy\nBut actually I'm very optimistic person and I always look at the chances spots\nI think when I look in the near future upcoming European election I think this is really one of the most important election we're facing and it's really as a state that in the beginning it's a it's a big fight going on about like like the the right wing and the right wing populist party and the national is you know in Europe\nWho really wants to destroy what\nWe've built in Europe um for the last what have you been building for the last ... a real threat though does it reflect it does it reset it says that for personal freedom\nIt's just that for democracy is a threat for rule of law and it's just that of course for the common Europe and it's just that for the economy so I think it's time to stand up and to fight for that is for\nThe golf [noise]\nFor you personally pizza\nBut are you on the pessimism optimism spectrum\nWhen the sheriff down to you that uh I'm equally optimistic I had the opportunity of living abroad for twenty five years\nAnd whenever last year was being mentioned in that context people looked up to Austria and I think face that last year was a country\nThat was being successful not just in in the field of culture but much more than what the government tries to do is to to broaden the basis of activities for which also has known abroad not just in the field of culture but to make a last year I location for doing business make it easier for international business\nTo be represented here and through that creates employment\nAnd I wouldn't agree with that point about the statement that we have to be worried about the future of the country I think thanks to the people of last year the country's performing extremely what\nAnd from your perspective is director of the Academy of fine arts about bling bling uh how do you do for the future or are you are\nOptimistic about the future of your country\nUm dinner I'm\nI'm not but I Hope that that can be optimistic after say also has one of the richest country in the world is one of the safest country and the world and I would like that people look at this performance of Austria\nAnd uh it's not a country where I grew up on every corner you'll have a problem now not so many problems as people\nThink about and I wish that the government also promotes this a point of view of Austria and say we our great country and uh we're rich country and we can also take the refugees and we can also take the immigrants\nAnd it's not a question of money we have the money how often is [noise]\n\nMistake or\nOtherwise finally are you ...\nWell let me split the answer\nI'm very optimistic that the unions do review and you'll stay together I Hope that you know not only able to articulate the Komen barely used words with talk today about it\nBut the union must articulate it's common interests it's common interest in defense it's common interest in foreign policy there we're much to be but I Hope to me to this will happen\nAnd now to Austria inspired to go forward we discussed here in wherever we don't agree I Hope that after five years we'll know four more years\nThat Australia use economically but also internationally in a better position than today\nI Know the problems I Will admit to some problems with the

from one father for example Britain the Netherlands China and other countries have passed laws limiting the number of children conceived\nBy donor but the U.S has no real limits just guidelines that aren't necessarily embrace by fertility clinics do you think that the system in the United states needs to be changed\nI think it would be a great help with it was I mean\nOne of the things that has been raised as that you know you could accidentally have kids with someone um that could be your sibling there could be serious genetic consequences how big a worry is that for you\nAnd that was all my life and then my mom\nAnd my grandmother they're always making sure that I knew the parents of who I was dating but that was also one of the reasons why I decided to make sure that I found all my siblings and that my siblings got to know each other know who they are so that that wouldn't happen in the future\nYeah have you approached the clinics that helped your mom conceive and what did they say\nI actually have it and yet I'm from what I had been told growing up\nUm when my mom went to go and get in semi needed with me they told her that the donor was only going to be available between ten to twelve families maximum but it was all verbal and we can't really [noise] I guess prove it but\nNow we're at twenty eight families and forty six children\nAnd they also said that there was going to be no one within five hundred miles of you right\nYeah they did and I live in Florida so five hundred miles is practically the entire state and there's seven of us living in this day alone\n[noise] so what is your advice to other kids of donors\nI Would say just always keep an open mind and I'm very fortunate that my donor has been receptive to meeting a siblings but you know there are some donors out there that wants to remain completely anonymous\nAnd so I Would say you know if the donors that way than the best thing to do is just find siblings because it's one of the

the hardest hit areas\nIn these next few weeks before the November elections will be taking a look at what is often called identity politics and there's one divisive phrase that has been at the forefront of the way identity politics is expressed in public the political correctness that we have embraced it enough\nAlready we have to stop with political correctness Americans have been choking on political correctness\nFreshman I guess you can't use freshman any first year you can't say right actually\nMeasure discriminated against when\nHe seemed culture liberals supposedly love it conservative can't stand it or at least that's what we've been told but a new study by the group more in common shows something quite different political scientist Josh among wrote about this survey for the Atlantic and I asked him to explain the results\nWere first headline is just how many Americans think the political correctness has become a problem at all country it is actually four out of five eighty percent of Americans\nFeel worried about what kind of rule by the place in our disclose among the second big surprises but this was sort of narrative\nThat young people are women perhaps people of color tend to really like political correctness an older white men are the ones who deeply opposed it and what's really striking is that that's not at all what you've seen the data right the best proxies or education level and income\nUp sort of a white people are actually like the less likely to fame for political correctness is a problem then people of color but people are most likely to see it as a problem or a Hispanic or Native American\nIn the same way in terms of age very youngest um don't like it any better than older people on the other hand if you are moving a hundred thousand dollars a year if you have a post graduate degree venue much more likely to like political correct\nThe reasons it's so interesting is because we often portray the country is divided right hopelessly your analysis says that there is quote and exhausted majority whose views are not actually so different from one another uh can you explain what that group is feeling right now\nYeah so it's easy to finger the sort of fifty percent of the population\nWill walk in every single way I'm almost fifty percent of the country who are just sort of racist and you don't have we have lots of hate speech and what we see in the study is that eighty percent of Americans dislike political correctness and eighty two percent or were you worried about a hate speech so most people I'm not racist\nThey also a little concerned that if they say the wrong thing a base stress themselves a little bit wrong me they might somehow a come off as being hostile when but not so you know one of the people\nWho was talking in a focus group said look you know nowadays I I'm not quite sure do I say you do I say Jewish do as a black or the west African American and I feel like if I got the wrong people are gonna shouted me and and that's where it was educational divide comes in\nBecause the kinds of people frankly who you know listen to NPR every weekend to perhaps have a higher degree and so on they tend to be more comfortable knowing what ... found invest a lot of Americans who have good intentions who don't have hate the hot at all but they're just unsure about what was to choose\n[noise] yeah I Want to take the term Latin acts um which has gained popularity I'm Latina and and if I talk to members of my parents' generation they feel entirely excluded from that term the term is meant to be more inclusive write 'em but these terms can also make people feel like they're not in on the conversation\nYeah and that's where we just have to be self critical about what's

citizens\nAnd they care for example about the ways in which Hispanics are being discriminated against at the moment in United States but they don't use your ... Tom\nI think you should see the potential allies Rob and denouncing them\nOr as enemies well how does that work how for example kind of politician run on progressive values um where the language doesn't alienate what the survey says is the vast majority of the country I mean how does it practically work\nBut I think that's a huge difference between standing up for minorities that are under attack\nAnd talking about is no way which sounds like you have a sort of laundry list of different groups that you have to win over in order to win election and I think that what's the difference between how block Obama talked about it and how it's been talked about it actually\nI was struck for example by the way that Cory Booker argues for a set of progressive causes when he talks about why does the we have to have more equity in high school education he always he talks about the fact that it's unjust\nTo the children and poor school districts um who don't get a good education but he also talks about the fact that we need to educate all of our citizens to the best abilities because we're in a global race of competitiveness with China\nWhen he talks about a prison reform doesn't just talk about the injustice to the people who are imprisoned user talks about the huge costs to the tax payer I think those are ways in which you're making the argument but it's close to your heart but you're also trying to show why does the business in everybody's interest\n[noise] I can hear liberals listening to this conversation and say you know that's fine but the fact of the matter is the other side weaponize his words in a way that that that we cannot cede the ground and conservative listening to this conversation might think\nThey're always trying to label us as racist and and the divide has become so vast in this country that people are listening to a conversation about something like this in totally different ways now\nIt is a problem but some people on the old right for example use popular discontent with political correctness in order to get a license to spew things but as straightforwardly racist\nUm but I think the right to respond to that used to have a little bit of a sense of humor to say yes look we can sometimes be true invested in whether the appropriate thing to say is a lot you know a lot to next\nBut you know what that's not a reason to deny but we have deep injustices in our country come join us in the political side or to make this a a country that lives up to its principles better off at the moment\nThat among you can read his piece at the Atlantic website he's a lecture on government at Harvard and the author of the people versus democracy why our freedom is in danger and how to save that thank you so much thank you\n[noise]\n\nYou're listening to NPR News\nThe news of snap judgment lie comes the ace hotel Saturday November Seventeen percent of the Cape you see in person tickets available right now the PC dot org slash in person\nThe news a snap\nJudgment law comes the ace hotel Saturday number seven to ... percent of the Cape you see the person tickets available right now at ... dot org slash in person\nCandy cc supporters include dignity health Southern California hospitals including Glendale memorials saint Mary in Long Beach Northridge hospital California hospital in\nDowntown LA St bernadine and community hospital of San Bernardino their doctors and nurses to look for the healing effects of human kindness every day to learn about emergency services hard care and healthy babies you can visit dignity health dot org slash so Cal dignity health hello human kindness\nNews programming on K BCC is made possible by the mon Family Foundation supporting quality reporting on critical issues for Southern California [noise]\nPeople\nThere are fears that number will rise as rescuers of you to read some of the hardest hit areas the remnants of hurricane lovely causing problems in Portugal strong winds and heavy rain from Leslie have uprooted trees smash store windows leaving behind widespread power outages\nAnd a major league baseball the Houston Astros have taken the opening game of the American league championship series beating Boston Red Sox last night came to us today the national league series between Los Angeles Dodgers and the Milwaukee Brewers tied game of peace game three is tomorrow\nI'm joy ...

how sperm donation should or shouldn't be regulated [noise]\nUm yeah and that there should be limits on the number of kids from one father for example Britain the Netherlands China and other countries have passed laws limiting the number of children conceived by donor but the U.S has no real limits just guidelines that aren't necessarily embraced by fertility clinics\nDo you think that the system in the United states needs to be changed\nThink it would be a great helpless it was I mean\nOne of the things that has been raised as that you know you could accidentally have kids with someone um that could be your sibling there could be serious genetic consequences how big a worry is that for you\nAnd that was all my life my mom\nAnd my grandmother they're always making sure that I knew the parents of who I was dating but that was also one of the reasons why I decided to make sure that I found all my siblings and that my siblings got to know each other know who they are so that that wouldn't happen in the future\nYeah have you approached the clinic that helped your mom conceive and what did they say I actually have it and yet I'm from what I had\nBeen told growing up um when my mom went to go and get in semi needed with me they told her that the donor was only going to be available between ten to twelve families maximum but it was all verbal and we can't really I guess prove it but\nNow we're at twenty eight families and forty six children\nAnd they also said that there was going to be no one within five hundred miles of you right\nYeah they did and\nI live in Florida so five hundred miles is practically the entire state and there's seven of us living in this day alone\n... so what is your advice to other kids of donors\nI Would say just always keep an open mind and I'm very fortunate that my donor has been receptive to meeting a siblings but you know there are some donors out there that wants to remain completely anonymous\nAnd so I Would say you know if the

a diplomatic crisis over the disappearance and suspected murder of a Saudi journalist\nIn these next few weeks before the November elections will be taking a look at what is often called identity politics and there's one divisive phrase that has been at the forefront of the way identity politics is expressed in public the political correctness that we have embraced enough\nAlready we have this uh was ... correct is Americans have been choking on political correctness\nFreshman I guess you can't use freshmen any first year you can't say right actually measure discriminated against when\nHe seemed culture liberals supposedly love it conservative can't stand that or at least that's what we've been told but a new study by the group more in common shows something quite different political scientist Josh among wrote about this survey for the Atlantic and I asked him to explain the results\nWere first headline is just how many Americans finger political correctness has become a problem at all country it is actually four out of five eighty percent of Americans\nFeel worried about what kind of role but it plays in our disclose among the second big surprises for us was sort of narrative that young people women perhaps people of color tend to really like political correctness and older white men are the ones who deeply opposed it and what's really striking is advance not at all what you've seen\nThe data right the best proxies or education level and income\nUp to the white people are actually slightly less likely to fame for political correctness is a problem then people of color but people are most likely to see it as a problem or a Hispanic Native American\nIn the same way in terms of age very honest I'm don't like it any better than older people on the other hand if you are now moving a hundred thousand dollars a year if you have a post graduate degree venue much more likely to like political correct\nThe reasons is so interesting is because we often portray the country is divided right hopelessly your analysis says that there is quote and exhausted majority whose views are not actually so different from one another uh can you explain what that group is feeling right now\nYeah so it's easy to think of it as sort of fifty percent of the population\nWill walk in every single way I'm almost fifty percent of the country who are just sort of racist and you don't have we have lots of hate speech\nAnd what we see in the study is that eighty percent of Americans dislike political correctness in eighty two percent or were you worried\nAbout a hate speech so most people are not racist but they also a little concerned that if they say the wrong thing a base stress themselves a little bit wrong me they might somehow a come off as being hostile when but not so you know one of the people\nWho was talking in a focus group said look you know nowadays I\nI'm not quite sure do I say Jude was a Jewish too as a black African American and I feel like if I got the wrong people are going to shout at me and and that's where it was educational divide comes in\nBecause the kinds of people frankly who you know listen to NPR every weekend to perhaps have a higher degree and solemn they tend to be more comfortable knowing what the right words out and walk that invest a lot of Americans who have good intentions who don't have faith in the hospital but they're just unsure about what was to choose [noise]\nYeah I I Want to take the term Latin acts um which has gained popularity I'm Latina and and if I talk to members of my parents' generation they feel entirely excluded from that term the term is meant to be more inclusive write 'em but these terms can also make people feel like they're not in on the conversation\nYeah and that's where we just have to be self critical about what's actually going to achieve more racial equality in our country if you think that for your own political reasons ... is a better time to use then been Godspeed to you but I think if you talk to your fellow citizens\nAnd they care for example about the ways in which Hispanics are being discriminated against at the moment the United states but they don't use your preferred Tom\nI think you should see the potential allies Robin denouncing them\nOr as enemies well how does that work how for example kind of politician run on progressive values um where the language doesn't alienate what the survey says the vast majority of the country I mean how does it practically\n... well I think that's a huge difference between standing up for minorities that are under attack\nAnd talking about is no way which sounds like you have a sort of laundry list of different groups that you have to win over in order to win election and I think that what's the difference between how block Obama talked about it and how have roots in talked about it actually\nI was struck for example by the way that Cory Booker argues for a set of progressive causes when he talks about why does the we have to have more equity in high school education\nYou always talks about the fact that it's unjust to the children and poor school districts um who don't get a good education but he also talks about the fact that we need to educate all of our citizens to the best abilities because we're in a global rays of competitiveness with China\nWhen he talks about a prison reform he doesn't just talk about the injustice to the people who are imprisoned user talks about the huge cost to the taxpayer I think those are ways in which you're making the argument that as close to your heart but you're also trying to show why does the business in everybody's interest\n[noise] I can hear liberals listening to this conversation and say you know that's fine but the fact of the matter is the other side weaponize his words in a way that that that we cannot cede the ground and conservative listening to this conversation might think\nThey're always trying to label us as racist and and the divide has become so vast in this country that people are listening to a conversation about something like this in totally different ways now\nIt is a problem but some people on the old right for example use popular discontent with political correctness in order to get a license to spew things but as straightforwardly races\nUm but I think the right to respond to that used to have a little bit of a sense of humor to say yes look we can sometimes be true invested in whether the appropriate thing to say is a Latino or Latin acts\nBut you know what that's not a reason to deny but we have deep injustices in our country come join us in the political side or to make this a country that lives up to its principles better then it starts at the moment\nThat session monk you can read his piece at the Atlantic website he's a lecture on government at Harvard and the author of the people versus democracy or freedom is in danger to how to save it thank you so much thank you

Soviet journalists and this is what's fascinating to date to forget this he was at the moment it is an advisor to\nThe royal court it was a unofficial advisor to former a soldier ambassador to London they'll get in fights or\nWho was also the head of the so the intelligence as soon as she was speaking on behalf of the game then there's a point of views so so it's very cynical today to present him as a kind of my very good point to the seeking to both of the regime elite special he was no\nNo three years ago and his son to the having serious problems with just so the leadership of because it just sounds really ... it kind of strikingly different paths to was a much more\nOr less said bold games like the war\nIn Yemen regression inside you know I met him Judy many many conferences and all over the years is probably the two thousands I don't remember even when we met and then we uh we're closer than we think alike on many issues that we developed a personal connection and the sympathy so I could say\nHere's the friend is not losing a trend\nWhat has the different parents meant to the dissident community uh what are they saying and and also just the wider community of of people that are his friends are the people that are his colleagues scholars like yourself\nYou know you have to do the worry of the people who are activists militants on a on the on the freedom or democracy or change sides in a region where authorities are rudely where um the\nFaces of freedom and actually even thinking or narrowing by the minute that these people are worried that they could be pursued hunger eastern or killed anywhere in the world\nAre you worried yourself I mean you do this work\nI Do this work I was worries many times in my life of course I the first time I did the work was in Syria in Nineteen Ninety three I was working on the business community not on some political or security you relate to it and it was a federal gator by the Syrian how about a ...\nThen ah eleven on when I was living and doing my work as a\nProfessor and those areas so sure you'll only be all my friends and my colleagues were interrogate the very often we were ah sometimes harassed we were asked to boot off this article from the paper or this one\nAnd have friends who have been killed because they were only writing all as individuals so so it's not some things\nTo you and I think that for us I Know that I speaking with you know at this site is that for example I have to put\nAcross for many years you know on my visit she goes oh I Know it I Will not go to Saudi Arabia anymore oh probably go to the end it's the same way I used to go and this is it begins to shake\nMy speaking to me right now about this issue means that you don't\nSay who's going to lead there's all sorts of ... and because I've written certain things and now I Know that certain people in Saudi Arabia that I can even name or people who work at the royal court are put their names on the ... people like me and others and these people are no blacklisted in this country\nAnd we know it I mean we all know OK so this is this is what's at stake\nWhy do you think this is happening now\nWhat's what's different now is is Susan regimes even if they were she is\nAnd bold and sometimes a restless with their own a bonus did\nNot do this level of things the road or in the daylight okay Mubarak could\nMake a bonus disappearing Egypt you will never\nThere to touch someone in the streets of London or they're living this oh dear leaderships used to get some ... some of the reasons in Switzerland or elsewhere but they would not kill someone in the streets of Paris or or room okay so this is no different these countries today\nShe is that they have wizard and extra ordinarily in your story which is our resolution that started in twenty thousand okay so they are today only food last\nQuest and don't against anybody good\nService and their political existence\nIf the west specifically and the United states I'm don't react forcefully to Jamal ... disappearance what do you think the effect will be\nYou'll get snow more anymore at all about ... it's about\nThe first of all a whole range of ... which you are squandering and completely side it's also about the whole sociology\nOf people who are not even researchers and journalists people citizens who are looking for a breathing space in their countries okay these people don't even want to foreign politics as much as they just want to exist judge they just want to go through their work and have an opinion if the west doesn't take action on this\nAll this will be in danger and the west will be complicit actively compass\nIt's awesome to think for me at least that I had such a big family and I can see a lot of characteristics and a lot of similarities between us and a immediately it's a it's an instant friendship but at the same time it is also worrying that I have\nSo many half siblings and it's overwhelming to know that I just I keep finding more and I don't know when it's going to stop\nYeah I mean there's an important debate happening right now right about how sperm donation should or shouldn't be regulated [noise]\nUm yeah and that there should be limits on the number of kids from one father for example Britain the Netherlands China and other countries have passed laws limiting the number of children conceived by donor but the U.S has no real limits just guidelines that aren't necessarily embraced by fertility clinics\nDo you think that the system in the United states needs to be changed\nI think it would be a great help with it was I mean one of the things that has been raised as that you know you could accidentally have kids with someone um that could be your sibling there could be serious genetic consequences how big a worry is that for you\nOut and that was all my life my mom\nAnd my grandmother they're always making sure that I knew the parents of who I was dating but that was also one of the reasons why I decided to make sure that I found all my siblings and that my siblings got to know each other know who they are so that that wouldn't happen in the future\nYeah have you approached the clinics it helped her mom conceive and what did they say\nI actually have it and yet I'm from what I had been told growing up um when my mom went to go and get incentive needed with me they told her that the donor\nOnly going to be available between ten to twelve families maximum but it was all verbal and we can't really [noise] I guess prove it but now\nWe're at twenty eight families and forty six children\nAnd they also said that there was going to be no one within five hundred miles of you right\nYeah they did and\nI live in Florida so five hundred miles is practically the entire state and there's seven of us living in this state alone\n[noise] so what is your advice to other kids of donors\nI Would say just always keep an open mind and I'm very fortunate that my daughter has been receptive to meeting a siblings but you know there are some donors out there that wants to remain completely anonymous\nAnd so I Would say you know if the donors that way then the best thing to do is just find siblings because it's one of the greatest connections you can never\nHave Kenya royal of Orlando, Florida she spoke to us via Skype thank you very much thank you for having me
