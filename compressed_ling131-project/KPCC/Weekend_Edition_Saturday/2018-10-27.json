so much for being with us thank yous got they're going to turn out to NPR's Ron Elving Ron thanks so much for being with us good to be with you it's got a\nFirst let me ask you about President Trump's reaction to these events because at the White House yesterday he said no quote a we must show the world that we're in either together in peace and love and harmony as federal American citizens are then just hours later a rally in North Carolina uh he hadn't yet another line of attack and\nYes and you know even at the White House event that you mentioned he said those words about peace and love and then he took off after CNN and others and to me\nAnd got the crowd chanting lock them up lock them up there is a pattern of the president first saying the magnanimous and presidential thing possibly reading from prepared remarks that may be on the teleprompter\nThan pivoting to the spontaneous remarks that are his trademark\nSo again last night at that rally in North Carolina he began with this violence\nWas never ever be allowed in America and I will do everything in my power to stop it\nAnd another way he talked about ending what he called the politics of personal destruction but moments later he was backed debating the crowd with the name of Maxine Waters and outspoken African American congresswoman and teasing the crowd before saying I\nWon't say it um I I won't say it's not clear what it was but in the past is referred to Maxine Waters as a quote very low IQ person\nI I Want them to say I was being nice the president said\nTo left or from the crowd and Democrats of course have um a level the charge that President Trump has ... help to create this politically charged atmosphere\nThe president told reporters yesterday that that certainly his rhetoric couldn't couldn't be held responsible for what ever happened to put all these mail bombs are addressed to Democrats in some of his critics\nThat raises the question how much can President Trump be held responsible for the actions of this one apparently troubled men\nCertainly not responsible in a legal sense or responsible in a literal sense\nBut everyone should have a look at these rallies or ask themselves what the undertones an underlying purpose of these rallies might be and consider the photographs now circulating of the bombing suspect himself attending one of these rallies and holding one of these signs\nUm other news we need to ask you about President Trump continued to talk about the caravan a thousands of Central Americans were traveling through Mexico\nTo try to reach the U.S border there reports this week the president's considering executive action that would block them from applying for asylum um do we need to consider the timing when we talk about this\nYes everything right now is about the mid term elections in ten days this this caravan had swollen to more than seven thousand early in the week yesterday it was down roughly half of that size or less many are dropping out the Mexican government is offering incentives for those who would choose to stay in the southern part of Mexico and that's an offer may\nMaybe pretty tempting for many of these people to accept while others are going to press on to the United states and if they get to the border\nThey will represent some marginal increasing the number who seek asylum at that border every month but the images and projections of an army of migrants marching across Mexico descending on America that was never the real story and it becomes less like reality every day [noise] ten\nDays from them in terms of looked as if polls have been tightening a now maybe Democrats have extended to lead according to ah the NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll\nIt looks like ten points in the generic poll which party do you want to have in control of the house so that's the threshold of a truly meaningful margin if it holds it would seem sufficient to deliver the house to the Democrats it\nWould not appear nearly sufficient to deliver the Senate but it would suggest the momentum shift we felt earlier in October toward the president and his party has begun to shift back in the direction of the opposition NPR's Ron Elving thanks so much thank you Scott\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt coined a phrase when he told White House reporters I have such a bully pulpit\nHe meant bully as it was then used to say terrific are tremendous President Roosevelt believed the president had a purely national platform that could be used when lighting and inspired nation with words\nThink of Lincoln in his second inaugural address chilly north and south the close of a war that had soaked America in blood with malice toward none with charity for all\nOur President Lyndon Johnson in Nineteen sixty five after

injustice and we shall overcome\nPresident Reagan look you know with a divided city of Berlin and Nineteen eighty seven and saying\nMr Gorbachev tear down this wall\nPresident Trump has been in office for almost two years and has millions of supporters but I Wonder if even many of them believe the president has used his perch your high office to other words that inspired he's presided over rallies the chant lock her up\nA parade of Intel's this year's campaign rallies that those who have different ideas around a quote ruthless mission to demolish and destroy corrupt power hungry global issue one quote millions of illegal aliens to overwhelm our nation and threatened the safety of every single American\nAnd of course she's called depressed the enemy of the people he's praised congressmen who assaulted a reporter Shane and the guy who can do a body slam he is my type\nOf course some Democrats and other public figures have also used overheated rhetoric but as Mr Trump is at a number of times about critics I'm president and they're not it may turn out that nothing and the president said set off the person who's been detained\nPerson here besides one of the docent and maybe the

start with the president and we can't pretend that that is ... ... of his opponents\nMakes no difference to blow political atmosphere\nI Wish we could stop there but we can't fix the truth is there's so much viciousness on either side on both sides\nThat people don't really listen anymore to anyone but the people who agree with them and frankly the people who agree with them enthusiastically that's a very dangerous thing it's not the most divided we've ever been we had a civil war after all\nA but it's a very dangerous moment in a moment when what we should be looking for on the national stage or the voices of calm and rationality\nLet me ask you about the history of this because uh of course you mentioned the civil war and won't even try and make that argument put it in in the Nineteen sixties you had the assassinations\nOf Dr King and Robert F Kennedy a you had the bombing of the weather underground you're George Wallace and open bigots running for president threatening to run over protesters I'm with you with your view of history what what does this represent in ours what's happened\nI think it is quite possible there were as divided as well in the Nineteen sixties and in some ways it's probably worse\nIt's true that we had political assassinations the Nineteen sixties and you and I we're we're both coming of age than it was a terribly difficult and and painful and in many ways frightening time and yet of course all of that we still had at the national level\nAre people who really for their job was to calm things down and you may have seen them Peggy Noonan the wall Street Journal\nThis week suggested that on Tuesday one week before the midterms but all the candidates on both sides spend the day talking about the virtues of the other\nParty there was a time when that kind of rhetoric was actually commenting on in America when people would often say of course I respect this and this and this is about my opponent you don't see that anymore and and I don't think that's going to happen on Tuesday\nPresident Trump has a has denounced the targeting of some of his critics he has called\nFor greater civility a in politics\nUm that has been called that's what he reads off a teleprompter and then he'll he'll go into a spontaneous or ration like or like the one last night at his rally in North Carolina the\nProblem is I I'm all for greater civility I wrote a book about civility I Believe in it and people I think it's an important virtue in politics respecting each other across\nOur differences really trying to find their commonality but with President Trump's own for greater civility and and for calming things down I have to say the pool for the putting as an eating if he's going to say that and go on back to the way things were before\nAnd we haven't gotten any further along if he's going to say that and stick to it\nThen I think that would actually be a good thing for the country\nWhere and what about it I suspect\nSome some people I'm a horse supporters of the president will say look this man in custody was clearly troubled clearly unbalanced you can't blame anything he did on the president of the United states or political rhetoric ... that any more than you can blame a Beatles song from our favorite trip [noise]\nMy view about shootings is always blamed the person who did it bombings I always blame the person who did it but at the same time it's still a signal that we need to tone down their rhetoric and I hope maybe this time well listen\nProfessor Stephen Carter at Yale his latest book invisible thanks so much for being

federal crimes including mailing explosives and threatening former presidents NPR's Ryan Lucas reports is not known as a second person may have been involved\nFirst let me ask you about President Trump's reaction to these events because at the White House yesterday he said quote we must show the world that we're not together in peace and love and harmony as fellow American citizens\nUh then just hours later a rally in North Carolina uh he hadn't yet another line of attack and yes and you know\nEven at the White House event that you mentioned he said those words about peace and love and then he took off after CNN and others in the ...\nAnd got the crowd chanting lock them up lock them up there's a pattern of the president first saying the magnanimous and presidential thing possibly reading from prepared remarks that may be on the teleprompter\nThan pivoting to the spontaneous remarks that are his trademark so again last night at that rally in North Carolina he began with this violence\nSever ever be allowed in America and I will do everything in my power to stop it\nAnd it another way he talked about ending what he called the politics of personal destruction but moments later he was backed debating the crowd with the name of Maxine Waters and outspoken African American congresswoman and teasing the crowd before saying I\nWon't say it um I I won't say it's not clear what it was but in the past is referred to Maxine Waters as a quote very low IQ person\nI Want them to say I was being nice the president said\nTwo left or from the crowd and Democrats of course have um a level the charge that President Trump has ... help to create this politically charged atmosphere\nThe president told reporters yesterday that that certainly his rhetoric couldn't couldn't be held responsible for what ever happened to put all these mail bombs are addressed to Democrats in some of his critics\nThat raises the question how much can President Trump be held responsible for the actions of this one apparently troubled men\nCertainly not responsible in a legal sense or responsible in a literal sense but everyone should have a look at these rallies\nOr ask themselves what the undertones an underlying purpose of these rallies might be and consider the photographs now circulating of the bombing suspect himself attending one of these rallies and holding one of these signs\nOf other news we need to ask you about President Trump continued to talk about the caravan of thousands of Central Americans were traveling through Mexico\nTo try to reach the U.S border there reports this week the president's considering executive action that would block them from applying for asylum um do we need to consider the timing when we talk about this\nYes everything right now is about the mid term elections in ten days this this caravan had swollen to more than seven thousand early in the week yesterday it was down to roughly half of that size or less many are dropping out the Mexican government is offering incentives for those who would choose to stay in the southern part of Mexico and that's an offer may\nMaybe pretty tempting for many of these people to accept while others are going to press on to the United states and if they get to the border\nThey will represent some more general increasing the number who seek asylum at that border every month but the images and projections of an army of migrants marching across Mexico descending on America that was never the real story and it becomes less like reality everyday ten days from the mid\nTerm just looked as if polls have been tightening a now maybe Democrats ... ...\nThe end of the lead according to the NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll\nIt looks like ten points in the generic poll which party do you want to have in control of the house so that's the threshold of a truly meaningful margin if it holds it would seem sufficient to deliver the house to the Democrats it would not appear nearly sufficient to deliver the Senate but it would suggest the momentum shift we felt earlier in October toward the president and his party\nHas begun to shift back in the direction of the opposition NPR's Ron Elving thanks so much thank you Scott\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt coined the phrase when he told White House reporters I have such a bully pulpit he meant bully as it was then used to say terrific are tremendous President Roosevelt believed the president had a purely national platform that could be used when light and inspired nation with words\nThink of Lincoln in his second inaugural address chilly north and south of the close of award there has soaked America in blood with malice toward none with charity for all\nOur President Lyndon Johnson in Nineteen sixty five after civil rights marchers had been beaten by Alabama State troopers telling Congress it wasn't just African Americans but quote it's all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice and we shall overcome\nPresident Reagan looking over the divided city of Berlin and Nineteen eighty seven and saying Mr Gorbachev tear down this wall\nPresident Trump has been in office for almost two years and has millions of supporters but I Wonder if even many of them believe the president has used his per too high office\nTo other words that inspire he's presided over rallies the chant lock her up\nThe president tells this year's campaign rallies that those who have different ideas or run a quote ruthless mission to demolish and destroy corrupt power hungry global issue one quote millions of illegal aliens to overwhelm our nation and threatened the safety of every single American\nAnd of course she's called depressed the enemy of the people he's praised the congressman who was halted a reporter Shane any guy who can do a body slam he is my type\nOf course some Democrats and other public figures have also used overheated rhetoric but as Mr Trump is at a number of times about critics I'm president and they're not\nIt may turn out that nothing and the president said shut off the person who's been detained and it's just picked it up sending pipe bombs to several people who criticize President Trump\nBut all Americans have heard the president ... sewage fan phony fairs and conspiracy theories and use words to shale insult and demeaned rather than console encourage or he'll so

we've ever been we had a civil war after all Bob but it's a very dangerous moment in a moment when what we should be looking for on the national stage or the voices of calm and rationality\n... let me ask you about the history of this because uh of course you mentioned the civil war and won't even try and make that argument but in in the Nineteen sixties you had the assassinations of Dr King and Robert F Kennedy\nA you had the bombings of the weather underground you're George Wallace and open bigots running for president threatening to run over protesters I'm\nWith you with your view of history what what does this represent in ours what's happened\nI think it is quite possible there were as divided as we were in the Nineteen sixties and in some ways it's probably worse\nIt's true
