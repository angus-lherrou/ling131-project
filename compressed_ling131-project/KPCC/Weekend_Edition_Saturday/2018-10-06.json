just Norway now to be sort of a new norm entrepreneur\nSo if we said if we listen to the economists to say that if you actually bring down supply you bring down the mountains for for South feels and that this is\nA responsibility for that feels producers to think about than I think uh we could actually kind of lead the way in thinking about how uh just transition to take place amounted to stick on\nGay should anybody lived to no way for lessons 'cause it's a problem as we said that doesn't respect boulders\nI think that the main lesson from Norway is historical less because it is a lesson above the national resources are\nThe societies ownership we we own the natural resources together so that tells us up to Walter ... hydropower oil and gas fish whatever is it's a common property and that is what's made possible and we'll make\nIt possible for us to evolve into the future with offshore mining would off water offshore wind or whatever so the natural resources are common property that is the main lesson to learn\nSo then I think we will have a lot of people working in this sector for a lot of years and I'm Glad the birds institution not only\nEducate people to work and renewables but also educate them to work in oil and gas because we need them in a lot of years to\nCome so let's think about that time scale we have touched on timescales of that and I said to wrap up if you're thinking ten years ahead how much dependence do you think that will be in New ways economy either directly through selling oil and gas or indirectly job's education whatever\nOn oil and gas where where do you think Norway will be in ten years time Kent\nIn ten years time well I don't think it will be a major difference in how we we run society still forty fifty percent of yeah in in ten years Tanya I think the perspective of has to be more like twenty Thirty years then it will\nProbably have less oil and gas impact in the economy because you have to have to change\nThe Grinch shift is coming I think them technology will have developed so much that it will be\nGoing in that direction gradually so yeah\nThere is so votes ultimately ... about the role it technology might play but a belief that oil and gas will still be a very big part of the Norwegian economy in ten years well\nI think production is declining overall and I think that ah we're not finding enough oil and gas I think if we're going to happen by itself that people even though the projections are that it will keep going until at least twenty ... will be some sudden increase that's not the protections I Would say if you look at the\nExpected production of oil and gas Norway is that it's tilted should three that they keep going up and then it type of something like that one I think that ... has\nProbably reached the peace now and then ... yeah the one they expect that that would be more gas resources to be found so\nI mean the question here would be should we asked no Asian politicians allow for the also the patrol and the gas industry to develop new fields for the future and that's something I Would argue against but but that would be a political question\nAd that political question how hard is it then for you if that's what you're going to campaign on to persuade people that they might give up some of that job security some of their economic security\nThan a decade that's not very long no it's not very long and and I mean that's something that we've been advocating for quite some time now in off the ... the oil price house so much as it did in two thousand and fourteen I think the ... site it became more\nTo how vulnerable we are to dial industry and how dependent we are so I see now she's in mentality I think we can ... do you believe that dark and gas industry will be their fight for quite some time\nBut it wouldn't have seen that okay we should be relying on the industry says well we should be developing other industry said industry as well and we should try to find new ways of living that would also help to well to find solutions to the climate the to the climate problem there is a ... a crisis could\nBe the ... yeah I think we're seeing now was like a warm summer because in our with it sort of had the expectation that it will get a bit warm I Will be good for farming et cetera that we haven't really ... the effects of climate change so\nMore often you know you're not abrupt change that makes a things changed and you actually a plan for it but we can't really hope for a climate crisis for Norway to to react gay\nA hot summer climate crisis that an economic crisis might change the timescale within which new way can citizens dependency on on oil and gas and he is how\nHow we we we we have to remember the last eight years we we reached peak oil in two thousand away\nSo we're ... production of oil from the last eight years so we're review and natural gas producer that's the main thing we're producing and with the predictions I see I Can't see that the one that is shutting off the lights on the shelf is born yet\nSo you do you think it's going to be another lifetime at least ... but then what does that make me ... look for new ways role in that particular debate but\nAlso started up but you have to do a lot of things at the same time you can't use carbon capture and storage you can use energy efficiency you can use gas to switch from coal there is a lot of possibilities\nCarry of gas right you've you've lost this debate well\nWell we all lost escape is right that that would mean that the world has not been able to handle climate change and we're looking at three to four degrees yes it is and and I would strongly insist on that we need to shift\nThe economy and the global economy away from from oil and gas off the twenty fifth day so it's really a question of of time here that's\nWhy I've come back to this is a political question because to me is the trolling resources to state and they're going to be there but we need to take this as a political question\nThere is and I'm hopeful for the oil industry in terms of the economic ... I think actually that we will have the shift sooner rather than later that renewables will have a bigger role can she wants to come and\nYeah I mean of course that will be more renewables but also the world will requests more energy so\nThat we have to look that question has well so uh I'm a I'm On line with the good his yeah I think that ah we will have a lot of natural gas in the mix or in the near future and in the long term as well and it will be necessary to meet the green shift\nNo longer the agreement on the real story this week thank you very much to a gas tank cute to Cancun and carry it has been cast ski a beverage Christ office and Gary Sunday Assaf\nThat's it for this week if you'd like to listen to the program again or any other from the ... if you can just back on line by searching for BBC the real story if you like this week program make sure you never miss another edition and subscribe to uphold cost you can find the ... the real story in your pocket cost up\nAnd we love to hear your thoughts on the program email us the real story at BBC ...

Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court Kevin are currently has the parents' support uh fifty one senators enough to confirm him for the lifetime position\nYesterday protesters filled the halls of the capital and all eyes were on a few senators\nWho hadn't reached their final judgment calls Republican Jeff Flake of Arizona will bring about the week long delay in the confirmation process to allow for additional investigation by the FBI and accusations of sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh fellow Republicans reluctantly agreed that the delay\nInhale the FBI secret report as an exoneration Democrats called the investigation incomplete and unfair\nLet the confirmation process for judge Kavanaugh\nBe recorded as a sorry epilogue to the brazen that of Justice Scalia's seat\nThat was Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer of New York who helped lead the fight against the nominee\nNo matter a pivotal vote by Senator Flake turned the tide he announced that barring some major new development he'll vote to confirm Kavanaugh today\nSo we'll Senator Susan Collins of Maine she took to the Senate floor for more than forty minutes to explain why she'll vote for him even though she found Christine Blasey Ford to be believable\nI Believe that she is by her at the sexual assault and that this trauma has ... and her life never lasts for when and said she name could not\nCorroborate any of the band that evening gathering where she says the U.S all a car\nI Believe Dr Ford that's West Virginia's Joe mansion he usually only Senate Democrat to support the nominee despite the chorus of protesters urging him to oppose him something\nCan and I believe with someone else it and\nI think something happened to her [noise] and Russian Russia correspondent Scott Detrow has been covering this whole week Scott thanks very much for being with us like her abdomen any doubt but the today's vote is done\nThere have been a lot of twists and the story so I'm not going to say anything is a hundred percent certain but yes we know that Brett Kavanaugh has the votes to be such a confirmed to the Supreme Court today we had been tracking for key undecided senators all along\nAnd yesterday three of them said they would in the end vote for Kavanaugh that's Jeff Flake Susan Collins and Joe Manchin who's the only Democrats supporting I'm Lisa Murkowski ended up being the lone Republican opposing Kavanaugh's nomination\nIs I don't have to tell you or anyone at this point this confirmations been so a contentious you were in the rooms where it happened ... uh to twist a line from uh from Hamilton uh what was your reaction like all over the capital when a Susan Collins a Republican Joe Manchin a democratic announced their support Cavanaugh\nI think the best way to describe the reaction was visceral on the building was filled with protesters all week leading up to yesterday as the key senators were actually walking around with police escorts things got so tense those ... ... protesters found Joe Manchin when he said that he would be the loan Democrat voting for cabinet\nWhile I'm a very much surveys have with this I have that people had to endure and the very much contend that we have to be something as it comes to deal with the facts I had him from [noise]\nAnd he would have are just as much as he voted no he's in a real tough political spot running for reelection in a state where President Trump is very popular the Democratic party is not popular and I was talking about Susan Collins she has been inundated with criticism after announcing show support Kavanaugh tens of thousands of dollars are already being raised for whoever runs against her and twenty twenty\nBut at the same time she got a standing ovation from her Republican colleagues on her for on the floor for her defensive capping off yesterday let me ask\nYou what seems to be a um a rising note of concern and sometimes even I'm not on both sides of the aisle at least liberals and conservatives over this confirmation fight and\nJudge Kavanaugh soon to be justice Kavanaugh perhaps as explicit blame of Democrats are trying to get revenge on him for his his role in the Clinton impeachment uh in the Nineteen nineties [noise]\nAll of that has politicized the Senate worse than ever and now perhaps maybe the Supreme Court\nThat that was a major concern even before that contentious hearing last week where you at a Supreme Court nominee arguing back and forth with with senators used to have\nThe house was where the raw politics happened the Senate was more statesman like in the Supreme Court with above politics the last two weren't the case anymore and and Lisa Murkowski was very worried about that and she said\nThat's one reason why she ultimately decided to oppose Kevin\n... they are dealing with issues that are bigger than a nominee and how they sure are institutions that only the legislative branch shove and continue to but I didn't mess\nMurkowski struggled with this decision it seems like she didn't make up her mind until the very last moment until she was actually on the Senate floor but something she's repeatedly said is\nIf you look at the poles of public support the Supreme Court has basically the only institution of American government that that Americans really trust right now and she's just worried about what this will do to that and it's it's really unclear what the repercussions will be and and what it looked like Brett Kavanaugh as the deciding vote in five to four ruins going forward which we\nThink he will be a lot of the time yeah what's your feeling about how this might affect the mid term elections that are covering coming up because of course both sides at one time or another geared up for this fight\nYeah we saw how much the or the Clarence Thomas a confirmation process affected the election that came after it\nThere was a whole year in between those two there's just a matter of weeks right now\nAnd it's really hard to tell we've seen polls we've seen data that showed that that the Kavanaugh confirmation fight got Republicans more energized but now they got what they want it so does that enthusiasm fade\nI was talking to one congressman and the other day who said that he thought the losing side of the cabinet vote would probably benefit more from from voter enthusiasm in the upcoming mid terms\nUh it's it's really hard to to know what's going to happen with something this raw happening disclosed to the election there's a reason why Congress usually does the contentious messy stuff in the odd numbered year so they have some time to to put some distance between that and election day\nNPR's Scott Detrow thanks very much for being with us all this week decades\nNow look at the

that's just being called to write with a male artist or for production ...\nI've heard about this um [noise] rule on the tour Bush did sometimes keeps women off\nYeah for some ... like if it's a male
