president he will make\nAnd you know we've become incredibly close and that was\nThat relationship was not something I looked for not something I Would have expected and her daughter is my daughter's only cousin you know I'm getting to see them the next generation grow up together and seeing them grow old enough to ask questions about our family and how\nHow it came to be and how we came to get back together it's just been really really special\nThis book is really honest and very ... about your upbringing how did your parents respond to reading it to sort of all of a sudden being able to see all the things that you went through\nI was anxious at first I'm sharing the story with them I knew I I very much wanted to write it and I knew I wanted them to see it\nUm and my father actually passed away my adoptive father passed away in the middle of reading it in January of this year and thank you um but by the time he passed he had read\nMost of the parts that he was in and he loves it he really appreciated that one of his goofy joke state and\nSo people used to ask us all the time like where did they get you meaning me and my father would say oh if you put a polling a Hungarian together you get a Korean like where do you think they came from it's terrible joke it was his way of kind of saying maybe you shouldn't be asking us of course [laughter] and um one thing that my they both said to me was that\nThis isn't the book we would have written about our family or about your adoption that that's okay you know it's your story it's your perspective\nAnd I think they're proud in the book\nYou have the scene where you are asked by a couple about what you think of having been adopted a which is a pretty heavy question to ask anybody um and you write at the time that you weren't honest with them about your experience what would you say now you know I think\nIn a way I was I was honest to a point but I wasn't willing to kind of scraped deeper I remember sitting there thinking gosh and I tell them about like the bullying should I tell them about all these questions that I had and all the times I I wondered about my birth family and wondered why they'd given me up and it seemed like a lot to lay on them but the the main thing was that\nI had not put down this burden that I still felt um sometimes I still feel to be honest\nOf trying to meet people's expectations as an adoptee because I Do love my family and I do want us in some sense to be seen as just like any other family and I\nI Want people to think that I look at me and see like a happy grateful well adjusted person you know um it was very difficult sometimes still is difficult for me um to go beyond that and to sort of complicate that narrative but\nI Do think that there are a lot of important questions that people who want to adopt traditionally could be asking themselves many many are are you going to this realistically and have you really looked at your\nFamily your schools you're neighborhoods your religious organizations if there were a child of color coming into your environment what\nWould they find when they find mostly white people or would they be able to find people who shared their background and people they could connect with you know I think if you're adopting across racial lines you know that is the beginning point Nicole Chung her memoir is all you can ever no thank you very much thank you so much Lou\n[noise]\nYou're listening to weekend edition from\nNPR News\nAt the Melbourne Zoo the monkeys are no longer allowed to eat bananas and the pandas are getting pellets instead of plums in fact fruit has been phased out completely that's because the fruit that humans have selectively bread over the years has become so full of sugar\nDoes use fruit tearing animals were becoming obese\nAnd losing teeth so how did fruit\nGets so sugary and what does that mean for us humans we're putting those questions to food writer and author Frederick Hoffman who joins us now welcome to the program Oh hi how are you a great thanks um so how has changed since humans intervened in this process well\nListen since about ten thousand years ago and the origin of agricultural human beings have been messing around with the ... where what you're looking at is\nNatural varieties which are purely which are tasteless which have no smell and uh the farmers were like we can do better than this and they started cross breeding almost from the get go\nI didn't think this is going to go to mediate leader the sex life of plants but apparently that's where we're headed um I mean why though has modern fruit become as sugary as it has\nWell one of the main ditched remember he was Nineteen thirty which is one of the United states uh passes the plant patent act and from that point forward the idea is we're trying to\nEncourage farmers to actually manipulate those plants and to make them leader to make them better uh and also to make them seagulls to take their sex way in fact what's happening is is that when you when you actually\nTake the sex drive of a plant away when you take away it feeds it actually could puts more energy into getting fat and sweet\nWhen you read about how fruit um has impacted the zoo animals were you surprised\n[noise] uh no not not at all I mean as I said for years now we've been robbing\nThese natural varieties of almost everything about them except their sweetness you you look at a watermelon there is no seed was watermelons it's full of just white red luscious fruit there's nothing like that found in nature of the tomatoes you find nature are tiny and tasteless\nThe apples you find in nature or almost all of them are bitter is people don't realize that everything we're seeing in the supermarket you're like super stars are like supermodels and interviewed athletes like long James that we're looking at the supermarket\nTo let me ask you because eating the super model of the of the ... well it doesn't sound like necessarily a bad thing I'm you've written a book about this kind of stuff that the farmhouse food stopping food is part of the problem has it become less nutritious is it just good looking and less good for us\nI think that the argument among dieticians is is that is yes the higher sugar content\nIs robbing a suitable a lot of it's a nutritional value and I also think there's a tradition in America of somehow seeking perfection through our food that somehow if we eat white we will make ourselves mentally and spiritually\nBetter and so of course if we see row after row perfectly listening absolutely gorgeous completely look like Apple's we think yeah I Want that\nBut fruit is still good for humans\nOf course eat like your grandmother told you to eat is probably the best the best advice\nFrederick Kaufman is a food journalist and author thank you very much thank you [noise]\nThis is NPR News\nI'm ...

I was gonna say absolutely I wouldn't be certain we have tremendous\nEmpathy and incredible ... for Dr Ford and we feel terrible that she was used as a political pond [noise] before\nThis fight of a cabinet although all signs special election state elections fundraising were pointing to this being a wave election in favor of the Democrats do you think that the Kavanaugh confirmation will make a dent in that momentum\nWell I think that you've already seen it this week I mean it was the number one fundraising week for the RMC we have more people reaching out to us around the country at night he was saying we must be able to be there to protect\nThe women and men in the future as they go to run for confirmation so that we don't scare them away and we see this after three point nine percent unemployment this is phenomenal the side of a\nKevin although hasn't been playing well with suburban women and that's a key demographic for both the left in the right um you know has involved issues that this demographic cares about sexual assault sexual harassment is that a problem for the\nGOP well first of all let's take a step back and look at that premise there little I Will tell you that as a woman who does living suburban America and now I Try to talk to people and see where their heart is they were outraged at how judge Kavanaugh was treated as well as Dr Ford\nIf anything I feel it's suburban women have really waking up and said that could be my son that could be my husband sure but we can't handle and that people were calling most polls do show that most college educated white women believe Ford\nSuburban women make a decision every time they go to the polls as to who they're going to support they are not\nPart of this wave and this is something that women are just going to all go left and you really have people for example look at senator Collins\nBy no means person you consider hard right but when she looks the evidence and puts it to the historical ends of looking at the Clintons and essentially how Bill Clinton was aided and abated by his wife while he victimize young interns I mean there's a certain point we have to say enough is enough\nAnd we need to get down to the business of leading our country and who better to do that than women on both sides of the aisle in this last month what are you running on what's your pitch to getting people out to vote very simple your vote matters you are going to be able to have\nA government that you want we're due process matters or constitutional values or reinforce and where we make sure that the\nThreatening wave of socialism from the left is stopped\nMrs Scheuer runs the conservative pack Nike's list speaking with us from Texas thank you so much thank you we live\nAnd for view from the Democrats we're joined now from California by Charles Chamberlain executive director of the liberal packed democracy for America welcome to the program for having me pulling this week shows the enthusiasm gap has all but disappeared [noise] what do you make of that Democrats have momentum scenes they lost it\nBut yeah I'm not surprised that uh it's changed a bit of courses tightening we're past Labor Day this was when people start paying attention to elections as the Republicans I continue to dig deeper and deeper into the whole that they've dug for themselves with the Kavanaugh appointment\nI'm we're going to see that we have a very very energized democratic base if we started at a ten which is where we've been for the last\nSix months this certainly turned it up to an eleven or a hundred\nBut this was a pretty brutal last but the Democrats I mean I've heard many Democrats say the Democratic party gets out played all the time you're going into the terms with a huge loss\nThat's certainly true but you know this was an unlivable fight from the beginning we don't control the house or Senate we don't control the house we don't control the presidency\nAnd now we don't control the Supreme Court a and I'm proud of the fact that you can see that the the democratic caucus held almost completely together a standing against it to fight regardless of whether or not they were gonna win we fought on principles and our values that's what the American public wants to see from us and that's why they're going to reward us on election day\nBut that's what the Republicans say that the Democrats are trying to bring this nominee down no matter what whether it be over allegations of sexual misconduct and sexual assault or whether it be on his on his record\nRight but what's wrong with that to both reasons are valid a he has a terrible right wing partisan record he was perjured himself he is a terrible judicial temperament and he's also been credibly accused of sexual assault any one of those for reasons are completely legitimate reasons to keep this guy off the court\nAnd the reason why they need to just type fight tooth and nail every day to try to defeat him win or lose\nWe've seen in recent polls that women on this specifically white women and specifically suburban white women are leaning now more towards the Democrats the women were outraged when the Access Hollywood tape came out a white woman went for Trump and helped him win what do you think that makes twenty Eighteen different\nI think that we have a very a much more exciting a and engage democratic bays across across the board a we have an understanding that the future of the Democratic party anti America is with the leadership of black and brown people of color or throughout this country\nAnd the progressive whites are a part of that coalition but we can't depend on the idea that uh the white women are going to save us\nIf you look across this country that's what we're seeing and that's where the future is\nWhat are you running on I mean when you're going out in this last month how are you getting people out to the polls what are you telling them\nYeah I said the two biggest issues one is check on Trump's we've definitely got to send some people to Congress that are going to fight Trump\nRight now with Republicans controlling the house and in the Senate\nOr the you know they've got what ever they need to get whatever they want a it's time that America puts a check on Trump and that's what we're messaging and people are responding to but it's not just about Trump's also about our vision for America and that's why you see campaigns that are running on\nA issues like Medicare for all inclusive populism really succeeding Beto O'Rourke has put a Texas\nRoaring digits between him right between Ted Cruz and the way he's been able to do that is because he was running a powerful people powered campaign on issues and a vision for America like Medicare for all\nCharles Chamberlain

they came from it's terrible joke it was his way of kind of thing maybe you shouldn't be asking the question [laughter] um\nOne thing that my they both said to me was that this isn't the book we would have written about our family or about your adoption that that's okay you know it's your story it's your perspective and I think they're proud in the book\nYou have the scene where you are asked by a

say now you know I think\nIn a way I was I was honest to a point but I wasn't willing to kind of scraped deeper I remember sitting there thinking gosh and I tell them about like the bullying should I tell them about all these questions that I had and all the times I I wondered about my birth family and wondered why they'd given me up and it seemed like a lot to lay on them but the the main thing was that\nI had not put down this burden that I still felt um sometimes still feel to be honest\nOf trying to meet people's expectations as an adoptee because I Do love my family and I do want us in some sense to be seen as just like any other family and I\nI Want people to think that I can look at me and see like a happy grateful well adjusted person you know um it was very difficult sometimes still is difficult for me um to go beyond that and since that have complicate that narrative but\nI Do think that there are a lot of important questions that people who want to adopt temptation they

yesterday's confirmation and swearing in of Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh to energize the Republican voters at a campaign rally in Kansas last night Trump called on supporters to turn out to vote in next month's midterm elections\nAnd I'm not saying that anyone in terms of the assertion of making anything up I was about just feel I was going to say absolutely I Want to be certain we had tremendous\nEmpathy and incredible sadness for Dr Ford and we feel terrible that she was used as a political pawns [noise]\nBefore the site of a cabinet although all signs special election state elections fundraising were pointing to this being a wave election in favor of the Democrats do you think that the Kavanaugh's confirmation will make a dent in that momentum\nWell I think that you've already seen it this week I mean it was the number one fundraising week for the RMC we have more people reaching out to us around the country at night he was saying we must be able to be there to protect\nThe women and men in the future as they go to run for confirmation so that we don't scare them away and we say this after three point nine percent unemployment this is phenomenal the side of a\nKevin although hasn't been playing well with suburban women and that's a key demographic for both the left in the right um you know has involved issues that this demographic cares about sexual assault sexual harassment is that a\nProblem for the GOP well first of all let's take a step back and look at that premise there little I Will tell you that as a woman who does live in suburban America and I tried to talk to people and see where their heart is they were outraged at how judge Kavanaugh was treated as well as Dr Ford\nIf anything I feel it's suburban women have really waking up and said that could be my son that could be my husband sure but we didn't have them and that people were calling most polls do show that most college educated white women believe Ford\nSuburban women make a decision every time they go to the polls as to who they're going to support they are not\nPart of this wave and this is ... women are just going to all go left and you really have people for example look at senator Collins\nBy no means person you consider hard right but when she looks the evidence and puts it to the historical ends of looking at the Clintons and essentially how Bill Clinton was aided and abated by his wife while he victimized young interns I mean there's a certain point we have to say enough is enough\nAnd we need to get down to the business of leading our country and who better to do that than women on both sides of the aisle in this last month what are you running on what's your pitch to getting people out to vote very simple your vote matters you were going to be able to have\nGovernment that you want we're due process matters or constitutional values or reinforced and where we make sure that the threatening wave of socialism from the left is stopped\nMrs shorter runs the conservative pack Maggie's List speaking with us from Texas thank you so much thank you live\nAnd for a view from the Democrats we're joined now from California by Charles Chamberlain executive director of the liberal packed democracy for America welcome to the program for having me pulling this week shows the enthusiasm gap has all but disappeared what do you make of that Democrats have momentum scenes they lost it\nYeah I'm not surprised that uh it's changed a bit of courses tightening we're past Labor Day this is when people start paying attention to elections\nAs the Republicans continue to dig deeper and deeper into the whole they've dug for themselves with the Kavanaugh appointment I'm we're going to see that we have a very very energized democratic base if we started at a ten which is where we've been for the last six months this certainly turn it up to an eleven or a hundred\nBut this was a pretty brutal loss for the Democrats I mean I've heard many Democrats say the Democratic party gets out played all the time you're going into the midterms with a huge loss\nOf that's certainly true but you know this was an unlivable fight from the beginning we don't control the house or Senate we don't control the house we don't control the presidency\nAnd now we don't control the Supreme Court ah and I'm proud of the fact that you can see that the the democratic caucus held almost completely together a standing against that the fight regardless of whether or not they're going to win and we fought on principles and on values that's what the American public wants to see from us and that's why they're going to reward us on election day\nBut that's what the Republicans say that the Democrats are trying to bring this nominee down no matter what whether it be over allegations of sexual misconduct in sexual assault or whether it be on his on his record\nRight but what's wrong with that both reasons are valid a he has a terrible right wing partisan records or use perjured himself he is a terrible judicial temperament and he's also been credibly accused of sexual assault any one of those for reasons are completely legitimate reasons to keep this guy off the court\nAnd the reason why they need to just type fight tooth and nail every day to try to defeat him win or lose\nWe've seen in recent polls that women specifically white women and specifically suburban white women are leaning now more towards the Democrats but women were outraged when the Access Hollywood tape came out a but white women went for Trump and helped him win what do you think that makes twenty Eighteen different\nI think that we have a very a much more exciting a and engage democratic ... across the board or we have an understanding that the\nFuture of the Democratic party anti America is with the leadership of black and brown people of color or throughout this country and the progressive whites are a part of that coalition but we can't depend on the idea that uh the way women are going to save us if you look across this country that's what we're seeing and that's where the future is\nAh what are you running on I mean when you're going out in this last month how are you getting people out to the polls what are you telling them\nSaid the two biggest issues one is check on Trump's we actually\nGot to send some people to Congress that are going to fight Trump right now with Republicans controlling the house and in the Senate or the you know they've got what ever they need to get whatever they want a it's time that America puts a check on Trump and that's what we're messaging and people are responding to but it's\nNot just about Trump's also about our vision for America and that's why you see campaigns that are running on a issues like Medicare for all inclusive populism really succeeding better rookies put a Texas roaring\nDigits between him right between Ted Cruz and the way he's been able to do that is because he was running a powerful people powered campaign on issues individually for America like Medicare for all\nCharles Chamberlain director of the liberal packed democracy for America thank you

things a rally well Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in as the newest associate justice of the U.S Supreme Court Trump was off to Topeka NPR camera keys traveled with the president and joins us now good morning Tam good morning\nAt this rally was on the schedule before the final cabinet vote in fact the president watched it from air force one you were there time what was the reaction on the plane\nYeah he wanted the reporters who were on the plane to watch him watching the final tally come in and he gave a thumbs up\nAfter that he took some questions and a reporter asked him what message she had for the women out there who were devastated feeling devastated by this result and President Trump said that he didn't think there were any women like that women\nResult when it's polished and that is very much what people experience with\nConcerts they go to the concert and they see the final version but there is all this stuff that goes into it that's rough and you know it's building the process it's experimentation you know when I was in conservatory there will be people practicing in the next room but even then you're not supposed to watch\nAnd not really supposed to look in the window you're not supposed to stop and listen and spy on people practicing it's supposed to be\nA private thing but it's when you come face to face with yourself and you look for your flaws and you try to fix them\nYourself it's really intimidating process it can be very discouraging so I Do think it's important that people feel like there is a community of\nPractice or is out there and we're all going through the same process\nBut I've learned over the years that just because you're having a tough day doesn't mean you're not making progress the tough days are actually when you're making much progress because you're trying to most things you are pushing against that wall that you haven't broken through before and eventually it will break through because you're pushing against

for the employees on but it really isn't anything more than that it's a convenience but it it's still needs to be handled by employees it's still needs an employee interaction um so it isn't going to be anything that can replace them but it is a fun interaction for our gas\nCliff Atkinson is senior vice president for hospitality had MGM resorts and the ... is part of the family of hotels while we were in Las Vegas he was in Japan for work so we got him on the phone\nFor us we like to be innovative and we like to try and do fun things\nBeyond the fun Atkinson says automation is helping transform the industry as gas demand more of a customized experience they're looking for options take for instance checking in the front desk is already changing\nI did is we eliminate front altogether that you're able to check in over your phone but the people that were at the front desk are still there are there to customize your jury there to greet you at the car and they're there to

about Brazil's recession between two thousand two thousand sixty one about\nThe is about violent crime is country whether over sixty thousand\nAnd he's journals boulevard using is not usually using

algae these are people live out to a fruit\nBrazilians are on you know that that has made them very worried about what kind of a president he will make they're worried about his close ties to the ... tree and they're also worried about the fact that he openly and frequently expresses admiration for the military dictatorship\nThat ruled in this country until Nineteen Ninety five\nSo\nFor anyone to win the presidency and the first round they need to get fifty percent plus one on could he went outright today\nHe could I mean he's been rising quite rapidly in the polls and the last few days the latest one how to just over forty percent of the boats and uh so it's not impossible given the fact\nThat you know these are just so\nIt's not impossible but he could win today come and I just thought that was absolutely unthinkable a few weeks ago even a week ago but now that it might happen votes unlikely\nYou know this will have huge ramifications for the region Brazil is the biggest democracy the largest economy in Latin America with ties to countries all over the region of the world what are his policy what will he'd do if you went [noise]\nWell what we know from what people around them

passed away in the middle of reading it in January of this year and thank you um but by the time he passed he had read most of the parts that he was in and he loves it he really appreciated that one of his goofy joke state and\nSo people used to ask us all the time like where did they get you meaning me and my father would say oh if you put a polling a Hungarian together you get a Korean like where do you think they came from it's terrible joke it was his way of kind of thing maybe you shouldn't be asking this question [laughter] um one thing that my they both said to me was that\nThis isn't the book we would have written about our family or about your adoption but that's okay you know it's your story it's your perspective\nAnd I think they're proud [noise] in the book\nYou have the scene where you are asked by a couple about ... what do you think of having been adopted a which is a pretty heavy question to ask anybody um and you write at the time that you weren't honest with them about your experience what would you say now you know I think\nIn a way I was I was honest to a point but I wasn't willing to kind of scraped deeper I remember sitting there thinking should I tell them about like the bullying should I tell them about all these questions that I had and all the times I I wondered about my birth family and wondered why they'd given me up it it seemed like a lot to lay on them but the the main thing was that\nI had not put down this burden that I still felt um sometimes I still feel to be honest\nOf trying to meet people expectations as an adoptee because I Do love my family and I do want us in some sense to be seen as just like any other family and I\nI Want people to think that I to look at me and see like a happy grateful well adjusted person you know um it was very difficult sometimes still is difficult for me um to go beyond that and to sort of complicate that narrative but\nI Do think that there are a lot of important questions that people who want to adopt traditionally could be asking themselves many many are\nAre you going to this realistically and have you really looked at your family your schools you're neighborhoods your religious organizations if there were a child of color coming into your environment what would they find when they find mostly white people or would they be able to find people who shared their background and people they could connect with\nYou know I think if you're adopting across racial lines you know that is the beginning point\nNicole Chung her memoir is all you can ever no thank you very much thank you so much Lou\n[noise] [noise]\nOoh you're listening to weekend edition from NPR News\nAt the Melbourne Zoo the monkeys are no longer allowed to eat bananas and the pandas are getting pellets instead of plums in fact fruit has been phased out completely that's because the fruit that humans have selectively bread over the years has become so full of sugar\nDoes use fruit carrying animals were becoming obese and losing teeth\nSo how did fruit gets so sugary and what does that mean for us humans we're putting those questions to food writer and author Frederick Kaufman who joins us now welcome to the program Oh hi how are you from great thanks so how has changed since humans intervened in this process well\nListen since about ten thousand years ago and the origin of agricultural human beings have been messing around with ... ... what you're looking at is\nNatural varieties which are purely which are tasteless which have no smell and uh the farmers were like we can do better than this and they started cost breeding almost from the get go\nI didn't think this is going to go to mediate leader the sex life of plants but apparently that's where we're headed um I mean why though has modern fruit become as sugary as it has\nWell one of the main dates to remember here is Nineteen thirty which is one of the United states uh passes the plant patent act\nAnd from that point forward the idea is we're trying to encourage farmers to actually manipulate those plants and to make them sweeter to make them fat or a and also to make them seagulls to take their sex way in fact what's happening is is that when you when you actually\nTake the sex drive of a plant away when you take away it feeds it actually could puts more energy into getting fat and sweet\nWhen you read about how fruit um has impacted the zoo animals were you surprised\n[noise] uh no not not at all I mean as I said for years now we've been lobbying\nThese natural varieties of almost everything about them except their sweetness you you look at a watermelon there is no seed was watermelons it's full of just bright red luscious fruit there's nothing like that found in nature to tomatoes you find in nature are tiny and tasteless\nThe apples you find in nature or almost all of the most bitter is people don't realize that everything well she was in the supermarket you're like super stars are like supermodels and then it'll be athletes like long James that's what we're looking at the supermarket\nShe'll let me ask you because eating the super model of the of the free world doesn't sound like necessarily a bad thing I'm you've written a book about this kind of stuff that the farm how food stopping food is part of the problem has it become less nutritious is it just good looking unless good for us\nI think that the argument among dieticians is is that is the yes the higher sugar content\nIs robbing a food a lot of it's a nutritional value and I also think there's a tradition in America of somehow seeking perfection drew or food that somehow if we eat white we will make ourselves mentally and spiritually\nBetter and so of course if we see row after row perfectly glistening absolutely gorgeous completely look like Apple's we think yeah I ... that\n... but fruit is still good for humans\nOf course eat like your grandmother told you to eat is probably the best the best advice\nFrederick Kaufman is a food journalist and author thank you very much thank you [noise]\nThis is NPR News this is eighty nine point three K PCC\nI'm Tammy Trujillo on your KBC the weekend
