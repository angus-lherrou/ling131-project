excited\n\nI didn't specifically asked are there any goes here I Am and have no reason that that I mean I had no clue coming from California to have had any kind of reputation\nApparently for at least a hundred years it's had a reputation for having against as I learned later the owner hold the employees you know\nMake sure you keep that secret they didn't want anybody to not especially a prospective buyer\n\nI had a pretty fast introduction to the guests probably within the first couple of weeks I was pretty can then I Would hear footsteps back and forth and the hallways at night it was fairly soon after I moved in I Would say within a month so it must have been um\nSpringtime when I first heard the children\n[noise]\nThe first one happened I was alone in my bedroom in the middle of the night and\nIt sounded as if it was in the room with me mommy mommy I knew that the children were\nLooking for somebody to save them and and it was white frequent but I didn't know how to help them and I and I felt totally helpless it was one of my\nFirst days there and so I was there alone and I sat down in the city room and I must have decided I wanted something because I got up to go back out\nAnd the door was locked in I thought oh well that's where there's really no key had no luck but um so I went to the other ... or ... another door [noise]\nAnd it was locked\nAnd by then I'm thinking okay this is creeping me out and I went to the third\nOr [noise] and that was the last two and there's no way these stores can be locked pulled\nOn the door now by phone the door and the doors would not come open and these are internal doors so there was no ... there was no locks on the door and I grabbed the handle and\nFull with all my my\nFans of George versus just wouldn't listen [noise]\nSo I run to the windows and try to get the windows open and those are all heated shut so by then I'm practically screaming\nI don't know what's going on my mind is racing\nI rented the phone I pick up the receiver I hold my breath thank God there was a dial tone\nDial that each show I don't know how well I explain it but she did come right over and I sat there on the floor and waiting for her it's just [noise] just praying I I didn't know what to do\nFinally I hear a car drive up I look out\nThe window and it's been a Joe she comes running up to the to the door\nThe door trying to get in she can't get a job where I can and like the doors are locked there's [noise] there's no way they couldn't lock and she said hold on I'll be right back and she went to get a tire iron\nAnd I can see her run out to the car and run back up to the house with the tire iron and the next thing I Know\nShe's in the room helping me up and she told me that when she got to the door that just sell them\nI couldn't stand up my legs which\nI was completely torn because on the one hand I loved the house I had so many plans\nAnd left all my friends so I was embarrassed to because what was I supposed to say oh my goodness I came home because there's a ghost [noise] but\nYeah I did have second thoughts but I just being there felt so right [noise]\nI never thought that I was listening I thought that what I saw was really manifesting that I had no idea what it was so I did doubt [noise]\nMy sanity maybe or maybe the whole universe I don't know\nWe just learning how to an unwritten rule that after dark you don't talk about the goes the experiences became progressively more\nAnd more\nFrequent\nEspecially at night but also during the day I Would hear children calling out and they say mommy mommy and sometimes other people hurting too sometimes they didn't but it always written my heart out [noise]\n\nAbsolutely fell to drive to um try to help them\nWhat does a regular person do when you're hearing these things I didn't know\nYou know I I wanted to do something and I wanted to learn more about the history and and I and then we did do a lot of research and talked to a lot of the local people and people who knew the house and that's when people were calling me Sarah\nI must have asked who's Sarah was\n[noise] in the history of the home there was a couple of owners and\nOne of the most famous was Sarah Matilda enter two little girls\nAnd her husband judge clerk would dress and as the legend goes the judge would\nForce one of the females place to go upstairs with\nHim to the nursery when the children were out playing where he would have their his way with them [noise]\nAnd a slave being very young when I was always trying to protect yourself and well she was afraid she was going to lose her status\nAs a house urban and she decided that to save her so\nShe would make the family\nVery ill and then she could save them\nAnd be the hero and so she thanked the poisonous\n... flour into the children's birthday cake\nIt backfired because that night Sarah Matilda and the two little girls died in the house\nI think as time went on and the two little girls kept appearing and we would hear more and more of them I figured out that it had to be them\nI Do feel that's why I was drawn to the house and I felt that since the day I first went to look in and looked up the back staircase I felt like I had lived there before if that's possible\nThe girls had been seen quite often like we'd have the school group um come through and the teacher would send me a photograph and say this was our class but who are the two little girls standing next to them [noise] and a lot of people\nThought that they were my two little girls because I have blonde hair and they had blond hair and they were dressed in our time\nFloating and they thought that was you know address my children and all the time so [noise]\nI just in a way I did almost feel as if you know they were related or they were my children are are they were in like [noise]\nI was alone at the house we had a very unusual snow and ice storms in Louisiana I mean that never happened so the types froze there was no\nUm water it most of the staff and I think even Jim went to either a hotel or or went home somewhere so I was surprised that we still had electricity but we did and I was watching TV feeling very comfortable\nAnd the electricity goes out [noise]\nAnd of course we found a book from the Eighteen hundreds it said whenever all the lights go out at the Myrtle something always
