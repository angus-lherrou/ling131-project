I just want to really put on a funny show\nBut maybe if someone sees it and they find it easier to talk about the great maybe someone sees it and talk to their kid a little more freely\nThat's great like those are I I Want to make sure that I Wish I had when I was you know Eighteen Nineteen years old and and didn't have an outlet that would spread this conversation ... ... I'm Sorry about that at the same time\nI'm also this is real for me and I'm not always emotionally equipped to take on more and there's times where people tell me things that are very personal or scarier dark and it it fills out you know I've had like people wait for me after the show to tell me about\nTimes that they've they've hurt themselves or people in their lives who who are gone now like and that's it it's makes me feel great that I've created something where people feel like they can air this stuff out gives off their chest but it's also very hard\nDo you feel like if you could cross out your condition from your life you would\n[noise] I think I Would if I could go back I I think I Would but you know it's it's interesting my few years ago I got I got open up the mail one day\nAnd I had a letter from my mom and it was a handwritten letter to the mail the like the actual U.S Postal service and you know this is not a thing that happens so often anymore\nSo immediately I was like what what is this and I read it and it was clearly my mom and put a lot of a thought into it and uh it uses letter was she she basically said you know I've thought a lot about\nYour stuff in your childhood and you know some of the things that you and your brother dealt with and she's like for a long time\nSo it's a lot of guilt and and wondered if I should have done some things differently but now you're older and I see\nYour work and I see that there's a lot of young people who are are getting a lot out of it and and it's just like I have to say like I wouldn't take it back because I see who you've turned into and what you've done with it and I think it's a\nI think you're you're helping some kids out there\nAs you can imagine that was a very\nEmotional experience for me to read that as far as I go\nYeah I'd probably change [laughter] I could go back and not have to deal with some of the stuff I doubt that's\nFor sure but my mom had that perspective on it which was both nice to read and also very intense very heartbreaking me personally if I could go back to Nineteen Ninety One Ninety Ninety two and just flip a switch and not have to deal with it probably probably\nYou're listening to ... I'm Jesse port my guess is the comedian Chris gathered\nI let's play a clip from my guest Chris ...
