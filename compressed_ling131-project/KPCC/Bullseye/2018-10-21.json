know that Porter spent a lot of time researching the music that can call his records his books watching documentaries\nCole who was black recorded a lot of his biggest hits in the Nineteen fifties right when the civil rights movement was heating up and those songs were beautiful affecting songs but they weren't explicitly political or socially conscious and Kohl's legacy has taken some heat for that\nBut Gregory Porter says it's not that simple\nYou know people think about his whose lives and was like oh it's you know he's in the sky and he sees you know it's just so you know milk toast and sweet but think about a song like pick yourself up dust yourself off and start all over again think about that song for somebody who\nThe thing that I think is really particularly fascinating about love if\nI'm if that makes them so important to the story is that really huge role in the history of Los Angeles and partly in the history of America is as an advocate for\nAn American identity that represented this part of America right but it was like more than Boston Philadelphia and New York ... but it included the Navajo and it included\nThe me walk and it included all the ... the Spanish that seems like a big deal and it seems like part of\nMaybe why they thought it was a good idea for him during the library despite him having no library experience because the librarian part maybe was an assertion of identity\n[noise] I think that he\nHe is really important in that sense that Los Angeles was no longer certainly as he could influence it not no longer trying to ape that culture of New York or Philadelphia or Chicago but instead was\nHaving a sense of itself as a distinct place\nWith its own identity [noise] it's funny for us to imagine now seeing Los Angeles as it is now that the idea that you would build buildings that had a Spanish influence\nThat was just not done you were trying at it before this identity really kind of took hold it was an effort to make LA and look like\nThe big cities of the northeast a sense of history of what had been here and who had been here was that was new I mean his influence\nTo say look this is what Los Angeles is he was the founder of the ... the southwest museum\nThat stuff wasn't being collected are preserved in any way it was very radical actually what he did and it's interesting because he didn't grow up here he was definitely a transplant but he really truly fell in love with the essential old California\nCharacter of this this amalgam of Spanish culture and Native American culture and and the new culture of people moving in and identifying at and really preserving and celebrating it\nMost of the the most of the important books of the early Los Angeles library we used as you describe it and I believe you are about citrus fruits [laughter] right\n[laughter] and she ... and yeah I mean the the initial I mean we ... gives you a real sense of the difference in what was going on in LA at the turn of the century versus\nNew York city which had a well established library that was already I'm building a collection of\nImportant literary works the among the initial purchases of the LA library when it was an association was form to\nHave a library happened were books about\nCitrus about beekeeping up I mean this was a country town it was\nA couple of thousand people was not a significant city and then one of the other themes that continued which was interesting is that the library existed in rented space for a very long time\nYeah I mean if your boys are obviously you can just imagine what the New York public library the main branch of the New York public library looks like that was big giant libraries of New York and Boston and all these city had been ... you know Eighteenth century\nAnd in the meantime Los Angeles at that point\nHad a library that was on the upper floor of a department store and you would ride the elevator along with the people were going shopping for ... years and you know they they would get off on the ... floor or the floor with children's clothing and you would ride on up and\nGo to the library and one of the it it was this a cause for much embarrassment in the city this feeling that will LA couldn't possibly be an intellectual center if it didn't have a library\nYou're listening to ... I'm Jesse Thorn my guest is Susan Orlean a staff writer for the New Yorker and author of the library book\nWas shocked about the fire that destroyed a substantial portion of the central library and particularly a substantial portion of the collection um it was driven by these\nStacks that basically function do like a like a charcoal chimneys for your barbeque or grill and the the fire was absolutely catastrophic ... what was the proportion of books that were destroyed and or damaged by this fire\nThere were a million bucks either destroyed or damaged and that was about um a little more than fifty percent of the entire collection\nFour hundred thousand were they were vaporized basically I mean this was a fire that burned for seven and a half hours it reached temperatures of twenty five hundred degrees and as you say the stacks which are the [noise]\nThe area where the books that are not in the open shelves are stored in the stacks and that's typical for a library but\nThe division between the different tiers within the stack 'em rather than being a ceiling which would keep a fire contained [noise] they were open grading so that the fire basically just these are seven cheers tall\nAnd the fire simply just blasted through all seven tears it couldn't have been a better set up for a fire\nI mean this was a fire where these spaces are grown so hot that firefighters were having to leave after like five and ten minutes simply because they couldn't physically be there just because he got so hot inside the building\nYeah I mean that's an amazing they had these oxygen canisters that would normally last an hour and they were breathing so heavily because there was so hot that the canisters are lasting about ten minutes\nAnd they went through more than a thousand of these oxygen canisters and they had to keep swapping the teams out because nobody it\nIt was just too hot to be in there twenty five hundred degrees doesn't matter if you're in a\nA fire suit it's just\nUnbearable at one point\nOver half of the entire\nCity of Los Angeles fire department was working to try to put this fire out\nAnd they ended up relying on the county to staff the fire houses around the city because nobody was around they were all at the library trying to put the fire out and they needed somebody to be there in case someone else someone tells caught on fire\nI mean it was very really difficult fire and almost every firefighter I spoke to said they'd never fought a fire that was as\nChallenging and as fierce as this fire was\nI think for many of them the the the sort of I I don't want to say the highlight of their career because obviously it wasn't something they were joyful about but it was the most intense experience of their careers\nMore with Susan Orlean

this quite spread out now there's a lot of new construction where the cotton fields used to be my mother used to pick cotton when she was a little girl [noise]\nThere in in Bakersfield Bakersfield is is um [noise] I feel like\nIt's a city in change racially and in politically\nBut it is a a a fascinating place I just moved back there\nAfter you know Twenty years I've been there for a couple of years now and I'm ... ... rediscovering a place that that I was raised in um so I'm Still trying to to figure out what it is\nBut in the meantime in figuring out what it is there's some are extraordinary Mexican food [laughter]\nWhich is you know in every corner and I love that and I'm a but it is still an agriculture a based agriculture and oil is enormously important there and uh\nAnd this you know a lot of working class people\nThe feeling of Bakersfield is you know you're you're not very far from Los Angeles you know ... hour hour and a half away you know and it's a big city of four hundred thousand people as you said yeah\nYou are not surprised when you are there that it was you know the birthplace of a whole sub genre of country and western music\nBecause it is it's hot you know streets are wide yeah and you can see a long way [laughter] you know what I mean like it has that open dusty field [laughter] ah\nYou know it's funny it is the thing is the transportation of the south it it is and ah the the people that gravitated their um the uh the agriculture that was a a is found root there are a lot of the people\n'cause it's a start of the of the Central Valley essentially they are California where you know whatever it is forty five percent of the produce in the United states has ground\nYeah yeah and and so the ... the black population they came they came for work um Texas Louisiana Arkansas there was you know the migration that there but from the south that went\nAh to the north and went to Chicago and ah Detroit or but there was also that group of the family that came from Louisiana Arkansas Texas you know Mississippi that came\nWest in Bakersfield was one of the places that they settled because there was agriculture work\nThe interesting thing
