World Service with me in golden [noise]\nI'm an economist and professor of globalization and developments at the University of Oxford previously I was headed policy for the world bank and before that economic advisor to president Mandela and chief executive of the development bank of southern Africa [noise]\nHaving worked all my life as an economist it's not easy to admit it but I think the financial crash of two thousand eight reflects the crisis in economics ... my profession as a great deal on the floor [noise]\nI was working in Washington in the run up to the crisis and neither I Know my colleagues knew the many thousands of others in the central banks finance ministry some commercial banks soared coming what should've been a moment of triumph was the economists preventing a\nCrisis turned into a spectacular public failure but where economists to blame for not stopping the crisis here's the highly regarded lead economics commentator the Financial Times mountain move\nI Do think that economics at\nSea town folded and asked\nIt influenced policymaking bad substantial responsibility for what went wrong\nSo what we're calling them is meant to be doing economists people like me welcome all kinds of things economist in finance advised bankers and their clients how to make money and understand risks\nThose working for government in central banks in finance ministries have a particular responsibility to ensure the financial stability\nThe Nineteen nineties and only two thousands were good times where economist for keeping things running smoothly they were rewarded with money and kudos\nMost of the public would barely aware of them as economies apparently ticks along nicely on they watch until suddenly these experts proved to be totally incompetent and able to see the crisis coming and to stoppage\nProfessor next on President of the u._k. Israel economic society thinks the reason that economists dropped the ball was that there's some things with load\nIt's not easy to have a really slick pat on sets up why they didn't see it coming but one way of looking at it is that those people who are managing financial institutions\nAnd asking whether they found all not tend to look at them one by one and what we know that financial crises is that there's a domino effect and the way one bank notes down another bank is that they lend to each other and I'm very into woven way so they build\nModels not let one dominant notes down enough of them now they build models actually with that if that wasn't bad [noise]\nWatch all these models exactly the ways of trying to predict what will happen if you're just one thing say prices interest rates unemployment\n[noise]\nOriginally there were actual mechanical model is still one on display New Zealand that uses water to demonstrate how money would float around the economy as computing power has grown\nSo to as the complexity of the models which should call them is try to capture the key relationships in a set of clever equations or professor ... saying that the models economists were using to predict the future assumed that if one bank failed would bounce back\nAnd most effect others but why would prevailing models assume that the crush couldn't happen when economists note that economic crushes occur with disturbing regularity\nParts of that story of assuming away those things that were dangerous was because economics had had quite a lot of success so if you look back\nAt the ten years before the financial crisis also that what you call it a great moderation and what that meant was the boom and bust didn't seem to be with us so we're still just rolling along in a chair for way down the river a reasonable state and things are going OK\nPoliticians believe this to reassuring people that they finally found a way to keep prosperity going forever here's the venue ... big circa Gordon Brown speaking in two thousand seven [noise]\nWe will not return to the old boom and\nBust [noise]\nEconomists so happy to blame the models they made for being inadequate but is this enough was the deeper problem with economics the bank of England's chief economist and they held and has no doubt that economists were in deep trouble\nI think we should take some of the black as an economist is and what is what my whole life\nIn economics truth be told our coast model of how the economy function of out of our system and um that will cause model fail at the first offense and the crisis it could not make sense of what was happening around us\nSo of course that was the same thing we can and we should have happened after the Nineteen thirties go back\nReform written branch seems crazy now to think we somehow lost sight of the importance of finance and money in banking and explaining the ... and the economy\n\nWasn't the economists suicide fault or the discipline of economics itself [noise]\nMy own view is that it's not economics but the economists have come to dominate the discipline that having a helpful obsession with perfect markets ignoring the parts of economics which do not adhere to their ideas including the central insights of John Maynard Keynes incredibly these high priest of the new economics\nSimply assumed to weigh the risks associated with crises as well as many other failures such as environmental damage will collusion which one forensic to market economies [noise]\n\nWilling bouncer the former chief economist is one of the biggest us banks Citibank believes that it's not a failure to see the crisis coming which condemns economists but rather the fact that we were captivated by new fashions which left us ill equipped to do anything about it\nNobody showed me she and the crisis coming not doing that I I don't feel particularly bad about not seeing it's coming it's not that uncommon right my doctor doesn't see my diseases coming either\nThat my doctor can prescribe at least I Hope so the right match bombs that disease as being diagnosed but much of\nThe fashionable economics of the Iraq had absolutely nothing to say about how to handle the crisis\nIt to guess far too long to diagnose a disease and responded appropriately wash school of economics that actually that is how to handle the crisis that was old fashioned games in economics\nAnd a number of people made that point but then people recommend that fiscal stimulus in the face off a deep recession\nThey weren't using frontier economics with a guy that gets starting graduate schools they are using stuff that evade you're remembered from the undergraduate days yeah so do you get onto the surgeries\nThey're rather better than the economy of the eighties and nineties and the early just as\nThe financial crisis highlights you extent to which what was being tortured universities was increasingly irrelevant\nWhen do you call them was head of graduate studies at University College London a top rated economics departments she saw how unhappy whose students were with a mismatch between what they were learning in class what we're seeing on the news as first banks and then the whole financial system began crushing down\nAll watching this and in some sense struggling trying to understand what was going on there were similar a sense of students being very ... and what they would come and say is can you help us understand what's going on\nWe're not learning to enact classes and they were right that we're not getting in their economics classes a set of tools that was helping them to understand the day by day dimensions of the crisis\nAnd Christmas was a good sort of catalyst because at Christmas people are thrown together with their relatives and one typical question\nIt's well your studying economics you can tell us about the global financial crisis and the students having to say well we're actually not covering that
