World Service with me you know ... [noise]\nOn the communists in front of globalization and development at the University of Oxford previously I was head of policy for will bark and before that economic advisor to president ... in chief executive of development bronco southern Africa [noise]\nHaving worked in my life as an economist it's not easy to admit it but I think the financial crash of two thousand it reflects the crisis in economics ... my profession has a great deal to also [noise]\nI was working in Washington in the run up to the crisis and neither on\nMy colleagues knew the many thousands of others in the central banks finance ministers from commercial banks shortcoming what should've been a moment of triumph was economists preventing the crisis turned into a spectacular public failure but we're economists to blame for most opening the crisis\nHere's the highly regarded lead economics commentator the Financial Times most of them move I Do think\nThat economics has\nBecome folded asked it\nPolicymaking best substantial responsibility for what went wrong\nSo what we're calling them is meant to be doing economists people like me welcome all kinds of things economist in finance advice bankers and their clients how to make money and understand risks\nThose working for government in central banks and finance ministries have a particular responsibility to ensure financial stability\nThe Nineteen nineties and only two thousands were good times where economists for keeping things running smoothly they were rewarded with money and kudos\nMost of the public would barely aware of them as the economy as a parent you checked along nicely on they watch until suddenly these experts proved to be totally incompetent I'm able to see the crisis coming and to stop it\nProfessor next on President of the u._k. Israel economic society thinks the reason that economists dropped the ball was that there's some ... with load\nIt's not easy to have a really slick pat on sets up why they didn't see it coming but one way of looking at it is that those people who are managing financial institutions\nAnd asking whether they will sound all not tend to look at them one by one and what we know that financial crises is that there's a domino effect and the way one bank notes down another bank is that they lend to each other and I'm very into woven way\nSo they build models not where one dumbing down notes down enough of them now they build models actually without if that wasn't that [noise]\nWatch all these models exactly the ways of trying to predict what will happen if you're just one thing say prices interest rates unemployment\n[noise]\nOriginally there were actual mechanical model is still one on display New Zealand but uses water to demonstrate how money would float around the economy as computing power has grown\nSo to as the complexity of the models which is a columnist tried to capture the key relationships in a set of clever equation [noise]\nWhat professor Knicks done is saying is that the models economists were using to predict the future assumed that if one bank failed would bounce back and most effect others but why would prevailing models assume that it crushed couldn't happen when economists note that economic crushes occur with disturbing regularity\nParts of that story of assuming away those things that were dangerous where's because economics had had quite a lot of success so if you look back\nAt the ten years before the financial crisis also that what you call it a great in moderation and what that meant was the boom and bust didn't seem to be with us so we're still just rolling along in a cheerful way down the river a reasonable state and things are going OK\nPoliticians believe this to reassuring people that they finally found a way to keep prosperity going forever here's the venue catch on sort of big circa Gordon Brown speaking in two thousand seven [noise]\nWe will not return to the old boom and\nBust [noise]\nEconomists so happy to blame the models they made for being inadequate but is this enough was the deeper problem with economics the bank of England's chief economist and they held and has no doubt that economists were in deep trouble\nI think we should take some of the black as an economist is and was what my whole life\nIn economics truth be told ... model of how the economy function of how our system and um that were close model failed it the first fence in the crisis it could not make sense of what was happening around us\nSo of course that was the same thing we can and we should have happened after the Nineteen thirties go\nReform route and branch seems crazy now to think we somehow lost sight of the importance of finance and money in banking and explaining the big\n... and the economy\nWasn't the economists who are folks who the discipline of economics itself [noise]\nMy own view is that it's not economics but the economists have come to dominate the discipline that having a helpful obsession with perfect markets ignoring the parts of economics which do not adhere to their ideas including the central inside so John Maynard Keynes incredibly these high priests of the new economics\nSimply assumed to weigh the risks associated with crises as well as many other failures such as environmental damage will collusion which one forensic to market economies [noise]\n\n... the former chief economist at one of the biggest us banks Citibank believes that it's not a failure to see the crisis coming which condemns economists but rather the fact that we were captivated by new fashions which left us ill equipped to do anything about it\nNobody shows coming she cries discovery not doing that I I don't feel particularly bad about not seeing it coming it's not that uncommon right my doctor doesn't see my diseases coming either\nBut my doctor can prescribe at least I Hope so the right match once that disease has been diagnosed but much of\nThe fashionable economics of the Iraq had absolutely nothing to say about how to handle the crisis\nIt to go far too long to diagnose disease and responses appropriately wash school of economics that actually did that as I Would add to the crisis that was old fashioned cases economics\nAnd a number of people made that event people recommended fiscal stimulus in the face off a deep recession they weren't using frontier\nEconomics or the guy that got stores in graduate schools they were using stuff that vaguely remembered from the undergraduate days yeah so do you get them through the surgeries\nThey're rather better than the economy of the eighties and nineties and the early to says\nThe financial crisis highlighted the extent to which would who's being tortured universities was increasingly irrelevant\nWhen do you call them was head of graduate studies at University College London a top rated economics departments she saw how unhappy with students were with a mismatch between what they were learning and close what we're seeing on the news as first banks and then the whole financial system began crushing down\nWe're all watching this and in some sense struggling trying to understand what was going on there were similar a sense of students being very perplexed and what they would come and say is can you help us understand what's going on\nWe're not learning to enact classes and they were right that we're not getting in their economics classes a set of tools that was helping them to understand the\nDay by day dimensions that the crisis\nAnd Christmas was a good sort of catalyst because at Christmas people are thrown together with their relatives and one typical question is well your studying economics you can tell us about the global financial crisis and the students having to say well we're actually
