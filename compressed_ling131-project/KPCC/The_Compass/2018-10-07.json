World Service with me in golden [noise]\nFind professor of globalization and development at the University of Oxford previously I was kind of policy for the world bank and prices that run the development bank of southern Africa and wasn't economic advisor to president Mandela [noise]\nLast week I showed how the crisis that started on Wall street quickly spread across the u._s._a. and to the rest of the world [noise]\nWhat started as a banking crisis rapidly move into a major economic collapse with production fooling at the fastest rate since the great depression this week we're going to folks and the response to the crisis and ask if the way the government's handled it make things better or worse [noise]\nThey're not saying that he probably the way we had we not pain [noise]\nIn the u._s. it's estimated that the crisis cost at least twenty thousand dollars for each person and overtime resulted in the loss of Fifteen billion dollars of national wealth equivalent to almost one year's economic activity\nThe greatest pain as being felt in the old industrial cities in small towns where there's a great concentration of homes affected by the collapse in the mortgage market\nJeff Smith the executive director of the Institute of housing studies in Chicago explains\nThe way that the foreclosure crisis in the financial crisis affected housing markets in the states is that it really started\nTo most heavily impact neighborhoods where you had a high concentration of subprime loans and you had a lot of families being evicted from their homes due to foreclosure you had a lot of vacant abandoned meant in those neighborhoods and it was really concentrated you know a lot of urban or an African American neighborhoods in cities and suburbs across the country\nSo in Chicago you got some neighborhoods where over forty percent of the housing units in those neighborhoods were hit by at least one foreclosure over the foreclosure crisis that house itself\nWas likely abandoned and overvalued so in many cases the value of the mortgage was much greater than the actual value their property causing blight in many neighborhoods in Chicago and other parts of the country\nI also Jeff what happened to these people foreclosure\nIs a negative event on your credit score credit scores are very you know significant numbers these days and when lots of people make decisions on not just if you can get a loan\nOr for a car or for mortgage for a credit card but also use if you can get a job you use if you can get a apartments so it was a big event that hell a significant effect not just on where they live but also options going forward\nIn the U.S the crisis has skewed home ownership to older borrows with strong credit ratings\nHomeownership rates will be under forty five have stood sharply since the crash over forty percent of housing wealth is now held by over sixties compared to own your calls it before the crash poor and middle income families and young people have not benefited from increasing housing values in recent years\nJust highlights the extent to which the diverging fortunes of the property market led to increased inequality\nThe economy at least for a certain components of the economy has improved and you see investments coming into the city but that's really only touching maybe a third to half of of the city neighborhoods and the rest of the city is continuing to struggle and really hasn't recovered\nFrom the financial crisis the neighborhoods still lack investments the families who live there struggle for finding employment and Ford will housing\nSo I think what you've seen in Chicago and yet I think what you've seen it a lot of cities is a growing tale of two cities where the fortunes of the rich and the folks who have resources that have been getting a better on the fortunes of the folks who\nAre struggling and are getting worse\nThe growing inability of low income people to sell their homes and moved the dynamic cities where the new jobs that we found\nCombined with the fact that the U.S government spends one six of the average of other advanced countries on the labor market retraining has reduced ability of people to escape their predicament\n\nNineteen Seventy in two thousand we'd love in a hundred and forty seven countries\nExperience banking crises three thousand age was the mother of all crises in the severity and globally impacts averaging comes in the rich world which the grunt uninterrupted since the second World War\nFiled the U.S economy was within three is about a third smaller than it would have been had they not being a crisis this was despite the\nFact that the U.S in boxing the stimulation package which sought to minimize the impact professor Joseph Stiglitz was received the Nobel Prize for economics explains the reasons\nWhenever a economy is hit by a crisis economy goes down tax revenues go down often expenditures have to go out for unemployment welfare benefits\nAnd so even countries with surpluses wind up having deficits and even more if you have to spend a lot of money to bail out the banks [noise]\nHistorically there have been many instances where government seeing that deficit say that deficit will result in a loss of confidence we have to get rid of the deficit the way you get rid of the deficit is cut back expenditures which is called us therapy\nFor raise taxes but actually really hard to do the middle of a downturn\nHerbert Hoover who was the president when\nThe stock market collapsed in Nineteen twenty nine used austerity and I credit him with converting the stock market crash into the great depression\nThe Obama administration had lunch to lessen the renowned British economist John Maynard Keynes drew from the great depression sooner after Obama became president in early two thousand nine Congress approved the seven hundred and eighty seven billion dollar American recovery and reinvestment act\nWhich aims to spare consumer spending and restore investor confidence through a combination of tax credits increases in welfare payments and cheap loans for businesses\nIn addition the Federal Reserve pumping money into the economy to reduce interest rates and then the experiment known this quantitative easing that also was adopted in the u._k. and Europe\nIn the U.S over four trillion dollars was added to the money supply in this way and then you can Europe at least ... trillion\nCanes great work address the question was should have been done and the answer is not austerity but stimulation\nWhat happens in an economic downturn is people get fearful they are spending and except vicious cycle is that now spend the economy gets weaker and austerity is a downward spiral\nIn Nineteen twenty nine governments acted like people and when times got tough they reduce spending but while it's rational for people to tighten their belts in tough economic times came showed that if governments did the same they would make\nMashed his father was\nAn ad governments need to overcome fear and economic contracts and my spending to reignite the moms\nIn Europe and the u._k. like in the U.S canes approach was adopted first and when the G twenty finance ministers were convened by the bend prime minister Gordon Brown in April two thousand nine they agree to one trillion dollar stimulation package\nAnd the European Commission agreed additional spending over two hundred billion euros [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Compass", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "07"}
