Wilbur Ross was in Brussels this week talking things over with the European Commission and you might recall back in July the president agreed to hold off on his threat to hit European auto imports with terrorists that would've been a very very big deal\nThe president agree to hold off while the two sides negotiated bigger trade deal\nWell three months later both sides are now blaming the other for lack of progress on any discussions with raw saying quote our president's patience is not unlimited marketplaces Scott has the transatlantic latest\nBack in late July European Commission president John ... and President Trump stood side by side in the rose garden and announced the makings of a deal\nWe agreed today first of all to work together towards zero tariffs zero non tariff barriers and zero subsidies\nFor non auto industrial good thank you so what's the hold a\nFinance professor Jeffrey Berg stranded at the University of Notre Dame says for one thing us trade officials have been a little busy hammering out another deal to replace NAFTA and that involved just three countries\nWhen you take up to twenty eight countries in the European Union it's a very demanding procedure demands

year that was on Monday and then yesterday\nPresident Trump said he wants to cut five percent from the federal budget next fiscal year and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said he is disturbed by the deficit and blames Social Security and Medicare\nBut here's a big chunk of the increase in ... we're going to do every year is because the federal government is pulling in less tax revenue

committee\nAt this point there is no real scenario which would actually pay for themselves they're probably going to be true or two and a half trillion dollars over years\nBut let's review that

we've heard so much about our pond or not or at the American Enterprise Institute says it's too early to know what's working\nI think looking at one year's numbers and saying around the tax cuts are not working and the adding to the deficits instead of reducing them I think is is is kind of misleading\nEven if things take time she says isn't the only issue\nPaid for these tax cuts with debt\nEven in the idea was that everybody imagines a tax cuts they find themselves in that period he takes place in a situation than the tax cuts themselves and not deficit finance\nAnother wrinkle companies aren't spending their tax savings the way tax writers planned than colander is an expert on the federal budget for example he says we've only seen a modest increase in wages also\nCompanies aren't investing they're using it to pay off debt and they're using it to a pay off a stock holders and do a variety of things that don't actually increase economic activity\nAnd they will need to be a huge boost in economic activity if these tax cuts are ever going to pay for themselves in Washington I'm Kimberly Adams for marketplace\nThe activity on Wall street day was down a lot but that is what is supposed to happen every now and then you all it is supposed to happen will have the details when we do the numbers\n[noise]\nA cynical observer would say that of course there wasn't gonna be a ... a
