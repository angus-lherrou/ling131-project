of prison guards who worked at that jail decided to uh have a fire drill during the overnight shift and that ... cents\nPretty much the entire staff to one wing of the jail away from the painting and during that ... that about Fifteen minute drill\nThree of the guards managed to take the painting down and replace it with a fake and and not very good fake\nSo they mess up the forgery how long did it take until uh people noticed the Dolly wasn't any wasn't there anymore\nAre not very long at all the painting was snatched a probably a little after one AM and about maybe six hours later one of the ah guards\nNotice that something didn't seem right about that painting had another guard look at it with him and they realized that is definitely wasn't a fake and from there they alerted the warden who quickly cordoned off the area and\nAn investigator was called to to find out what happened\nRight this investigator ... his name as my career so he was with New York city and kind of in charge of finding bad internal affairs among the corrections officers in the city and the like uh some suspicion landed on several wardens at Rikers right\nThat's right well not ... but a a system deputy ward and these are basically the highest level you can go in the ranks before you get appointed to being in a warning 'em and during that graveyard shift they were\nThe or there was two of them are a guy named Betty news out in a guy named Michel ... and they were basically the top man in charge that evening so or something was going to happen like a fire drill they're the ones who would have called it so suspicion immediately turned to them\nAnd inspector Caruso starts seeing that they're actually had been a plan a foot for some time it was not an impulsive thing right\nThat's right so a ultimately for guards are accused of taking the Dolly or one of the guards or an officer named Timothy opinion uh the morning after the highest he uh is immediately wracked with guilt and remorse over what happened\nHe decides that he needs to unburden themselves to investigators and tell them what happened\nAnd he goes in two days after the highest to the investigators and says I was part of this I was instructed by many news oh image will ... to steal this painting and their plan was to sell it because they believed it was worth quite a lot of money they were planning to sell it on the black market for a million dollars\nAnd Timothy ... was supposed to be fifty thousand he was essentially supposed to be a one of the lookout man and ultimately he was uh involved and actually taking the painting down and putting up the fake which by the way they they uh they put up the fake what the stapler so again it's not terribly\nLoaded lived as a replica um so once ah my Caruso had\nA Timothy opinion talking to him he wanted the officer to help them even more so they convinced him to wear a wire and later that evening he met up with another one of the guards this time it's a gardening Gregory socal and they met at a\nA like a little donut shop in Staten Island Timothy Kenya and Greg socal again talk about what happened and they're both filled with\nRemorse in paranoia that they're going to be caught and unbeknownst to Gregory socal you know Tim ... is wearing a wire so once the conversation's over investigator swoop in and they take Gregory socal into custody\nWho once he's taken into custody also and burns himself about the highs and again points to figure at Michel ... and Benny news or as the ringleaders so he has or convinces Gregory socal to wear a wire himself\nAnd uh later that evening when silk all supposed to start his graveyard shift at the jail\nHe and many news though in Michel ... agreed to meet and just talk about all the the heat that's on them about this heist and they meet in a a a an old locker room underneath the jail\nWhere there's like a hissing boiler and there's music playing from a nearby a weight room for the officers\nAnd they discuss the case\nDepending on who you ask investigators\nThey would say that a Benny news though and Michel ... implicate themselves in those conversations and they you know talk about about how the heat is on them they talked about how this would never have happened if they use the better replica\nAnd the investigators after they have this they give us recording the conversation they feel like they have enough\nTo at least I'm actually get a search warrant I'm betting news those house rather has been a news as mother's house they ransacked it they you know open up filled in fire places they look in the ceilings they don't find it so\nThere's some implication from the two thousand three highest that it it wasn't the first one that this piece as Dali is still on the art last last even today because the one stolen in two thousand three may not have been the original ... what's that about Benny\nWho ah who spoke to me for the article\nHe had his his thoughts about what happened to what he thought that you know\nThat painting had changed hands so many times over the years you know it was\nIt was in the cafeteria than it was it was a boxed up and then it was sent away to a a gallery in Virginia then it was boxed up again and kind of forgotten about and then found in the trash bin and then went to a more than ... office and he believes that somewhere along the way maybe somebody else might have taken at you know when there was a little less\nChance of being caught and and so many things that the the painting that they actually\nTook from that lobby of that jail was an was was already a fake was already a replica of the original one had gone missing long ago\nI got to say your story has enough young yang to it that I think they would really appreciate it himself
