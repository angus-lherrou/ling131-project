to keep it mostly clean but it is\nProbably going to have to get a little bit racy real work on the program\nHi Kay so this is going to sound like a weird way to start this interview but I'm the ... the entire premise of this article and and the job of intimacy coordinators is that for actors this shit is a workplace it's the office\nYeah and I mean I think that you know it hasn't been treated like that in the past I don't think that it was necessarily\nOut of mountains hangar on purpose but people get really uncomfortable effects especially in a workplace but it's something that really needs to be spoken about explicit we win sex and sexuality is involved in the actual job of making a film or making a TV show\nShow within the bounds of what the Federal Communications commission will let us talk about on the radio so for me as as it were the first ... the leader of this article that you wrote is it's really eliminating you know\n[laughter] yeah\nI started my article sort of trying to\nGet readers to enter into a TV set and what it's like for an actor and what that can be on the day when they're filming a sex scene in the case of and we need who plays Laurie on the juice she is making her half naked and she's been trying to get far more or less facts and\nShe's all these eyes on her and this is a situation where I think a lot of actresses has felt\nExtremely uncomfortable a because\nWhat ... told me and she's the intimacy grenade or on the juice said nobody has an opportunity to explicitly say this is what I'm comfortable with\nHow did it come to pass that there was an intimacy coordinator on set to begin with\nYeah so after season one I'm Emily native I mentioned plays Laurie mhm she realized that filming the sex scenes\nWas really taking a toll on her and she needed something to change so she went to the execs before season to started filming and said hey I Need some support I Need help on fat HBO started doing research and they stumbled on a leash or at us and our company\nSo how ... with the government that these are are you know simulated sections where you have to say that right but but how does she do how did she do that\nAlisha well off and get the script and she will go to the actor and she'll tell them what's in the script and then she will work it out with them defining what they feel comfortable with talking to them up\nOut their boundaries about anything that they would like on set to help them feel safe so then go back to the director on the producers and see if she can work something out that everyone else got about then when it comes to the day of filming\nShe is often standing within I shot a doctor um she is usually looking at the monitor to see how the scene is playing a so she's there to comment on the\nChoreography and she will help them protect themselves she'll tell them how to make things look more real without them having to do something that feels more sexual to them so it's about choreography the same way that we have a fight scene choreography\nRight uh HBO and it kind of makes sense is is leading the way on this or at least among the first because they've got this reputation for doing a whole lot of sex do you suppose it's going to spread is there a movement now to get it domestic coordinators ... in the broader spectrum especially given where we are in the society today with with me too and all of that\nYeah I think that's very likely to happen I Know David Simon said that he\nThere from from the from the wire we should say right\nAbsolutely yeah he said he never wanted to work without and intimacy coordinator again\nAt least you told me that her nonprofit intimacy directors international now that people know that she's working with the ... and ... other shows
