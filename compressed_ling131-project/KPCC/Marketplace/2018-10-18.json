off some of the American debt that it holds the marketplace Tracey Samuelson looks at the likelihood that might happen\nThe U.S government spends more each year than it brings in in revenue and to cover that shortfall it borrows money selling treasury bonds China owns more of these treasuries than any other country\nAbout one point two trillion with a T dollars and this has been a source of anxiety long before the current trade war here's Hillary Clinton on the presidential campaign trail back in two thousand seven\nWe are now dependent upon China and how do you get ... on your banker thing is\nChina's stockpiling treasury bonds is a very small fraction of the total us debt about five percent Mary ... director at the center for Chinese studies at the University of Michigan\nI think the notion of China as our banker is overblown both in terms of how much debt it's actually owned and also whether or not their alternative buyers\nBut lots and lots of treasuries hasn't actually been buying many more in recent years so the question is really with China dumped the left at it owns as a weapon in the ongoing trade war you know flood the market with lots of bonds to try and mess with

that China could cause through sales\nThe fed could tweak its plans to raise interest rates in order to offset any fallout from China's bond sales\nThat's why I Am much more worried about the rest of China might conclude that just wants a weaker currency and tried to uh respond to terrorists in that way\nThat there's as allowing the Chinese currency to appreciate against the dollar would make its goods cheaper globally and that would be much more disruptive and much harder for us to counteract I'm Tracey Samuelson for marketplace\nGot a graphic on her Instagram by the way of the top ten
