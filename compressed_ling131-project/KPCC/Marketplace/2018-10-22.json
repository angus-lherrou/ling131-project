enjoying the churning\nWeekdays it for an eighty nine point three gay PCC\n\nThis is marketplace I'm Todd result you I've heard perhaps of the Sinclair broadcast group a behemoth of a local television conglomerate that gets attention every now and then for its top down and very conservative political agenda that winds up on the air and dozens of local markets across the country\nThere is though a business model story that goes along with Sinclair how it got so big and so influential ... one of our front regulars I should say she wrote about it for the New Yorker magazine where she's a staff writer ... to to talk to you again\nGreat to be or ... show or maybe the place to start actually was just with a little primer on on who or what Sinclair is because it's it's been a little while couple of months anywhere since his company has been a miners Sinclair\nIs the largest owner of broadcast television stations in the U.S a and a lot of people are not terribly familiar with them the way they hear about CNN and NBC and other big networks uh Sinclair owns a hundred and Ninety two stations in eighty nine markets\nSo they are enormously influential they're seen by a lot of people are but they're they're largely outside the coastal media bubble\nBack up to that size thing because that is is relevant in a lot of ways uh for the context of this article because there are regulations and and considerations about who can on what media was right\nRight well regulation of television has changed over time and it has loosened overtime but in general there are a lot of restrictions around media ownership for reasons of preserving competition and local markets and also because\nA diverse points of view and diverse sources of news are considered to be sort of fundamental to uh maintaining a free and open democracy\nSo dig down into this a little bit and give me I guess maybe the ... the first one of these that Sinclair did back in the day was in Baltimore and and explain how they got around the rules I suppose is is the question what can\nSo so what they did was they would acquire a competitor station uh the FCC would say well you need to divest you need to sell one of these stations in order to comply with the regulations and the laws\nBut then uh they came up with a very clever trick to help with their lawyers and they would just simply divest the second station to a shell company run by sort of a business associates or a member of the ... family which is a family that controls Sinclair\nYou know so they would be able to say to the FCC that they sold the station but in fact the station was still not really independent and then they would sign an agreement that would give them the right to supply all of the programming to the station\nLet's get the Sinclair responds in here you ask them you know how did you guys get away with the citizens and they say their line has been for many years we're metal legal requirements right\nYes they I mean incredibly they did a managed to stay within the strict interpretation of the law although they they violated the spirit of the law one could say but yes what they did was strictly legal um but it was it was raised and it was pushing the line for sure\nSo to the to the other half of the question then why did the Federal Communications commission let Sinclair do this so many times\nThere's no simple answer to that I mean the the FCC comes under a lot of criticism for allowing too much consolidation has been a problem under both Democratic and Republican administrations\nUm they have allowed a number of enormous monopolies to form now I should say that I'm In the late nineties the FCC did investigate Sinclair for this\nAs sort of fraudulent divest deter strategy they ended up finding that Sinclair had violated some of these rules and they were not making good faith truly independent divested yours and um they find the company race herself forty thousand dollars which is really not a lot of money to a large corporation like Sinclair\nA word here in defense of the Federal Communications commission or Sinclair has wanted to buy Tribune Media for a while they had a deal and just recent well a number of months ago but recently in relative terms a determined the FCC ... pi set in essence I'm not going to let that happen\nThe Tribune merger was sort of a fascinating little window into the business in regulatory environment that has sprung up under President Trump there was this real sense that the merger would just get waved through because Trump is a big supporter of Mr Smith end up Sinclair and he was tweeting positive statements about the company\nAnd several weeks ago I G pie announced while we're not going to approve this deal we have major concerns in effectively killed the deal referred it to a legal hearing within the FCC which sort of doing that\nBut what we've learned since then has Sinclair was basically behaving in such a way that it was a foregone conclusion they did not even make minimal effort to appease their regulators and get their deal approved\nAnd they had had such success for such a long period of time that they figure the odds were in their favor\nThe trick had worked in the past and the number of regulatory experts I spoke with said well it's sort of one thing to try and pull off that trick with the champagne messengers when you're a much smaller company but once you are the largest company in the country and you are about to become even larger", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Marketplace", "city":
