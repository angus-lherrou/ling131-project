building in a mostly warehouse looking district\nGood morning it's nice to have you here is a\nSchool to bigger best Jeanie Buss she's the reason we were there she's the president and CEO of the Los Angeles Lakers\nThis is the UCLA Health training center the Lakers training facility\nIs a nice nice building as but fits a sports franchise worth more than three billion dollars but the Lakers are more than just a basketball team right there a global brand and one of the great teams in NBA history although not recently and not really the season yet but more about that in a minute\nFundamentally the Lakers are and this was a ... a longtime owner of the team Jerry Buss would have wanted it during the entertainment company with outsized influence but you've got to deliver on the court and lately as I said the Lakers having\nSo Jeanie Buss went after and she got this past offseason LeBron James the best basketball player in the world right now and she brought him to this building there's tons of natural light clean modern lines also a whole lot of purple and gold all with the business of basketball firmly in mind\nWe moved here just over a year ago we had outgrown our other training facility which is just a couple of blocks away and our entire revenue generating arm was in a building across the parking lot so we were a very divided company\nSo this was as we should are overlooking basketball courts in I mean there's like three basketball courts or whatever it is um this was a strategic investment for example\nYes yes the the architects that we ended up choosing talked about how architecture could change culture and an organization\nAnd that was you know exactly what we were looking to do back in twenty twelve we had a player by the name of Dwight Howard that played on the Lakers are ... and we were at our old facility he came up to my office\nAnd he said can I ask you something and I said sure and he goes\nWhere the people that work here and it was then I realized that it was important for them to know how we operate behind the scenes\nAnd so this building is a walkable building there is no barriers that you can make a full circle without having to divert through anything or being stopped and backtrack\n... runoff and books are\nOkay or they'll follow me ... this way\nAnd as you noted as we have I think six or seven conference rooms or this one is called twenty Patton you the address on the front there for her for the for the last year in France and yeah I don't know each one of the ones that are surfacing that that's that's what I'd like to know that for a million dollar question\nWhen the Lakers are in town is a busy around here I'm going to break that it's only nine o'clock in the morning it was\nUm it yes when the Lakers are here this would be when they would normally practice oh brave here in our um\nGee league a coaching staff as they get ready for ... yeah the south bay Lakers is our team um that we use to develop our draft picks you know bringing free agents that weren't drafted\nI'll take you in here to the war room because morning ah this is like where the draft is how\nYou know ... or one two three four at least four or five like Ninety edge television screens which are shows us the ... of course I'm with this phone you can or the best guess as I said you regret\nThe way that the the building is designed is the the the basketball courts are at the center of the building and ... you know when you hear the basketball's it's kind of like the heartbeat of the building and um so now we're walking as if oh so there you go you know we are one of the players\nSo we'd rooms and different rooms right of course are over there the beautiful weight rooms and joke so this is a big boom you're supposed to start asking questions but I'm going to cause it's like this is the heart of the players right this is where the rubber meets the road um so what keeps you up at night but what's your worst [laughter]\nMy ... my the thing that keeps me up right now is that the the greatest player in the NBA LeBron James decided to come join us and and be part of what we're building and\nWe've missed the class every year for five years so this is not what the brand was meant to be and that's what what are fans deserve to be back to what they're used to in in terms of Lakers basketball\nHaving the best player has brought us back it's it's it's elevated the brand now we just need to do that on there\nI I don't necessarily expect you to answer this question but it kind of have to ask her view in la brown and will quote in your coaching and Magic Johnson drug for basketball and then you know ... and the other best for grits are you guys have the conversation on yourself about look this isn't going to be
