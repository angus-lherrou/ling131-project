scheduling demos learned more than ... dot com [noise]\nFrom the studios at Colorado Public radio in Denver today I'm Amy Scott in for Congress do It's Tuesday October seconds good to have you with us\nBefore we get to the Amazon news of the day it's worth going back to last month and a bill introduced in Congress by Senator Bernie Sanders he called it the stop bad employers by zeroing out subsidies act also known as the stop bays those act\nAs an Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos the bill would tax big companies whose employees rely on federal benefits like food stamps Medicaid or subsidized housing which is reportedly true in some states of Amazon\nThe idea is to encourage those employers to pay higher wages well Amazon announced today that as of November first it's raising minimum wage for us employees to Fifteen dollars an hour we got Abigail Wozniak on the phone to talk about all this she's a professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame welcome to the program\nThanks for having me trying to understand the impact of this though the minimum wage in Seattle where a lot of Amazon employees live is already more than Fifteen dollars an hour\n... kind of employee do you think this is going to have the biggest impact on\nSo Amazon apparently has argued that a lot of their full time warehouse workers are fulfillment center workers are already making on average over Fifteen dollars an hour so you're right that they already have quite a large swath of their workforce who would not be affected by that\nThey specifically mentioned part-time temporary workers ah they almost certainly will see some changes there those tend to be lower paid positions than a full time positions and they should also apply to whole foods cashiers\nAnd average wages for cashiers in general in the whole United States was about uh about ten dollars and sixty cents so for those folks this is likely you a raise but it's very unlikely that this is touching a large set of their core fulfillment center workers Amazon and its\nAnnouncement also said it's going to lobby Congress to raise the federal minimum wage which is just seven twenty five an hour but even without the federal wage increasing this likely puts pressure on their competitors to do the same right I mean Wal Mart only recently raised its minimum wage to eleven dollars an hour\nThat's still a quite a bit less than Fifteen does this sort of speed up the the movement in that\nDirection really I think a skilled warehouse worker is already earning more than a cashier um so that's kind of wanting to keep in mind is that Amazon is not quite in probably exactly the same labor market as Wal Mart is by the same token a lot of other firms are already\nAnnouncing these types of bigger wage increases so for example it's hard to do so I didn't want it to get to Fifteen by twenty twenty and Costco right in saying fourteen so I think Amazon is in some ways just keeping pace with that\nThere are lots of places where Amazon has employees that have lower minimum wages for example Texas what kind of impact you think this will have on communities where suddenly a lot of people are making more money certainly\nThere are places where this raise we'll have more buying power for the employees who are affected that in general should be a good thing for those local economies\nIt also does put some more pressure though on firms that might not be at a point where they are ready to pay wages that are quite that high so I think definitely watching for effects on smaller businesses\nOn their ability to recruit and retain workers and those kind of local market would be an important thing to follow up after this announcement we're\nGoing to look at how far Fifteen dollars an hour really goes for an average worker but what kind of impact do you think this could have on the larger economy\nAmazon has what two hundred fifty thousand employees plus another hundred thousand seasonal workers as you've said a lot of them are already making at least Fifteen but if you were of those employees are relying on public assistance they have more money to spend\nI mean do you see a macro effect from not just Amazon but this larger trends\nWhen pay expands for workers we have more in kind of a total wage bill that can cycle back through the economy\nThat's good in general for growth um we also going to want to keep in mind what's happening with inflation if wages go up generally that's great but we have been experiencing some optics and inflation and want to kind of keep an eye on the real purchasing power of these raises for workers\nAbigail Wozniak teaches economics at Notre Dame thanks so much Thanksgiving\nAs the professor and I were discussing Amazon isn't the only retailer raising wages and more could follow suit meanwhile more cities and states are raising their minimum pay closer to what worker advocates call a living wage\nSo what's it like to live on Fifteen dollars an hour marketplaces Renata Sago talked to some of the people who would know best Alex\n... is twenty two years old and words to part time jobs in Florida he makes sixteen dollars an hour as a community organizer and nine fifty at a fast food chain he says he's able to pay his bills and bus fare but earning Fifteen dollars an hour full time with health benefits would help\nWhat I'll just leave your job miles but actually like fuck you ever go more alert show much\nSharon ... Peterson is forty two years old and lives in Utah\nShe's made Fifteen dollars in the past working odd jobs and said she was able to manage as a single woman now that she lives with her husband and his raising two kids she relies on renting out rooms in her home and her parents chip and money\nIf we had bought this house when we did we wouldn't be able to survive on five dollars an hour there's no way\nBack in Florida Alexander Saunders who works at a community center received a raise last month after a few years of making a little over Fifteen dollars an hour the twenty eight year old credits that wage with him being able to pay off his debts\nI actually just paid off last year at Harlem\nBut he says he wouldn't have been able to do that if he hadn't been living with three roommates\nSplitting rent some was um an enormous show\nWhile city like New York Los Angeles in Seattle are mandating Fifteen dollar an hour wages the fiber Fifteen as it's known continues and now Amazon employees across the country will get to see how far the Fifteen dollar wage will take them I'm not a say go for marketplace\nWe have another slice of the Amazon story on line today and explainer on monopoly sunny dry saying that five times fast and why the term might relate to Amazon on Wall street retailers paying a price for the promise of higher wages we'll have details when we do the numbers [noise]\n\nThe new NAFTA or as it's officially now the U.S Mexico Canada agreements reached over the weekend is already raising some complaints from North of the border Canadians are worried their drug prices will go up\nThat is because one piece of the deal gives years of extended patents protection that is monopoly protection too high end expensive drugs known as biologics that means the trade deal could delay the time it takes for cheaper generic to get to market from Washington marketplaces Scott tongue reports biologic\nDrugs are complex medicines made in living cells because your immuno suppressive anti inflammatory perspective and very pricey this trade deal would give biologic makers ten years of patent protection Canada and Mexico which is longer than they enjoy now Brian ... action\nFor trade representative pharmaceutical makers and others\nNot entirely what's in the United states but I think this is a real when\nA when because it would fend off

years law professor ... is with Santa Clara university\nLet's say a president comes into power that wants to really reduce drug prices and do it by reducing the number of years and she would also have to potentially break NAFTA\nWhich has been re branded but you know\nWell the fact that we've got to deal with Canada and I know that this ten years makes it harder for us to make that change\nDrug makers say they need that long to develop biological in Washington I'm Scott Tong for marketplace [noise]\n\nSo I think this trip which is largely being kept a very funny especially in things that she wants to do up in completely shattered by the baggage that the Trump Administration has\nSo at the what you're saying is Trump's actual policies are zeroing out the soft power that the first lady brings to the table\nYeah I mean she used to being sent to you know leverage the goodwill and the positive vibe associated with some ladies especially when it comes to issues such a sufficient tourism education which we knew that Michelle Obama and Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton all worked on\nBut then again if I ... back home in the U.S is actually contradicting some of these efforts or not actively working to support some of these initiatives that I think it's definitely not very helpful\nIn seeking to make this visit a successful\nI'd be how have other first ladies generally been treated on diplomatic visit to African nations this goes back to pat Nixon went by herself to visit a number of countries in Africa\n[noise] yeah I was literally look you've got photos yesterday Laura Bush for instance made five trips to the continent to support President Bush's health initiative for aids and if you look at for instance Hillary Clinton and Chelsea the\nKind of welcoming that they received for his ... and yet in South Africa it was almost like receiving rock stars right and let's not even mentioned Michelle Obama when they would do to to South Africa and Morocco she's very much love across the country and especially if\nA black lady of the United states\nSo um it's gonna be a bit different as we've already seen with millennia trumping God I never actually so far as just like last a few people cat and shoot people are excited about have is it if you've seen the photos\nThat badly people on the street no way being no homemade signs I mean at the end of the day nobody has
