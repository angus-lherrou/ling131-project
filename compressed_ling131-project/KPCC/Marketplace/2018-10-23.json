day before the second of October get is always to have you along everybody\nYou know of all the topics that economic Washington deals with\nAt a policy level few of them bring with them more willing and gnashing of teeth then these two seemingly simple words currency manipulation the subject comes up every six months Treasury Department is required to put out a report listing those economies that are manipulating their currencies to gain competitive advantage but really here\nWe are talking about one economy right China and as we told you last week the Treasury Department did not repeat not\nSay Beijing is manipulating its currency\nBut that did not end the wailing and the national over the weekend treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said he might actually consider changing the rules the department uses to decide whether countries are playing fast and loose with the foreign exchange markets so we asked marketplaces Tracey Samuelson why all the for X held up\nAs far as current global economic issues go currency manipulation super high unless\nThis is not something that very many countries have done historically and not something many countries are doing today\nDavid Feinberg is professor of international political economy at Johns Hopkins but if you worried as the president does that other countries somewhere to us than we do to get them then you worry about the ways that exchange rates can make those foreign goods even more appealing Matthew Goodman is with the center for Strategic and International Studies\nThere is a close relationship between currency and trade policies\nThing is that China isn't currently devaluing its currency for competitive advantage\nThey don't you know clearly needs to test of manipulation at the moment\nAnd anyway the label just doesn't pack that much punch they'll ... at the University of Maryland\nIt's kind of a strange tool because if we deemed China to be a currency manipulator the result of that is and we have to have talks with China about it but of course we're talking with them already\nThen there's the politics there ... there is with the American Enterprise Institute\nRemember the president said he would call China a currency manipulator on day one we've now gone through four rounds of reports where they haven't called him a currency manipulator and you know their reasons for that but that's not what he campaigned on\nWhich could put him on the defensive on the next campaign trail I'm Tracey Samuelson for marketplace\nA detour now to personal finance and that all important credit score that can weigh heavily on people's economic wellbeing psycho what'd you short for fair Isaac corporation in case you didn't know it Richard credit history and gives you said score\nBut nobody said this morning it's coming up with a new number new product if you will something called ultra psycho for people who don't have much of a credit history to begin with or who maybe didn't have the greatest credit in the past marketplaces debris British or it has more now on who stands\nTo gain from that if you don't have a credit history it's kind of hard to get a credit score like it's hard to get a grade class if you've never taken any of the test so what if I could always doing instead with ultra psycho is looking at other information besides your credit history to figure out how credit worthy you are\nThat includes not having a history of negative savings and trains acting response\nSally Taylor is scores vice president if I go she says you have to volunteer this information willingly it's not automatic there are fifty three million people in the U.S who don't have a credit score students are immigrants for example\nIt's cooler will tap into another ten to Fifteen million we estimate that fifty three\nThat's of course millions more people for lenders to lend to and for if I go to score Taylor also says this will raise the credit scores for some people jak Gillis is executive director of the consumer federation of America\nThe folks that will benefit the most from this are those folks who have marginal credit scores or who don't really have much credit\nBetter scores can save people money they affect your insurance your car loan your mortgage now the question for any new type of credit squared though is is it accurate Jonathan glow he is a principal a consulting firm ...\nSo it's very easy to create credit scores when the economy is going well in default or very low where the world is going to hit the road is really when we hit the next rough patch\nThe next recession is when you find out which loans should not have been made in New York I'm Rebecca shore for marketplace and that always the\nWay on Wall street today that name is volatility will have the details when we do the

two weeks or anything like the past couple of months who boys a lot of political money going to be spent the center for Responsive Politics figures five billion dollars from all sources is going to wind up being spent on the two thousand Eighteen congressional elections a lot of it coming from\nWell shall we say the upper end of the income distribution marketplaces Justin ... has that one one\nOf the reasons there's so much money flowing into these midterm elections is because billionaires alleging more of their cash on politicians\nThis is something that sort of arose out of their normal sports has been made over the last few decades\nThat stand for political scientist Adam Monica he found that the total wealth the Forbes four hundred jumped eleven to fold since Nineteen eighty two and the amount will be people spend on politics has gone up in proportion historically he says\nPretty clear that there was a lot more money coming from very well the conservatives\nLike casino mogul Sheldon Adelson he's or thirty four billion dollars and he's a staunch supporter of Republicans in pro Israel issues after giving Donald Trump twenty five million for his election eat as much from the front row as the president celebrated the opening of an embassy in Jerusalem\nThis year it'll send and his wife and pony up eighty seven million dollars to conservative groups and candidates but lately Monica says many billionaires are leaning another way in\nOvertime it's been trending pretty clearly towards more money going to the darkest\nConservative candidates have earned more billionaire donations the data from the center for Responsive Politics show Democrats are catching up\nBut like I said that's because a lot of newer billionaires come from more liberal places like Silicon Valley Dustin Moskowitz the billionaire cofounder of Facebook gave over five million the groups like move on dot org and a group dedicated to winning Senate races others say the polarized political climate over the last two years has led more people in general to contribute\nThey feel this is an emotional need for people to engage\nThat's ... next Gen America that's the political

causes an east coast billionaires are spending a lot to Boston based hedge fund manager sets Carmen recently announced you donate twenty million to help elect Democrats after years of supporting GOP\nFormer New York city Mayor Michael Bloomberg pledged a hundred million to help elect Democrats that could prove useful as Bloomberg eyes a democratic presidential bed and twenty twenty\nContributions Bloomberg's a pretty easy to track but then there's what's known as dark money\nThat we're seeing the spending side that we don't necessarily know who is actually behind it and a lot of the cases\nAnd I'm a silly research is dark money at the center for Responsive Politics a huge chunk of the spending goes the advertising and depending on what the ads say she says their funders don't always have to be disclosed\nThat makes it hard to tell whether it's a billionaire spending or a corporation or anyone else\nShe says Democrats are collecting more dark money from donors in recent years perhaps to avoid the stigma associated with big money in politics but she says high profile billionaires tend to operate in the open\nAs they get more ... than their groups at least get more disclosure whether that be I think he had had a puzzle or their reaction to that being that they do start disclosing that more\nAfter all it doesn't hurt if the politicians who helped elect
