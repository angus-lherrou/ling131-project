going to sound a little cynical and I suppose in a way it is but that doesn't make it not true kids and I'm Talking really young kids who are or a market there are a market that can be catered to the content can be created for and from which profit can be made\nThe corporate example at hand is YouTube and its influence on the youngest of consumers Alexis Madrigal is a staff writer for the Atlantic his most recent piece is called raised it by ...\nBook on the program thanks for having show talked to me about how you came to work on this story\nI I have a two year old and a five year old that scene\nToddler YouTube and I was like what are all of these things all these brands I've never heard of these companies all over the world and I watch my daughter becoming totally absorbed in this kind of animation that to me looks kind of pre Pixar you know what I mean\nOh okay you're lots to unpack in there because the idea first of all of a toddler you to what what is that is it as it sounds\nSo Derrick channels on YouTube that are built specifically for you know one year old ... year old three year olds and that's what I call type of YouTube and it's this kind of\nWild place well I I almost don't even know what to say uh the premise here is that is that really young kids in this economy have tablets and phones and they're on them almost as much as adults it kind of see\nThat YouTube is by far the most popular brand among children and even little children have their own favorites to one of the biggest brands within the space has called to chew TV\nYou know they have Nineteen billion views they have twenty nine million subscribers this is a global children's entertainment for kids love it they can't get enough they watch them over and over and over and over\nAll right so maybe I'm being naive here but I'm a you know back with the the analogy you make in this piece is to PBS in public broadcasting in Sesame Street and children's television workshop from like fifty years ago now in in the American economy\nAnd the ostensible reason for all that was to educate not necessarily one or two year olds but\nYou know slightly older toddlers and and give them a leg up is that\nThe mission of of toddler YouTube and into two TVs that what they're doing\nYou know I think right now they're in a transitional place they bent entertainment they've been just trying to capture as much children's attention as they possibly can and now they realized that they've done that\nAnd they need to deliver them something better and so what I'm hoping is that this global phenomenon of all these video producer on YouTube will have a similar revelation and do similar work to create YouTube it's good for\nIt's rather than just something that sucks up their time well so spit bullet for me do you think that's going to work because you know not to make the American analogy on everything here but there were researchers and educators and\nAnd government regulators in some sense talking to the folks who are doing children's television workshop is there a sense that there's that infrastructure beneath what toddler YouTube's do not really on the other hand they can benefit from you know fifty years of research on children's television but the media environment the media business there's obviously a much different\nAnd the biggest differences there's just YouTube basically says dishes where kids are going\nThis is where the whole businesses and so YouTube itself would have to be the one that sort of maybe tip the scales for educational content within the algorithms that determine what people watch what do we know what do we think uh it's actually doing as a kid setting aside from it or whatever educational benefit they might have we know what being attached to our phones and our screens does to grownups\nWhat about the kids young kids well I think you know the the worst possible impact\nIs that essentially that kind of attention grabbing fast paced content and the ability to switch between those things very quickly maybe sending kids up to back to kind of pacing that's actually not educational and that's kind of the big worry that we sort of in juice kind of attention a loss in kids\nAlexis ... writes for the Atlantic his most recent piece is called raised by you too fast and it was just excellent really pushing [noise]\n\n\nComing up
