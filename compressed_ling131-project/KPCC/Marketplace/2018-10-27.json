{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Science fest interest let's make a plan dot org [noise]\nIn Los Angeles on John result buddy twenty six they lost over there was always have your long everybody\nThe number of the day this Friday is three and a half percent that's how much the economy grew in the summer quarter July through September ...\nBecause you knew there was going to be a bunch of numbers are nothing without context which is a why we're here but it's also be when you'll Richardson from Edward Jones in general from the Washington Post our in our studios in New York City everybody\nHi chi chi chi so let me start with you\nAnd and uh in the process of asking this question I'm going to point out that we're going to be hearing from a Tracey Samuelson in about six minutes or so on some of the details of uh the GDP report as it deals with trade but a very quick\nPass on his GDP report it is a good number\nYeah the headline number is good there are some underlying parts of it that are a little bit troubling including the fact that business investment I had had slowed you know there is this risk that\nThe boost to a capital expenditure as was pretty front loaded this year as a result of the time ... and we're seeing a slow down and so that is a little bit troubling but generally the headlight number was good consumers seem happy\nNew and it occurs me actually just thinking back to how I open the show that I should have said there is that there are three fourths right economic growth the trade war and also the tax cuts because there was a tension there between the trade one of the tax cuts in the stimulus and the and the un stimulus if you will of what's going on\nLet's boil it down to two things uh one is higher interest rates which the stimulus feeds into and stronger growth and right now\nFor a short period of time maybe we are at an economic sweet spot for the economy can still grow but inflation is still very moderate in fact below the Fed's target rate of two percent in this latest GDP read\nAnd so right now um things are looking good economically speaking in its good as Katherine said because the consumer is good\nI I hear some trepidation do in your voice mail\nYou know there's no such thing as a perfect the economy and part of the reason that markets were worried this week and we saw that in the stock market this week is there there were these three ... concerns slower global growth higher interest rates\nAnd ... concerns those are going to stay with us until they're resolved and said you'll see the push pull in the market between really strong fundamentals and I'm very worried outlook for ... investors ahead\nOkay Katherine not to point out the president's ah economic inconsistencies but it bears among leaving them out well well uh\nSo so here's the thing just on the street and terrorists and he he came out this week in in a tweet at some point Monday Tuesday and said we're going to billions of dollars into the United states because of all these jobs not mentioning the consumer is going to pay those towers but then he turns around in an interview with Wall Street journal and says tariffs we don't have any terms on this economy I don't I don't understand I guess is what I'm saying\nWell and in that very same Wall Street journal article he also talked about how useful the terrorists had been so like basically in the same breath a you know on the one hand he's saying we have these tariffs on the other hand he signed the tears don't exist it can make your head spin a little bit and you can understand why it has been so difficult for some of our trading partners potentially to negotiate with\nThe people who have been dispatched to negotiate on behalf of the United states\nIf they don't really know what the president wants the president is inconsistent about not only what he wants but actually what he's already been doing then that can be that can make it very difficult to make any sort of progress and you know I when I've talked with\nA business groups when I talked with business owners they have expressed a lot of concern about the the uncertainty that comes from the fact\nThat Trump does not seem to have a particularly sophisticated understanding of international trade or clear goals for that matter about what he's trying to get out of these negotiations\nMeal and other on him from the wall Street Journal interview and and uh one has to say it's a goal right is to put pressure on the Federal Reserve he once again called the fed a chaired by Jay Powell ah his biggest uh economic problem\nI'm even as a German pal told me back in June even as the fed doesn't pay any attention with President says one does wonder if\nNow with some signs perhaps the economy might not be a all that it will be for too much longer um and the fed might be thinking about rage what does this kind of pressure you suppose due to the ...\nWell you know it makes a hard job even that much harder right so what that is really concerned about is how to keep the economic\nBull market running how to keep economic growth and and step one still normalizing policy because women as\nAnd we know that it will be a land eventually the next recession hits he wants to make sure that he has to look at is this fully ready to to stop\nA the slowdown is possible and that means raising short term interest rates it's a very effective tool the fed has been using it for years and they want to make sure that tools ready for the next recession\nAnd they want to do so in in a context of economic growth and so that's what's happening here very moderate increase in short term interest rates from zero right so\nAlong that path any political ... political ... of a very moderate increase in rates makes the heart his job all the more tricky and that's what I'm has to be negotiated going for a port\nNeal Richardson a at the end we're Jones Catherine Rampell the Washington Post on a friday I'm In New York city don't you\nThink ... thanks guys\nHave a nice weekend on Wall street today down day that ended up and down weak and let me say one more time I think like the fourth on this week I've said this this is normal this is what's supposed to happen markets go up they go down but it has been a while since things have felt this chopping run will ever details when we do the numbers [noise]\n\n\nUm\nIn part\nBack we're going to go to the GDP report from this morning because you know a list economic indicator and all\nThat is Catherine and you'll and I were saying it's pretty good number credit where credit's due to dig a little deeper as we're want to do around here and you can start to separate what is boosting economic growth consumer spending for instance from what is not helping rose all that much at all one of those drugs last quarter was trade marketplaces Tracey Samuelson explains what's going on there\nSo how much faster with the economy have grown without this drag from trade\nYou would have seen a much larger growth rate probably closer to over five percent\nAt the end of you know is chief us economist at ... global\nWhat you saw was exports down pretty sharply imports were up pretty sharply\nTogether that she nearly two percentage points off of GDP Growth\nBut he says imports were driven by a strong dollar which is making foreign products a good deal plus she says companies were replenishing their inventories filling up their shelves head of the holidays they may also be trying to get ahead of tariffs on Chinese imports that are set to jump from ten percent to twenty five percent in the new year\nBetter cars than now and have it ready to to sell rather than having to purchase more that cost more down the road\nThis macro economic data matches what we've been hearing from public companies as they report their quarterly earnings Matt McDonald is a partner with Hamilton place strategies which analyzed transcripts from recent corporate earnings calls\nThe trade discussion has edged out ... for the first time and when they're talking about trade there almost all talking about tariffs\nFor example Ford has estimated the Trump administration's trade policy will cost the company a billion dollars this year in part due to higher steel prices and tariffs on imports from China\nThat does feel like from both the way companies are talking about it and from what we see in the GDP numbers that the impact of starting to bite\nAt least at the country and company level consumers just aren't feeling it yet a majority responding to a recent marketplace Edison research poll fifty to present the terrorists have no impact on them personally I'm Tracey Samuelson for marketplace\nWe've gotten some insights into the
