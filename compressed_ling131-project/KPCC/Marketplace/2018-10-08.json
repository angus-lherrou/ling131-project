{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Him one question do you remember the photo of the ...\nIt was that I kind of photo that ran on the cover of life magazine and also ran on the front page of the LA Times and it was a long time ago and I said of course I remember the photo everybody remembers that because I was only a few years younger than won\nWhen Bobby kennedy was assassinated and and I remember looking at a teenager you know squatting Kennedy side trying to help him and I thought my goodness he's not much older than I Am so I set out to try to find one and I found them living in San jose\nAnd I did the first story about one in Ninety eight\nSo take us back to June fifth Ninety sixty and remind us why one Romero was right next to Robert Kennedy when he was shot\nHe grew up in Mexico and the family moved to Los Angeles one one was about ten won recalled back in Mexico being an homes where there'd be two photos on the law one of one of JFK\nYou know as a teenager after moving to Los Angeles\nWas really young to be politicized but he did\nFeel kind of marginalized as a Mexican immigrant what do you remember of the counties was that they spoke of Mexican people as hard working God fearing family oriented so we have to respect for JFK and um he found out that Bobby kennedy who was turning California the Democratic primary that you're running for president of the United states\nSomeone had gotten a job as a busboy bass in her hotel and when he heard but Kennedy was staying at the hotel and went to the other bus boys and he said I really wanted to meet this guy and if there's a call from Kennedy's room I'll do anything all bus or train for a month I just want to be the sky\nSo the call comes in and uh one\nThat was another bus boy and I go up and he said the Kennedy was in the room to the door was in the room was on the phone and kind of distract them one thought while I get to see 'em but that's going to be about it and then Kennedy gets off the phone goes up looks them in the eye\nAnd shakes his ... once said it was a two handed shake and he remembers the blue eyes of Kennedy and he said it was the first time he felt like an American the first time you call it like a man and he said he walked out of their room feeling ten feet tall so the next night\nI'll be community wins the primary he makes a speech and the Ambassador Hotel auditorium when he was making an exit through the pantry area and one was on duty\nAnd wanted to push through the crowd if Kennedy remembered him reach out and congratulated him so he grabs communities him and here's the shocks\nAnd next thing you know it was Kennedy's flat on his back and one didn't know they were shocked he thought it was maybe somebody had firecrackers and it was a prank but one quick his right hand under communities\nIn the back of a hat tries to let them in the blood on his hands and then he realized he was on my goodness and one was carrying Rosemarie being with them to use as you had them in his pocket and he pulled them out and he said he shoved them into Kennedy's hand and uh he was taken away was rep Margolies\nOf course the Robert Kennedy died um one Romero only Seventeen years old at the time incredible what happened to one Romero after that what kind of life did he live\nOne was haunted so much so that you have to get out of LA guests would come to stay up in Boston are and they were asked to see the bus or a bus or\nThey wanted to have their photos taken with whom he got some letters and he said most of the people who wrote them are contacting her more you did a good thing but he got some negative stuff to have people saying holy you hadn't reached out to say 'cause he didn't cause to shake your hand maybe you wouldn't have been shot\nAnd other people saying why couldn't you do something couldn't get between Kennedy and the shooter and one is Seventeen year old equipment dealer he quit his job he moved all the way to Wyoming and miss California and came back but not to LA to northern California the San jose and eventually you know started his family\nAnd became a construction worker paving and I think the one one left Carmen one left a really difficult like and I think he was always on the run he wanted to both honor and remember the moment\nAnd what he took to the Kennedy legacy of compassion and tolerance and at the same time thinking about it back to the most horrible moment in his life I Need to know how to express themselves\nAnd they kind of disappeared and he didn't talk to the media for years you didn't do much of anything except work his tail\nIt was only in recent years that he began to\nIt began to snap out of it a little bit he began to listen to people who are telling him you did nothing wrong\nYou have a relationship on Facebook with a woman from Germany who reached out to him when I wrote one of my columns and so you don't need to be so trouble you didn't do anything wrong and when I see that photo of news squatting accounting side\nI see somebody who was a brave young men who wanted to help someone in need while other people retreated and one began to see it that way and in his last year as I think\nHad a little bit of relief he was still kind of a search her he was always looking for something some ... some explanation as to why he was in that moment at that time and to figure out what he needed to do with it\nYeah it is unexplainable isn't it as you said you'd catch up with one Romero from time to time and one time you went with him to Arlington National cemetery to visit Robert Kennedy's grave tell me about that what was that like\nOne that talked for years about wanting to pay his respects\nYou wanted to go to community was gray and um I was in Washington at the hotel with you on the night before he was going to go to the cemetery he was with a long time good buddy of has a retired TV newsman guy by the name of ... and we were talking\nAbout this visited one was saying that he wanted to apologize here talk like that for a long time in Rico and I said you have nothing to apologize for\nAnd he said I just I just want to tell him up you know I miss him and that I Wish I could have found a way to stop the bullets so the next morning\nWe uh we go and wanted wearing suit who's got the square\nAnd we walk across the cemetery won one at a moment to himself when unity and he walked over on the milk down your truck and he wept and he later told me that you just talk to you know what he was sorry\nAnd then they would never forget her I mean we could have done more\nThan just incredible to sort of some people live with their entire lives that was the LA Times reporter Steve Lopez remembering one Romero the busboy in Nineteen sixty eight

at four on eighty nine point three gay BCC\nThis is marketplace I'm ... in the wake of security breaches and then hearings on Capitol Hill and the more security breaches Facebook made an interesting announcement today a couple of new devices essentially\nVideo chat platforms one called the portal a bigger one called the portal plus in the big draw here is a camera that gets coupled with AI that can follow you as you shut which depending on how you look at it or how it looks at you I suppose is either really cool or really creepy\nMolly what is the host marketplace ... or go to on questions like this same only\nGuy show who wants this do you think they thinking about\nI mean in a world where Facebook does not have the trust crisis that it has this is really smart I mean this is a device that lets people have these really direct personal connections are\nThey in fact more private than posting on Facebook you could imagine if you were part of a Facebook group like a book group right or a little family groups\nThat you could have a really nice video chat together uh and then you have so many connections on Facebook that the idea to be able to easily connect with them and do this video chat would be great we're still waiting for this in some ways\nI'm actually and this is surprising it has a little more built in privacy then let's say an Amazon Echo you can turn off it off the camera and microphone Facebook says this totally ... cuts that connection to the mother ship and it's worth noting\nBloomberg pointed out that when Amazon announced over Seventy new devices and services last month it didn't mention privacy once\nOkay yes and point taking that however comma this is Facebook and we are in a world where Facebook has the trust crisis that it has right\nI have been operating a very informal survey on ironically Facebook I'm trying to go out um\nNinety eight percent of respondents would not buy this and we're like fifty fifty for Google Home [laughter] and uh and Amazon Echo [noise] it's a really surprising announcement to make for example right after a hack right after announcing that fifty million accounts right optimized\nAnd a few Research Center survey from before that hack news said Seventy four percent of people were reducing their use or deleting the baseball cap or changing their privacy settings I mean you have to trust a company a lot before you let it put a camera in your house\nAnd it's a very confident assertion by Facebook I think that that maybe people are worried about their privacy at all\n... which may well be the case right as we have talked about let me ask you a different but related question it's kind of business model and it goes like this hardware is not Facebook's core competency\nYeah I mean separate from all of that I think it is very interesting that Facebook wants to get into the hardware business it is tricky there are low margins and it's hard to get right\nYou add a whole customer service layer that didn't exist before you know Google and Amazon both worked for years to get consumer hardware right Google arguably has not yet\nIs only just starting to figure it out because of dedicated an entire division to it\nYour Google Glass anybody right I mean that's where you know it's hard hard where it's hard truth of alright Mali which is always the marketplace ... thanks guy ...\n... or ... or ...\nOr are we are going to do a better labor market stories in the bottom half of the program today one of your one from overseas both on the common theme of the completely foreseeable perils of historically low unemployment\nIn this country as we learn on front of the jobless rate is three point seven percent the lowest in almost fifty years employers are having a tough time finding people and that includes the federal government the Census Bureau says it needs to hire hundreds of thousands of temporary workers for the twenty twenty cents is what you're going to be your for you know it\nAnd it's not going to be as easy making those hires as it was last time around from W we as a in Pittsburgh marketplaces are comparisons that one\nTen years ago David Michael Moore had just gotten laid off from a decades long job as a newspaper reporter in San Antonio Texas\nUnemployment was high and there were many he spotted a sign at his unemployment office and along with nearly four million other Americans applied for a job as a temp work or around that time of the twenty ten cents is\nThere was the work that many\nTen years later the senses is reaching out again for field workers and others to help gather information but it may be hard because the economy is in much better shape than national unemployment rate has been low and fewer people are out of work the census is already
