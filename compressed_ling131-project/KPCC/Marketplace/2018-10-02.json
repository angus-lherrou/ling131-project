{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "In DC I'm Lizzie O'Leary in for ... it is Monday the first of October good as always to have you with us\nAnd we start today with NAFTA or rather the deal to replace it last night after about a year of trade negotiations the U.S Mexico and Canada finally reach the United states Mexico Canada agreement or us MCA\nAnd this we will have a result of much more happening right here in the United states it means\nMore than anything else far more American Jobs and these are high quality jobs they're also strong provisions to enforce what's called the rules of origin requirements this will incentivize billions of dollars a new purchases of us made automobiles\nAll right so you heard the president let's unpack this agreement a little bit new name and all we've got marketplaces Scott Tom Hi Scott\n... manufacturing powerhouse uh that's the president's phrase that's what he said this new trade deal is going to create in the U.S [noise] so let's talk jobs first um east is really going to create new jobs\nAt the very least it it's unclear so it looks like automobiles auto jobs around the center of the rhetoric trickle of everything and the and and we're a lot of the jobs involved are so few simple let's say you a simple cars and trucks to sell\nHere in North America you might be Toyota or GM or BMW right now sixty two and a half percent of your content\nHas to be from Mexico where the U.S or Canada that's to avoid tariffs under the current deal or else it's taxed\nSo this new deal written after two point oh whatever you have to set up to Seventy five percent of the ideas well let's make North American cars even more North American ... now here's the problem\nThe problem is the sanction ready or else that you have to do these chores or else I take away your phone right we say that in my house or the or else here is the terror of two and a half\nPercent so if you make cars and Mexico where it's cheaper and have a lot of auto makers dug their way out of the great recession\nYou might say well you know instead of messing with my supply chain in finding parts in Indiana where it's expensive and his bureaucratic I'm just going to eat the tariff of two and a half percent and since I'm non compliant anyway I might source more my parts from low cost places like China I'll just get around it\nSo that makes for more jobs in China and more jobs in Mexico\nOr let's say OK I follow the rules I have more U.S content for more U.S suppliers that's probably going to be more expensive so my costs go up my prices go up I Can't compete I might sell fewer cars and sales go down and I lay off people so several ways this could backfire as far as jobs\nWhen he talked about jobs one of the big focus this year has been high wage jobs and there isn't an Asian in this to create and protect auto jobs that pay at least sixteen dollars an hour so how does that fit into that\nSo there's still says a large percentage of each vehicle has to be made my workers who make sixteen bucks an hour or more\nSo what uh companies do when we just got pushed up sometimes yes they hire more workers who make more money\nSometimes they say you know what it's time for me to want to invest in Warsaw scored and more robot more automation to replace people and as the cost of worker goes up and the cost of automation goes down there is no guarantee that employers are going to respond the way we think they might\nWell so looking a little more broadly to take off all of the terrorists against Canada and Mexico you know not all off the table um it's a little thing what's here and what's not\nYet so right now we do have tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum those are those are announced those are in place in the justification is because of national security so Canadian steel Mexican steel still subject to that and it's more it's very complicated but there could be similar tariffs on automobiles\nComing as well we're waiting for the Trump Administration on that that's on a separate track but for right now yeah steel tariffs are still in place in North America\nAnd filing interesting here in D.C today what are the chances that song get approved by Congress\nWell good luck Lucy predicting down a vote on this would come next year after the midterms when there is a good chance that Democrats could very well take the house rights and historically Democrats have been more anti trade deal that this deal is more complex and might have pieces that Democrats could support but whether they're going to give the president a victory that's a different question\nMarketplaces ... thank you very much You're welcome NAFTA has had a long history questioned for yet who was the first president to talk about that idea we've got a video with the answer just go to market place dot O. R. G. and click on a little tab that ... mentioned on air\nNow we're going to stay with trade and the U.S M. C. A.\nThe White House says the agreement is a quote weaned for American farmers ranchers and agribusiness well someone in that category is Patrick Smith he runs lost his ranch is in ... Washington they grow apples and also hops yeah for beer\nWashington state is a big producer on both those crops and Mexico and Canada are big buyers\nWe've had Patrick on before to talk about all this so welcome back\nThings will be glad to be here\nAll right so based on what you know so far hum how does this do you look\nI'm so far I think there's a lot for farmers to be excited about in this deal farmers of course to deal with a lot of uncertainty already and so taking away some of the uncertainty regarding a couple of our most important trading partners is welcome news for most of us\nDo do you think the people around you um are you know X hailing a little bit today\nI Do I Do I think um you know Mexico's is a very important markets for\nUs agriculture in general and in our region especially fresh apples and ah with the back and forth on trade over the last few months Mexico had established the tariffs on us apples and yeah so now Apple's in this deal has no tariffs applied to them and I think for us up here in the\nIn the central part of Washington state that's a big relief\nSo last time you were on the show you talked about apple exports slowing down do do you think that maybe this deal you know speeds up apple exports this year I had that ship friday sale\nI think we're hoping that export levels will return to where they were earlier this year you know we were having a really good movement into Mexico and the first four or five months of the year and then this summer after the terrorists were imposed\nThat movement slowed down significantly and so hopefully we do see a return to those levels from the first half of the year and we're hopeful that that will get there in short order\nWe look at this are you sitting there thinking this is just nasty again or are there differences that you see I mean how does this plan for you on the ground is at the same thing with a different name\nThat does kind of looked like that from our end right now I'm I'm sure that there are some differences for maybe some under other industries but for for us and our businesses\nUm both hops in Apple's this looks a lot like or what we've had last few years and and that's good\nYou know are you still concerned about trade in the rest of the world trade with Asia for example or has this given you enough breathing room that you get to sleep easy ...\nI think we're still hopeful that this is one step toward maybe normalizing a trading relationships with Asia with Europe\nMexico and Canada of course are two very very important markets for us but we're moving apples and hops from around the world and would like to see 'em you know more of these types of deals come a similar to the Trans Pacific partnership\nA that we've uh pulled out of but more of these types of deals would be very welcome to buy most of us and in our industries\nI ask you the first time you're on the show in twenty sixteen you were worried about having enough workers to do the work you do and harvest your crops or is that still an issue for you\nYeah absolutely is labor in our part of the country up here a farm labor is is still a somewhat scarce for us in many other employers in this region\nA were extensively using the age to a a guest worker visa program to help meet our labor needs and there are some bills that are you know somewhere in\nCongress right now that would make some positive changes to the program but a lot of those efforts of kind of stalled out over the last few months and so we're hopeful that we will see changes to the program as soon as Congress is ready to act on it\nPatrick Smith from leftist ranch is good to have you back on the show great thankfully if you ...\nThe revised trade relationship between the U.S Canada and Mexico or many trade questions in general we'd love to answer them leave us a note at marketplace dot org and there you can read more about economic winners from today's announcement on Wall street today the markets love that trade news do you do when we did the numbers [noise]\nWe have the latest chapter today in this saga that is ... and his relationship with Tesla the company he cofounded he's giving up a little bit of control over it that's the upshot of settlements the electric carmaker reached over the weekend with the securities and Exchange Commission\nThe agreement settles fraud charges the SEC brought against mosques after he tweeted in August that he had quote funding secured for a deal to take tests all private except he didn't the agreement with the SEC is aimed at reigning him in marketplaces Nancy Marshall guns or reports basically\nGoing to school with blacks and whites and Asians it's you know we had everything\nHe remembers celebrating the Vietnamese new year eating dinner at friends' houses African American families in prison he says he had to know his place as someone with Mexican roots\nBeing a Mexican prison sucks not only do you have to do your judicial sentence but you also have to deal with the peer pressures of having to fit in you come in already designated southern and Hispanics or northern Hispanics and then if you're a Mexican\nNational is by state what state you are in Mexico or what country you're from Central America\nHe says he had to conform to survive the\nActual moment that you know kind of shocked me into it was when one of the older mixing guys one of my neighbors\nWill walk into a chow and he had this you know and the bar moustache you know and it sounded like he was talking in the movies you know he had that makes me an accent\nThat stereotype you know and he says you know ... we don't talk to these Nichols you know we don't engage with them we don't do business with them and if you do you're going to get in trouble at least you're going to get beat up at ... you going to guess that\nI knew then that I was in a different world because of the consequences\nThere were also standoffs among prisoners\nWhere we had like the stair downs right where it was like get on my table type thing right and one particular incident that I remember they had just brought this new picnic table onto the yard and everybody wanted to live by the basketball court the blacks in on it and they ... and the Mexicans were like a man or not we want that table\nThey were literally willing to kill somebody for a damn table I was you know mandated to actually get involved so I couldn't actually think for myself\nThen about two years ago he was transferred to stand Clinton just across the Golden Gate bridge ... inside just pass the gates\nHey there Hi nice to meet you wise has it gone so far so good yeah [noise]\nSo we just arrived to withhold the yard\nListens to St going lower yard and the biggest thing that people that visit here looking is the fact that it's racially segregated\nIt is true hundreds of men working out hanging out split along racial and ethnic lines you see this in the cell blocks to Jesse shows me his out\nThough this is where I live with his roommate is from Mexico for let's see if it is\nThis is where you sleep like um [noise] like a big person's closet you know bunk bed and then you have a lock her in the bank right above the toilet and the thing I can actually touching on the wall and the bunker at the same time\nBut sand Clinton today is still getting more and we had the Haitian and getting prisoners from different backgrounds to play sports together worked together that was new for Jesse for Fifteen Years he'd only socialized with prisoners with Mexican heritage\nWas like a fish out of water I was uncomfortable because of the camaraderie that there was amongst races when I Would walk the yard it bothered me that blacks whites Mexicans were playing basketball together or that there are playing baseball\nOr like man these guys are on the line he didn't know who to trust one of my ah first neighbors when a guy here in West block\nHe offered me a burrito one night and I was hungry as hell and the black guy and he's offering more real and I said oh no I Can't take this hell no you know I thought it was set up right when I got back in the cell you know I started thinking wow you know I'm I'm really hungry\nAfter back out and they looked at me and he says you know\nIt's not like that here you know I started thinking about that\nHe started getting involved and found his place at a newspaper published here in the sand Clinton is one of the only person newspapers in the country\nSo this is the same way in newsrooms this is we're spend most of my time seven days a week\nIt's an old warehouse type building computers along one wall and a bit surprising a soap opera with subtitles on the TV it's\nA Korean we weren't Korean soap operas you know that's one of these things you know you guys watch Korean soap operas we do we do we watched Korean soap operas in the afternoons one of the staff members actually lived in Korea and then he was watching them one day and then I started

old I was born in east LA I've been incarcerated for Twenty one years\nJesse started working on a rail and at first there was tension\nI find it hard for him ... to accept orders from a different race especially when you're coming from other half the ... where we don't even communicate with other races\nBonner ruined Jesse are now really tight\nWhen I first met Jesse I think I was going to be that close to him no absolutely not right because Jesse you you've got to stand offers you know you don't know how to approach Jesse you know he got their start in look I guess it's um all the years that he's been incarcerated you know however um\nSince the time that I have known him that brick wall has been coming down slowly but surely and he smiles more he plays more and he even gave me a hug me All right\nJesse says he's been thinking a lot about his childhood his mix of friends back then\nYou know I went away from um from my childhood and I've kind of slid too far you know I was just like stuck\nHe has a wider group of friends now and it's take him out of his comfort zone\nBlacks Asians yeah I'm whites every Mexican whether he's north south uh by some Mexican national I've come to

American producers\nSaid the last time you were on marketplace you were scheduled to appear before Congress to talk about your application for an exclusion from the steel tariffs which was denied a how did that appearance go\nWell the the experience it was everything that you would imagine you know the the stately boardroom when hundreds of people watching you and um I think it\nIt went surprisingly well like I made my point and there were some changes made to the exemption process that accommodated\nMy concerns as well as the concerns of the three other companies that also testified alongside me my main Bush was for the exemption requests to be retroactive to the first date they're submitted not the first day that uh the Commerce Department decides to look at the request and entered into their system\nAnd that still didn't give me the exemption I'm Still working on that I'm now talking to US Customs for the correct a import code they there was a discrepancy with that so it's a it's definitely a bureaucratic process\nAnd I'm not happy or not made whole yet but I Do feel like we made significant progress by testified\nWe've been talking about the tariffs on steel and

C. C. C. [noise]\nUm\nThis is marketplace I'm Amy Scott in for kind of result after big storms like last month's Hurricane Florence recovery is not only slow but expensive some estimates put the damage at twenty to thirty billion dollars for Florence and a portion of that will go to repairing the beaches affected\nThe U. S. government spends a lot of money repairing coastal communities after big storms at least a song is a reporter for ProPublica and wrote about the high cost of beach re nourishment and how that money is divvied up welcome Lisa\nThanks for having me at least that can you tell me what beach nourishment means\nWell it's basically when the government comes in and they pump a lot of sand onto your beach\nTo a fix the damage to the beaches that have occurred to erosion or through storm damage\nAnd the reason why a federal state and local governments will fund this is that without beach nourishment some beaches in the U.S particularly on the east coast in the Gulf Coast\nAre just getting smaller every year um they're retreating and so the people who own property on the beach obviously want the beach to stay where it is and those beaches are very important to the tourism economy\nHow much does all this cost and where's the money coming from it costs a lot um so many of these\nProjects are mainly funded by the federal government particularly the Army Corps of engineers and FEMA in total cumulatively the U.S has been about nine billion dollars to rebuild beaches since Nineteen twenty three\nAnd when we looked at the north Carolina data after Hurricane Florence we found that in that state alone federal state and local governments have spent more than eight hundred and twenty eight million dollars cumulatively for those beaches\nWow and what is the argument for spending that money\nSo the local residents would argue that they need that money to keep their tourism economy going to keep their properties up\nAnd that you know people from all over the country coming enjoy these beaches so the government should help fund their economies the people who benefit the most from these projects are actually the property owners of ocean front properties\nSo these tend to be the second homes or vacation homes oftentimes they're very large a pricey mansions right along the beach they're the ones who get most of the benefit from these projects\nWhy is that who decides which beaches to protect and which to leave alone\nThat this is sort of decided on a case by case basis some communities actually find most of this work themselves through local and county taxes and so in that case the federal government isn't really involved\nBut for many communities it's the Army Corps that decides which communities get funded and the way the Army Corps makes these decisions they use that economic formula that ends up favoring more affluent communities and the reason that is\nIs that the corps tries to see which projects can they find where they'll get the most out of every dollar spent\nSo in essence it ends up favoring more affluent communities\nAnd not just affluent but predominantly white right\nYes um so the analysis we did in North Carolina we looked at about sixteen communities that have received funding for these projects and the average uh demographics in those communities but something like Ninety four percent white", "show_name": "Marketplace", "year": "2018", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "02"}
