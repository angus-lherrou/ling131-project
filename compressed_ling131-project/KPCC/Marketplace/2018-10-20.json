President Trump announced that he was going to be providing twelve billion dollars in aid to farmers that are hurt by the trade war which hopefully will help boost up a sort of his core constituents

unemployment's low we got corporate profits this week when it from the banks which are making ... billions of dollars what's not to like\nWell except for some one time charges in those tax benefits than benefit from the tax cut\nActually their balance sheets are looking pretty shabby which means that the regular business of lending to Americans who can afford to pay back those loans is not doing so hot which is an indicator that um maybe things aren't going as well as a as people are saying wage growth continues to be pretty slow\nUm and it it also indicate that probably over the next quarter if they don't have those one time charges were going to see a much ugly quarter and the stock market is probably going to react pretty badly to that Joe uh enjoy the fun while it lasts a\nOn the

the economy overall but we're definitely going into the midterms anytime we do see a surge we are going to see the president probably promote a you know promote what he's done over the past\nYear and he's urging mad at falls like a thousand other points that I mean it is yeah ugly snuff and of course Trump used to wait that if that happened to president should be fired there is a dirty bomb
