with the Chinese hard quantitative things each side can do terrorists themselves very good example of those\nTen or maybe twenty five percent import taxes on a whole list of goods shipped by each side to the other\nAlso softer were qualitative things like just not buying certain things the other country selves and for our purposes right now one of those certain things as American oil which China has basically stopped buying Rebecca Elliot covers energy for the wall Street Journal walk on the program\nThanks for having the guy this seems like a substantial drop in Chinese imports of American oil what is going on\nSo as the trade tensions between the U.S and China have escalated in recent months even though China has not impose any terrorists on us crude the U.S exports to China\nActually drop to zero in August after about three hundred and fifty thousand barrels a day of crude in the first half of the year so a very significant drop it\nAnd we're we're reasonably sure that it's all trade related right they just decide or we don't want to buy this stuff anymore we're going to get our oil elsewhere\nRight so it may be that Chinese companies are looking to limit purchases of US soil in case they trade tensions escalate further and you know let's say tests were imposed are created\nSure uh we should point out here that it's not like the global market is is a an unwelcome places for oil exporter so American crude does have somewhere to go\nYes exactly is the first week of this month actually us crude exports nearing two point six million barrels a day sit there at record highs in recent months so what we're seeing is a shift in the trade patterns so with China\nNot buying as much us crude that oil is going elsewhere in the world\nSo who is buying American oil if if the Chinese have decided that they don't want three hundred and eighty or whatever it is that was in barrels a day\nThe U.S has customers around the world oil is going to Europe it's kind of Latin America to India and elsewhere in Asia the market is shifting mhm in response to this decision on the part of Chinese companies\nRather than evaporating anyway at this point at least for the last ... years\nSo this is one of those things that it's not a a direct retaliation right it's not imposing new tariffs on American products it's the Chinese saying oh okay fine we're just not going to buy American because we don't have to\nExactly said there are other exporters they're exerting that choice as of right now it does not appear to be significantly cutting into the demand for us soil but China has a large degree by power its course\nRight right Rebecca Elliot are running on um a energy oil and gas of Wall Street journal Rebecca thanks all thank you for having me\nComing up we'll

story now that's a little bit um hunting is not a terrible word here jak Lowery as a piece in the Atlantic magazine called the gay men who have lived for years with someone waiting on their death\nThe story starts in the late Nineteen eighties in the advertising pages of the game and lifestyle magazines jak what were the problem it\nThank you for having me give me some sense of um the advertising sections of these uh ... what were they like\nI mean they were as varied as any magazine today I mean you had advertisements for alcohol advertisements for designer clothing you had advertisements for vacations cruises ... and you also had advertisements for biomedical settlements okay so now you have to tell me what by article settlements\nIn ... settlement a person names of third unrelated party as the benefactor to their life insurance policy in exchange for immediate cash so if you have a hundred thousand dollar while your insurance policy and you want to buy advocated right I'll give you Seventy cents on the dollar\nAnd you'll name me as a benefactor to your life insurance policy and so when you die all collect you know the entire a hundred thousand that detaches courses you're waiting around for me to die yes\nIs there I mean life insurance is regulated industry right is there anything that regulates\nThese ... it's not really kind of one of the more gruesome parts of the industry is that especially during the AIDS epidemic a this was not something that was regulated I mean some of the brokers who were buying a biological settlements you know I'm sure had you know the best interest in mind for these people but\nThere were a certain amount of ... ...\n... in theory it's it's a quick buck right I mean the the life expectancy of these men who had aids in the eighties and nineties was not not long no it wasn't until medicine\nGot involved yes I'm In Nineteen Ninety five a class of drugs called ... and editors came to market\nProduce inhibitors dramatically expanded uh the life expectancy for people living with HIV nowadays the life expectancy from HIV positive person is just a couple of years short of nature I'd be negative counterpart and basically the entire industry around by article settlement collapse wow and\nSo they with these men now living you know some of them from those days are many of them are still alive\nYes and the policies are being paid by\nThere isn't really a way to find out who owns your life insurance policy once you sell it and so the man that I talked to who by advocated their policies in the nineties\nThey don't really know who owns their policies today which must somehow be terrifying in in some weird way\nI don't think it's constantly on their mind but I think it's something that they definitely do think about from time to time or one of the people that I interviewed is a guy named Sean ... and he is the mayor of his town in Pennsylvania so he is somewhat of a public figure yeah with with some weird trying to price\nOn his with somebody waiting for\nHim to die if they've been paying the policy premiums all these years what did these men\nDo with the money they got\nThe answer to that is very ... you know hospital bills were exorbitant for people living with aids and the only available medication for a long time was a a drug called E. Z. T. cost ten thousand dollars a year it was the most expensive\nPharmaceutical ever brought to market but two of them and that I spoke with actually started their own businesses a one ... started a magazine called paws which is still around today the magazine designed for people living with HIV", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Marketplace", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "15"}
