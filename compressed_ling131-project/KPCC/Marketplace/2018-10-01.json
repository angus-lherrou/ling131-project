given Tesla's board some headaches but now we're going to look at the composition of boards themselves California Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill into law Sunday requiring that publicly held corporations headquartered in the state include women on their boards\nThis law is the first of its kind in the U.S we've got Jenna McGregor to talk about it she covers corporate governance for the Washington Post thanks for being here\nThanks for having me run down and what this law is and who will be affected by it\nSo California Governor Jerry Brown just signed into law a bill that lawmakers there have been trying to get through for a long time next shoe actually require companies that have their principal offices in California do you have\nWhat we'll start with at least one female director on their board\nDid do most sports include women already I mean how how unusual is it either to have women on boards or not have women ...\nParticularly large companies have a woman on the board large publicly traded companies but their numbers share that about twenty five percent\nOf companies headquartered publicly traded headquartered companies in California do not have any women and you know they're trying to fix that issue through having a mandate it starts it will grow over time over the next couple of years they're going to add to it where it's not just one that you were

September for\nDeciding to sign it into law so what was the way of making a statement of of what the country has been engaged in a major national conversation about yeah I'm\nThe issue of whether having more women on the board has any impact is is a good question there is a lot of research that shows it does have a good impact but it leads to either higher returns or better decision making are better price mergers yet\nThe question of how do you do it do you actually the require them to do it you have an incentive for them to do it do you do it through kind of public shaming and so what
