{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "\nIn Los Angeles unkind result is Thursday actually with a fork is always to have your long everybody this has been a day of big numbers on Wall street most of them printed or\nDisplayed on screens anyway in red ink triple digit losses on the Dow at one point eight percent drop on the NASDAQ but we are going to get going with a technically smaller but arguably more revealing number than either of those to the yield on the ten year treasury note the benchmark ten year I should add\nSits right now at three point one nine percent that's the highest that you'll the interest rate that that bond pays the highest it's been since two thousand eleven we've gotten marketplaces re measure on the phone from New York to talk all things bonds and put this into context they break\nHey they're kind of thought I was listening I think actually it was you yesterday on the marketplace morning report giving me a the yield on the ten year it was three point zero nine so here we are almost thirty six hours later it is a ... percent higher attempt percentage point higher what gives\n[noise] okay so generally speaking this is happening because the economy is doing great now why specifically yesterday\nI mean like if it's like if you're trying to push a car out of a ditch why did it suddenly move that second you know but one reason could be that there was a very good number I asked them index of ... non manufacturers service industries that was near a record high yesterday\nBut generally you know you have a low unemployment three point nine percent of GDP Growth rate revised working two percent second quarter this\nAll this great news and it just keeps on piling up and piling up\nA means that a investors could be thinking that inflation is coming up here so and if inflation is going to be actually come and we also saw an oil prices rise are rising right so if they think inflation coming\nThen that could eat into their long term investment at ten year treasuries a long term investments so they're going to need to hire you all the other thing is that uh this could be telling us that investors believed the fed is going to content keep on keeping on raising great pride right in ... and ... so that influences like\nWhich is which is what you're ... talked about and we'll get to back that we'll get back to ... but let me ask you to sort of I think related question is the first days what does what do rising American interest rates mean and the global economy we have talked about emerging markets on this program for some of the problems are having give me the give me the framing\n[noise] well the better things are doing here the more money this is going to suck out of the riskier parts of the world so you know petty turkey and pity Argentina right um\nYou know if you're an institutional investors are out in the world and you were just looking just scrape and for the bottom of the barrel for somewhere to put your money [laughter]\nYou know you were playing around with turkey plan aren't Argentina player of these other places in the veteran you already been because scraping 'cause that's risky over there right that's the deal yeah exactly it's risky yeah it's super risky financially unstable lots of political problems\nYou know and and so yeah there are other things are here people are like I'm just going to I'm going to put this money back in the U.S that hurts those countries currencies\nOh case but if I had been living on a my savings account interest rates and my ah certificates of deposit interest rates which for a decade now have been ... basically isn't this admittedly small pickup word a sign of hope yeah it is yes\nThat's right savings account or returns are going to go up that's a that's exactly right now on the other hand so is your credit card rate so is your mortgage it's not a surprise that the thirty year national average mortgage rate is also a multi year high jump in with this tenure bond a yield so above them\nAll right uh back to Jay Powell super quick we got a half a minute I'm he sits there the chairman of the fed does and he sees the bond market reacting in the way that in theory he wants right he wants a he's been raising rates and he wants this to keep picking up what do you think\nHe's singing good great that's what I Want that's what should happen everyone's getting the message or and also it's happening while the economy is doing great so right now if you know so it's working out which\nIs even better so British or New York talking months thanks very\nShort or talk to you soon it's going to be interesting to see what happens by the way with those bond yields tomorrow morning say ooh eight thirty or so east coast time when we get the September unemployment report best guesses are can be pretty good lots of new jobs a new low low rate on unemployment which becomes\nA big deal when you think about this we are getting so close to the holiday hiring season writing given the strength of the economy that debris was just talking about holidays sales are expected to be pretty strong too which means Georgia going to be busy which means\nThey're going to have to be hiring so what's it would be employer to do in the search for those new hires marketplace adjusting how has that one you don't have to\nTell stories that workers are hard to come by jak Klein hands with the national\nRetail Federation says just look at when retailers are posting holiday jobs this year\nThey're announcing these openings much earlier than what we've seen in the past\nHe says doors are starting to raise wages to attract seasonal workers they're also offering incentives like signing bonuses additional training in more employee discounts\nI Believe one of the companies out there was even thinking of providing a four one K.\nBut even though the unemployment rate is so low there are still plenty of people willing to take on more work seasonal workers are often people who are working second or third jobs as economists treats like Hillary duty at the new school she says stores no that higher wages will bring in people who need the extra income\nIs really no such thing as a labor shortage in economics higher pay\nCould cut into profits for retailers and gift buying more expensive for shoppers but look these are good problems to have the national Retail Federation said holiday sales are expected to jump by more than four percent this year economists Sarah house at Wells Fargo says workers are benefiting to\n... this week with Amazon increasing their minimum wage the target and Walmart increase the level that they're bringing in workers'\nShe says retailers could ask employees to work longer hours instead of bringing more people on that would be good for our existing workers if they need those hours bad for shoppers you'd have to wait in long lines at the checkout counter with fewer employees around New York I'm Justin how for marketplace\nOn Wall street today well we did that right well have the details when we do the numbers [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's been an interesting day in the U.S China economic relationship a big story and Bloomberg Businessweek maybe you saw this about how the Chinese army had hacked into computer hardware used by some of the biggest tech companies in this economy those tech companies by the way the night we should say\nLater vice president Mike Pence said in his speech this morning that he expects China to be more proactive than ever in trying to influence us politics and also some fresh understanding what the new NAFTA is going to mean for the global supply chain under the terms of the new deal and yes I noticed technically the U.S MCA\nManufacturers are going to have to get more of their parts from the three member countries to avoid tariffs United States Mexico and Canada of course the thinking from the White House is it that will force supply chains to shift back to North America\nWhich is to say shift away from China marketplace Jennifer pack has the reality check on that from Shanghai\nEarlier this week President Trump declared the deal would provide a big boost for North American businesses and\nJobs that are being manufacturing powerhouse that allow us to reclaim a supply chain that has been off shored do the world because of unfair\nTrade issues and the president might be on the right track says Enrique out a trade expert at Singapore management university yeah and then you impact that would be a re sharpening of the supply chain is to the detriment of China\nSome companies have already shifted production out of China because of things like increasing labor costs and heavy regulation\nThe U.S task and knew us NCAA deal\nHas just accelerated the process says Alberto that already with the censure and associates a firm that advice as foreign investors in China\nHe says about ten percent of its manufacturing clients are starting to set up production line outside China\nBut are they as President Trump lines relocating to the U.S\nI don't have a single crime that loop and moving back to the U. S. uh all of them are looking at the Asia\nTo countries like Vietnam and Cambodia he says the expert Henri ... says nations that have a free trade agreement with the U.S also benefit like a\nWall Street light Singapore like Korea he says however that any boosts\nUs manufacturers could be short lived because China can produce so many things that other countries can't end more cheaply Michael's accord with the consulting firm Tompkins international says the U.S MCA won't dislodged China from its central role in global trade\nChina you're going to be in the world market and a major exporter\nHe says the CEOs he advises has no immediate plans to shift production he's telling them to wait and see he says there are no winners in a trade war and he's optimistic that U.S China trade tensions will soon be resolved in Shanghai I'm Jennifer pack for marketplaces [noise]\nOne of the constants in this country work out to be the best I don't know a couple of five years anyway is that identity theft is in the new normal every time you turn around there's been a hacker data breach the means you have to lock down your credit report and now barely you have to lock down your kids credit reports to\nThinking that oh the experience of other places wouldn't be enough and ... but it's just it's a different game really and I fell on my on my first wave a really big way of my biggest slave until that time and I broke my feeble er and um I had a lot of weights on my hat\nAnd I had one ... big wave hit me after the one I fell and that was a huge impact that took out my life jacket and helped me on the water for two waves and then\nI was further to the inside and it had smaller wave hit me but by then I was really really tired and I had no no life jacket and I had a broken leg so it was just a struggle rated to reconnect with my driver who um didn't find me for around nine minutes so it was a big fight\nAnd into recovery you just decided I'm going to keep going I mean that takes a lot of motivation how'd you kind of give yourself back up to get back out\nOf the process you know five years I mean I have many injuries that we find surgeries and I\nHad I had you know half of my mind in it um by being here and being exposed to the sport and expose the waves and so I tried to be president even though I wasn't fully but for me in order to to keep that fire burning that desire and the focus for so many years\nSo surfers at your level mile will only go out into waves of this size once you've got a dial down the geography of the sea floor whether it's in North shore of awhile who were people into Haiti knowing how the sea floor shapes the way it was crucial to knowing how it breaks and\nUnderstand the power behind that water can you help us understand the geography of the sea floor and knowledge already because these are massive ways maybe the biggest ways in the world\nUm it's a very special place because we have a canyon uh that's approximately they say up to five kilometers Steve we don't really know because it's only measured up to two hundred meters on the charts super close legs you know the\nPentagon version is pretty powerful has really Armstrong lender and we get those big from coming from New York or up above us going to Ireland and coming down to us it has a phenomenon that I\nIt's even hard to understand but I Know that they come in different angles and I think like at times is just to waste combine that became one and they just get read you read it\nAll I whenever I see the videos from ... to my stomach just drops I Can't believe people even doing that so tell me about your day getting the sixty eight foot wave we we\nWere having a pre spectacular season a real cold winter and a lot of big date we went out that money I mean it was still dark we knew that I was in the raid gigantic because of the forecasts but also because it did get gigantic the night before and we saw it right before the Iraq and we we actually waited for three hours and a half or that wave\nStupid code or it was quite tiring you know like for my mind and and my body to keep warming up and focused and sharp\nAnd believing that the way it was going to come and not many ways a written that day because it was so big and difficult so when ... came we were basically waiting way far out nobody was around us and it came for us\nThen we just decided to go for the second one to be safer and and to have a similar to ride and I thought\nI saw it and I knew I knew was going to be really a big budget that are focusing on a renewed completing that ride\n'em as you said you worked really hard for this uh and yet you were awarded this goes world record this Monday so many months later tell me more about the whole process and what what took so long\nWell you know there was a difficulty and the process um if you understand that there there was no division for the woman in the in the in this book you know it was it was considered to be just one record and and\nObviously it was it was the men's record because you know they weren't surfing bigger than us so it was it\nWas hard to get to get a woman [laughter] I'm biggest wave written a record in the in his book why ... ... you know it's a new country agree any people to really care for it and really committed\nTo it and I think if there is not one athlete that really pushes towards it I mean nobody is going to sit there and be like yeah let's just add the woman's\nHere you know just not how it works you know women have to fight\nTo get their space where it's supposed to be just a man's world you know so\nIt screaming loud enough and you get hurt 'em and people here you and that's what happened you know and the and that was taken so long I didn't know what to do anymore and I started a petition a lot of people went out and find it and gave me a thumbs up support than that I think what radio rushed the whole process to happen this year\nOne thing I like to hear from our guest on our on our shows what music they listen to and I know surfers off and have a tune in their head of the paddle out or some show music to wind down after a big waste such and what are you listening to lately my\nOh my God so many things um [noise] I Love the new everything is love from the cartoon\nJay Z Beyonce um without somebody listening to card to be like hip hop\nR envy and my one last question um and you probably get us a lot why do you surf and what he's sort of big waves [laughter]\nSerious 'cause I mean it is a wonderful sports you know you got to be on the on the water and connection with the nature and no way that the same as the others it's always different it's always challenging there's so many variables um\nI don't know I just love the lifestyle and for big way you know in particular is just such a big challenge I've always been moved towards challenging things and difficult thing than I I'm always thought that big wave surfing was\nThe hardest thing you can you can do and surfing and and I think that's one of the reasons I got drawn into it\nBy a ... who is now give us both record holder for surfing the biggest way by a woman it's
