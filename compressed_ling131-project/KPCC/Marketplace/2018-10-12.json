P. Morgan city group Wells Fargo ... they'll all report earnings\nAnd that could snap investors out of this ah because they will get some hard data to base decisions on and so things could go up especially if companies are doing well and the fundamentals like strong\nWhich companies are and the fundamentals have been drawn right I mean we have to admit that right jobs are growing the economy is growing so the underlying reality as old\nAs straight as I've been here\n... on the market beat today Thanks thank you All right so we will turn now to three snapshots from the president of the United states three glimpses into his thinking on monetary policy interest rates in other words\nAnd what the Federal Reserve has been doing with them namely as marketplaces burial cigar sitting right there just said raising them three times this year if your accounting and we are and so is the president which gets us to this first of all this from the president last night in Erie, Pennsylvania apologies by the way for the background noise\nMaking big fan of gun\nThen this this morning from a call he made to Fox in front\nOf the Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute that's all this that's ridiculous what they're doing\nAnd then finally later this morning from a bill signing ceremony in the oval office\nI think the fed is far too stringent and they're making a mistake and is that right [noise] ed ... despite that we're doing very well but it's not necessary in my opinion and I think I Know about it better than they do away with it\nSo if your business and economics journalist what\nDo you do with that because the president is just wrong the fed is not crazy or ... or stringent the central bank under both its current and the media to pass cheers has been deliberate and transparent and measured as it sets about getting interest rates back to something near normal after a decade of keeping them at zero\nAlso by the way when I ask you about back in July if it bugs him when the White House pumps them in the eye on monetary policy or whether it's going to change what he does he said if you listen between the lines here that\nI had a great a colleague in mentor back in a day who used to bring meetings into focus by saying\nLet's controller control so for we control as long as what we do\nWhat we do and and I just told you what we do when we're always going to do that's who we are it's always who we're going to be we're we're going to we're going to do our business in a way that's strictly non political\nWithout taking political issues into consideration and that you know carries out the mandate Congress has given us a we have the tools to do that we have a statute that allows us to do that in in a way that is independent of political considerations I'm strongly committed to it and so on my colleagues\nSo where does all this going well there's a mention here that this whole thing we've been talking about the past what five six and a half minutes whatever markets tumbling rates rising the doing what it's doing the president doing what he's doing is all anchored all of it in the knock on effects of one economic reality whose name\nIs inflation the feathers we told you would like to see prices rising by about two percent a year we got some new inflation numbers this morning and marketplaces Kimberly Adams has more on what they may or may not me\nThe consumer price index tracts prices for a basket of goods and services in August it was up a tenth of a percent landing at two point three percent year over year\nInflation is at a moderate level it's very close to where actually the Federal Reserve would like to see it\nAnd ... teaches economics at Hamilton College I think\nThat it's an endorsement of their current plan to continue to raise interest rates very gradually\nBut numbers are funny you could use those same CPI numbers to make a different arguments economist or need to desk he at every court ISI sums up the counterpoint\nThe fed has a two percent inflation target these numbers are close to two percent why on earth would be be raising rates\nTo desk he says the fed isn't just looking at where inflation is now it's looking at where it's headed plus nothing isn't all that attached to CPI\nMain piece of data they look out for their inflation target is a different price in later called P. C. E. or personal\nConsumption expenditures which measures inflation a little differently\nTake healthcare CPI measures how much you spend out of pocket p._c. eat tracks how much your healthcare costs

car as to and I still utilize it yeah and I go to my mom's house and I get it and usually I drive around\nSo yeah I think that's something that we're really trying to get across in the series of stories is that no matter where you live on the planet the Arctic affects you\nSo we're going to hear a lot about eyes and why what happens to it it's so important uh but this was going to hear from you and me it's more than just a is right\nYeah for a million people live in the Arctic and they have a front row seat to all these changes I really wanted to try to understand what climate change looks like an Arctic through the eyes of the people who live there and um\nAfter spending all this time in the eight different Arctic countries I really had my eyes opened to the way that climate change intersects with all kinds of other issues up there\nFor instance I spoke with ... with the end what certain polar council in Alaska\nShe was one of many people I talked to who had information that kind of surprised me I asked her a question that I kind of thought I knew the answer to and I was wrong what would you define as some of the biggest threat to people in the Arctic right now I'm calling I station\nColonization I was not expecting that\nYeah this is something that was a surprise to me too but I heard over and over 'em throughout the Arctic there are a lot of indigenous cultures and almost all of them have gone through some sort of colonization process one of the groups that I spend a lot of time with our the sunny these are the indigenous people of northern Scandinavia and western Russia\nAnd I spoke to one woman named ...\nI Am ... and ah my country's ... me but it is ... it is divided into four countries Norway Sweden Finland and Russia so we are kind of stateless\nSo if climate change and colonization of the legacy of it any way are two big challenges for people in the Arctic right now what do they want from the rest of us who have been colonized rivers and caused the climate crisis to begin with\nI think that what most people that I spoke with in the Arctic one is they they just want to be included in the conversation about what's going on in the Arctic I think some of the legacy of colonization\nMeans that some of the people that are most impacted by these changes you know really have to fight to get a seat at the table in terms of all of the different conversations happening around how to respond to climate change\nAnd um I think that just listening and taking perspectives seriously if people who live in the north is a great starting point\nAmy Martin of the threshold podcast talking with the world's Marco Wurman any serious kicks off next Monday on the world\nFinally today race and fairness deep conflicts over how to deal with
