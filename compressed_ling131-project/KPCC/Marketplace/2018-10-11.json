{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "In New York today I'm tired result is Wednesday the tenth day of October good is always to have you along everybody and look I get it I Know it's unnerving an eight hundred and thirty one point drop on the Dell all three major industries down more than three percent today\nWhat about which there are two things to say first of all markets go down as well as up especially after they had been going up so far so quickly that is an important point and completely normal number two\nThere are a lot of reasons why this is happening chief probably among them quickly rising yield that his interest rates in the bond market that we've been telling you about the last ten days or so and concurrent ... about inflation all of the above I have to say again\nOur normal but admittedly off putting when interest rates have been so low for so long and markets have mostly gone up\nWhat is interesting though is that what's been going on in this economy is financial markets is affecting the rest of the world case in point treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and the Chinese currency today in an interview this morning\nBut it was more in Beijing against what he called competitive devaluation of the UN that's Chinese currency that is trying to trying to get a global trade edge by making its currency and therefore goods cheaper for others to buy\nThink trade war and terrorists here and we should point out that the UN is about ten percent cheaper today than it was last spring but his marketplaces Tracey Samuelson reports that might have more to do with what's going on here than what the Chinese are doing\nThe wind has been losing value against the dollar but you know what it's had lots of friends on that journey\nThe dollar is strong if the euro and then the Canadian dollar in Norway Sweden and almost all the crush of the world\nAre Chandler is the chief market strategist at ...\nI don't think I Need to separate like ... framework to claim China\nYes China's economy isn't growing as fast as it once was and\nThere's concern about the heavy debt burden they've taken out by local government could banks lots of bad loans\nSo that's definitely a part of the ones depreciation but mostly everyone wants that all the panky at Johns Hopkins university says if anything the Chinese have tried to keep the value of the one from falling further they're not working to make it cheaper\nThey haven't done anything any differently than doing her along on\nThe dollar is like this glowing orbit drawing people in thanks to a strong US Economy and rising interest rates better tempting investors with higher returns but as the files it does have this effect that the Trump Administration doesn't love you swipe presided as a trade policy professor at Cornell\nSo but ... says that the Trump Administration has pulled on imports from China now are much less sport and in other words a person's status on Chinese imports doesn't amount to much if the Chinese currency degree she is by almost an identical alone\nBecause that things minutiae and was trying to warn China to get any ideas about using its currency as a weapon and the country's ongoing trade war Chinese officials said yesterday they have no intention of devaluing their currency I'm Tracey Samuelson for marketplace\nWhile the drudgery structure and the foreign exchange markets in terrorists in the trade war get all the headlines there is another way the United states interact with the global economy that's at least as significant and it fits\nUnder the general heading of regulatory review the White House said this morning and this has bipartisan back in Congress that should be said that the White House announced that the committee on foreign investment in the United states ... as it's called is going to start taking you're much closer look at\nForeign investment in the United states Janet Babin has that won\nThe new rules are meant to protect our national security no apply when a foreign firmer individual tries to invest in certain sensitive areas such as technology everything from aircraft parts makers hey I to semi conductor makers read lots of Chinese companies\nBut also other kinds of companies says Gregory who sits in a partner at law firm fully in larger\nFinancial institutions insurance company's money transmitting companies they're they're all going to have a more probing scrutiny of their sales\nThese firms will now have to alert syfy us about any potential foreign investment or face civil penalties the agency will have to sift through thousands of additional filings a lot more work when it's already lacking some say enough resources to get its job done more work to for foreign companies that want to invest here\nTony Fratto is a former Bush administration official now at consulting firm Hamilton place strategies he says the tightening up an additional powers recipients could have a chilling effect\nI Do think that maybe they're charge has gone too far\n... says foreign investment dollars could be redirected to Europe or Asia\nAnd those investment dollars go other place than we are we are actually strengthening our competitors in some cases our national security of photos\nWhich would defeat the purpose of these new stricter regulations in New York I'm Janet Babin for marketplace\nWall Street today as I said not so good also remember I mentioned people are starting to get worried about inflation we get numbers on prices at the consumer level it's called the consumer price index technically tomorrow morning so there is that to look forward to stops way down on this Wednesday will have the details when we do the numbers [noise]\nOne of the few things that Republican and democratic political professionals agree on is that the midterm elections twenty seven days hence are going to turn on turn out and in the weeks left no small fraction of the record amounts that are going to be raised and spent on this election is going to be directed from we at getting out the vote with one especially lose a group\nIn mind marketplaces Kimberly Adams says that\nSeveral times a week a couple of dozen volunteers gather at the historic women's national democratic club in Washington DC they said it along ... table and do their part to get out the vote I volunteered\nMore this midterm these and then I have and any other election\nOn the day I visit Nicole queen Dexter is handwriting postcards to potential voters yes handwriting postcards that had the outline of the state of Virginia which is just across the river\nTheir fellow Democrat we need your vote to flip the fifth on November say this election is so important in your voice is more important\nThat fellow Democrats name and address may well have come from a list of likely voters people who have voted before lots of get out the vote money is aimed at getting those voters to show up on election day\nBut that money could be better spent elsewhere says Clarissa Martinez she's vice president of need us us a nonprofit that focuses on boosting Latino political engagement\nSo what do you see in the vast majority of resources actually chases highly have vigil voters first and foremost\nWhen what you really need to do says Martinez is bringing new voters\nFor young voters and for communities like the Latino community they simply don't end up making that outreach target of many of those campaigns\nAnd that neglect it shows up at the polls only twenty percent of those Eighteen to twenty nine years old voted in the last midterm in twenty fourteen which is one reason social media is full of ads like this one from knock the vote where aging baby boomers mock younger voters\nIf the weather is nice maybe you can go to one of those little marches you might even shared this video on Facebook\nBut overall will be\nAbove you out because well actually they might and not just because many races are so tied political parties can't afford to ignore younger\nOthers but because this time around\nMany young voters refused to be ignored\n[noise] then out the rallying cry from the march for our lives following the Parkland\nShooting you registration spiked after the protests and those young voters mean business in a new poll by a deep breath\nThe center for information and research on civic learning and engagement thirty four percent of Eighteen to twenty four year old said they are extremely likely to vote in the midterms some of that energy is a response to the political environment but there's also money behind it mostly from the left\nOur program is over thirty million dollars and a good chunk of that is being spent on field organizing on the ground face to face conversations with young people\nThan ... with progressive group next Gen America he says his outreach budget this year is more than double what it was in twenty fourteen outreach aimed at people like the friends of Twenty one year old scholar Reinhardt who lives in northern Virginia Reinhart is registered to vote but many of his friends\nAre I just don't think they're that engaged in the political sphere honestly a lot of my grinding pretty hard right now at jobs out of school\nEven sound next incense it's already signed up more than two hundred and thirty thousand young voters across the political spectrum Mike do have is a Republican strategist with the public affairs from mercury\nSo we make in England and she'd only been here about one year two years two years\nThat was sixteen years ago like old couples that communication has always been ... was our last question\nOn ... show\nWhich to me means\nCare less I just hear it as a no whereas\nGood luck with that American [noise]\nWe mean it as a yes and it's taken as a oh I'm really unenthusiastic about that like a ... yeah exactly it's a linguistic shrug\nAnd um I Do find it annoying to me what shorter means is well I hadn't had that idea but that sounds fine to me but the little second guess that every time I said yeah not much in that comes up quite often it actually does [laughter]\n[noise] Lynn unfilled live in Brighton on the south coast of England they have uh just about to turn an eleven year old\nDoctor often okay All right and here's the question of everybody asks you if you do a BBC interview at the beginning they say what did you have for breakfast today tell me how did they go\nSo American that was our expecting to hear beans on ... or something\nAnd what was then you'll buy on Black Friday by
