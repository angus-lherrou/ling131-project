Monday today the eighth of October get is always to have you along everybody's sometimes\nThat I Know it's rare but sometimes various threads in the news come together in interesting ways and today as you might have guessed is one of those days last night us time we got a new report on climate change and it is bleak very bleak a group called the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change thousands of climate scientists basically\nSay the earth's temperature has risen one degree Celsius about one point eight degrees Fahrenheit if you do the conversion since the industrial revolution and if we can't keep that global warming below about three and a half degrees Fahrenheit\nOceans could rise an extra four inches grain yields and available drinking water would plummet it wouldn't be bad as I said it would also be the group says expensive heat to Fifteen trillion dollars\nWell good thing then and here's the other thread that the Nobel Prize in economics was awarded this morning to a guy who was spent his life marrying up environmental science and economics William North house of Yale is his name so in his honor marketplaces got tongue gets going with this what if what if\nThe terror Starbucks than it was all things being equal what if we could see climate change and its solutions in economic terms\nSay you're at a dance of PHD's and you force all the earth scientists on one wall to dance with all the economists on the other that's what William northern houses done he asks how does economic growth effect pollution and vice versa USC economist Matthew Kohn\nGrowth causes greater greenhouse gas emissions but greater greenhouse gas emissions intern lower economic growth\nFor instance climate change lowers crop yields and raises air conditioning bills nor has made models for policymakers to find the best approach to climate and economic growth\nNot because we're environmentalist but to continue economic growth and the overall improvement in our overall standard of life\nAnd building or an houses world the optimal answer is if the or attacks on polluters based on the damage that they do this is largely accepted in climate talks so he changed the debate to economist Michael Green stone at the University of Chicago it's no less about right and wrong and more about math\nWithout bills incredible work climate change really could have become very firmly a moral issue instead of an issue that reflects trade offs and the problem with moral issues is at my morals aren't your morals\nBut like any good academic north house gets into fights he thinks the world can handle five degree Fahrenheit right which is much higher than many others economists Noah ... at Columbia explains that's because no one has assume something about future generations\nPeople today don't care very much about what happens a hundred years from now and I think that's where there's a big disconnect between north houses model and the way that a lot of people work on climate\nChange the the issue this gets in the weeds of quote discounting the future but it means that climate debate on and economists terms I'm Scott Tong for marketplace\nOr theme today of what if

together in a concrete model with a major implications ... is a former colleague rumors and a professor at Stanford\nEconomic growth is the result of these innovative efforts by entrepreneurs and scientists and researchers and so anything that influences their effort can therefore affect our living standards in the long run\nGovernments have the power to promote or discourage innovation

previously been ...\nAnd yet maybe that message hasn't totally sunken here's Rome or at a news conference this morning\nI've been really disappointed that we just haven't had the kind of political environment where we could think about you know speeding up technological progress\nThe U. S. government's share of all basic research funding in the U.S is the lowest it's been since World War two in New York I'm Sabrina short for marketplace\nA quick plug here for our interview with Paul
