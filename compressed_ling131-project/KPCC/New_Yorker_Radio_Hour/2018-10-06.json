Yorker radio our co production of WNYC Studios and the New Yorker\nWelcome to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick if you watch the video of two protesters with Senator Jeff flake in an elevator during the Kavanaugh hearings if you saw them confronting with so much anger at the way women have been treated for so long\nThe way they said to a U.S senator don't look away from me look at me and tell me it doesn't matter\nIf you look at the way flake change disposition afterwards it's all becoming clear that something absolutely remarkable is taking place in America right now this is very much the subject of Rebecca Traister his new book good and bad revolutionary power of women's anger\nYou know crazy unhinged ball busting unattractive invalid marginal like it will go badly for us if we express our anger directly and I think that way I write about this in the book that one of the tactics that so many of us turned you we cry which is a fundamentally\nMore acceptable um mode of emotion for women it's it is in part because of what that manager said to me it will be understood as vulnerability\nWhich is more acceptable in women me right um now that's especially true for white women by the way there was an ... there's a racial dynamic in terms of crying as being something that can elicit sympathy\nAnd uh that sympathy is very much more likely to accrue to a crime woman if she is white [noise]\nUm what are you saying what is what is a woman of color are more likely\nTo do well women of color have written about this very beautifully that the vision of the traditionally vulnerable femininity I'm at the governor's sympathy your empathy\nIs very often the suffering white woman the crying black woman is doesn't have that same kind of imaginative hold and more than that white women's\nTears have often been used to cover for instances of racism um so I mean it's the the vision of the suffering white women and the need to protect her has often been the cover for lynching for um\nYou know for for racialized racist violence so I just want to you know when we talk about the tears of women being something that makes them vulnerable that is a dynamic that applies especially if you are a white woman\nI really do hope men read this book in in great numbers as well as women and for me there was a an especially affecting moment that I'm going to touch on your husband comes to you\nIt's just as the me too movement is really exploding and he says I'm shocked the profusion of it the violence of the horror of so many stories that we've heard about in the last year\nAbout sexual harassment and sexual assault was old shocking to him shocking to me and he's coming to you in some way for what you call feminist absolution\nSo what's to be learned what can you tell him and really by extension what can you tell me well\nI think that this I my hope is that this is a moment of education and readjustment of the view of of ... a full human experience for a lot of men\nThey're just not seeing the ...\nHave not realize how common how ubiquitous how every day these kinds of ... this is part of opening the men are learning something about the experience of not being men in the world you don't even watch\nMuch of the learning comes out in terms of defensiveness\nWere first some first time and it's a process and I don't I don't worry about\nYou know thinking about oh my God in high school maybe I said something terrible I made a bad joke in the office that's what year old\nFor all of my anger and it's and and this is an angry book that I've written than I Am very angry at men and I talk about the complexities of\nUm the tricks of a women's movement or a feminist movement is it asks you to identify as your oppressor a group of people who are your intimate your loved ones you're the man you share beds within families with and who are your brothers in your father's in your sons and your friends it asks\nOf us to complicate those incredibly intimate relationships that are often loving and they're often based in need independents on who the man on whom we rely I really do feel for the men for whom this is difficult we are changing rules\nPartway through the game that's what this process is asking us to do that is hard\nIf there's no other way to do it we don't get to just start fresh with a generation starting now right if you actually want to change the way that the power structures work and the abuses that they permit and you want to say actually we we don't want to have those abuses anymore we want to make them them\nNo longer acceptable that is going to mean that there are some people who are caught in the middle who entered the world with one set of expectations\nAnd one side of assumptions about how they could behave and are being told halfway through that that's no longer acceptable\nAnd that is really that has a cost has a toll and I do feel for those guys that doesn't mean that I don't think the process is necessary and I stand behind it and I don't think I'm Alone in this most of the people that I Know who are\nFervent proponents of the me too movement and if this difficult painful process are incredibly conflicted about it too we don't want to be the police who determine if somebody should lose their job or not lose their job\nAnd a lot of the anti me to stop said oh it lacks nuance and it's just a bunch of execution or no everybody I Know who's behind this movement you know most um intensely and fervently feels incredible conflict and so I feel tremendous sympathy for the guys to\nThe book and it's remarkable one is good in math Rebecca Traister thanks so much thanks so much for having me David [noise]\nRebecca Traister his new book is called good and [noise] the
