just album and that was Jim ... injured\nCommunity kept coming up and it was like we need to build a community because right now the people that I care about and the things that I care about are being erased through laws through media\nAnd I want to create this project in a tour experienced that allows all the dirty computers in the world those who are told because they're unique or\nThey're going

I'd never shied away from talking about sexuality um I think that I Am a private person\nAnd I do not and I still to this day don't like talking about more personal relationships when\nI think this was after after the election and just as I was working on this project I knew that once people saw 'em dirty computer the motion picture the short film that I did and they listen to the album I knew

Pennsylvania\nWhen you're looking now at at the politics that allow for this to happen right what do you think needs to change for something like\nTo stop being able to happen at a political level [noise]\nI don't know if you're going to drop it because it's too much money involved a little bit better news and the little guy don't matter uh we get more people are gambling involved may be able

decades and it's nearly impossible race for her to when she manages a farming cooperative she served in the Peace Corps in West Africa and lived in guinea\nWhat she saw extractive industry in Africa made are fearful of what oil and gas companies would do is they rushed into Pennsylvania and\nDo you usually get as involved as you're getting like what are you doing to support her\n... notes are talking to people written stories and telling people trying to try and do it again you know it's hard to do out here in the middle of nowhere that fond of the voting later writer and I signed up on my property that drives up on the neighbors they when they're going to vote maybe we'll see it I don't know you know\nSo you've taken on the site it's probably the most active political you've ever been right yeah do you have hope that it it will change though that you're doing it anyway doing it I like to see 'em Lee and Lee started talker\nSeventy miles farther on an hour and a half drive to the west from blooms gun shop we arrived in Huntington\nHuntington is a rural community midway between Harrisburg and Pittsburgh it's which are lined with white pine and shaggy bark at very we came to visit Ellen Geller hard sixty three year old retired special ed school teacher she was so upset about the pipeline on our property that she'd actually gone to jail over and\nShe stood in front of some heavy machinery to block the equipment from digging on our land and she'd also Puerto noxious cocktail Iran said milk and Tabasco sauce as well as laid rotten cat food near where the pipeline workers\nWere working in order to make their jobs I'm comfortable she'd actually gone to jail over that\nBut she'd recently been released and showed us the ongoing construction from a safe distance\nThis this is our wet and this is still part of our wetland area so it gets a little foggy and it gets rocky okay we're we're so\nFamous last words right [noise] construction\nOr you've been so controversial in contentious at the gas hearts that pipeline workers carry cameras and they photographed us as we stood by the website [noise]\nGuy has a camera in his hand has a video I saw video camera\nThe ... she has like Alan and our daughter lease had an organized what they called camp white pine on the forest in part of their property to try to block the pipeline\nThrough social media they'd called on other protesters who came with the expertise to set up this sophisticated network of police in zip wires that allowed protesters to harness and clip into the trees to block chainsaws from clearing the woods\nAt one point they had six activists sitting in their trees I spoke with a lease the daughter at their kitchen table\nAt least do you think with the election of Trump that makes any difference in this issue\nI mean I think people find it easy to blame these things on Trump\nBut Obama was already doing it anyway and in Pennsylvania we have\nA democratic governor who is watching all this stuff go down and he [noise]\nHe watched what happened to us and to everybody else along the line and all the bills and all the contamination of wells and the destruction of the forest and\nNow retired teachers being thrown in jail and he still talks about how this project is necessary and and good you know so that's what you get with a Democrat\n[noise] you know people around here just don't for the most part don't get involved with politics a lot of people don't vote\nBecause they don't see value in it because they haven't been valued by those\nPeople who have been in the positions of power\nSo what does it matter you know like I mean folks down in southeast PA were able to like actually physically meet with the governor over this pipeline hasn't given about meeting with us you know like he's never going to come out here to meet with people that just never going to happen they don't care about I don't even the U.S [noise]\nMm oh\nThere's a huge Gulf between what people along this pipeline thinking possible how they think politics can actually impact their lives and it has to do with economics for the gear hard living in isolated in rural Pennsylvania the idea that a blue wave could save them just doesn't exist that's politics for CNN\nNot reality but for Daniel ... running for state assembly and the more prosperous suburbs politics is part of the solution Danielle would like to see the pipeline stopped but even if Democrats took control of the legislature which is unlikely there's no guarantee that they would stop it\nIt's even less likely that the pipeline will change the outcome of Pennsylvania's congressional races and make it a blue state again\nStill Danielle is playing a long game like Democrats all over the country she's trying to rebuild the party's presence on the ground in local offices and in people's backyards\nDon't do it like we talk all the time I talk all the time about how through my own race I'm actually going to find people for next year the ... elections because the more people to the more people to talk to Democrats in where they vote for Democrats\nSo it's a I think it's a it's like a
