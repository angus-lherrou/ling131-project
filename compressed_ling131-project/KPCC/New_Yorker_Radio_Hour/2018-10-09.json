{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "As we could go about this a congressman done buyer has a bill up called the fair representation act that involves you know larger multi member districts and folks elected by rank choice voting you know that's another way of looking at this and going about it but um there are going to be you know a lot of\nOf changes here I think as\nAs Brett Kavanaugh takes a seat on the Supreme Court you've had reformers for the last decade pinning their hopes on on the Anthony Kennedy in a national standard there that road for a national standard\nAppears to be closed and in fact I'm you might now have five justices on the court who found on the very idea of independent commissions at all so what you might be looking at\nOur legislative fixes as well you know something that opens up the process that you know guarantees transparency that you know mandates that\nAre folks who are joining these lines can't favor or does favor any political party or candidate there are all kinds of supercomputers that can draw you know twenty five thousand sample lines and perhaps\nForced politicians to test the extreme districts that are they draw up against non partisan lines right so I mean I think we're going to have to look at other ways of doing this especially as we run out of states that are allowed to take this on the ballot\nIn our time is short but read Wilson I wanted to get your sense about how the U.S Supreme Court has factored into redistricting it has never struck down a map for partisan gerrymandering whereas now a new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh on the court what's your read of the future of redistricting gerrymandering figuring out this whole thing before the U.S Supreme Court\nYeah as David Was mentioning I we were we were all sort of waiting for Anthony Kennedy to come up with some kind of standard that could be applied\nAcross the country but to a number of cases in places like Virginia and North Carolina have been reminded back to lower courts so we're still waiting for a a real honest to God challenge that actually makes it to the Supreme Court ah and and resolves itself in some way other than a sort of a punch back to a to a lower court\nAnd you read I I I'm Sorry to interrupt I Know we're short on time but it seems like the issue is really just trying to define gerrymandering in a legal sense like we have an ... definition of obscenity from Miller versus California Nineteen Seventy three like there's a there's a checklist literally there's just a checklist you'd go through something is obscene if but\nWe don't have a checklist to define the line between redistricting in gerrymandering\nAnd and and we don't even have a definition as to whether or not gerrymandering is illegal or or a unconstitutional and by the way let's also defined the phrase fair what are we looking for when\nWe talk about a fair redistricting process is a compact districts is a district that ah encourage competition I'll tell you in my home state of Washington this the commission that gets together\nIs appointed by the house and Senate Democratic and Republican conferences\nThey get to get those four people get together and elect a fifth\nA nonpartisan person they always come up with a five to nothing map that that everybody gets along with and their goal is to create a a district that will be or at least a few districts that will be democratic any few districts that will be Republican so that Washington state has a member of the majority party in Congress or that they can\nGet something back in ... when\nA when they need to but the fact is you know what is fair is it is it competition in November is it having representation from minority groups there is a district in in the Chicago suburbs that looks like an alligator with his jaws open that district makes sense\nBecause it's about Seventy two percent Hispanic so be very large Hispanic population in Chicago that lives in different neighborhoods has a representative in Congress I'd argue that fair\nOne last question David daily that we've gotten quite a bit of you mentioned computers and I asked\nInstead of allowing people to redrawn districts why not give the task to artificial intelligence they could probably draw much fairer evenly distributed lines based on square mileage and the process would no longer be partisan David I Wonder if the challenge with that is figuring out what to tell the computer to do or are we at that point now before we let\nThink I think read is right I think that there are so many competing values here and that people have to decide what values they want\nOut of representation these are very basic questions and sometimes those values are in conflict with one another uh do you want districts that are contiguous and contact\nThat well a district that is compact around the city might you know simply elect all Democrats a ... I'm ... so those districts might not necessarily be competitive I'm so a lot of these values our intention and we as people ought to talk about them and work out\nAt those values supercomputers are amazing in this though I think what they have done is they have shown\nThat the maps that politicians that produce\nAre very extreme and in a state like North Carolina or in Michigan you can run you know twenty five thousand draft maps off of the criteria that the politicians are given\nAnd you can see exactly how ... ... you never get the extreme outcomes on one hand if it could work into the process of supercomputers that would be great but I Would not turn it over to them\nAnd before we go speaking of Michigan Katie fake if you're initiative passes\nWill you be involved with the commission in any way will be next for you briefly\nThe biggest thing is if you want to make sure that people now know that they can serve on this commission said well I got out and keep raising awareness that you can apply if you're registered voter\nAnd then also then people actually for the first time be invited into this process so they can go and get testimony about how they want their communities represented so we're going to make sure that we're making sure that uh people now that they could now be involved in redistricting\nSci fi he of voters not politicians ... will send up the hill and David daily a fair vote thank you all for speaking with is the show was produced by James Morrison Daniel night and stuff collect to learn more about them and the rest of our team visit the one a dot org slash staff\nUntil we meet again I'm Joshua Johnson thank you so much for listening this is one [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the joy foundation committed to advancing racial equity and economic mobility for the next generation and the great lakes region learn more at Joyce ... dot org\nFrom Jane in Gerald catcher supporting the children's movement to Florida dedicated to helping all children entering school at the social emotional and intellectual skills needed to succeed more information is available at children's movement Florida dot org and from the listeners who support this NPR station\nGood evening if they'd been nine and you're listening to eighty nine point three K.
