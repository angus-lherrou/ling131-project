{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Attracts support from people who even from people who consider themselves to be a gun rights proponents I don't think anybody wants\nTo see a guns in the hands of people who have already been determined to be a danger but um you know through the legal system so uh I think that's another area a much like the you know it's related to the red flag laws where there is room for a agreement there and compromise\nWe stick with you one second Scott since you mentioned red flag laws more cheapest tweeted how do you determine mental illness for red flag laws I have a mental illness have never been in trouble are not violent I Love guns and weapons in general and also want gun control but what would these laws means for me Scott\nWell each uh each state I mean the laws are going to be the details will be different in each state but generally speaking um [noise]\nUh and Chris of maybe could give a little more detail on this it's a family members or police officers determine or or believe that a person might be a danger to others or to him or herself then that would trigger the the red flag law and of course the details as I say differ but that's the general idea\nChris yes thank you that that's exactly right and I I think that what's important to note is none of these states that have passed excuse me\nA red flag laws have the issue has mental illness as the defining feature for the issuance of a ... what we're calling extreme risk laws it's actually at risk behavior\nThat is noted by family members or police that is the subject of the order is the subject of the court hearing for the record I think it's very important to know the vast majority of individuals in this country who have a diagnosable mental illness do not connect any kind of crimes with a gun\nAnd so I think that it's ed concerning I don't want to have the idea that somehow\nThat focuses on mental illness it's that focuses on at risk behaviors that indicate that the person may be suffering temporarily uh from some kind of crisis and that guns and it should not be in the possession of the person during that time\nTo get in one more comment from Kate in Tallahassee, Florida keep posted on our Facebook page\nMoms demand action is working hard in every state across the country to advocate for meaningful common sense solutions that Americans overwhelmingly want\nWe support legal responsible gun ownership but we know we can do better to keep firearms out of the hands of dangerous individuals while we were happy to see the Florida Legislature passed meaningful reform this year we strongly disagree with the idea of arming teachers and will continue to fight against this dangerous proposal\nRichard let me get your response and of course I'd also like to hear from you too and she talked about kind of the politicking on both sides\nThe Brady Campaign in the house we're partnering on a new campaign called end family fire that's related to the safe storage of guns Chris I'd like you to tell us more about this campaign in the moment but first let's listen to part of the ad and then Richard I'd love to get your reaction was [noise]\nThe guy the guy with a\nWhile he was a kid on the campaign\nNo no absolutely not it's not a toy you know ask you I Am a ... year well it's not any way I needed to protect your your sister mom\nFrom bad guys like on TV about charitable faint and guys you got there I have to\nPretty visceral campaign Richard I know we're low on time but what do you make of it\nIt's true when children have access to guns I'm horrible things can happen um\nYou know we should one of the things that we could do a much better job in this country is instead of always thinking about having to our criminal law and making this illegal in this little thing or legal why don't we collect smart American sometimes\nAnd use our tax laws and encourage people to do the right thing not just say it's illegal if you don't do this I mean we could encourage people to buy\nA firearm locks and sit in a safe to keep their guns and give them tax credits why don't you start thinking like smart people again in this country\nOf course we're low on time but let me give you the last word on this and and whether or not there are certain states that you're targeting with this and particularly candidates who may have campaigned partly on gun legislation before we got to go\nShore I just want to say Richard I'm with you let's work on that together but the epidemic of gun violence we have in this country requires multiple solutions not just one and family fire is so important to us because we have lost\nAn opportunity for a long time now with Congress shutting down research into gun violence et cetera to really push information about safe storage four point six million children in this country live in homes with loaded and unlocked guns eight kids today\nIn homes across America are shot

and I'm not sure if this is something that can be addressed through legislation\nIs that when the chargers rage against Harvey Weinstein and Les Moonves there was a similar story and that was that if you said anything about them or fought off attacks your blacklisted is that still a concern that people who speak out are jeopardizing their careers\nWell there's absolutely the risk of that happening but this legislation is\nA glass ceiling break I think for vulnerable people in California and I think it's going to allow for people to find their voice stand up and say enough this happened to me you know and of course there is a concern about that and I\nI had to weigh that when coming full of the year ago um and I just thought this isn't just about one story and one person and what happened
