writes ... jingle jing theme songs like the one for papa patrol the kids' cartoons drawing Nick junior he works with improv groups including the upright citizens brigade he has his own music group teammate where there's old girlfriend Danny bunch or he posts hilarious tweets and helps contestants on America's got talent do their best\nFor the one big moment before an audience of millions\nSo I don't know what's going to come at me in any given day um and there are things that sometimes I just have to like fake through and wing it a lot of times it's a frantic pace so that's like hey you know we had this act coming in there only here today\nWe're going to try these six songs to see which one sounds best sometimes we have opera acts and I got to play also a meal and sometimes we have ... so a lot of time spent on Spotify or YouTube learning songs\nFigure out the court progression sort of you can hear a song and start playing as well that's how I learned ... mostly I quit lessons growing up a lot so I was never really like a classical guy always learned by ear\nShrinking ... yes and I ask you about your ... oh yeah\nUm [noise] I was born with a genetic hearing loss and for Eighteen years all the way through high school was really reluctant in the eighties and nineties to get a hearing aid because it was like you know one of the big behind the ear hearing aid technologies moving so fast um\nI ended up getting one small one I had that for years in just a few years ago I got these two little guys and ah yeah they're super\nTiny they go all the way in my ear and my work that yeah they uh they're very tiny or yeah and I can hear you\nWith them out it's just kinda muffled she's got a lot of people when they knew that as a kid would rule out a career in music I\nI don't know it just it was never a point where it was like do you want to do music or something else that was always like I just knew I mean I think maybe for a moment when I was eight I thought I wanted to be a veterinarian or astronaut but I think I always knew I was going to be a musician so it wasn't\nEver a do you want to do this or should you do this it was a really hit the parent lottery like the parrot jackpot by like they supported me very early on to do what I thought I needed to do what I wanted to do\nYou've made a life of music yeah luckily and and luckily\nI mean I'm Glad to hear you say that cause you to hold everything I'm very fortunate I mean I'm always well aware\nAnd I try to like help people that I can uh when I'm In a position to I mean this isn't a normal I tell my friends whenever they're complaining about something like I didn't get this job or I think that it's just gig that in music and like yeah but\nDo you know crazy this is we get to do this like it still feels weird to me like LA I Love LA I've been here ten years but it still feels like\nI Can't believe I live here I Can't believe I live here and I get to work and music so even when I have those days where I'm like oh man I got to get some work sooner things get rough I'm Still thankful that I get to do it and make that choice\nYou are here in this vast human community right LA yeah thriving with ambition and talented ambitious people\nAnd you are trying to help some of the most talented door as I don't have to tell you in the talented or sometimes the most vulnerable we aren't they yeah but you have a big responsibility I mean yeah\nYou know this show is really special because there is people from everywhere that they might be the best in their town they might want to karaoke contest in their local bar but to put it on the stage making if they can make it resonated across America\nA lot of this job is therapy like right before they sing and we're in a commercial break is live on TV and their freaking out and I just go up and say hey you've done this\nTwenty times this week like you got this just remember just setting yourself what is this all mean to you it's not about getting the right notes it's about\nConnecting with the audience making them feel something it's not always about being the best singer perfectly executing a song it's about the emotion and that's really hard to quantify into coach into someone and and I'm not taking credit for doing this all myself there was a team of people that's helping do this\nCan I hear pause patrol ... what is it ... ...\nSo he I think from my friend wrote it and I said the demo for it so I could probably like\nBut not use this weird like weird voice that's not really my voice and I went in and I sang it for like twenty minutes and I was like cool what ... what was that and get some Nickelodeon show we don't know they didn't think it was going to be that big a deal\nAnd then the next you know like people that were listening to my band in college now had kids and they were like hey I listen to you at West Virginia University\nNow my kids with you every morning or I get messages going I'm going to murder you if I hear that song on one more high today I Will tell our listeners let them play this one last time I mean\nBe there on the other\nAround and then shipping I miss it up rather and his
