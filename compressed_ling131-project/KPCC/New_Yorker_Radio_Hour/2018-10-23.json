Oklahoma he's also a former teacher and a member of a F T he told us about legislation that he will introduce next year that would repeal his state's right to work amendment\nThe right to work past in two thousand one it's been nearly\nTwenty years and when you have an experiment that has failed I think it's worthwhile to go back and to look at the facts and to see it it has it increased wages has it helped with unemployment and the answer to that is no so when you have to show to experiment I think it's worthwhile for\nAnd I think it's also fair for the people to go back and have the opportunity to correct that mistake and so I Am going to introduce a house joint resolution\nThat would have to be voted on in the house in it and approved by the governor and it would go back to the vote of the people to let them reevaluate okay it's been Twenty years how has this hotel has helped working class people are still the wage gap how is this working class people have consistent hours\nTo be able to support a family on one job how safe working conditions once they account for all of those and they can go back to the polls and cast their vote on whether or not they'd like to repeal the so called right to work\nThat's Oklahoma democratic state rep Mickey balance who was also a former teacher and member of a F T not to be confused with Mickey ... for those of you who are fans of satirical sixties rock music\nWe heard from some of you about these efforts to roll back right to work laws one listener emailed\nI live in Missouri where we just had a right to work vote on the ballot and overwhelmingly failed\nThe Republicans who constantly are trying to tear down unions and claim right to work is good for every one are constantly offering exemptions to police and fire unions from white to work laws if it's good for every one why offer exceptions also Republicans say they will keep forcing this issue on the ballot even though it failed\nOverwhelmingly Scott do you have any sense\nOf what the future of right to work might be like in states like Oklahoma Missouri and others\nWill certainly the Missouri a vote that you just referred to offers a hope to um to unions and pro union I'm\nA people across the country I mean that that vote the Republican legislature in Missouri approved a right to work bill and then I'm\nA people who oppose that decision were able to gather a tremendous number of signatures and and put it to a on the ballot and it failed overwhelmingly something close to Seventy percent of Missouri voters voted against that so I think I'm\nA certainly if you are a pro union person that offers you some hope and then also to talk about I think one of your callers said about\nUh wages and I'm\nA oh you're the Oklahoma legislator it is the case that these states that had these teacher walkouts largely over over stagnant wages West Virginia Oklahoma Kentucky Arizona all our our right to work states so I'm a you know that that might support his uh his point of view\nI Know we're a long time but Vince in her new show I Wonder what you make of the decision in Missouri not to become a right to work state\nWell first let's just talk about some of the the wage issues that were brought up\nA wages are actually going up faster in right to work states than in non right to work states and I mean even in Oklahoma Oklahoma wages have out paste the majority of non right to work states since that state a gay workers the freedom to choose a well over a decade ago\nUm and so workers are making more and right to work states and uh you know Randy is out there in New York City and she can probably tell you how much rent is how much groceries are of a catch is that in non right to work states things were more expensive so yeah workers are making more in New York but everything costs more\nYou'll forgive movements and I know we're very short on time I Wonder what you make of Missouri voting against becoming a right to work states\nNow well listen I mean there is a ... a lot of reports and how much money was spent but you know summer three to one summer five to one when you get outspent by that much with misinformation like uh like we were just talking about with right to work in wages\nIt was a tough race but um you know I could see it coming back and other states are still embracing worker freedom are still looking to give workers the ability to choose\nAnd when they do we do see wages going up and out pacing those in non right to work states rainy before we go so\nWages in right to work states are three point one percent lower than those in non right to work states the point is this\nPeople as one of the when as Sarah said people join unions because they want to have a better life\nAnd unions help them and their families have a better life\nAnd they help the people we serve like kids have the resources that we need and that is why people are sticking with unions all across the country we have not seen a drop 'em in any significant way and in fact in lots of places we are growing because people need it says thank you for having us on\nScott before we wrap up what should we be looking at going forward any other Janice like labor cases to watch out for a big difference in this fight over unions and right to work\nWell certainly some some a pro union people are worried that um that the Janice case is just the beginning that people are opposed unions would try that that case applied just to the public sector and um even though a since the new deal there has been in the Wagner Act this uh\nEnshrined in law that the guarantee a for private sector employees to unionize certainly there are fears that among the pro union folks that there will be further efforts to undermine that\nScott Greenberg or executive editor of state line Scott thanks for talking to his thanks very much for having me Randi Weingarten president of the American federation of teachers thanks Randy

joining us there's one show on television that never mentions the name Donald Trump or for that matter anything related to our current political reality and yet it feels like a series that is utterly made for this time in American history\nThe NBC show the good place which launched in the fall of twenty sixteen unfolds each week as a moral philosophy lesson wrapped in a TV sitcom anchored by the co stars Christian belt and Ted dance and\nThere's actually a character named shady played by William Jackson Harper who was a moral philosophy professor and gives tutorials on ethics to the others\nAnd whether you realize it or not ask you watch your learning something too\nWe recently visited with the creator and show runner of the good place to make sure and would Jens ... who was a writer and producer on the show shorter created a good place after his previous series parks and recreation ended stats ... also worked with him on that series\nBefore we began talking about how they we've ethics in comedy short told us about a recent invitation that he'd gotten\nI was invited because of the philosophical discussions take place on the good place I was invited to attend the annual conference of the national association of Star Trek scholars\nIt is ... is is not a joke the highest honor I've ever received my life I could not be more excited it's it's in Fredericksburg, Virginia\nAnd I and Mary Washington University I'm flying there and two weeks with Todd May who is a professor ... who's an advisor for the show\nWho is actually a search or scholar so he eyes I when I was invited I said it's very flattering um you should\nIdeally invite one person who knows what he's talking about to this and so I recommend it Todd which it worked out perfectly because he works on the show and he knows the subject matter so the two of us are going to attend this annual convention and it's going to be amazing\nI think it's fair to say that philosophy is more than a Trojan Horse in this series that in many ways if you know about philosophy and care about philosophy and care about moral arguments that you can really engage with this show on like probably any other primetime show\nHas that been something that you always intended has it been more uh as that response been greater than you initially expected\nI don't know what I expected frankly it was just always the way the show was was that it was\nBaked into the premise it wasn't like a thing that we were going to kind of dabble in or that was like um like on the surface there was the idea here as always these shows about people trying to be better in whatever way\nThat meant to them to be better people and the way they're sort of lends we were looking through his ethics you know I did a lot of research about the afterlife when I was first developing\nCompanies and individuals and people in Hollywood say we're not going to tolerate terrible behavior in exchange for either successful product or just creatively interesting product and thank\nGoodness Mike let me ask you this last question I think what's interesting and this is totally anecdotal is that the show was watched by families how unusual is that for you\nTo have a show where families watch a show that's hitting people at very different levels based on their age their education and where they are in life\nThat anecdote of like I watch it with my family has been said to me about parks and recreation it's been said about Brooklyn nine nine um it was that about the office which I did not create or adapt that was great Daniels but I wrote on that show\nAnd um I think that if there is just sort of unifying idea behind all those shows it's that first of all there on NBC and so there's less you know cursing and nudity and stuff and parents feel like it's a little bit safer even if some of the humor is a little bit more adult but it's not so adult that you have to worry\nBut I think that those shows are ensemble shows they have a large number of characters who represent a large number of viewpoints on the world um and there is some kind of unifying theme there that I learned from Greg which is that\nYour life use your relationships with other people at some fundamental level that is what makes your days pass it is your sort of bonds with other people that matters in the world and so\nI Would guess in this I'm not a psychologist but I Would guess that if there's a reason that families gather to watch those shows that has something to do with it [noise]\nMike in gender thanks so much for but I've come to the
