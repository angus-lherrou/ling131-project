weekend long bonanza of interviews and live events of all kinds Sally ate sat down with a legal analysts Jeffrey to bill\nGates is a former deputy attorney general and she served under Republican and democratic presidents but now she's emerged as a prominent critic of the Trump Administration\nAnd her name is being whispered as a possible candidate for high oh now that's a possibility she usually down place but she has been shut down entirely\nHere's Jeffrey ... even a staff writer at the New Yorker\nWith Sally [noise]\nWas born and raised in Atlanta Georgia she went to the University of Georgia she went to the University of Georgia law school and in Nineteen eighty nine she became an assistant us attorney or in the city of Atlanta\nShe prosecuted a lot of big cases including Eric Rudolph who was the white supremacist to bomb the Nineteen eighty six uh Olympics and in two thousand ten\nPresident Obama appointed a Sally the U.S attorney in a in the northern district of Georgia which is ... and in two thousand Fifteen she was confirmed as deputy attorney general of the United states\nAnd on January twenty two thousand Seventeen briefly but eventually she became the attorney general of the United states and that's where our story is going to start January twenty two thousand Seventeen where were you what\nHappened well I was you're right I was serving as deputy attorney general and there is a tradition at the department of justice that in the transition Tom and administration said deputy attorney general the prior administration serves as the acting agency for the incoming administration\nUm to to maintain continuity important in any agency particularly the OJ\nBut there's another tradition as well which is nothing happens during that time\nMy chief of staff told me I Would have nothing to do so there would be plenty of time or in her words long boozy lunches\nOkay on January twenty four four days later Michael Flynn the incoming national security advisor was interviewed by the FBI the next day the twenty fifth the FBI came to you at this seems like a lifetime I Know I don't know if ancient history but you yeah trust me\nYeah okay okay um well an issue had arisen with respect to sanctions that President Obama had imposed and that actually had been had strong bipartisan support on sanctions against the Russians based on their interference in our elections and\nUm it was very strange that despite the imposition of the sanctions the Russians didn't do anything in response and so the intel community was trying to figure that out and in the course of that discovered\nThat Mike Flynn who was going to be the incoming national security adviser um had been having discussions with Mr Kislyak was the Russian ambassador\nUm essentially imploring him not to do anything in response to the sanctions\nBut then the situation got a lot worse\nBecause people in the administration starting with Sean Spicer and others and ultimately come the culminating vice president Pence\nUm went out and were telling the American people that there had been no such discussions we knew because we had recordings of these conversations that we weren't the only ones who knew\nThat General Flynn was providing false information sensibly to people in the administration who were then providing false information to the American people we weren't the only once he knew that\nThe Russians knew that too and because this had become such a big public thing this is precisely the kind of information they would love to be able to hold over the head\nOf the national security advisor which made him potentially compromise compromise it's it's a black male so what is what happened to 'em so I contacted Don McGahn who White House White House counsel hum and told him that I needed to come see 'em right away\nTold him what we have learned that\nYou know the vice president have been on face the nation and saying you know I've talked to a General Flynn personally and he is assured me that there were no conversations about sanctions so you got the VP out there saying this step so we told\n'em Mr McGahn how we knew that it wasn't true how we happen to have recordings of these conversations and why we thought it was a problem\nAnd and you go see him a second time on January twenty seven yeah he asked me to come back and ... was that different are the same or what it was it was a little\nDifferent in the sense that um\nHe was a bit more combative I guess I Would say in this discussion and I you know testified before this sort of one of his first questions was what's it to the department of justice if one White House official live to another and what did you make of that um\nUm what about um the role of Rod Rosenstein Rosenstein\nDefinitely has raised the profile of the attorney general's you thought you were famous Rod Rosenstein is maybe the most famous are in America he he is because the attorney general sessions has recused um\nHe is the supervisor of Mahler investigation and how do you think Rosenstein is handled that\nI think he's done a really good job of that um I think you know\nYou've known Rosen some yeah new and back when we were U.S attorneys together and the Obama administration and so I'm known rod for a long time and like I Know everybody for a while was so focused on making sure that we protect Robert Mueller and goodness knows I think we need to protect Bob Mueller but\nIt's equally as important to protect Rod Rosenstein right now because he really has control over what ultimately happened in this investigation\nI mean in fact the report that Mohler writes doesn't go to Congress it goes to the deputy it goes to his supervisor who was like are the attorney general so you could have a deputy attorney general who receives the report and says thank you very much puts it in a drawer and that's the end of the story\nAnd that certainly seems to be the course that our president would think that that person should take\nWell it does seem like a I mean the president has\nAll but written on a wall is\nGoing to fire the attorney general\nThe midterms and you think it's going to fire Rosenstein too\nYou know far be it for me to get in Donald Trump's had a nice walk them both up to the guillotine multiple times now only to then pulled back\nUm so it's hard to know if it's one or the other or he does it in a swim for neither and he just continues to torture them um it it it's kinda hard to know which whatever I think he thinks will be best for him\nUm the the president appoints the attorney general is he the president's lawyer is he the people's lawyer what's what's what is the role and what's the relationship what should it be because it's it's not a simple thing you\nKnow and and and I get that a lot of people might look and say look the department of justice is part of the executive branch just like the department of agriculture commerce or any of the other agencies and you answered the president or the president's lawyer\nThat is so not true and\nI remember actually when I first became us attorney and we all went to the White House for what was essentially a photo walk 'em with Eric Holder the attorney general then and you know we're all lined up in the bleachers in the East Room there for the president to come in and and [noise]\nYou know he comes in and and he looked at us there and said look\nI have a pointed each and every one of you and I know you're going to do a great job but there's only one thing you need to remember and that is\nYou don't represent me you represent the people of the United states and as long as you remember that [noise]\nThey're going to do your job and everything's going to be OK so\nTwo thousand nine yeah\nMe read you I'm a ... I'm from from President Trump um which which relates a little into the criminal justice or dementia\nI'm very sad that the FBI missed all the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter this was the Parkland shooting a high school\nUh this is not acceptable they're spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign there is no conclusion get back to the basics and make us all proud\nI I Know you're a it's just you can't be at a loss for words the New Yorker festival okay\n[noise]\nSickening I mean he's taking a tragedy where children were killed and he is using that tragedy to attack an investigation of his own campaign what what\nEffect do you think this the kind of criticism of the OJ the criticism and the FBI has day\nTo day well let me see what effect I don't think it has for okay I don't think it impacts the substantive decisions that are being made bottom line prosecutors on the line agents their\nBooks having confidence in the O. J. and and the FBI that has real life consequences of agents come knocking on doors to try to find witnesses or others to provide information and cases when you were selling that kind of distressed\nThat has a real impact on public safety when juries are sitting in trials and are hearing testimony from FBI agent and they're thinking about what their president is sad about how you know they're liars and all you know part of the deep state trying to undermine this administration\nThat can help but have an impact there and I think that you know the public's confidence in our criminal justice system is essential for that system to be able to work\nAnd that to me is one of the ... the great tragedies of all of this is how that's being abused ... one of the things I really worry about is where are we win this administration is over I mean what's the new normal at that point\nWhat have we sewed to based not just public discourse but the the dignity of the presidency and Congress and the department of justice and others that\nWe look and are entirely different than we were before\nHow's that for oh God oh my God [laughter] cut to present myself [laughter]\n[noise] um you you are now a partner at ... big firm and a lot of 'em want you to run for office is that going to happen [laughter]\nI Do I get that react I pander with the rest of them yet so I'm\nYou know when when people have mentioned that on I'm incredible flat or don't even feel like the right word there I mean it it means a lot to me that people have said that they would like me to do that or would trust me to do that um public service absolutely I mean that's in the heart and I believe in that\nRunning for office just feels very different to me than that I just have a hard time seeing\nRight but if but if a different president wanted to call you back to Washington wouldn't be out of the question for you to go\nOut I Believe in public service Barry [laughter] [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\n\nThat was the deputy attorney general briefly ever so brief the acting attorney general Jeffrey to the New Yorker [laughter] [noise]\nWe'll hear one more conversation the festival rely performance with Vincent Cunningham talks with E R B singer ...\nNext on the\nLine from Baton they didn't say no no he will do it when\nThe New Yorker radio hour is supported by the wall Street Journal providing news and insights about global markets politics tech and the arts\nThe wall Street Journal read them viciously membership options and more information at W.
