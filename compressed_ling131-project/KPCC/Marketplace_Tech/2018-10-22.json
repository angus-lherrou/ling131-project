loco Nevada for Nevada senator Dean Heller President Trump had this to say about the caravan\nDemocrats don't care about what\nThey're extremists immigration agenda will do to your communities do\nYour hospitals what about your hospitals and Jews schools\nThe Democrats don't care that a flood of illegal immigration will bankrupt our country you saw this I Want to see the bridge over the weekend did you see\nThe bridge yesterday and today I mean is is that an incredible situation it's sad and I said obviously it said from both sides have said from the site also we got\nTo figure it out I'll be honest with you I've already figured it out [noise]\nDon't make a lot of people out President Trump campaigning for\nNevada US Senator Dean Heller ... el ... joining me to talk about all the politics of the past few days Carson Bruno Pepperdine University where he's the assistant dean and adjunct lecturer lecturer in the school of public policy\nFormer research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford as well Carson good to have you with us morning and Matt Rodriguez democratic strategist founder and chief executive officer of Rodrigo strategies Los Angeles a former senior Obama advisor in two thousand a map good morning\nAnd when I'm Carson let me start with you about the um the caravan President Trump has has really pushed hard or on the caravan and on the illegal immigration during these campaign rallies what's your sense of the traction with a Republican leaning voters\nYeah no I I think first definitely we need to recognize that the this issue is a humanitarian crisis not just their security and immigration issue that has really been the focus politically coming out of the Trump Administration are particularly around the concept of the midterm elections um\nThe setting that aside from looking at it through the political ends it definitely does play to Trump's base I mean he has I mean since the very day one when he walked down or slid down the escalator of launching his presidential campaign and then throughout that entire campaign in into his presidency\nAh the immigration issue particularly legal immigration issue has been um a top issue for him it does play to his base it plays to really kind of rally them together really get them really motivated again a there's been a constant theme about the Democrats being a lot more motivated than Republicans coming into the mid term elections\nAnd we're kind of seeing that possibly being reversed on single bit more enthusiasm from the Republican base but also just given the nature of how blatantly um\nIllegal or the caravan is acting both with crossing the Mexican border and then heading toward the the us southern border it really plays into possibly swaying some of those more moderate independent voices um and voters who may not have been on that side with the Republican base\nWhile and the lack of of the Mexican government really doing anything to stop that sort of pass to get on through to the U.S to the radio when I'm that's an issue that's going to definitely rile up Trump's supporters Matt do you think the caravan helps Republicans in the mid term\nI mean we'll have to say a women's did the numbers started to come out in the bottom of immigration has been the kind of North Star for this president from the beginning and there's a variety of issues that he touches on but immigration was the genesis of his ah launching of his campaign and it has sustained him\nWhat you're seeing in the final weeks of the campaign you see Democrats trying to stick to issues 'cause they've been doing very well and bread and butter issues and sort of around with the revolt and by the ocean to a lot of what Trump has done and so they're trying to stick to health care they're trying to be a counterweight to Trump they're trying to to talk about society as political norms and bring back sort of effective government\nI Would ... contrast no to the chaos that Trump has has for the broad of a first couple of years\nWhere Trump Republicans are trying to do is push us a little bit more culturally and sort of touchstone issues because as\nThen this is not just for Republicans this happens most ah off year elections for president as you've won the election it's much more difficult to get your voters out to be seen as Obama had historic loss in two thousand fourteen two thousand ten it's very rare to win in off year elections just goes all the way back to Franklin Roosevelt\nAnd so it's going to be fascinating to see if Trump can do to the radio the Brett Kavanaugh said it was kind of a\nA bit of a boon for them because I put it into a more cultural context where it's much more black and white for voters and that was pushing Republicans and they're hoping some folks were uh were are kind of soft in terms of voting pushing them out and now we're seeing immigration is caravan so he's going to be talked about crime that Democrats are pushing folks terrorism\nAre now what is going to work or not I don't know but but everything from sort of Hillary statements and it was a war and stuff over the last few weeks", "year": "2018",
