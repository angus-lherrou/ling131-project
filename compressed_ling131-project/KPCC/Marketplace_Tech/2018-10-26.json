I think that the clearly the president has the ability to say that there's a danger a risk\nTo American safety and close the border\nAnd he has to make that fighting and use that as a reason he cannot use is a reason that he disagrees with asylum we are bound by both federal law and international treaties to recognize the right of asylum so if it really depends on how he characterizes this but I think we end up that if the president doesn't the right way\nUm than he can be attacked on policy grounds are attacked politically and the fact that there is not enough reason\nThe board but if he says that there's a danger to American public I'm off the border he can close it\nNow the uh several hundred troops that have been discussed potentially being sent to the border active duty military these are not reserves reserves have been used in support positions at the border I'm so let me take a hypothetical let's say the president says\nNo asylum consideration no one can come in if you had large numbers of individuals attempting to force their way through border crossings into like could the military legally be used to stop entry\nThis is somewhat unchartered waters under the what's called the plastic coming Titus act back in the winter for bees Hayes era and reconstruction\nI'm there have been sort of opinions are raised by congressional staffers and others that would say that an immigration action you cannot use\nCurrent us troops and the idea is that you don't want to use us troops for criminal law enforcement you don't want to use us troops ... at the fear because you don't have the rights of the accused if the army is arresting you as opposed to a law enforcement agent so whether\nWhether the army could be used for people once they cross the border is\nProbably the answer is no would anybody have standing to sue maybe not but maybe somebody who has been arrested by the U.S army could seek a hideous corpus and they have a court declare that they were apprehended illegally that's the only scenario I can see where this will be challenged\nA minister von Spakovsky I'm I'm assuming again that's all I put that ethical but President Trump would say well this is essentially an invasion it's necessary to have the military to defend the country's interest in borders um what do you think the legality of that\nWas up to him as a way that you're talking about a\nTroops at the border preventing people from crossing the border or a arresting people once they get into the end of the border as as professor a ... a said correctly you know we have this law the parts of comic Titus act that as it says you can't use military troops for domestic law enforcement\nBut I think the president actually would be corrected arguing that he's not using troops for domestic law enforcement he would be using them to prevent aliens from crossing the border and look there's a Nineteen fifties a landmark\nCase a called a ... offers a shot to see in which the Supreme Court said that the exclusion of aliens\nIs a fundamental active sovereignty and that it's inherited\nIn the executive power the president's control the foreign affairs of the nation using the military\nFor foreign affairs purposes in this case uh preventing aliens from crossing the border I I think that he can do if he wants to station so a dairy troops you know a hundred miles back from the border do arrest or illegal aliens once they're in their country I don't I don't think he can do that but at the border yes that he can do\nAnd ... and the other thing to point yes professor ...\nHas been reported is that they there may be a different theory that the troops might be sent out to provide logistical support for border patrol and ... meeting not actually are", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Marketplace Tech", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "26"}
