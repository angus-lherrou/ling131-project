{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Of um how justice Kevin Oh like a Justice Thomas\nGorsuch Alito and Roberts um view particular provisions of the constitution those provisions that the framers left purposely ambiguous such as the word liberty and the due process clause\nSo it might be more helpful to think about the court divided between those justices to have a broader view of what the word and liberty and the due process clause protects and can first to citizens and those who have a narrow\nView and when we start to say that versus liberal or conservative\nWe could very squarely identify justice Cavanaugh is a more reliable judge who's going to more reliable in interpreting the word liberty narrowly so if that's reproductive rights or marriage right that once you hone in on these particular subject matters then we get a\nBig sense in in a in a in a very clear sense of how having 'em all the the court loser Justice Kennedy who had a had a very broad view of what the word liberty means it means that\nThe state can't prohibit as same sex marriage it means a that while Justice Kennedy uh was in the middle on abortion rights he was none of the view that roe v Wade should be overturned 'em and or that it was incorrectly decided to the extent that he would want to have to turn it so\nI'm so I think that narrow view of liberty is where justice Kavanaugh is going to be a very reliable vote with Thomas Gorsuch Alito and Roberts and I think that says a lot\nFor what we would expect in on the second amendment I Would say something similar that what we do get from justice Kavanaugh Second Amendment decision and it's in distant when he was on the court of appeals is that the test he would apply in Second Amendment case\nThis is the one that puts him very squarely with Justice Thomas in justice\nGorsuch it's one that's going to have a very narrow view of when the government can impose gun control and while I agree with professor ... that there will be some\nRegulations in prohibitions on guns that all of the conservatives slash um I Would say I'm a broad view of um of when you can carry firearms or have very firearms um they would agree on with everyone we would hope that there'll be some things\nThat everyone on the court would believe are beyond I'm beyond the pale it\nWhen it comes to firearms justice Kevin has already put in writing or that he has a test that will mean that many efforts to regulate guns even register them um will will fail and that um localities like Los Angeles\nHave more power to regulate firearms when justice Kevin I joined the court and we and just because it's just generally more unpredictable about a number of things\nAs a wouldn't that be a broader view of liberty though when it comes to gun owner rights\nAnd and so that's a very specific constitutional interpretation point the um the second amendment right to bear arms comes out of the second amendment when I say this view of liberty and talking very specifically about the word liberty and the fourteenth amendment and the due process\nClause got it the difference between anemia rated writes in a new rated right God in unless it and so the marriage rights case and the reproductive rights cases like roe v Wade come from that word liberty and the due process clause\nIn the ... yeah a literal usage of it in the clause we're talking with loyal opera desert Kimberly west falcon also with us Barry McDonald's Pepperdine University law professor thank you sir for being with us\nHow do you think given his rulings and his legal writings justice Kavanaugh ... will likely I'm related to his his fellow conservatives\nWell I you know he strikes me being sort of a strong will you be a tradition of a justice Gorsuch and a\nMaybe a Justice Alito in that he he paid a lot of attention to a text you arguments from a historical perspective as well as originalist arguments and I think he would say that uh he advocates disorders rain in the same way that uh you\nKnow the other conservative justices at least ... report to do in in certain cases\nSo I I I don't think there's any question that I'm In most cases there'll be reliably Sunni I Do agree with professor ... professor ... you can never predict is on a case by case basis but you I think you can predict overall trend that will be a pretty solid and we can so rooted\nIn and when you say judicial restraint um this the idea that a judge you shouldn't do you know go too far beyond the actual text of the constitution and in in making law\nAbsolutely and this this comes up most often in a ... professor west welcome was talking about in terms of the clock rights particularly\nA subset of due process liberty rights are such as abortion", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Marketplace Tech", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "09"}
