{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "We ah had a good turnout at those locations last weekend and then at the polling places on election day while the voting experience remains the same in LA county as it was in twenty sixteen uh we've beefed up our um\nAs as a nearly an indicated in orange county we'd beefed up our our security mechanisms are are training a poll workers and the resources that are available to voters that those at those locations so we see a a large percentage of our mail in voters who prefer filled it take a ballot in\nAnd drop it off um either at a polling place on election day or you have over a hundred and fifty ballot drop off locations throughout the county or to kind of\nAppeal to that voter who likes to receive about through the mail but still wants to put it into a ballot box when they when they mark that\nBad as challenging as election days are for your office back in June ... you had a particularly rough day with over a hundred thousand\nRegistered voters who were accidentally left off the rosters at polling locations and and of course they were still able to vote with provisional ballots and to have their votes counted some people do said they were told well they've been were registered they couldn't vote were given improper information they said\n... what was the upshot of that what caused the problem and what\nA fixes had been put in place to try and avoid that\nThat was a that was obviously a significant issue in June and and one that we take a very seriously and it turned out that that was a ...\nThe compatibility issue between our local election management system that produces those rosters and the way it interacts with the new statewide voter registration data base uh we've addressed that through some\nUm you know tried to address the compatibility issue those systems that but more importantly through our quality assurance mechanisms and uh and just\nBasically pouring through that data and doing a better job of checking all the data field it was sort of an innocuous um issue that that resulted in that in June so that's been addressed um as you pointed out though I think it's always important especially a week out before the election a conducting an election in any jurisdiction\nIs a is a major undertaking and we still rely on\nReally manual processes and are distributed method of of delivering service we have over twenty five thousand poll workers out there at four thousand voting location so\nIt's important that we have backup plans and that that really is what the provisional ballot his foreign California that sometimes gets confusing in a national media because other states have different rules more restrictive rules about provisional voting\nBut it really is the failsafe method in California so while that\nIssue in June of resulted in about twelve thousand voters who had to vote provisional ballots that were ultimately counted in the election or we don't expect that to happen uh on Tuesday but we want voters to know that they won't be turned away from a polling place so any issue that they're experiencing on election day we have a backup plan to address\nJohn ... really important to stress so even if one of the volunteer poll workers gives you an indication oh you know you can't just remember you have the right to cast\nA provisional ballot you will be counted once they confirmed that you are on the voter rolls in all of those are counted there's another sort of myth that well if if there aren't enough provisional ballots that would switch you know a particular election\nThat they would not be counted that is not true a and a dean I'll let you reinforce that but you get once it's verified you county every provisional correct\nThat that's absolutely correct and um you know it's funny and I think Neal would would say the same thing we are always surprise every year to hear ah that that myth repeated that that and actually we hear that even with regard to vote by mail ballots that that people say well we we don't think you count those unless there's a close contest\nNothing could be further from the truth we we in California have a uh as you know in a long gated post election cameras period that ensures that every valid vote is counted in the election\nProvides for auditing and accountability of that on and while that is agonizing for candidates and sometimes for the media it really is that mechanism that that that guarantees for all of our motive is that if you show up and cast your vote and have your voice heard on election day we're going to make sure that that voted included in the final returns of his election\nWe're talking with dean Logan registrar Los Angeles county and Neal Kelly the Orange County registrars not like to hear from you any questions you have about early voting voting by mail any questions you might have based on previous experiences voting at your local polling place\nPlease give us a call both gentleman would be glad to answer your questions even if you're not a registered voter in one of these two counties if they're more generalized kinds of election questions I I Do Neal or dean should be able to answer them if they if they are more generalized and not specific to a given", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Marketplace Tech", "city": "Pasadena",
