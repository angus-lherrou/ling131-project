{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "In states that Trump overwhelmingly won and twenty sixteen I think there's a hope that one or two of them like potentially Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia will also vote in favor of cabin out but it's really you know all eyes and everything that's being done this week is on making those senators feel comfortable enough so that they will vote for him\nA unity interview on sixty minutes last night with Scott belly democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware a talked about\nA is trying to change Senator Jeff flake of Arizona his mind about voting for the uh moving ahead the nomination of judge Kavanaugh without a further FBI check if you look at our voting records\nAnd our backgrounds Jeff as a genuine conservative I'm not we don't vote the same I mean Ninety percent of the time by by hearing each other um our common faith in our common enthusiasm for making a difference in the world of\nHelped us trust each other and there's not enough of that in the Senate and there's not enough of that in our country\nNancy Cook political White House reporter so what's been the response from Republicans to what flake did at that eleventh hour on friday\nWell I think that they were surprised by it and and they would have preferred to vote but at the same time you know as I said there's just really a handful of people who are determining whether or not that vote is going to move forward and it's like it's one of them and he holds tremendous power now\nAnd he's exercise in it I think this week my understanding as I've been talking to sources in the White House and on Capitol Hill license\nThat they're really trying to stay in close touch with the heat senators senators like Murkowski cons to make sure that when they do try to act and that's the issue is over and they do try to move forward about there's no more Eddie is a surprise as they want to make sure that whatever demand they have they know about that now\nAll right and again Nancy co foreign let you go what ... where does the the evidence comes from that the FBI is I'm allegedly being constrained in the investigation is there some memo that was obtained or where's that come from\nWell I think that's really coming from the Senate and the white has a sort of blaming each other and then meanwhile Senator Feinstein last night of California is requesting what does a written document that says this is exactly at the scope of it because I feel like there's not clarity yet like we haven't seen a document that laid out what the scope is\nAll right Nancy Cook thank you so much appreciate your being with us today\nAnytime thank thank you political White House reporter joining us on TALK\nAnd just talk with us about the attack the FBI has in its investigation or reopening the background check of judge Kavanaugh's Luke ... with Radford University in Virginia assistant professor of criminal justice\nAnd was a supervisory special agent with the FBI for seven years professor ... thank you for joining us\nMy pleasure thanks for having me on so I share what is your thoughts first of all about that the allegation that the investigation is is uh being limited just to interview for individuals does does that sound I'm likely to you that that the FBI would observe limit like that\nYeah so I I Do think it's unusual both in terms of the scope and the timeframe I mean generally when we think about these kinds of investigations we think of them being led by the evidence right so the other evidence um a\nDictates where agents skills so that is unusual and the other limitation of course is the the timeframe I mean in a perfect world we would want I'm much more than a week to to uncover and to follow up on these many many leads\nUm that being said FBI is equipped to do things quickly um they respond to these things in a in a in a in a fast men are when they have to a terrorist cases a good example so they have the tools to do that but I think they're being limited in a way that they're ... they're not accustomed to because they generally want to follow the evidence\nAnd oh what is the the likelihood they would be examining um judge Kavanaugh's calendar in greater detail that they'd be looking at the employment of\nMark judge a that was raised in the testimony by professor Ford on Thursday um are these the kinds of things that would appear they would be able to pursue\nYeah I mean I I think in a in a in a typical case you absolutely would in fact you might want to do those things before you talk to the witnesses so you have more evidence to go into an interview and you're more equipped for that these are all a examples of things that can corroborate\nProfessor force testimony or perhaps contradicted so um\nWhether that's with the scope I don't know but that's certainly an area that the FBI would want to look at 'em under normal circumstances before they go into those witness interviews", "show_name":
