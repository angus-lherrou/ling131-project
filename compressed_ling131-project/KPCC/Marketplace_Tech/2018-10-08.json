{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Point in time dealing with All right let's move to a new topic um voters you know have a right to know who you guys are what your values are what how you work what kind of governor you'd be because if you when you're gonna have to work for the legislature and you're going to be appointing department heads and all this stuff federal question a different question for each of you starting with you Mr new some\nThroughout your career you've had a series of public's bats shall we say with a elected officials were supervisors when you were mayor\nA there are a lot of back and forth comments ah and sometimes when you get asked a tough question by reporters you didn't like it you were you know someone said them again\nAs lieutenant governor you had a difficult relationship with Jerry Brown at the beginning you tangled publicly with the state Senate president pro tem over gun control yeah and you and also a back and forth with the speaker Anthony rented over single payer so my question is like what are you know what does that say about your ability to get along with the people you need to get along\nWell I I get along extraordinarily well with the legislature currently I get along and got along very well with most of the members of the San Francisco board of supervisors but I'm interested in change\nOr you know changing the order of things as difficult some people have different points of view\nOr the speaker is a different point of view on single payer financing or members of the San Francisco board of supervisors at different points of view on homeless strategies and different points of view on health care strategy so look I'm In a certain myself I'm going to be bold are not many people came to my defense when we advance same sex marriage you didn't include that you should because the overwhelming\nA majority of Democrats in this country some of the most I think well known democratic leaders were very very critical publicly of my willingness to lean into that\nI took on the national Rifle Association and they weren't pleased by a those efforts to require background checks not just for gun purchases but now I mean there's some purchases so if you're looking for timidity I'm not your person if you're looking for someone to be bold and courageous lean into issues changed the order of things I'm committing myself to that causes the next ... do you think\nThough that you can be bold and not timid without getting in ... with\nYour aggregate periodic look I've been doing this for some time and there's there's areas of disagreement and sometimes people are disagreeable my intention is to go together and not go alone learned a lot over the years and uh my approach and what didn't learn from\nExperience I think at the end of the day and you know there is that African proverb or that is if you want to go fast go alone but if you want to go far go together\nYou know I when I look back over the course of twenty plus years I was married a relatively young age and there was a desire to do everything all at once and I think issues of prioritizing bringing people into your vision making people feel part of the team those are all lessons those are all attributes I Hope to bring the\nGuard our question for you voted out did you want to see going really well yeah I just wanted to emphasize that\nYou know I come from the private sector where I have to work with people and get things done and achieve results and I've done that for forty years and not everybody in my team agrees with everything that we have but we what we got to do is we got to get people allied around common goals and try to figure out ways to reach those goals and I think that's what I'm gonna do is governor\nOur and for you I have a question about values you started off your political life as a Democrat you ran in Illinois to be a delegate to the Nineteen Seventy six democratic convention and then he became a Republican you ran for local office in Chicago and then the U.S Senate from Illinois guy named Brock Obama won that\nAnd he ran for president in two thousand Seventy thousand eight\nAnd I just wanted to read refresh some of the points you made during those times you said or we need a federal marriage amendment to keep the same sex couples from marrying you said we have a and I'm quoting we have a problem with transvestite teachers [noise]\nAh you said that if we don't use common sense we will quote open the floodgates polygamy and ... and all kinds of other things and you know I could go on but I'm I'm guess I'm asking is what is\nWhat does that say you've got your values and about your um your kind of governor you\n... your ... specifically referring to uh you know the issue of gay marriage ... during the others well maybe so but you know the fact of the matter is that uh there were many many years ago I have a bald on those issues and frankly just like a rock Obama and Hillary Clinton who both oppose gay marriage of very strongly for a long time they evolved ... changed but\nYou know I think the the thing to take away from all that is at all the way through my efforts to be in the past\nI've been fighting against the establishment about corruption or you know my mom was a Chicago school teacher that's what led me to want to fight corruption is the corruption of the special interests that are making California too expensive\nAnd too on equal for people and that's what I'm gonna attack in California as well\nYou say you've evolved in that's fair uh although a ... he was mayor at the time that you said those things it wasn't a like in a long long time ago I mean\nSo maybe so but as as recently as a two thousand three and two thousand four block Obama and Hillary Clinton were both against gay marriage so\nAre you know I have all been on those issues ah and ah and I think they are not going to be germane to this I think the important issues in this race or the affordability for people in this state the ability to live a productive life and afford gasoline and water and electricity and\nYou know uh the failing schools that were having to put up with I think those are far more important issue Scott", "show_name": "Marketplace Tech", "year": "2018", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "08"}
