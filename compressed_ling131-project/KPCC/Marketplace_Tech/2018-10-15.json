{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "... I mean this is the area where the president can towel to what's happened during his\nTwo years in office the stock market has boomed the unemployment rate is down into historic levels\nAnd you've got a an economy that you're seeing wage growth after significant period of stagnation so I'm ... ... ... as you look at that aspect year if things get\nDicey with the economy does that potentially you take away the big thing that the president asked to doubt\nWell certainly the economy is always one of the top issues that voters evaluate the incumbent party whether it's the president or the party that's in majority on and in this case they're going to want to stick to a what's working and what's happening which is why it's surprising that Trump would come out and criticize the fed so ah extensively\nWhen the market is going to move up and down and when he has been making lots of appointments to the fed so a lot of these folks that are on there are are his appointments um\nThey need to stick to the bigger picture and so reacting on a day by day basis of whose fault it is that the market dropped um is just ridiculous and so if they take that broader picture I think they're going to see that the fed knows what they're doing they've been in a long period of market growth\nAnd they're the ones who who have been helping control things like inflation and job loss not necessarily the actions of one particular president or Congress and so it's better to just sort of get out of the way and let the news on the economy unfold\nAll right we're talking with professors Matt Barreto and Jack Pitney it's our weekly Monday round up of all things political you can comment on the dog page KBC C. dot\nOr you can also join us with your call at eight six six eight nine three five seven to two UN ambassador Nikki Haley announced last week her resignation effective at the end of this year if caught seemingly everybody by surprise except for President Trump\nA professor ... your your thoughts on um what this means for the Trump Administration and and her potentially bright political future\nWell yes you someone who is generally respected within a bipartisan circles and I think that un job\nOr is definitely an important one for a resume builder for a career builder and so I think a lot of people are asking sort of what's next for Nikki Haley and what's floating around right now and sort of political circles is that is Lindsey Graham\nThe senator from South Carolina is heat potentially on a short list due to join the Trump cabinet there's always turnover at the sort of two year mark at the midterms and of course we know who's at the top of that list is Jeff Sessions\nOr and so is Lindsey Graham going to become the attorney general perhaps and does that mean there's an open US Senate seat in South Carolina is that what Nikki Haley was thinking I Would keep my eye on that I wouldn't rule it out as a crazy conspiracy theory I think there is some thought that Lindsey Graham of buttering up to the Trump Administration\nAnd that would leave Nikki Haley the former governor of South Carolina in a very good position perhaps to become a U.S senator\nJack Pitney what do you think about that scenario\nUh ... most likely route to the U.S Senate or otherwise uh Lindsey Graham has indicated that he wants to stay in the Senate a long time the other senator from South Carolina Tim Scott isn't very old\nUh so unless there is a a gram appointment to a Trump cabinet she might have to wait a long time until there is an open Senate seat a so that would that would be your best and easiest route to national office\nWell yeah and if if if she is looking at a presidential run 'em you know some some time down the road here I'm ... first of all do you think that\nHer standing within the Republican Party jak if she decides six years from now she's going to run would um put her in good stead in a Republican primary\nWell she certainly hasn't done anything to hurt her prospects within the Republican Party on the one hand uh she uh had a a reasonable record as governor of South Carolina or something that you could characterize as extreme\nOr the other hand uh she was very complimentary to a President Trump and hasn't antagonized or his supporters of the trouble is a six years is a very long time in politics and she has a very high standing now booked a\nWill people will remember her in six years that's another question\nWe of course had the swearing in of justice Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court last week he started hearing cases\nJak I I I Wonder your thoughts about the political ramifications of ah the deeply divided confirmation process of Kavanaugh a voters can have short memories but this was so intense do you think there's lingering effect on the midterms\nAre there seems to be a lot of Republicans were saying this was a energizing their base because they believe that Kavanaugh was treated very unfairly and that was a common theme of a Trump and his uh uh his retinue supporters", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Marketplace Tech", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "15"}
