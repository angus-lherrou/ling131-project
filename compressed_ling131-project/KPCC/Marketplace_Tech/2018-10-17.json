I'm I guess circumspect about our ability to get that through the Senate\nBut nonetheless I think we can mitigate a lot of the damage that is being done and with that seat now in the budget process\nUm even if we have one house even without the other in democratic hands we have much more leverage in the budget process and would that leverage you can make sure that agencies are doing what they should and not doing what they should\nCongressman you do you think that it's a legitimate concerns the Republicans have had about\nUm what's come out of the FBI with a certain statements agents have made in prominent investigative positions about the president's ah about his fitness for office or the size of warrant for Carter Page and and get a using at least as part of that\nUh the so called Trump dot CA you think that this is just totally about protecting the president as opposed to uh\nSome legitimate concerns about whether there's the FBI bias in the investigation or\nI don't think there's evidence of FBI bias affecting the investigation and do that was the conclusion of the independent inspector general so most of this is is essentially flak that as being um shot out there in order to help defend the president or help in order to help distract you\nKnow I I Would say that the text messages um that we saw from Lisa Page and Peter Struck I can understand why people would look at those in and say okay at least in their private lives they clearly didn't like Donald Trump didn't think much of him\nThe question is did that translate into any kind of investigative action and inspector general found that no it did not and\nSo that's all we can ask for ah it's I think that certainly true that federal employees whether the FBI or the intelligence community or or the U.S department of agriculture are entitled to their own views about eight or is it like any other\nWay went beyond that though because trucks that something like will stop in something like that now that might not have lead to any direct action but it certainly raises flags among Republicans that there might have been settled ways in which the investigation was somehow tainted as a result of that expression\nYou know if that's certainly raises that question um and for that reason we had an independent body look into did it in fact have that impact\nAnd what the inspector general found was that no it didn't um as best they can determine because of the decision making the investigation was made by a collective body um in which they were only one or two voices and not the deciding voices\nThe inspector general ... was a this didn't affect the direction of the investigation um a lot of the other material that's been put out there\nAbout the Carter page Pfizer application or has just been false and fraudulent ah it has been the selective and misleading characterization of a classified material uh and that's frankly has done such a disservice not just of the country but\nTo our intelligence agencies and their ability to do their jobs because now the intelligence community\nUm and sources to the intelligence good to have to wonder whether or if the political winds change they could be expose their identities can be revealed um that is a road in which our committee never went until the so called Newt as memorandum a that's a road hoping never go down again", "show_name": "Marketplace Tech", "year": "2018", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "17"}
