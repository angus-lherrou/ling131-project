I think you're right that there is no uh there's no really direct quotes that are terribly\nA damning in context about drinking he admits that he drank he admits that he\nUh went to parties that other people around him were doing that I think the difference here at least as far as Democrats are arguing is that he is also intermittently argued that he was more of an angelic figure somebody who is more consumed with school work and in athletics and things like that\nUm they think that that's not comport with what classmates have said both on the record and anonymously and these reports so it's not even strictly just about the drinking but just about his character I'm ... and I think that this again goes to credibility we can talk about these things and we can parse each individual statement\nThat he made 'em but this isn't really about drinking this is about whether Brett\nKavanaugh has provided an accurate picture of himself as as you know put forward denials that are accurate or and Democrats know that their best way of of hoping this is going to be to call into question\nThose denials and so that's why I think we're focused on that that's why I think we're seeing focus on what he wrote in his ... year book and various claims that he made about those things because that's really what goes to credibility in this case\nYeah I'm just for those who weren't necessarily following that there were a number of references in a year book a Kavanaugh's uh classes your book\nThat I think most people would take a sexual references that judge Kavanaugh in his testimony\nGave other interpretations to a than sexual ones back to the issue of of drinking though Iran um it it seemed to me that that the Asians as he was the answering questions about his drinking where he launched into\nUm you know all all his accomplishments uh scholastic Lee instead of directly answering about his drinking\nUm that even though that was um I think you could argue with vase and\nHere it seems that his underlying argument was look if I if I was drunk all the time how could I have accomplished this I must have been able to study I must have been able to work hard and do all that\nAnd with the things that we read about his classmates friends they don't undermine the aspect of his hard workers accomplishments they just make claims about what they said they saw in excessive drinking so again I'm I'm not sure that there's a direct contradiction here\nEven with his invasive nests on the extent to his drinking your your thoughts era yeah\nI think you're exactly right the the invasive nests there are certainly indications including coming from an NBC report last night uh where he doesn't seem to have been particularly forthcoming even when he talked about uh the Deborah Ramirez allegation when he was being interviewed by the Judiciary Committee shortly after that came out [noise]\nUm the but there is a difference between not being forthcoming and perhaps being a little bit misleading", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Marketplace Tech", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "02"}
