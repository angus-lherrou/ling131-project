Edwards case that deals with three strikers the governors decided not to appeal that there's a separate case involving sex offenders that the governor has decided to appeal so there are two cases one involving sex\nAnd one involving through third strikers\nWhat's wrong with allowing on a case by case by case basis the review of an inmate as to his or her propensity for violence the age of the inmates are to continue to consider these individuals' for early release if it's believed\nThat they don't pose a serious threat of committing a violent crime\nOkay first of all there is a is a complete misnomer that there are truly non violent third strikers first of all to be sent says a third strike or you've had multiple serious and or violent offenses in your past\nAnd then also after prop thirty six thirty six doesn't allow a non violent or non serious offender to be sentenced as a third strike or unless they pose a danger to public safety so the people who are currently in prison is third strikers\nHave either committed a serious or violent offense or a judge has determined that they pose an unreasonable risk to public safety so there's no there's no non violent non public safety risk people in prison after prop thirty six and all the reforms that have happened that are serving a sense it's a complete misnomer\nAllow it I'm not sure I'm following wouldn't you have individuals who back in the nineties were set in ... three strikes who you know obviously some of those folks are going to be you know a much older they're going to be older folks they wouldn't still be held after prop thirty six\nNo ... thirty six said if you weren't sentenced on a serious or violent a fence and you no longer a pose a risk to public safety you could be released immediately that's what prompted\nIncluding three strikes okay\nWell if prop thirty six was the three strikes reform act\nAnd it basically said in order to go to to sense to be twenty five to life as a third strike or you have to either have committed a serious or violent offense ... or a judge has determined that you're a danger to public safety if you don't meet those two criteria you were released from prison\nSo you're not currently serving a sentence in state prison right now after prop thirty six unless you've committed a serious or violent offense an aggravating factor applies\nOr a judge has already determined that you are a danger to public\nSafety now one of the issues of contention I Know has been about what's listed as a non violent offense or so is that likely in your view to come into play on consideration of who's release that debate\nExactly the problem is is a violent offenses under California is a statutory definition it's a very limited let me give you a list of some examples that these offenses under the law are considered non violent assault with a deadly weapon residential\nBurglary personal use of a deadly are dangerous weapon selling er furnishing drugs to a minor\nGrand theft firearm gain crimes drive by shooting shooting at a habit of dwelling shooting into a vehicle witness intimidation criminal threats stocking domestic violence with injury vehicular manslaughter while you're driving drunk and killed somebody\nTo me and to most laypeople does sound like pretty violent offenses to me but under the law in California those are considered non violent these are the type of people who are now going to be impacted by this ruling who are gonna be could be released\nA and onto the streets even though they're violent offenders in my book but they don't fit the statutory limited definition\nWe're talking with senior deputy da ... county district attorney's office Robert ... let me go back to Stanford University\nA hat or the three strikes project Michael romano's Mr Amano what those individuals convicted of those is their third strikes like assault with a deadly weapon firing into a a dwelling that sort of thing would they be eligible for early release", "show_name": "Marketplace Tech", "year": "2018", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "19"}
