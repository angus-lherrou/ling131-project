was absolutely adamant dash Thomas did not like adults was afraid of adults\nTheir world was just between the two of them\nI'd worked an awful lot with kids who were habitual runaways\nAnd they are either running to something or they're running away from something I felt that this was a very lonely very isolated the family you know the dodge um he had left them the mom was working three jobs he

used to literally draw kids into\nPeter file rings child abuse situations that doesn't happen every day but these are realities so the big question on everybody's lives was who is this child\n...

towards the family at this point and also I was starting to I I liked Gregory I thought he was a nice kid I thought he was interesting and funny and you know I kind of started to quite enjoy hanging out with them so\nAfternoon we want that for ice cream\nShane want it to see if he could get Gregory to open up a bit more about Tom and he did\nGregory he was really at that particular time enjoying games on his PlayStation and then he said actually Thomas doesn't have a PlayStation and he doesn't have an X. box\nAnd I said well what does he like them games does he play and Gregory told me that he had us Becky\nI immediately such um do you mean is that ... spectrum and he said yeah that's stuck since that's what he has [noise]\nSays that spectrum again ... of popular in the eighties\nAnd this is what really jarred with me he said the two games as he says or his favorites or manic minor on school days [noise]\nThat these were the two big games\nWhen I Would have been about Thirteen or fourteen years old so we're talking Nineteen eighty four Nineteen eighty five you know it was really fascinated with is what what else are they said what what's the a team Thomas tells me it's his favorite show again I'm bowled over the Eighteen\nSo but that was that's like an action show that was on again when I was a kid Gregory\nGregory mimic I'm One of the catch phrases from Mr T. set I pity the food he doesn't like the Eighteen\n... what the hell is all of this about\nThis child Thomas who was a huge Thailand a mystery and cryptic some things that I couldn't even understand who was engaging in all the things that I engaged with\nThere was a power to me that was drones\nBut hang on a menace we've stopped you getting out\nI said how are you seeing Thomas then he said to me the Thomas is guessing in [noise]\nHow do you mean he's cashing in explain that to me he said to me I wake up at night and he's in\nMy room ... sent a chill right down my spine I felt a very powerful sense of urgency that we needed to get to the bottom of this before something really terrible happened and I did I pushed him again you know I really needs to be shipped out he's just like no absolutely not ...\n\nI had come home quite lace one evening I'd had a really rough day at work and I kind of falling asleep and I I remember being woken up by my cell phone ringing it was or on the other end and she was really\nObsessed very agitated\nAnd she asked me could have come out to the house really quickly because\nSomething that happened a century and others should I call the police on my way out of somebody tried to break in she said no that the police can't help us with this and that kinda freaks me out a little bit I thought oh my gosh ... has got a I got on my car got out there as quickly as I could she brought me into the kitchen and she had\nAn old cassette recorder sitting on the kitchen table she said played us\nSo I played us how to actually pick it up and almost put it to my ear to hear what was being said gradually I realized what I was hearing with two distinct voices\nOne of which was clearly Gregory Gregory saying no mommy gets afraid when I go outside to play with you\nBut the other was slightly lower end sounded almost as if it\nWere coming from an older child and I could hear the other child's voice becoming quite annoyed quite agitated you know look you know you have to play fair it's your turn you need to come out with me now\nYou got the sensitive stood up and at that\nPoint on the recording I heard or less good reason why they're bursting it [noise]\nI heard her say Gregory or you will rice she told me that when she went into\nThe room Gregory was on his own what she said the window was open and on the road on the bedroom floor there was soil and pine needles and little twigs as if somebody who had\nBeen walking around in the woods had been standing there\n\nShane went out back and he did see a dream pipe running up the side of the house right beside Gregory is window he figures that was how ... getting in for the sake of the mom shame throughout another possible explanation\nCould at the Gregory pushing the fantasy to a new level where he's creation these two voices themselves but usually when children do that they're very very deeply psychiatric disturbed and that just wasn't Gregory\nIt was just telling myself that these are just too frightened little boys who had found each other and somebody needed to help the\nChange that down with Gregory again he had to ask Ken who he thought Thomas really what the word\nTo use is Thomas was from the woods [noise] almost as if he was a\nHarsh of the world to be honest with you kind of like they gave me the creeps to hear him say is\n'cause I I felt that maybe she did understand an awful lot more than we assumed he did\nShane haven't really talked about the situation with anybody outside the family\nSo he confided in the school principal who was also a friend and could perhaps shed some light on this mysterious boy who lived in the woods\nHe kind of suggested that I had some has stepped into kind of like a rural legend about a girl\nWho had become pregnant by her father the father had brought her residents of the woods to a cabin and he had captured there and made her house for a child in the shock and the story\nWent that she gradually became crazier and
