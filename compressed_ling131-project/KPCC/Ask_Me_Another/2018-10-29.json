{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "But where it gets complicated as with political gerrymandering which is where you're trying to map to discriminate against Republicans or Democrats\nAnd they're the courts have been really reticent to get involved that the Supreme Court kind of hasn't given a clear answer to politicians about whether this is okay or not and then the absence of that clarity\nPoliticians are kind of having a field day so I wanted to play a clip I read that really took my breath away the first time that I heard it\nAnd this is a state legislator from North Carolina David Lewis he's a Republican state rep\nTalking about how Republican legislators in North Carolina we're going to redraw the state's congressional map\nI proposed that we draw the matched to give reporters from that vantage to tune rope publications and three Democrats because I've not believe it's possible to Rome with love and ... ... ... to do it\nSo you actually found this on camera wasn't entirely subtle and not take them all of the ... yes yes if I could gerrymander any better I Would\nOf this is science friday from WNYC Studios talking\nAbout gerrymandering\nOh yeah well so those comments by representative Louis actually prompted a lawsuit by some North Carolina voters and and good government groups to try to get this gerrymandered congressional map taken down by the court\nSo tell me about this case how how does the ... fit in okay\nOkay so traditionally in partisan gerrymandering cases one of the things that they've had missing is is this question of how do you prove a gerrymander how do you actually quantify how much a particular ... is hurting Republicans or Democrats\nAnd and that's where math can really help math is pretty good at quantifying thing uh so in this North Carolina case one of the the experts is a math professor named Jonathan ... and he came up with a way to actually quantify how skewed a map is yeah it is\nTrue that would be the math professor you've made a calculation of probably straightforward\nStraightforward might be pushing it but the theory behind the calculation is quite straightforward because the case he's making is if you're going to call a particular map gerrymandered and said this map skewing the election results than it would help to know what a normal election result would have been for that\nYear if you're going to say something unusual in gerrymandered you'd better not what usual looks like and so the way he figures that out is he takes the actual votes that people cast and then election so like\nAll the votes that north Carolinians cast in the congressional race in twenty twelve\nAnd then he calculates how many seats Democrats and Republicans would have one if the district maps had been just a little bit different and he does this thousands of times with thousands of nonpartisan alternative redistricting scheme and then the ... you know well how different is my you know quote unquote average result from what we actually saw\nAnd what he found for example in that twenty twelve congressional race is North Carolina elected for Democrats to Congress and twenty twelve\nBut Jonathan saw actually are more typical result would have been six or seven Democrats so now he can look at that map and say you know what that mapped elected for Democrats it's unusual it's a typical and I'm able to quantify that\nSaid that that is what he set out to do is really key finding but it was actually something else that really surprised on it then when he did all of this um let him explain it\nI saw my doubts as to buy never changing a single vote\nBy only redrawing the districts I could change the number of Democrats elected from four to nine out searching and we would consider each of those you know we call it a wave election either votes right and extremes but with the same boat you can create a wave election for the Republicans and a wave election for the Democrats\nSo that that's kind of amazing Johnathan is looking at an election where the votes are unchanged one set of votes but depending on how he moves those district lines around he can create an election that's a landslide for the Republicans or a landslide for the Democrats that is how powerful gerrymandering is\nTo this this mathematician who's going to court with the stuff\nThat is correct so last October this mathematician Jonathan mattingley was an expert witness in a court case he actually took the stand on behalf of those North Carolina voters who were suing the state over the map and his goal was to try to convince the federal judges that hate this this map is gerrymandering\nThat have that goal for well we're hoping that you'll listen to the epicenter of this is Jim Lewis cliffhanger what you
