{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "That that just isn't true that doesn't have to be true anyway so what I say that yes it is very difficult to find the logic in a situation when you're feeling very strong emotions and that's where I feel that the mathematical discipline of obstruction really helps me because it means that I can look at a chain of logic\nAnd separate that out from the emotion so I'm not saying I shouldn't feel emotions but I put the emotions in a kind of different\nCompartments and think about the chain of logical steps and this helps me to understand another person's point of view even if I disagree with them very very viscerally and I'm very upset about that position if I ... from that I'm looking at that chain of logic step by step\nThen I don't have to feel what they are feeling but I can see the logic that they are using and those two things can be separate but then I can I can actually use the logic to be able to understand that point of view despite my emotional disagreement\nThis is science friday from WNYC radio [noise]\nAm Ira Flatow talking with Eugene Chang author of the art of logic in India logical world I think you know that is one of the hardest things to do these days is to just count to ten [noise]\nYeah that's a very important aspect of it because logic is a slow process and it doesn't happen in the format that is very popular in the current modern world which consists of a Mike drop or a one line or some kind of mean that doesn't have very many words in it or two hundred and eight to ... to tweet\nLegit takes longer than that and I wish that we could all take time to slow down our arguments so that we have time to explore the logic and build the logic\nMhm so you ... it's almost like mindful of you know you have to find a way to catch yourself\nYeah in a moment is yes it is a lot like that and I think that that kind of mindfulness can help us understand the logic inside out own emotions because our emotions are all coming from somewhere\nThere is something that is causing them and I honestly believe that when I see somebody who is feeling something emotional about something very differently from me if I Do that mindfulness for them even if they are unable to do it for themselves then I can start to understand what that basic belief is\nFrom which all of this is stemming and maybe I can see how that basic belief is different from my basic belief and that's why we had different we think different things not because we are logic is different but because all starting points to a different way\nOf about a minute or so left but I Want to I wanted to ask you about something you write a great deal about the logic of privilege relating virtually to race and gender is that an area specially ripe for a logical treatment\nYes the arguments are um I get very vehement and some people get very upset\nAbout the whole question of privilege and identity politics and I think it's important for us to understand everyone's points of view and often it's a misunderstanding about what privilege means because for example white privilege does not mean that all white people are better off than all non white people\nIt means that any white puff and if they had all the same characteristics and the exact same life except that they were black as well we would expect them to be worse off in society and so some white people get upset because they say things like but I I grew up poor and I had to work really hard so that means that I didn't have white privilege\nAnd we need to acknowledge the fact that indeed that all white people who are really struggling and we shouldn't let our discussion of privilege\nIt raised that fact that they're all white people are struggling because if we're raised that fact than they get angry and feel that they have been disenfranchised and that they have no voice but we need to understand that if they were black than they would have an even worse time and that's what the logic and the structure of privileges really about\nDr Chang thank you for joining us again as always was a pleasure to have you and thanks very much luck with the book Eugene Chang

a tireless fighter for science literacy\nSeeking to reach the public about the importance of science do any means possible\nIt's a battle to keep our science programs viable\nAnd that's one of the problems are I think we have there are obstacles\nTowards the goal we have and we think it's in a crucial goal is to prove or teachers improve education and get a reasonable number socked the general population the graduates of our high schools and colleges to be comfortable with science\nAnd to be skeptical that you can do everything with science what you can do and what you can't do this is a
