{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Is the same thing true of carbon it's it's better to keep it from being admitted it's much more efficient to do that than to try to suck it out of the year later\nThat's for sure absolutely certainly\nOn reducing energy demand energy efficiency and these are all going to be critically important efficiency of industrial processes um and I changing some of the behavioral changes that would lead to kind of more low carbon society would be very critical\nA martyr if later this is science friday from WNYC Studios\nI mentioned some of the uh the things we're watching now rising sea level the levels we are more devastating floods and we had a hurricane\nThat's now gone off the scale this week I'm In for some measurements are we not seeing is it not fair to call these consequences of of climate change were evidence more or less of climate change\nAbsolutely I I I think what's important um and I think one of the reasons why I'm this report on is really hitting home to people is that everyone is seeing the um devastating impacts them just one degree of warming\nAnd now we're talking with the current climate change commitments on even if they were fully implemented we're slated for two point seven to three point seven degrees Celsius of warming\nUm said that the world that um we don't know what that looks like I'm certainly that that's better than without the climate change commitments but we are talking about a tremendous changes\nUm across systems on and certainly we have lots of evidence that um the impacts unfolding around us and have a human fingerprints I and we can see the impacts of human activity I'm In a number of different changes including and storm activity\nUm in terms of the amount of time that storms are sticking around\nOn in the Atlantic the the frequency on the intensity of storms I'm the a sea level rise basically gives a higher on boarding for um coastal inundation I'm so we're definitely already seeing a lot of impacts on told her I'm ounce of rainfall\nIt's coming out of these that's right or it's just amazing but but you you scared me a little bit when you just said we don't even know what it would look like and it above two degrees Celsius and\nIt's so so on what we do have is we have some models that um look at what the projected impacts would be and um for some of these impacts we have more certainty and\nFor others we have less certainty they are also these so called wild cards on\nThat probably are are low low probability on but what had very high impact and where those thresholds lie on for some of those we are not completely sure so if you think about shifting of ecosystems from a tropical forest to savannah like state or because you have such extreme drought\nUm that would be not only catastrophic for the ecosystem and by diversity and services but also for carbon for carbon storage\nYou know and but frequently struck by people who say you know if we take it's going to cost us money is going to cost taxpayers money to implement some of these things we're talking about\nBut the other side of the argument never gets talked about it what you're going to cost in terms of lines in capital and movement of populations and farming if we don't do any of these things it's just it's so totally unbalanced on the other side\nThat's absolutely right and interestingly the report found that economic losses are actually much greater as temperatures rise and with middle income countries in Africa Southeast Asia India Brazil Mexico\nI'm projected to be affected the most um they looked at on global GDP losses for one point five versus two degrees and found that it was significantly different on a lot of these losses sometimes aren't even in the calculations to begin with\nA and I'm certainly if you have short term as um where you don't value later on economic impacts are as well as those that are harder to quantify um it doesn't get into the equation\n[noise] so uh you know we'll just have to wait to see what happens when we were because it's not a pretty picture the way we're it's\nNot it's not a pretty picture but there's there's a lot we can do and we must do a you know first time in terms of the international process governments in twenty twenty on are invited to up their commitments and to increase the ambition of their commitments and that is going to be really important\nOr what we know is the current commitments are not good enough to get us on track so I think on making sure that there's an expectation and a pressure for governments to do that on\nBut also for for people not to throw up their hands on because there is an incredibly were important role for everyone to play not on the government but the private sector and also individuals and I'm a lot of different things that individuals can do for sure most you know I was so I I was\nJust thinking individuals can do\nI I I was gonna say the single biggest thing is to to get out and vote 'em because I think we need to um make sure that decision makers are taking climate change incredibly seriously and really turning the admissions director around\nGet up there and vote thank you very much like to live and Dr Kelly living as a senior associated with the world resources Institute thanks for taking time to be with us today\nThank
