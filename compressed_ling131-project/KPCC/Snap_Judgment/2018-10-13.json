says on the guy had a different take on total strangers stopping by their house I was more\nMaybe more skeptical like nervous of a wire the here what's their agenda mhm\nHow can people come and meet with us if they don't want something from us their houses so crowded at the only private place to talk with her bedroom on a good match that on the bad Lonnie and Sandy and chairs and I can remember seeing a little uncomfortable and thinking to yourself\nWhy am I sitting here why not mine I with a family who are these people I don't know them but I I guess it might help but he was very overwhelming like I Can't believe that I have to sit and have this conversation what is this is my life now you know\nWas there a point in the conversation where it started to turn for you yeah I think I think when they when they said don't to join our organization now don't side and I'll just take care of yourself\nLet yourself grieve death questions about neck\nAnd before long they were just talking a money remembers asking if they were religious and if they ever got signed from Jesse he told match that like them they weren't but they took a loving loving as on low from Jessie the conversation went on for three hours\nYou know all our friends and family as much as they did for us and how much love they showed\nNone of them have any clue but we were feeling and hear what you people knowing exactly what we're feeling\nThey also made me feel a little more confident is I don't know if that's the right word you're in a club we all don't want to be and we didn't want to meet you we wish we would have met on the different circumstances but you have people help you with this kind of grief\nAnd a few days later when the online conspiracy started appearing about neck\nThat he didn't exist or that he was living in California\nThey remembered Sandy's morning\nIt was still upsetting but less upsetting because they knew it was coming they helped in other ways to\nThe door it took the Philips has advice and gotten to trauma therapy right away both individually and as a family\nThey're younger son Alex has been through a lot Nicholas his best friend was the last things necked it on a day of the shooting was walk Alex To his English class Alex was injured in the shooting and sat by a kid who died right in front of him and like I said managing her grief along with her son's has been tough\nThere was so much attention on Nick Nick Nick Nick Nick everybody came for Nick flowers for for Nick the letters were make I felt like you know I if this didn't happen to Nicholas in only this I could have been there for alec so much stronger and so much more so\nI was afraid that he would get neglected and all that\nI think sometimes children feel like\nWell you must have loved that child more than you love me then\nThe sun was twenty five when his sister died and he tried to talk to him about it which ended up pushing him farther away when she talks to parents who talked about her own mistakes to\n\nEight months after they first met which is still in touch with Sandy detector call each other every couple of weeks Mitch relies on Sandy more than ... who unlike him already has a built a network of friends she talks to all the time\nAnd then we tax that I think we texted yesterday it was eleven eleven actually was actually yesterday\nAnd I feel like she's still in it you know she's still with us She's someone who we can lean on and and give us support and I injured\nAnd want to hurt me maybe you know seeing us get stronger it gives her energy to\nHe's right about that Sandy spends almost every day at a tiny kitchen table or trailer fielding tax and phone calls from survivors and messaging with people on social media who ask for help\nThe pain is always there at the end of the day and when you go to bed at night when you first wake up in the morning it's there but you have a sense of purpose and that that helps\nA little bit of a lifeline or something oh it's total lifeline total you know if I didn't have this work I don't think I'd be alive I really don't and I say that to Loni all the timing us that you know don't you love

Culver City California I'm Janine hurts the clean up from hurricane Michael continues across several states at least fourteen people have died but rescuers haven't reached some of the hardest hit areas if you're a school Lawrence is in Mexico Beach Florida\nIt was rattling Lee scary and the bullet hit the wall Fifteen feet away so we all kinda got showered by rock fragments\nYou can't run away the port alleges are made of fabric on the bottom so you're half expecting bullets just revenue from the from the bottom up\nA second gunshot went off and at that point I could see that there was three people at the base of the class that we were on John\nDickey the photographer you had a long camera lens so he put it on his camera and he looked down and he did see the scary looking guys\nI'm with the guns and they were there were waving to us to come down and so John went ahead and volunteered to go down first\nAnd then he almost immediately radio up to me and he said hey these guys are they really like for you to come down and how to talk\nThey soon as I got to the ground was greeted by these are true\nGentleman who were wearing camouflage clothing I'm One of them had of Patagonia Gore Tex jacket on and it's a really nice climbing sunglasses and he had a tube of Colgate and according to his brushing as an of a pockets on his vast that he was actually quite proud of\nSeasons first thought was that these men were banned it but they didn't act like bandits they shook his hand and introduce themselves\nThere was a the commander who uh call himself Abdul there was the guy with the Gore Tex jackass sunglasses who his color beret and he was just overtly friendly uh he was grinning from ear to ear really happy to meet us\nThey they seem to have pretty chill attitudes but they had big guns [laughter] and so they're they're just basically like follow us\n... when I Do let them back to the Base Camp the glamorous had just set up a few days earlier they watched as a handful of armed men were rifling\nThrough their supplies do directed them to sit down next to another hostage and then into military uniform they recognized as the cookies officer issued their travel permanent\nBut I didn't immediately or register that in fact\nUm because when he stood up to make room for me to sit on his Rob I'm I noticed that he was covered from the waist down in blood he was completely saturated\nYou started pointing to the blood on his parents [noise] yeah it was it was\nThe curies office his name was drawn and he was signaling to them secretly that these kidnappers had already killed three other cookies officers\nI think he saw the look on my face which was probably action\nAny held up three fingers and many he swipe one finger across his throat\nIt seemed as if a blues men were not ... there was some kind of militant rebels and they were preparing to move the whole group somewhere else\nAnd if they want to move somewhere that means they have to be somewhat kind to us we didn't have a lot of things that we were going to be able to exploit and that was one of them we can export cooperation our level of cooperation\n... men broke down camp took all the supplies that could carry and began to march everyone at gunpoint over the rugged terrain the climbers and the other hostage trot had no choice but to obey and then suddenly above them there was a new even deadly or threat\nCourteous helicopters military helicopters started fly around overhead and that's when everything changed\nIt got really frantic\nIn what had been a silent Himalayan valley just a few hours earlier a firefighter wrapped up to a point it up to the helicopter in mind go hide or we will shoot due to the hostages ... suddenly they were dodging bullets from every which way\nThe helicopter was shooting from above and Marjory soldiers crusted hill and we're closing in on the rebels who are also returning fire and\nThat has this kind of the new things started to fly and\nThere's the murders and shoot it and you have this whistling noise you need to hear it coming\nFor you and then there'd be an explosion Mm\nI'm don't let the hostage to the Russians exacting from tree to tree and they ran for hours up and down sharp steep gorges alongside fast moving river\nSo we kind of escape the on the line of sight of the soldiers um and we weren't running across as plateau to the adjacent\nTruck came over and sat next to me\nAnd he put his hand on my knees squeezed it really really tightly\nAnd he looked me right in the face and he pointed across as valley\nAnd he said I'm going to die over there\nAnd that kind of degree I think anybody would do which is to lie to him and to tell him that we were all\nIn this situation together and everything going to be okay and uh he told me to shut up and he said listen to me I'm going to die over\nAnd that means that you need to do something about the situation\nOnly moments later a blues men motion for the group to move behind\nA large Boulder out that Boulder where they whistled at us and told us he got one of the time in ... was the first one to go I'm so ... went up there and then as soon as he got there they shot him point blank and that\nThe four of us um had to come up after that and sort of walk around the Boulder and see him lying there was a pool of blood coming out of his head and then we had to basically crouching lay on top of his body for the\nNext hour or two into we finally fled the thing you know the battle\nNights out and the adrenaline was starting to wear off\nWe finally got up to this rich where [noise]\nUm we were able to stop and sit down\nWe had a we had a break and there was kind of a very strange feeling\nThe crossfire has done the helicopter was gone but their food water and supplies for also gone\nAnd so we ended up with just a few things in our pockets which I think there's a power bars or a three musketeers bar\nUp to his men scattered during the firefight now there was only three men left up to himself to the shy one in a bear the friendly one\n... had a few pieces of hard candy that he shared he pulled five of them out of pocket any kind of looked around at the other people other than himself and you could see him during the math and he ended up taking one of the pieces and giving my friends that I the other four pieces\nAnd I think that for me that was a moment I knew that we could be that if we just played our cards right\nOf dull had relaxed a little bit the climbers we're no longer at gunpoint and there was an unspoken agreement that everyone stay together that is until they came to this river [noise]\nWas really fast raging river and they were having a hard time with it they started trying to\nFigure this just fallen trees and and and get it across the river to make a bit of a bridge and Jason I'm decided to this moment that he was going to help and I didn't understand why\nI don't swam and I'm like a cat in the water so I Would actually terrified so I've just committed I charged out there and I just grabbed\nThe laws and [noise] plowed into this raging torrent of water was like almost getting swept away barely able to hold on to the log\nAnd I got about three quarters of the way across and ah I ended up setting off the phone I'm planning into the main current and I was right at the top of a waterfall and I thought to myself like a nice for hideous because now you're going to have relatively drowned in front of your friends\nBut he managed to\nGet himself completely soaked but also get the get the log across the river and then get safely onto the other riverbank and not allow the rest of us to\nSort of walk across this logging get across the river\nAbdul came over and I was reaching out my hand\nAnd trying to grab his hand implementing the rock and he was terrified of rocket US law [noise]\nHe was very hesitant to grab my hand and I was trying really really hard to establish that connection that's if I wanted to even if you didn't need a hand I wanted him to have to take my hand to get up\nAnd ended up to be kind of a moment of brilliance\nAnd instead he reached out and they gave me a rifle and\nI was like well that's even better [noise]\nAnd so I check his rifle and I turned around and I very intently gave it to John and I said here John do you mind holding this for a minute and I think that's probably when John frame of mind started to shift and I grabbed up to his hand and I pulled them up and he was just so happy\nAnd smiling from the area and he was patting me on the back and asking me if I was a soldier\nThey looked at him and that kind of held up their guns and like just triumphant moment and they like padded among such shoulder and they're like ... like soldier\nLike they're like you you want to help our cars and the dynamic between the you know our captors enough completely changed at that moment they they actually believed that we were trying to help their cause that we were totally on their side\nOver the next few hours John the photographer tried to communicate to Abdul asking what the story was here and up to try to explain but he explained it as if he was letting them in on the rebellion\nLet out this horrible exploding sound go tumbling off again\nJohn says the same as just as possible\nAnd then um he facts or a photograph that the army sent through that was clearly sue [noise] and yeah I was astounded will never understand how he survived\nI remember um being happy that he I'm died for sure but really what made me more of that I you know I had the capacity I sort of had this like evil inside of me that allowed me to kill I think most people\nWonder if they were put in a live or die situation like this would they be able to react\nAnd I did like I was able to react in a way that saved our lives and so that there's always been somewhat empowering but you know I still didn't you know I didn't want to kill anybody I still would never want to kill anybody\nUm so I was I was happy to do that\nSo Jason and John flew back to Kurdistan and they were actually granted the meeting with the cookies minister of defense\nSo\nSince I had the ministry of defense and right in front of me I just went and threw it out there and said hey are you going to be able to ... visual name is ah Ruslan ... um and then he said yeah sure I mean it's written now good ten minutes from now\nThan they right to sue into the room\nAnd she or he walked in the room and he saw it and he smiled and [noise] uh we had we he gave us a big handshake and then we sat down and had a sort of brief an awkward\nConversation um is the first time we've been able to talk with an interpreter and we apologize I said hey sorry about that whole like you know off the cliff kind of thing and he had he had to laugh when I said sorry about pushing it off the cliff any kind of shrugged his shoulders and ... on the same thing [noise]\nUm and I guess for me that was probably the most valuable\nPart of that interaction and the most viable partner\nWalk away with it\nKnew that he was facing the death penalty for half a dozen different charges you know invading a foreign country\nCan people kept to all the kinds of things and I felt really sorry for him he was a Nineteen year old car really had a real innocent kind of air about him I didn't want to say anything in front of the army that might contribute to him getting the death penalty [noise]\nUh [noise] no [noise]\nUm it just seems to me like that's how the circle of violence continues\nMm [noise]\nThank you Jason Smith
