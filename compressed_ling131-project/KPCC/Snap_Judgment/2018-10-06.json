around me was Russian some sounded an echo radios I Do remember hearing my\nBrothers and my sister and my mom [noise] get out of the house and get out get out\nThere trying to push me toward the front door [noise] my dad still stand when I looked at the gun opened it ran downstairs by this time I'm On the front porches hot summer day he comes to the door I'm On the ports are still days of a sudden

call from the from the detective\nAnd he's trying to talk me out of pressing charges at the behest of my mother who at this time no longer worked and needed the alimony alimony and a child support [noise] from my dad so now she was planning on me [noise]\nWhat matters most to me was [noise] was that was that my mom and my brothers and my sister are fine\nSo I agreed to drop the charges at this time\nA victim can agree to drop the charges in da with and pick it up it's not so these days\nShe was released that day\nSo I I ah I left home um legacy filled up but\nNothing else I left Detroit ended up in a homeless shelter I couldn't hold down a job\nFor the next several years afterwards uh all I can do\nI was very concerned with the fact that I didn't have any any family in a in a angered me [noise]\nI made sure I got plenty screwed up every single night of the week so I began to party allied um raves and LSD and ecstasy\nForty three now\nTrips me out\nBack and that still does history we're not married\nBut she and I have been together for seven years now and we have a wonderful son awesome kid man the complete opposite of what I was his age happy my son\nHe looked at me one day when I yelled out to be sure [noise]\nOh my God that was me I looked at my kid in a hundred or so sorry\nI Do not want to make you afraid of me but sometimes I've been afraid you know that\nI become my dad\nI'm not asking anything if you but just hoping that by reaching out like this the ideas will somehow survive I Believe in ideas and that they really can change human destiny yours and hope and gratitude catcher rain\nThere isn't a catch ... our Denis says well Colum wrote to Cynthia specifically is because he read something she wrote for the Washington Post that stuck with him he seems Ernest when he says that he is and reaching out for attention but as one last effort to get his were seen\nBut it was the first time I'm writing because this is my last day on earth that rang through Cynthia had\nAt first I thought well okay\nAs I realized that it was someone who really was potentially going exist in first of all and was going to do this I actually started to get jobs are somewhat angry but I thought who does those who does this to a total stranger and it sounds callous in retrospect and I'm not proud that I had that initial reaction but a\nFed up enough or angry enough that night that I thought there was nothing I can do about this this person is in Japan I don't even know really a substantive way to try and reach this person if I wanted to and I clicked my laptop shot and I put it on the floor next to me and I went to bed\nBut Cynthia didn't really sleep that night and in the morning and she felt terrible for non reaction and she started trying to figure out what to do with all the way in Japan and as far as she was concerned she was the only one to get the email but about that she was wrong\n[noise] that morning about a dozen people all across the world got the exact same ... somewhere in Japan and China and various cities across the U.S [noise]\nMost of them didn't know each other all they had in common was that they were writers and then at some point they wrote something for the Washington Post\nMy name is Darren horn and I'm a novelist\nWriter Darryl Horne was at home trying to get her four kids ready for school and she decided to just take a quick look at our inbox\nWhen I looked at my messages I saw the title of the message was saving all like I say\nI have people throwing lego at me and the sort of thing while I'm reading the message you know and fighting about who's going to get in the car first in this kind of thing and the person who's writing to me saying this is my\nStay on earth [laughter]\nWell there are debated what to do around the same time in another city entirely a guy named Ron Charles opened his inbox\nI'm the book editor of book world at the Washington Post we get you know you can imagine hundreds of pieces of mail there every day from people desperate to get reviewed or published\nEverybody insist that\nThey know that we get a lot of pictures but in this case their book is really special and if we would just read it if we could just open it and read that first chapter you know we would see but you know if you get thirty of these measures as a day for Seventeen years it's easy to get you know a little skeptical\nHere's ... again it almost felt like an emotional mugging but it's also a little bit um [noise] I don't want to say manipulative because that that implies a kind of malice that I don't think this person had but it felt unfair I feel guilty even thinking of it that way because I Know that's wrong to feel that way\nThere are Cynthia Enron never met each other all they had in common was the Washington Post and now they all had to figure out what to do about this email\nI was just looking for clues in the email is how I could find this person she mentions that he was in Japan or he gives it provides an email address for his ex wife\nSo I wrote a brief no to this woman I just said you know do you ever met them you're mentioned at the bottom of the suicide notes\nI forwarded the message I said I received it is disturbing message\nI Hope that you may be in a position to help this person\nIf there's anything you can do this isn't anything we can do please let us know you know Ron Charles Washington post and then\nI just moved on with my day\nCynthia do want to ignore the email at first did some extra research to find out who she could contact she poked around on line and found a relative of his knees on Facebook and messaged her\nIn the messages since he apologized for getting in touch this way and then explain that she thought Denis says ... should know that her uncle might be in serious danger [noise]\nI remember that was a snow day in Washington and\nMy daughter was off school so I just close my computer and I took her outside and we played in the snow and I remember laying on the ground and we made snow angels and I just thought God I Hope this guy is okay\nCynthia didn't hear back from done is not the next day or the day after that or the day after that\nCynthia didn't stop thinking about him and then one day she heard back from his niece and she\nSaid thank you for reaching out to me I Am Dennis Williams nice and he did commit suicide\n[noise]\nI was just got it is the best way to describe it it's out it felt like someone to punch me in the stomach\nThat feeling after four\nDays and weeks and [noise]\nI guess like any grieving process maybe it sounds strange to say the grieving process because I didn't know him I wasn't a family member of his but [noise] at lingered for a while that I had this connection now to this person but he had very\nDeliberately reached out to establish this\nConnection and that that it hadn't worked out the way I'm Better movie version of it would've are down where I Would have somehow figured out a way to save him\n... [noise]\nCynthia decided to do some research into who Dennis was in the process she found out that she wasn't the only one to get the email so she called some of them up to see how they had reacted too and she was the one that told all of them about done as his death like Cynthia dare I hadn't stopped wondering what happened to Dennis\nAs upsetting as it was when she and I were sort of talking about the timing and it became clear that in fact when I received this message that morning with my children are running over my house\nShe was already dead\nThis horrible too but it does kind of help to know that nothing I could have done that morning would have made any difference I don't know I mean why who cares whether it makes any difference to me um but it does make me feel a little less wretched about it but you know our our lives are predicated on this chemical as though right\nCynthia I'm like the rest of them may have gotten the email when Dennis was still alive but what is truly impossible to know is even if she had emailed him right when she got it that night when she was checking your email in the middle of the night would it have made any difference [noise]\nAnd Cynthia talk to his ex wife Kiko she found out the dentist had always plan on doing this\nHe always said what he had said in the email when his work was done so does he\nHave a strange none of this was at all surprised the cake out [noise]\nGet emailed her to right before he killed themselves he asked her not to be sad\nI'm happy he said\nWhen he went up to the roof of his hotel\nOoh [noise]\nWhen I've talked to people about this in the past months and months since that's happened\nBears some folks who say well you know could you have done more and where are you being cold about it but he didn't ask for help in fact he said he was resigned to doing this that he had decided I'm not asking of any anything he specifically says that in part of the latter\nUm he just wanted his ideas to survive\n[noise]\nHe left very few people behind among them a daughter who he didn't raise and who he was a strange from he popped into the lives of strangers in his last few hours and then he disappeared altogether but not before asking cake out his ex wife to be sure to keep his Facebook in blog up just in case someone got curious\nAbout his work that was the part that upset me the idea that he felt that\nThis was what was important in his life and nothing else mattered to the point where he was going to kill himself because there was nothing else in his life that mattered you know I I've been very fortunate to have had\nA fair amount of success as a writer and so perhaps it's not fair for me to see this because perhaps I Would feel differently if I weren't as successful as I've\nBeen but it would never occur to me that my writing was the most important thing that I had contributed to this world\nI have another Alan ... a aspect of my career I'm a scholar of yet in Hebrew literature and I'll say that\nWhen you study English literature you know a whole lot about forgotten writers most of the books on my shelves were literally saved from the garbage I Am sort of very aware of what it means to be um a forgotten artist in that sense and even with all of that awareness um\n[noise] I just I was upset at the idea that what\nWould matter most about a person's life would be their work every person has a legacy", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Snap Judgment", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "06"}
