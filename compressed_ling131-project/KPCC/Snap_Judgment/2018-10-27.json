morning neighbors are holding a vigil tonight remembering the victims Pennsylvania governor Tom Wolfe says all of Pennsylvania mourns with the Jewish community\nSo people often just went in to see people they didn't have to know that when I was real calm it\nThe people who ran the funeral home as soon as they knew that a lot of times we would go there and just to get out of the heat but they had one kind of unwritten rules you couldn't come in unless you were interviewing can just be hanging\nUh you you could go interview in which meant that\nWe had to sit and look at a body we would do it we wouldn't want to\nBut we'd all done it so many times we knew the rules of the game\n[noise]\nI'm about twelve years old when the story and it was late summer\nIt was hot as hell probably one of the hottest days that I actually [noise]\nAnd we all piled into rational readjust finished playing take ball outside\nWhat was unusual that he is I kicked the ball and the way across the street toward this fits with his like crazy don't live too would snap snarled anything got near there and\nI'm a God is good during the yard\nAnd all of a sudden this kid just came out of nowhere and slapped the ball down [noise] and he said today\nIn the moment that had happened not a one of us even said who is is that is because he looked like us but this particular you he was with none of us and that's when we first met him we all went inside the funeral home and we're sitting on a role like we normally would do\nAnd he was sitting with us and he didn't speak\nAnd we weren't speaking because we weren't supposed to so he was being unusually quiet was just par for the corps but when we got up and we left\nA couple of us were saying that he could play good what's his name oh\nI think he's who easy [noise]\n\nSo this war started turning up all the time we were playing [noise] none of us to remember him ever view there when we would start a game [noise]\nAnd we were trying to need to get together there will always be in the heat of the gay\nWhen all of us were thinking about nothing but the game kicking the ball throwing the ball\nChasing each other being on a bike racing around the corner\nThere'd be one more of us he was skinny\nSkin I'd say a two inch afro not much of a pro war short sleeved shirt\nNot button at all nothing underneath the cut off pants tennis shoes and ... oh\nHere's speech\nBut I Would say something like or do you want to go up the street or do you want to stay here I Would give him possible options he would not or shoulder shrug cabinet expression on his face\nThe reason why none of us went into great depth about why he didn't speak is because in our community there were several kids and adults who had this kind of disability [noise] this was an era where people with a developmental delays there you're treated at all\nI saw lots of kids coming out of the country who\nDidn't speak couldn't speak with me a doubt that wasn't so uncommon I probably knew a half a dozen kids like that\nOne day me and the kid was hanging out in the alley and I was looking at Page's flying around the funeral home [noise]\nI had to say she or he was saying I like bitch\nSo I took him to my house to see my business\n[noise]\nI got introduced to pigeons [noise] raise the wages when I was maybe ten years old [noise]\nPut on your arm or something and get a little greater coroners when it was cool to relax you could\nYou get rather back in a squat down raise their feathers up [noise] cooler wings up in the air and spread over there and when they wouldn't allow it to be able to walk out into the street with him and toss them up in the air and watch 'em just say a little distance\nAnd it comes back to you that was that was the magic you made a bird come back to you [noise]\nSo I was raised in a pigeons in a makeshift who was built in the\nBack of our house where I live with my mom I must step back and I'm like most of the kids we didn't have any real\nFormal coup so we make them out a piece of plywood all signs and posters even old television sets [noise]\nThere's one type of pitching called rollers the rollers\nAre different in that they have this habit of flipping an air we call the roll and but what they're really doing is flipping\n[noise]\nThe effect of that is the pigment would be flying and it would be like he stopped flying in mid air it starts falling out of the sky that's what it looks like and they flip flip the better ones will do that almost two they hit the around and come back up it's marvelous thing to see and we would jump up and down\nAnd scream and holler at clap our hands are encouraged them to\nTo grow and you could be a bunch of us stand around\nFlip and scream and holler [noise]\nCome on come on come on slapping a hands together come on come on come on all of us had different calls while it is and we would do\nThese pictures were off financially out of our means we're all poor kids a pigeon like that would probably cause six dollars\nIn Nineteen I'm\nSeventy two Seventy\nThree were okay with the bird you could get but if you had a roller\nYou know up to that point I hadn't had any rose\n[noise]\nWe're in the back yard he's really excited and he's comfortable with his you know he knew how to hold them the right way the way he smiles too with the wage touched on this fresh air wing file\nThey were comfortable with him the way he walked around the coup and pool that my wire\nAnd looked at my nails\nAnd he smiled at me and we walked around the look to see what I was the\nMoment but the one thing I couldn't\nGet from him then was where\nYou from [noise] where you stand man who you know folks who you relate to what school you go to who is you know and he would give me nothing\nWe would hang out more and more we do more walking through the back alleys would spend more\nTime in my backyard and one thing in particular happened\n[noise] we're walking through the alley [noise] at a lot of allergies were dominated by adults smoke street and all that would just take over and Alex and this was one of those cases\nAnd we've both just took off [noise]\n\nAnd we ran and ran and I didn't look back to see what the dog was doing I got about two blocks away and I was out of breath and then we got away we did it we can gather we've always fine I we're friends now they do when I was he even read it hard\n[noise] but [noise] he wasn't there [noise]\nHe wasn't rich [noise]\nI didn't see him again to the next day [noise]\nFor the first time\nI was starting to feel funny about him and that didn't make sense it was scary it's like you disappeared you weren't there was no place to go\nOr wanted to see him so badly the next day [noise]\n... [noise]\nI was in the backyard with the pages that turned around and day was and we went to the coup like she normally would do\nI had to ask him way we do anything else were we play what what happened to you yesterday where did you go\nWhen I mentioned to my mother about this boy to come and go and disappear or to speak [noise]\nMy mother immediately told me to stay away from [noise]\nJust stay away from she was afraid [noise]\nI didn't want to give 'em up [noise] I didn't want to [noise] wasn't like I had a lot of friends [noise]\nWhatever it was it was good to me it was my friend [noise]\nI Would say it was a month later\nSo we're probably in August and now\nAnd we're taking a usual walked through the ... behind the funeral home and we've been walking for a couple of blocks but we've started going to he was lead me in a direction that we never went before\nThe way I always start with amount I get a good hard look at the animal [noise] I kind of wait for them\nTo speak to me and lack of a better word and see what is unique about them and [noise] it was\nGorgeous as far as roadkill does it didn't have any broken bones to didn't have led it didn't have\nLeave and maggots why have an aunt in it [noise]\nIt was really in good shape [noise] that had really nice brown for her and\nThe whole thing was kind of golden brown but at the tip of its tail was white\n\nNormally a specimen this perfect is a home run but there was something about this particular squirrel\nThat looking at it just made my skin crawl and I couldn't exactly explain why I felt uncomfortable\n\nI just it was almost like I had this no no no no [noise] kind of drowning out\nIt felt more like being screamed\nThat honestly\nIt was frozen solid but it almost look like it could\nHop up and run\nOn the tree and as I was looking at this world I was just rock with these horrible intrusive thoughts\nYou're gossiping what are you doing what are you thinking about this right now\nSo I had been struggling with these thoughts and I picked up the squirrels and I picked up\nThe exact a knife and\nI always start the incision right between the shoulder blades a you know below at the base of its neck and then you know when you go from the shoulder blades down to the tail down\n[noise]\nAs soon as I pressed the tip of the exact them into the skin\nI felt that go in a tiny bit [noise]\nFor twins [noise]\nIt was just a fraction of a second\nI I definitely saw it that quickly flick that little shiver and it startled me so I I dropped the squirrel and the nice and they expected it to jump up and run away [noise]\n\nI spoke to an end convinced myself\nIt was a dead squirrel like I mean obviously it was a squirrel [noise]\nSo I still myself picturesque world back I got the exact a blade and like ripping off a band aid I just I stuck with a knife in and dragged it down the spine lines [noise]\n[noise]\nHi I'm Ruth my hands and the blade on it to the point where I can get my hands around its stomach in between the skin and the body [noise]\nAnd then I started working its little arms five just popping them backwards through the skin and got it skinned out so it was almost like it was wearing a one Z. of its own skin [noise] and the final part was a cutting the ... [noise]\nI suddenly had a really sharp pain [noise] underneath the knuckle um the painting on my right hand [noise]\nI dropped a squirrel dropped the blame [noise]\nAnd I look at my hands [noise]\nGlove had actually been torn open\nAnd underneath that there were four short ranch marks on my skin on really close together [noise]\nSo I took off the damage was\nAnd I I was doing that [noise]\nI noticed a little\nTiny bit of movement in Memphis missions so I look back up at the world [noise]\nAnd it was lying on the table [noise]\nAnd I saw the four\nFingers on if pond [noise] slowly Pearl up into a little fist hold for a second and then really slowly relax [noise]\nYeah that yeah [noise]\nI just I panicked [noise] having these feelings [noise]\nSeeing the firm is [noise]\nI can explain that whatever that's just my own brain\nBeing [noise] having a a\nWorld pa wound on my hand was much harder\nTo explain away maybe I put too much pressure on the brain and that sent a signal through the dead muscles to make the paw flick and it caught my glove just write that has to be it because the only other explanation\nIs that I just skin to the squirrel alive [noise]\n\nIt did occur to me several times to just stop [noise]\nIt felt like I was going to be cursed from that point on to never have\nAnother good experience with taxidermy which would be devastating\nLike what if I'm done what if it's gonna be like this with every animal from now on\nI got as far as picking everything up to throw it out\nBut if I had given up it would have been a huge step backwards\nI hopped on a new glove clipped the wrists and the or ankles are often the carcass I buried it in a plastic tub under about ten pounds of salt\nSo that it could dehydrate and put her on the shelf underneath my uh underneath my bedroom window and went to bed and\n[noise]\nI could barely sleep that night because the scratch just was thriving and every time it through audits I thought about the world [noise]\n\nThe next morning I woke up\nAnd all I have to do is change to solve it can't possibly get as weird as it was yesterday [noise]\n\nI took the big bag of salt outside when I open the tub that had the skin inside\nThe skin was\nSitting up halfway out of the salt as if it did for road up for air like a ... be getting up from its grave [noise]\nIt was just sitting there\nStaring at me with these empty aisle isn't\nSticking up reaching out [noise]\nThere's no way the dead holiday world push the way up to ten pounds so there was also no way that anybody has touched it because\nThey all think it's disgusting [noise]\n\nI just dumped out the salt buried again put it on the shelf and\nWalked away from it for I expected it to be a very long time\n[noise]\nOne morning while I was finishing my coffee I heard a squirrel start barking [noise]\n\nAnd I for a second I throws because I'm thinking oh my God it's bits back it wants revenge but it was just another squirrel outside\n\nI just felt sad thinking that you know well dang this world that I was\nSo afraid of [noise] it also used to nibble and Kate\nBurn skater and bark\nAnd [noise] um [noise] bearing nuts and it just kind of just kind of all hit me that this was a living thing and it had [noise] I don't know dignity [noise] I went back to the salt and uh you know the\n... was actually still in there and it hadn't uh tried to escape again [noise]\nBut I just opened it up\nI felt like I own an an apology and I started talking to it so I said look I'm Sorry I didn't listen\nBecause I think that you were telling me to stop before I even started\nThe only thing that I Want to do is preserve you and make you last forever\nSo the next morning I woke up\nAnd I walked out on the porch and look up in the big oak tree that's right over the fence I saw um a brown squirrels not medium size really bushy tailed with a white tip [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Snap Judgment", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "27"}
