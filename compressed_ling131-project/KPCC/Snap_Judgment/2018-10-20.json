Simpson too but I turned to face teary or a\nJust saw that the wall was pockmarked with bullet holes with around so I was standing there looking at these pockmarked wrong it just seemed like something wasn't right that these they weren't typical\nMy squad leader and showed me this like pencil trick you can insert like a pencil and into like small arms fire against a wall it'll tell you like the direction that the fire it come from this being the second story I put the fence into the world and\nIt's a very little to the ground just sticking in like\nIt meant that those\nShots had been fired straight across\nSoon as I step that pencil and everything fell into place\nThis had been killed for him but they had to lined people up in here and just\nExecuted them and I just felt a little keys in my stomach standing in a kill house [noise]\nInstantly just felt like the walls just collapsed in on themselves don't really claustrophobic and I just needed to get them\nOut of the room it seemed like there was a maligned presence there [noise]\nThat was trying to get\nSomebody killed and it was totally inexplicable\nYou have to imagine that all of this is under the backdrop under the soundtrack of this just this before [noise]\nJust this ever present oral presidents\nFeeling that you were feeling what we're all in with that like the ball and like anxiety and\nThere's like a there's an under current of tension\nIt wasn't like a we all huddled together in a circle and are trading back and forth there was people would pair off with their best friend and be like do you would not believe what just happened nobody's going to talk about that because you're showing weakness I think that if one\nPerson were to stand up and be like goes kind of scary we would have written them apart\nSo we're left with all of this downtime and so you have now like half a dozen twenty year old children and one of the number one pastimes on these as Katie's is looting someone is like hey there's a storage unit down first floor\nAnd that immediately became something that all of us jumped onto\nBecause it it gives you a chance I guess like um to prove that you're not afraid to know goes to prove that you're not scared as soon\nAs that call goes out like yeah you know what yeah yeah yeah man all\nAll route to these people that I Know business and it's almost like a an affront to whatever was there\nIt was just like a a gated off a unit on the first floor and I walked over there\nReally yeah basically like a storage space I mean exactly like a storage space and there's just a very simple\nSymmetrical wrought iron gate on front\nDoes wrought iron gates are so loud that three of us walked up and got really low to the ground and just grab the gay on the bottom and just lived a quarter inch\nAnd then quietly walk backwards so that the gates not rubbing against the ground so that it wouldn't be allowed at all\nWe left the gate like prop all the way up and [noise]\nSo I think about half a dozen of us go into this a storage unit\nOf turn the tables chairs closing decorations silverware all\nKinds of things it smells like dust old\nAnd it's pitch black and the only light in the storage area is coming from or a little a little red tack light [noise] it's already like three layers of spooky like we couldn't even use our ... and the space are night vision goggles because it's so dark there's so little ambient\nLight and not really for looting anyways because uh you know you really want to yeah needed there's there's an art to this portable practice\nSaw it out like my best friend just unload on and [noise]\nAnd I get to him and I was like you know whisper in in which promote like what the hell is wrong with you do why would you do that but she had no\nIdea what I was talking about as far as he was concerned we went and\nChecked it out everybody came out only together\nAnd that was it [noise]\nAt this point I'd been in the building for maybe eight hours I'm ready to go home now this is a very not been a pleasant experience for me I imagine\nThat for some people who would be really easy to dismiss this like as nerves or you know what the stress like a battle yeah trauma things like that but the thing to keep\nIn mind about that is this was one of maybe fifty missions that I went out on but nothing ever\nLike this nothing ever that came so close that was so blatant\nLike a a force\n[noise] or as the sun comes up the gun trucks full of and we exit the building [noise]\nThis is how just stupid\nYou are at Twenty years old those paintings they stayed in Iraq I brought those things back\n\nSo I'm back in my room in the barracks and take these things out and I'm like hey check out these coup paintings that I got in a ... our platoon medic is in their news like I I Would very much like to have that and I'm like no way to\nKnow this is my decoration I went through the haunted house for this this is my prize I Am keeping it thank you sir\nSir cagey leaves and Sam comes in one of our ... one of our interpreters Sam and I was like what the hell is up with that place dude like it's really really weird and he's like oh yeah like that pleases unclean [noise]\n\nIt was like well what do you mean it's an clean use like very many people died in that building so\nUnclean and no one goes there [noise]\nYou'd really brought home to me what had happened [noise]\n\nAnd it's such a thing to admit it's like it's such a thing but I picked up the painting and that was like hey do you guys know where to go and he went well I Want to you know what I found cagey and it was like here man and it was really special to you\nI'd really like for you to have this in a cave it away\nPardon pardon you feel proud of the worst period for um just fighting back in a way that that had no military um which means\nThat wouldn't come into way way later now looking back all of these years later I have a lot of respect for whatever that thing was it was able to scare me\nI felt like any ways like I I got my come up at five months after this whole episode in may is when I got hit by a ... bed or car bomb [noise]\nEven the fear was not as scary as that experience for the simple fact that I felt like if I caught around in the noodle I'd be dead if I got ripped apart by an explosion I'd be dead [noise] book would ever was inside of that structure\nIt felt like if you were to die in its presence that it would have like a completely different set of consequences than\nIf you were to die just a out insect or somewhere like or you could
