N. Y. release\nThe spy comedy Johnny English strikes again written by William Davies David ... the director makes his feature directorial debut Rowan Atkinson back as bumbling spy Johnny English forced to come out of retirement\nAfter a cyberattack reveals the identities of all the active undercover agents in Britain decision suffer from South [noise]\nIt just sucks it so that French cyclists both obstructing had led us to sickness of [noise]\nA world when that can send us Johnny English weighed\nSorry that I actually find that funny a B so this is the third Johnny English movie the first two thousand three events who doesn't Lebanon now they don't they take their time putting them out pretty much every Rowan Atkinson movie as an excuse for him to do Mr Bean stick\nWe have to remember that so even though he is a spy use a super is by the whole point is to get them into situations where he can stick his tongue out and bend his face and do his funny little dance and kind of just do the stick that we're accustomed to him doing with his incredibly rubbery visit\nAnd uh I have to say the Johnny English movies keep getting better they're still not very good um but they keep getting better the original one I didn't think it was very funny to second one Johnny English reborn was so so this one despite\nBeing really dumb has an interesting thing on his mind and it is this the Johnny English is now retired and you have to come out because all of the actual\nActive spies have been revealed in the cyber attacks so they need to go to the spies were not active and he's not on the grid and of course now that the cyberattack has revealed all of their digital and security he wants nothing to do with cell phones or an electric cars that have GPS everything is analog 'cause we're going totally off the grid old school\nAnd that's a really interesting idea especially considering that the villain here is basically Google\nThey kind of throw a red herring entered it isn't very convincing that maybe it's the Russians but really it's Google is a Silicon Valley billionaire who wants to take over the world by a centrally strong arming the G twelve and giving him later the plot yeah it's it's not hard to figure out\nIf and and so it's a big swipe at a at the at at a very timely topic which is data mining and the fact that our data and privacy is is out there for the whole world and and how has it been used and\nA Google is making a lot of hits and they're going to take more because of this movie so I thought it was a very interesting way of taking the Johnny English character and ... world and all the ... that goes with it and wrapping it around an idea of it is a little more interesting than what the two previous films out\nOr a Johnny English strikes again third in the series drawing Rowan Atkinson is rated PG in white release the documentary\nOn her shoulders a profiles ... uh twenty three year old ... survivor of genocide and sexual slavery the film was directed by Alexandria bomb Bach in her featured directorial debut a Christie one started so this is about\n... who as a young ... woman was taken hostage by ISIS and turned into their sex slave\nShe's one of many many women young women children whom this horrific fate has fallen she managed to escape and in the subsequent years has\nToured the world talking to world leaders visiting refugee camps and telling her story but also really trying to urgently called nations to action to help\nProtect the people and to go after ISIS and to do everything they can to keep this horrific\nFuture from ... becoming reality for so many people and it's about how she balances all that pressure and he ... internally house she has dealt with\nHer own grief and her own loss of innocence but also the pressure that's been put on her\nTo be a a hero and an inspiration and you know she's like I kind of a quiet young woman and she has to get out in front of the U.N General assembly and and make her case and it's really heartbreaking and really inspiring it reminded me quite a bit of the ... documentary that came out a few years back\nIn terms of you how this woman who who never wanted that who never asked for this but now is in a position where she has to stand up for people who don't have that kind of visibility who don't have that kind of voice and it's really inspiring she gets a lot of help from a mall Clooney\nUm as far as pleading her case before the U.N General assembly she has a husband if he her husband weighed no is that her husband yet but he stood by her and clearly he he's a little bit older he wants to have a family but he's\nBeing patient and not pressuring her and like letting her do what she has to do for the greater good and she's just so lovely quite often she will just speak into the camera and say\nI Wish people would talk to me about more substantive topics and they asked me about the gratuitous details of being raped by these people and and it's just it's she's so subtle and everything she says it is heartbreaking\nWeighed a I'm normally really really good at distancing myself from the subject of a film and being able to you know regardless of whatever the politics or whatever the the subject matter maybe being able to evaluate it as a movie and I think it says a lot about this movie in probably a lot about me that uh I couldn't do that here and uh\nYeah different movie to watch while you're like my my mother was a war refugee\nYou know and I uh I Know is going to lose it on the air I'm Sorry and I I I grew up hearing these stories from a different point of view from World war two point of view but uh and you know Fifteen months ago I I spent time at a at a a a ... a Syrian refugee camp in Jordan\nAnd heard stories again and so you watch this film if you have any connection to that and even if you don't you can't help but have it just completely get under your skin it is\nWhat's extraordinary about this and full disclosure the or the editorial consulting other film was Doug blush who's a superstar editor and a friend of mine and I emailed him afterwards I said I'm sitting here I'm just weeping\nA and he said it's all about Alexandria ... the director he said they were just pared away everything so that ... voice was what really carry the film there was no editorializing by the filmmakers and um and that's what it is it's it's her voice and it's such a such an important force\nPut not actors on camera and let them be versions of themselves and it is not when you the truth acting it is just wonderful\nThere's something also to say about the photography because when you're when you're when this happens when actor people who do not have experienced being blocked in and kind of doing takes\nA are put into a situation where they have to be comfortable you have to put the camera someplace that enables them to do what they're doing in a different way than a professional actor would and that's where I think uh as far as the genius is is he always finds these beautifully composed shots\nThat allow you to feel like you're watching a a like this is a real movie but the actors are not being treated upon by the production it's a it's a it's an incredibly well planned and and well executed movie\nI'm Tony Mendez is bars this film life and nothing more can be seen it ... playoffs Pasadena lend lease Monica film center Santa Monica it's unrated\nOr the comedic drama a bread factory parts one and two stars Tyne Daly and Elizabeth uh in ... ah the film was written and directed by Patrick Wang ... wait\nSo it's important to point out this is a film that is in two parts is four hours long that's why it's in four parts each each of our parts to parts each each part is it is a is roughly two hours in length so two hours and then go see part to\nUh this is I I haven't heard anyone else said make the observation that kind of surprised this is almost like a Robert Altman film\nIt has a Robert Altman quality to it in the sense that the way that Wang shoots it and the time and the ... that he gives to the to the way the story unfolds basically takes place in upstate New York a small community where there was an old bread factory that is now in an Arts Center where they do you know theater and other other performance\nAnd it's now going to be a corporate ties and convert it into this thing where this very bizarre kind of post modern performance art is going to be the the new standard of the day and there's this team that a very weird and and quirky and nobody really likes this in Tyne Daly represents the the the town's fault the people who want to preserve what they've had\nAnd a boy it takes a long time to get going but it's interesting\nIt sneaks up on you because it's really intimate but also hugely ambitious and yeah the the length of part of it but it's also a massive cast and each person really get to a lovely moment or two of\nVery true very rich character development much more so than you might expect and um yeah there are some long monologues were an actor will just like tell a very long story reforming their performance\nBut then people do and the second half second have is very playful and people like burst into song and like people were person who would tap dancing routine while they're typing on their phone in the middle of a coffee shop and then did you meet chunks of heck you buy\nAnd he's like a lovely modest small town people give these powerhouse performances and the point being we all have our ... and our if all around us all the time which sounds like they're beating you over the head with a really facile notion but it's kind of love lead the way it all ends up\nI feel like Robert Altman is smiling at this movie has that Nashville quality to it it really does\nA bread factory in two parts more than four hours total running time a bread factories on rated it's written and directed by Patrick Wang and is it ... Monica film center Santa Monica\nThe price of everything a documentary about the contemporary art world Nathaniel ... the director weighed yeah\nNot a not earth shattering but a really interesting to talk about the uh all about the relationship of of money in the art world and they talk to artists and they talked to dealers and collectors and uh it's it's very very illuminating because everyone kind of agrees money can corrupt the the art world\nBut they need it at the same time and it's a conundrum the the isn't really resolved\nI'm nor Kennedy result but I Love the fact that it sort of immersed me in that world and introduced me to all these really interesting people and there's one woman in particular is an art dealer who says the most interesting thing about art uses some people see some need to be shown and some will never see that that was a perfect way of some\nSort of a fascinating conversation too about where our belong to someone pay fifty million dollars for a de Kooning or whatever it is or should they donate what they have to a museum there's one gentleman in Chicago who donated his four hundred million dollar collection\nOf contemporary art to the are the two to Chicago is that where it belongs or should it be in your house because you truly treasure it should be for the masses are should be for the few\nUm I was staggered at the the prices at the price of gas and sort of thing with the bread factory it's about the collusion between art and commerce while and the other thing is that of course for every a high level art museum a tiny part of its collection is ever visible to the public they mentioned that to a lot of it's in\nStorage in storage exactly the price of everything documentary on the contemporary art world\nWill be shown on HBO in

critics wave major and Christie ... we have another film to review was\nBorders Sweden's or in free for Oscar consideration it's directed by Ali ... who co wrote the screenplay Christie what did you think of this Swedish romantic mystery oh my goodness\nThat makes it sound like an understandable thing when you call it a Swedish romantic mystery there is so much going on here there's not that\nMuch once they get to it wasn't there to explaining itself\nIt's not that interesting but um it is about a woman who is a security guard at customs agent\nAt the border in Sweden and\nShe has this incredible sense of smell that allows her to ... to pick up when someone is lying or they're nervous or their feelings she felt she smells fear she smelled guilt\nAnd so she can tell when someone is lying about\nStuff they're smuggling into the country and sometimes that's really helpful like she can find a guy has No Child porn hidden in his phone or whatever um but she's a misfit and she misunderstood and she's got some facial deformities and then one day she meets a man who's just like her\nAnd that's kind of interesting to until it until you\nFind out who they really are I don't want to give away who they really are\nAnd really you you you almost can't even talk about this without giving the whole thing away it takes about an hour to start showing its cards and once it does it's not that interesting anymore it's it's interesting when it's a mystery and when it's an unanswered question and then and then you realize\nOh this is basically just a traditional spy film or you know trope that you've seen them in a hug them a hundred other movies but they just kind of\nFlipped it a little bit and it's not that that Richard that point what is interesting though is her performance that's the thing I'll give it credit for you know the the actors the Swedish either in a land or play has this you know ... like ... with the brow and you know and she's ... she's a she's
