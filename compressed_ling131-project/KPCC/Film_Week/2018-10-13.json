time director I Baron holds also stars in the movie with Tim that is a Tiffany Haddish\nCarrie Brownstein and Billy Magnuson also star to movie about how one politically divided families Thanksgiving turns ugly winter arguments starts over an oath that Americans are required to sign pledging loyalty to the government\nIs is that I Know it's a fairly said we're not talking politics I'm not going to ruin Thanksgiving in from Russia or [noise]\nYou know are not the\nSubtlety politic you three people were doing everything he\nWasn't that long ago if you work\nLet you have to sign a law one of those boy I had to find when I worked in Pasadena City College the oath is the film a what'd you think Amy\nI made it gave me the absolute Chavez I don't know if anybody else got any Chavez hearing that clip I don't know if this is the movie people might want to see what their families on Thanksgiving it depends on how much you get along with political\nBut it is about a moment a lot like now where there is a slow burn they have about seven months heads up to this Thanksgiving warning all of Americans that they should sinus loyalty oath not a big deal you might get a tax break if you do everyone's downplaying it in there and hold who people know him as if he didn't he was in ... a few months ago he writes in Texas is this is for some\nHe's a very stubborn hard headed guy who's just not gonna do it and his wife Tiffany Haddish says she really agrees with him and most of the family that he has been different shades of\nJust sign at you you you liberal freak um and I think it builds a terrific point the first half of this film I thought was really funny the second half it turns into more of a horse which I wasn't quite expecting and I liked it a little bit less but the first half of this I was absolutely a dark\nComedy for sure they'd be approaching that sort of very bad things level of dark comedy not so much bad family dark comedy with straight yeah I'm a ... but so so so so we go there in case it's not obvious I just white and Tiffany is black\nAnd they have an interracial daughter a vis oath thing has all kinds of sort of um in in the field is you're not required to find the ... ... you're probably ought to find the hills\nAnd and he is just so hardcore liberal I mean he is not going to find these all these me give you all his friends are not going to one by one they fall away one by one they fall away and he is just not going to let it go\nI like that about this movie there are these people roaming around who are some sort of like I don't know ... cops but not cops and they looking for people to see whether or not they find the ... and two of these guys one played by John Cho come to his house and they want to know a ... year old and he and he's not having it and that's when it starts to spiral out of control\nIt does get ugly does get brutal does get mean\nUm I think it's safe itself right at the end to my mind\nI agree and I was really impressed that Tiffany Haddish by the way she is very underplayed and she's almost shutting I have ranged put me in drama there's ... which I was very impressed that although it's funny we should say it's funny it really is it is funny\nThe oath the action comedy uh directed written by and starring Baron notes with ...\nAnd Kerry Brown's team the film was rated R it's selected theaters goose bumps

I worry sometimes and you have films that give a lot of time to a real issue there like this that he can inspire more because the shooter act I definitely want to do\nAnd what sort of happened after the attack um green grass takes care to not make it lurid at all with any of the shootings and said he singled out one survivor\nAnd I sort of build forward to this moment where they're both facing each other down in the courtroom with one young man representing\nWere Norway could be going forward as like a progressive country that is that supports immigration and then the one young man who wants to shut it down a little long and a little dry I found it intellectually really respectable what'd you think to\nA green grass onion [laughter] I I guess is what it is I think that there was something that we can call it a public restroom and certain beginning of this film which almost has no dialogue and it'll all be followed this young man as he carries out um his his attacks we just lays it out or not not not quickly muscle methodically\nAnd and I and I do love to Paul green grass is the director ... do you do not need every character to literally say everything you're thinking for the audience to catch on he understands that now\nAfter we get past that and the guys under arrest and we get into the sort of look at what the system society legal system or to the politics of the country what he's doing then is he's he's exploring how are we going to act as if the movie is about that guy\nAt all the movies about everybody else in Norway everybody of Norway except that one guy and that's why I think the most interesting intriguing thing about this movie\nAlright and you've going green grass the ... river\nOr green grass the director of the film and it's not as long ago as I thought in my in drug seven years ago\nThat this horrible attack was carried out in Norway twenty do July\nIs the biographical drama yet that selected theaters also screaming on Netflix the movie's rated R. and the writer director Paul green grass of was a guest on the frame withdrawn foreign you can hear that conversation by visiting our film we page\nAt Cape BCC dog board coming up we'll hear what Jim and Amy think of apostle as well as the sentence and we'll talk with a rocket scientist we add on to earlier this week on air talks a she's a big fan of\nAh the film about Neil Armstrong the first man we'll talk about favorite films that have space is a theme back in just a couple of minutes\nAnd this is eighty nine point three K PCC I'm Tammy Trujillo sick with us that one today for the b._b._c. news hour\nDay President Trump to Saudi Arabia will face severe punishment if was involved in the killing of Saudi journalist we ask is artificial intelligence sexist and Elvis Costello helps us celebrate the seventh anniversary of the L.
