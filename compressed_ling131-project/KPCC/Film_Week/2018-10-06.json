Ahmed hardy plays investigative journalist Eddie Brock\nHe becomes the host of an alien simply opted gives him the supernatural powers of his alter ego venom\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nI think I Want to process or like that\nWould be cool though the show without a what'd you think of ...\nI don't know why wait is rolling his eyes because I actually enjoyed that him and I'm the last person that expected to I'm not a huge fan\nOf this genre and I particularly dislike the way the trailers had and the ads had made the film looked like it was all about you know just about I think the I think the one she says we've had enough heroes and we're all this had enough here it's a it's it's look\nTom Hardy is what makes this movie he is such a great actor we've seen him play bad guys you've seen him play good guy do\nWe ... he can do more than any actor I can think of today who is as young as he is he is what makes this character so good\nAnd ... when Eddie Brock is is contaminated by this venomous ... a ... alien ... he then manages to sort of take on taking side and take on the other creatures so it's almost like in you know in the actress has kind of thing where the the creatures inside him but it's funny it's funny as heck because of the way\nTom Hardy navigates the relationship between the two of them and so it's almost like he's got these two voices in his head and it just it just made me laugh\nIt does give us a whole new meaning to interior monologue I Will say that yes it that way and a good\nWhere are you know I don't think so uh I I get\n... ... they're they're they're now three studios that er during marvel films there's Disney which is during model cinematic universe there's Fox which is doing everything X. men and related to them\nAnd then Sony is kind of they still have one foot in the Spiderman brain they've kinda they're sharing that with marvel now to try to figure that out and this is I guess technically part of the Spiderman a realm but they're doing this entirely independent of marvel and you can tell that the marble\nEntirely and well it's been wrong but it in yeah yeah but But Kevin ... is not sort of ... and see you right so you you can tell that\nThere is kind of a missing they're trying they're trying to find a tone here that is their own that you may\nAnd if it's not can't be enough or soon and can't be soon enough to really win me over it starts off very serious like a you know almost like a pie editor like they'll miss your space ship coming back with these\nOrganisms that they've found on the comet somewhere and then the crashes and one of them gets loose and next thing you know people are merging with some ... and making that voice\nAnd ... and then about an hour in it starts getting kind of campy and weird and it's not just this demon ... not just in Beijing the body Snatchers thing he's making jokes and he's he's wise cracking and suddenly this symbiotic can speak English and has a sense of humor attitude and that comes so\nOut of the blue and it wasn't that out of there and it was uh\nYou know it's got Rosenberg is one of the writers on this his who he's just he's got such a quick and ... that I I think you can really find him\nYet if it if it'd laid the groundwork sooner like within the first ... like the way Starman did you know right John Carpenter Starman let you know right away we're going to be having fun\nWith that but I think that's part of the charm of it in ways that you don't expect it so it when it comes along you're like you're sort of delight in you know I didn't you were the ones that I had to lay people into the average elated I didn't love Michelle Williams in nor the way she was shot by the way\n... having quite a week ... star is born and that and which I thought I didn't love the way it looked at looked sort of muddy\nAnd but it's good stuff for starring acting but he is having it at that may be\nThe first time it to my memory that that exists in talk of his job at the top two grossing films and usually that's a good question I don't even remember same cinematographer having two films than\nWe do know he of course shot black swan was nominated for that now he's been around long hair done a lot of really gap but um yeah other than that the look of the film which I didn't care for the time I had a good time my laughed it was fun for\nEveryone in my theater was having a good time too so you\nCan imagine [laughter]\nAll right he wasn't struck by them I Would tell them how to use it events Michelle Williams and ... Ahmed Ruben Fisher the director therefore credited screenwriters including Scott Rosenberg rated PG Thirteen in wide release and the frames John horned interviewed resigned mad about the film you can hear that\nWith a link on our film we page or its KP C. C. dot org slash the frame\nNext the drama the hate you give from director George Tillman junior Audrey Wells wrote the screenplay uh it's based on two thousand Seventeen a book by Angie Thomas stars ... Regina Hall Russell Hornsby an algae Smith\nFollows the character of the star Carter as she lives in two worlds a poor mostly black neighborhood where she lives and the wealthy mostly white prep school she attends\nA high school where you go to Jennifer\nWent out of it really is and isn't as it was when I have some ... to\nLive basically Williams inside as it give any one of the reasons they call a ghetto and I hate my so forgive the hate you give weighed\nAlmost almost I so you know Eighteen minutes of this movie it's about two hours and Fifteen minutes long it's a long movie\nUm the the first eighty some minutes is great absolutely terrific and then it kind of overplay its hand in a in a really unfortunate away the last fifty minutes which should have been about twenty five it could have lost twenty five minutes I could tell you exactly what it need to lose\nAnd it would have been a much much better film as it is it's worth seeing it's really worth seeing a if for no other reason among list and bird is\nExtraordinary and lead part she carries every second of this film on her shoulders\nAnd it is in is a very difficult emotional trajectory to sell to to work that character through all of these difficult paces all these things that she was juggling she has a white boyfriend she doesn't tell her family about her dad used to be a drug dealer\nYou trying to do right by his kids and they go to a prep school they're all of these dynamics that she was juggling and dealing with before the shooting and then the shooting just turns her world upside down inside out and she\nShe's just a force of nature she's amazing actress and then we've seen her before and uh yes she was in one of the hunger games movies when she was when she was younger so she's and she's been around for a little bit but this was really her coming out she is absolutely tremendous here and everything in the film that works it works because it has to go through her\nUm the now George Tillman who directed this previously did ah you know the barber shop movie soul food has a real Gloucester machine to his movies I've I've met some of the title of socially and they're just wonderful guys and that wonderful ... in them always comes out in the film sometimes to the point where it's maybe a little too polished\nAnd I was going into this thinking okay is is the George Tillman gloss\nGoing to be able to is it going to to undermine the grip that needs to come when this goes really really difficult\nAnd and he he does the ... some of the best work he's ever done I mean as a director it's absolutely superb the only thing is that it in that last about fifty minutes and I and then I Would ... probably up to the novel and probably because young novelists tend to do this\nWhere they they will get to that crucial point where you want to you the story has to tie up you've got to hit your Daniel you gotta hit all those high points\nAnd you wonder did I Do it well enough and you don't trust what you would written before that enough\nSo you sort of overdo it you over salad and there are about seven climax this year\nIt's a little bit over up there in a climax for for other movies it could have been scaled back and it would have been more powerful they would have let the those first Eighteen minutes really kind of work on you so I I think it's unfortunate that it doesn't rap out as well as it should it's a little clumsy at the end but the stuff that's good is really good\nAnd goes all the all out to to play basketball um obviously a vehicle that they wanted to do for them you know being married to that is one of those things we get a lot of those in Hollywood hey we're married were stars let's make a let's get a vehicle that we can do together I'm Paul Newman joined Woodward did it and every other married couple senses tried it\nIt it has some great film making it it it has some powerful moments that also has some gory torture moments that I didn't think they needed to go there\nIt's it's just as easily imply the film is to polish to really dirty itself up with moments that almost feel like a you know like Italian ...\nUm the the problem is it has this\nReally really irritating voice over with an elderly cruise narrating every scene and telling you what it is that you were seeing\nHanding it to you on a cookie and it feels as though they had a cut of the film that was working so poorly they said\nIt's like the Blade Runner thing the original cut a Blade Runner well let's just fix it let's get to know will be back in the studio and just have or give us some narration they'll make it very clear and it feels I'm its condescending and it it feels as though they're they're take they they don't trust the audience to really make sense of what the of the story telling word that they didn't want to go back and do another cut\nIf that voice over was part of the original screenplay it's a huge mistake either way um it it really undermines the films are effective\nIs loving Pablo is the film about Pablo Escobar and Virginia the lay whole Javier ... Penelope Cruz star Fernando lay on day ... is the director and screenwriter treated our you can see it at the AMC dining sunset in West Hollywood\nA lot and not a lot a lot a is a Nineteen thirty for film that's being re released the movie is directed by John Beagle who also co wrote the screenplay for the film stars ...\nYeah this is a classic film and it's it's really an an early sound era masterpiece Johnny go with I think only twenty nine years old when he died was a tuberculosis\n... was about I think a week or two weeks after the film was released\nWhich was extraordinary up until this time he had done some shorts and a longer short almost a feature called zero for conduct\nWas really it kind of ... figured the four hundred blows very money ways a beautiful beautiful film he ... he had a ... a wonderful sense of camera almost a ... a a father of the new wave in some way to the camera became an instrument for him and was able to sort of\nYou know make a move and making slow I'm his imagery is so beautiful this is the story of a of a young couple who boarded boats there I'm from ... out in the ... in in France and and there's a there's a complicated dynamic between the two of them there's not that old man on the boat and ... and a younger guy on the boat and\nAh she wants to explore the city when they get to Paris she goes off and and has your own adventure and and then there's this sort of a fight between the two of them and it it ... you can't give too much away here but there's this lyrical iconic moment that ends up in in the water gorgeous gorgeous black and white image hog graffiti\nAnd and it just sticks in your head how's\nHow's the print is this a ... it's already ration\nRestoration and\nAnd it's it's just poetry is pure poetry or this is one of those films that they will show you in film school as a as an example of you know this is a true Phil masterpiece and it's so sad because it was\nHis first and only nine years and years old his first and only feature film you're like well said he'd made you know short leading up to that and if you go is a really seminal figure because he's one of the he's he's one of these French artist who came from\nA ... to some degree and and I wish we could sway us you know do all the good are Swiss but very much a part of the same culture where they come from this reactionary boys want background\nAnd then sort of translate that into an artistic reflection of his father was a bit of a notorious anarchists in France and so there's there's there's a lot of there's a lot of baggage and his family background that he he wrestles with in ... in his art and it is it is pure poetry it is an allegory and it is a it is what it really one of the seminal films of all\nTime so you're a horrid horrid the directors or writers you think that the go influence\nI Would say well for sure ...\nAbsolutely true photo was was influenced by this I Would I Would argue that even though they were contemporaries of the rental are in many respects influenced by if you go I think\nSo yeah and she was so certainly also because the whole idea with the new wave was at the camera became a pen they can hammer was your writing instrument and go you know he was like Twenty years ahead of that but you know he he was he was right there with that and it would have been wonderful to see what he could have done had he lived\nMovie as a lot to learn from Nineteen thirty four Jones' ego the director and co screenwriter is drawing Dieter Harlow the film is unrated you can see it at the new our theater
