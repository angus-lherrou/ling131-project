Nineteen forty or Nineteen forties and others direct control in Culver City right now\nUh end of the city council of oversee decides to her rent control that means that her when word of ... every year but not ten percent a year not a gouge or\nA and a tendency to come after after she decides to move um would be covered by rent control as well so a ... ... and this is exactly the kind of tenant that needs protection that people who were getting ten Fifteen twenty percent rent increases every year because there's a shortage of housing\nSo they uh landlords able to take advantage of that because we were we should acting people\nWe should mention though that are in her case cover city could enact even with Costa Hawkins rent control that would affect her unit now that's just a decision to go over ... yeah\nAll right again your questions on the air talk page K PCC dot org or or eight six six eight nine three KP cc John and Fullerton says I'm a proponent keeps saying it won't affect new housing construction but\nThink of all the people that were told that one Costa Hawkins first passes legislation involved it keeps capturing newer and newer units beat her dryer\nWell that's not true actually that uh you know the cost of ... puts a a limit on a new construction\nOr in terms of ah when you can impose rent control and so ah there's no evidence whatsoever that caused the Hawkins has emerged things any better in fact you know the cost of all kinds of death of Nineteen Ninety five\nOr the landlord ... said that at all a free up the housing market and make things better\nThe housing market has gotten much much worse since Costa Hawkins was adopted and so if we are set rid of cost dog is a repeal it we passed ... and then a more tenants will be protected from being evicted it'll protect the housing and\nThere will be but a huge increase of new construction as well because uh it won't affect your construction landlord you on hold by the question is isn't worse\nBecause of cost dog and you just because of supply and demand are just there aren't enough enough units for the big ...\nRegatta Hawkins didn't create our housing crisis um local cities have done a horrible job of making sure that we have enough housing\nAnd they haven't balance their jobs with their housing the ... are getting in a way of helping us construct new housing we saw that at the legislature this year interfering with new construction along transit a court orders so it costs a Hawkins is not the cars\nAre at a ... on on the ability of these rent control boards to be able to set what a fair return uh why not have that in cases where we've seen a tremendous ride increase of of of the value of properties that landlords have rents have gone up tremendously and even for mom and pop people\nUh they're making money typically in a way that they haven't in the past\nAnd that does put the squeeze on rent or so why not have a limit on the profitability of that so that you balance the two and\n... it probably ten had done something much more moderate we might not be sitting here in this station but prompt ten didn't do that\n... ten is just opening the floodgates to allow local governments to do whatever they want unfortunately I during the nineties when the legislature passed Costa Hawkins they realized that local governments were not doing a good service to not only owners by the tenets of the local level\nBerkeley and impose it on single family homes Berkley had lost three thousand rental units\nSanta Monica last nine thousand rental units we were seeing gentrification so they said let's put the brakes on these stringent forms of rent control let's do something more moderate that's not what prompt pandas prop tennis not moderate that's why it's opposed by the building trades and the N. double ACP and the veterans they say this is not a modern form of rent\nControl do I want to ask both of you what what's your vision if prop uh ten were to be passed what effect would it have on the housing supply well\nThere are certain cities that are are in place right now with rent control that are gearing up an already have their ordinances in place to apply to single family homes so Berkeley Oakland rich men\nSan Francisco in Santa Monica the light switch should be turned on their would immediately apply and could apply to single family homes um we also have some that are qualified for the ballot\nA national city Sacramento about the supply what ... well that was that ... that has everything to do a supply because we believe will go back to the seventies and eighties where we lost housing so the supply there would be reduced\nBerkeley also put a a a stoppage on new construction back then too so we believe the supply also will be affected in that way\nPeter dry what effect do you think corrupt and would have on the housing supply\nSo the three largest cities in California with ... in the bay area San Francisco or San jose in Oakland have had huge increases in supply even though there's rent control because it's not covered by a new construction is not covered by rent control so it'll have ah\nThe major impact on reducing supply and it will protect the people that are already living in their apartments and those apartments will remain a affordable\nFor the for the long term and you know and Deborah knows them and she knows that knows shitty is going to impose rent control and single family homes that are not owned by big corporate option to you and where is\nThat the target of the single\nFamily rental market which are these big wall street and other corporate absentee landlords that are making a huge huge profits why I say I'm going to have the legal family\nDon't talk about this subject I had all kinds of blisters own apartment buildings were not huge companies so they're in in a two Miriam in West Hollywood says I own a try plaques Old West Hollywood is under rent control if\nProp ... passes or what would be the increase caps for for new tenants right now I can raise it to market value would that be all the rent boards determine\nWhere short term of what would happen if on turnovers currently today as you pointed out it's it's a when a tenant moved out to the landlord can then raise it to whatever the market will bear however it didn't come back under rent\nControl or I don't want to thank you both so

I worry sometimes when you have films that give a lot of time to a real life shooter like this that he can inspire more because the shooter act I definitely want to do\nAnd what sort of happened after the attack um green grass takes care to not make it lurid at all with any of the shootings and said he singled out one survivor\nAnd I sort of build forward to this moment where they're both facing each other down in the courtroom with one young man representing\nWere Norway could be going forward as like a progressive country that it that supports immigration and then the one young man who wants to shut it down a little long and a little dry I signed it intellectually really respectable legislation\nA green grass onion [laughter] I I is is what it is I think that there is something that we can call it a public restroom and certain beginning of this film which almost has no dialogue in law he followed the show man as he carries out a um his his his attacks were just lays it out or not not not quickly muscle but methodically\nAnd and I and I do love DePaul green grass is directed the ... you do not need every character to literally say everything you're thinking for the audience to catch all he understands that now\nAfter we get past that and the guys on the arrest and we get into the sort of ... a look at what the system society legal system or to the politics of the country what he's doing then is he's he's exploring how are we going to ... activists the movie is about that guy\nAt all the movies about everybody else in Norway everybody of Norway except that one guy and that's what I think's the most interesting intriguing thing about this movie\nRight and you're going green grass member\nOr green grass the director of the film and it's not as long ago as I thought in my in drug seven years ago\nThat there is a horrible attack was carried out in Norway twenty two July\nIs the biographical drama yet that selected theaters also streaming on Netflix the movie's rated R. and the writer director Paul green grass of was a guest on the frame with John Ford you can hear that conversation by visiting our film we page\nAt Cape ...
