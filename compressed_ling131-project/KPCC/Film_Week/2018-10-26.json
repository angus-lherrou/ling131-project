{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Well the the polls that icy though seemed to indicate that Americans are truly polarized and that you've got um the Democrats are are not just the party but they'd themselves they're moving\nFurther to the left 'em and and the conservatives have moved further to the right we saw this even before the rise of Donald Trump the Republican Party becoming more conservative than it has historically been so it's really that much to pick up when you consider a more moderate Americans are they're really that many of them left where\nThere was just a big survey done of American political attitudes which found that the real extremist on each side or they put a small number you're talking six to seven percent on each side most people are not these hardcore extreme as most people\nAre much more moderate but the incentives in our political system really reward parties catering to their bases especially in the primaries and so that's why I think you're seeing politics going to the extremes it's not necessarily because most Americans are that extreme\nMax I'm you know many Republicans hold their nose regarding Donald Trump but see much bigger gains here for the conservative cause weather's Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation the Supreme Court justice or the tax package that I'm Trump and and Republicans in Congress were able to get through\nA relaxing of regulations on business and environmental regulations so conservative post all these things they say yeah you know he's\nDistasteful and what he dies we we don't like the things he says the attitude the presents but there's just too much good stuff here for us as conservatives to look that gift horse in the mouth your response to that\nI think that's incredibly ... that's very shortsighted because yes even if you're looking at it from a conservative perspective when you think there's some good things Donald Trump has done\nThey base conservatives basically wind up closing their eyes to all the terrible things that he is doing he is dividing Americans by\nRace he is attacking minorities he has vilified this caravan of of Central American refugees he is inciting us to political violence he used a meeting his opponents as saying that they're guilty of trees and that they don't love America that they're in league with criminals use creating a very dangerous climate in America which I think has created\nA climate that led to this Trump supporter in Florida a mailing these bombs to all of these\nUh targets of Trump's wrath\nDonald Trump is also undermining the rule of law he's engagement obstruction of justice he's running down the FBI this is supposedly the law and order party and yet they're vilify the FBI\nHe is a cut some taxes at home but he is raising taxes abroad tariffs our tax hikes and Donald Trump is turning his back on free trade he is turning his back on American allies on American global leadership\nHe is he's sick all fantasy towards ... Kim Jong un and other terrible dictators I mean just imagine if this were Iraq Obama doing this Republicans would be outraged but with Donald Trump they ignore it or approve of it it's it's a disgraceful hypocrisy\nNext what about the the the the view that Republicans are expressed that President Trump\nIs able to connect with non elite middle American voters in a way that\nYou know so called mainstream Republicans haven't been able to that\nHis policies on trade or because he's listening to people who've lost their jobs in the middle of the country and who haven't benefited from free trade or some of the more global list\nPolicies are of both Republican and democratic predecessors you think that there's there's no legitimacy in that argument that he is giving voice to those concerns\nI think he is giving voice to the worst impulses in our country\nThere is no question that there is real pain and suffering out there and he is in touch with it but he is channeling it in as you know phobic native us direction he is basically encouraging his followers to blame brown people to suggest that immigrants coming here are the cause of all our problems\nOr that there are disloyal elites who are exporting our jobs abroad basically engaging in very dangerous conspiracy monitoring and us hope so called solutions of terrorists are hurting the economy you're seeing the slowdown happening right now the stock market is hurting\nUh companies are are reporting that it's costing them large amounts of money even Donald Trump himself is\nSubsidizing farmers by ten billion dollars to make up for the cost of his terrorists here's a bright idea instead of offering subsidies to farmers wanted we just let them sell their goods that brought us they were doing before\n[noise] All right uh so if you don't what's President Trump is out of office after one or after two terms what keeps the Republican Party\nFrom um separating itself from President Trump because you make the argument essentially that the party is doomed itself by time itself temporarily to Trump why\nI think it'll be very hard for them to do what they're doing now because the Republican Party has essentially all in with Trump\nIt's not just Trump out their vilify immigrants catering to racism and xenophobia all these other Republican candidates are following suit I mean if you look at the campaigns this year Republicans are routinely accusing Democrats of being sympathizers have MS Thirteen wanting open borders basically\nPlanning on prejudice and all sorts of ways uh vilify Muslims and other targets so they are becoming deeply complicit in what Donald Trump is doing to America\nAnd he is transforming the party a to a very large degree right before our eyes so I Would hope that we could have a more moderate center right party in the future but the only way that's going to happen is if Republicans suffer devastating political defeats and learned that they could not a play on prejudice and bigotry in order to win political power\nI Want to talk with you that use of military force because uh this has been an area that's been a great controversy for you and and I'm a U.S approaches the U.S spouse\nDo you see things differently or um in terms of using US military force for so called moral games do you think that there that we should rethink that approach\nAbsolutely I've learned some valuable lessons from my support for the Iraq War which are now regret it and I write in the book about how I was I was mistaken and what that is caused me to do is to understand\nBetter than I did before the limits of American power to understand that prevented with war is not a good idea so I mean I still very much believe with American leadership and I believe in upholding the international liberal order that the America created after Nineteen forty five but I think we should be much more cautious about the use of force than I was in the immediate post nine eleven era\n... thank you for joining us appreciate it back here in Southern California where where do you live currently New York New York or what have you back your visiting Southern California ...

you think of this Swedish romantic mystery oh my goodness\nThat makes it sound like an understandable thing when you call\nIt a Swedish romantic mystery there is so much going on here there's not that much and yet once they get to it was it started explaining itself it's not that interesting but um it is about a woman who is a security guard at customs agent\nAt the border in Sweden and\nShe has this incredible sense of smell that allows her to to pick up when someone is lying or they're nervous or they're feeling she feels you know fear she smelled guilt\nAnd so she can tell when someone's lying about\nStuff they're smuggling into the country and sometimes that's really helpful like she can find a guy has you know child porn hidden in his phone or whatever um but she's a misfit and she's been misunderstood and she's got some facial deformities and then one day she meets a man who's just like her\nAnd that's kind of interesting to until later that until you find out who they really are I don't want to give away who they really are\nAnd really you you almost can't even talk about this without giving the whole thing away it takes about an hour to start showing its cards and once it does it's not that interesting anymore it's it's interesting when it's a mystery and when it's an unanswered question and then and then you realize\nOh this is basically just a traditional spy film a you know a trope that you've seen them in a hug them a hundred other movies\nBut they just kind of flipped it a little bit and it's not that bad Richard that point what is interesting though is
