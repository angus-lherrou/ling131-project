attempting to cross over the border NPR Shannon van central port hundreds made it across others return to Guatemala for food and water\nMyself who never had their criminal position off today could also be voter except across the valley political letter\nWriter [noise] and I should say the character is a real person it's actually based on an individual Claudio what'd you think of can you ever forgive\nMe I liked it a lot I'm\nMelissa McCarthy has that really in comic energy and her timing is always perfect her movies aren't always perfect ... she's made some missteps um she's made some great sound too bad spy and the heat and um but this is something different for her she has I think she's done one other more serious role but\nThis is a very different role she has certainly her humor comes through there's caustic which I'm In fact I think at one point there was a line that says caustic we'd it she says cost acquitted my religion which is great I mean the ... center wrote this and she's such a wonderful writer\nAnd there's some great lines like that that dialogue is excellent I have a feeling this is going to be one of the nominees for a\nScreen play or a tablet complacency was based on it or not the memoir\n... I mean this woman was a con artist who was she was you know and but she seems to be very sympathetic and you're just because\nShe is sympathetic and and not likeable is still I think what she would prefer that you respect her rather than like her\nThat's very well set and one of the things I like about this movie which I think of as like a very sweet movie about a very mean person and it doesn't soft pedal that it it doesn't stop at all the vicious aspects of her she is a complete died in the war missing throat and she openly refers to herself as such the cat\nWho plays quite a role in the movie actually uh she loves that cat and that's all she allows you yeah and you know she that that's often understand in some ways this is like you know this is a character who is a professional crank who's good with words who loves cats I mean it's the character only a movie critic could love\nActually it's been so I mean I think\nThe movie really does get you to root for her and draws you into complicity with her scheme or with out sanitizing her or redeeming or even like she doesn't really need redemption\nNo and you see her I mean she's ... and she but you do see her humanity and you see that she is lonely and you see sort of um the frustrations of being an artist just kind of a writer who's out of step and his work is not appreciating says she's sort of forced into this situation um and so you you have a you have an empathy for\nHer you do and you also she does have you know sort of I guess the obligatory psychic role but in this case it really it accounts for a Richard ... plays a jak hawk who's the man that she you know he's he's a drifter kind of a bit of a a hustler himself\nAnd and you know ... and they become unlikely friends and eventual accomplices and their dynamic is is so witty and so it was so caustic and yet there's this affection that ... that that uh emerges in their dynamic that never feels forced\nThey have such a great chemistry together and and I like the way they created New York city in this era um it it's kind of Justin musty and and it feels like you really are going back to this particular time which was not that long ago was the eighties right\nNow they're really Lee Israel she actually wrote like authentic\nBy asking for four she started doing the forgery arise you'd written a biography of Dorothy kill gallon and uh another so that'd be without her you know it was the live on the bank had yes and that kind of pushed her into the financial problems\nAnd then she started forging these letters by Dorothy Parker she had kind of a similar Dorothy Parker wit\nAnd that's that's one of the wonderful things about the movie too and it shows that she kind of become a fraud and an artist yeah in time yeah it's a very much an appreciation of the art form it takes to forge some convincing answer right and there's this part with them says nobody could write like Dorothy Parker and she kind of give them\n[laughter] it's pretty great\nCan get you should go see it Charles given your knowledge of Lee is when she said can you ever forgive me is the film it's rated R. starring Melissa McCarthy and Richard III grant Mary ... the director the coal hall of center in jeopardy or the screenwriters it's at the arc light Hollywood and the landmark in West Los Angeles\nWildlife dramas drawing Carey Mulligan Jake Gyllenhaal it's directed by Paul ... who also co wrote the screenplay with Zoe because Dan Justin what'd you think of wildlife\nAnd it was a very strong film is actually one of three uh at least three directing debuts that are opening this weekend one of two are directing they've used by actors in this case\nPaul ... who wrote the screenplay with the actress and writer and his partners that we ... them um and it stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Carey Mulligan as a married couple in great falls Montana in Nineteen sixty um\nIt was a portrait of the collapse of the marriage amendment that takes place over the course of the movie in a very measured intelligence somewhat deliberate fashion um and yet despite that slowness of pace which may be trying for some I was completely held and riveted by it partly because the performance was just so good\nI'm Joan hall who I think under plays a bit more than he usually does as this man who is incredibly frustrated\nAnd uh you know his his masculinity feels under threatened so he goes off to fight these forest fires that are way and his wife a play by ... it feels so resentful and abandoned by him when he goes off\nThat she uh\nBasically embraces for liberation or I should say after he leaves and comes into this sort of defiance\nNew understanding of herself ... such a good actress and such an underappreciated one I have never seen her better on screen I think that's an ... single ... single rate deal and just the volatility promotion and also all the stores are said before it before shut up\nUm is seen through the perspective of their fourteen year old son played by or get us Australian actor named at all\nHe's excellent to I guess I agree a hundred percent with everything you said um it's based on a Richard Ford novel he's one of my favorite novelists and his his his it really has the feel or Richard Ford novel come to life I think that that's like ... and Paul data really did a good job of of adapting a that it's\nSet in the sixties and you feel that it's set in the sixties although I feel like Carey Mulligan characters more of a\nA contemporary kind of woman in many ways um\nIt's so detailed and meticulous and it's very as very elegantly done I'm Jake Gyllenhaal as you say is is very understated she's wonderful and it's told from the viewpoint of this boy who I think is also just really great I mean the other and then there's another performance it's actually really good deal camp\nUm but you know for ... for for his directorial debut it's complex it's this deep dive into this the psyche of his broken family and and um it invokes the era of really well I think he did a beautiful\nDay does he have a role in the film no not at all just directions railroad yeah\nEvery one of the ... the television to detail this movie is extraordinary and I think the pulled into I'm\nKind of refute such a a a stereotype you sometimes have about actors turn directors in for him but he he does not appear on screen and\nHe doesn't just the performances are so good but it's not just the performances it's not just actors indulging actors he pay so much attention to everything in the frame and he shoots a lot of this like from a distance to do you want you to get the environment and the atmosphere not just not just the characters\nAnd he ends up in a work together on really spark they did they both yeah here to that and uh do the right to I Can't remember where she wrote it yeah yeah they've collaborated before they didn't have it a good ... years oh okay so she had written and I believe okay but whatever it is their their collaboration really works here\nUm and it still feels a bit like a play but it never has sort of that\nIt's it's claustrophobic but not an stifling way it is for pre it sort of way\nThe movie is wildlife strong Carey Mulligan Jake Gyllenhaal directed by Paul Dana corroded with Zoe cars and rated PG Thirteen it's at the landmark in West LA and the arc light in Hollywood the Danish thriller the guilty directed by Gustavo Mohler uh what'd you think Claudia\nI Love this movie I saw it at Sundance I've and I've seen it a few times since ... film festival\nI'm speaking of claustrophobic this one is confined to one location and it kind of reminds me of a movie that came out a few years ago which I absolutely adore it called walk with Tom Hardy where it was all took place kind of in real time in in in a confined space in that case it was his car and this one it's um\nIt's in a police station and this is a guy who had been a detective and he's kind of demoted to being a um call center emergency calls that are person\nAnd he gets this call a of a woman who's been abducted for simply by her husband and so you know he is in the process of sort of\nA healthier and in the thriller takes twists and turns and its suspenseful and the lead actor Jacobs ... is amazing he's a Swedish actor who's I think pretty big in ... um someone that we don't recognize necessarily but it's a very tight inefficient and edge of the the kind of thriller\nThis fascinating about this movie is that\nYou are watching set of grants face the whole time and he's just on the phone you never see the woman that he's talking to in Iraq and goes and some of the other characters that he's talking to over the phone\nOf this movie you know reminds me of a very famous phrase Hitchcock used employer just playing the audience like a violin and this movie does that without showing you mean you'd actually forces you to imagine\nBut worst of what he's describing Danish we might add to read and business [laughter] what are you so much you can you could just read the subtitles the whole you know as if I mean despite that the costs phobia it's visually interesting to keep\nThe director keeps a very compelling and there's a lot of intricate layer twists and turns and this and the narrative emerges with such clarity even as you were just having to visualize so it's it's a very much kind of demands a reward your attention [noise] um and it's it virtually the only because the sort of in character\nAnd I was prepared not to like this ... this is weird and it just captivated me so uh if\nBig that Fox has a cartoon which we gave her prize last year these are interesting animated films nothing is silly this year or less but very interesting work\nAgain this weekend at the ... Chinese theaters Hollywood the animation is film festival mid nineties a comedic dramas written and directed by Jonah Hill in which he makes his directorial and feature writing ... view sunny subject and Lucas had just stock Claudia\nOh we're talking just talking earlier about uh actors making a grandchild debuts and um you know I was thinking about credit gr wagon Lady Bird and yeah how perfect that one was in her looking back at her adolescence this one isn't as much um but it has\nA moment I think he might develop into a good director um he has kind of a nice naturalistic style and there are some moments that um some visuals that I think really work that mostly deal with the young main actor sunny subject I think is really good\nUm and ... Smith is kind of a surrogate big brother he has a big rather play by Lucas Hedges about his I'm not given much to do and fortunately 'cause he's going after\nBut I'm the feels that direction less it feels like a first draft it feels like there needs to be more edits and more\nGood also feels very much like the derivative product of its influences which is fine but you know you're you're what Larry Cox kids primarily for me the nineties yeah total nineties missed out on a trip to very you know self consciously not wink wink but it's it's it's it's all their link later like linked later group hangout portraits um\nI think there are problems with the script that the ... never really quite gets over despite trying to pure scrappy and and thrown together um and there are two really good skate movies this years kitchen and mining the gap both of which I think are a lot better than the\nMid nineties the film from writer director and he doesn't ... writes in direction this film Jonah Hill it's rated R. at the arc light Hollywood landmark west LA the great buster a celebration a new documentary about the tremendous comedian buster Keaton\nA includes archival footage and Peter bogged down a bit she is the director of the documentary Charles\nThis is very much about Donald ditches Valentine's buster Keaton I mean you can see the influence of Keaton and say what's up talk a film I like very much a bug daughter that she has\nA she was one of the greatest comedians ever you know one of the giants of silent film you had a huge impact on cartoons humor the Warner Brothers directors were always talks about looking to keep them for ideas he did not have a happy life\nAfter his brilliance and the weddings was stuck it MGM where he made a lot of really bad movies you're drinking problems or he seemed forgotten for a while\nAnd now this we rediscovered him you know in subsequent decades and they'll just how brilliant in great he was there beautiful restoration of his film in for Kerry who ever gets tired of the general\nOf the ... the generals on my top ten list at all times one of the greatest films ... junior yeah uh\nAnd there are lots of people who knew him were just they tribute to her in a few like Dick Van Dyke and I'm a drugged up there and I'm trying to read his name um Mel Brooks you kind of expect but Vernon hurt saga and Clinton turn [laughter]\nAh but you know how could anyone who's interested in film can't help but look keys and he was so imaginative so technically innovative such a master of timing is work is brilliant and it's lovely\nTo so many or a film one week I mean the list goes on and on and you keep them great the great posture a celebration Peter Bach Donald ... documentary tribute to buster Keaton is it the new what theater in West LA it's unrated\nThe comedy an evening with Beverly Laughlin stars operate closet Jim Hoskins the director and co screenwriter with David White Claudia\nWell director uh Jim Hoskins specializes in weirdos into ... and not just quirky you know characters that full on bizarre as um so you need to have a tolerance for oddball movies where all the characters are are eccentric and the story is pretty absurd um next adjusted [laughter] and Charles I had\nA but there's massive method to this madness I enjoyed it there's kind of a structured bizarre ness Opry plaza and her eye rolling ways it's kind of perfect for this gym and climb into I've always loved them by the concourse Craig Richardson it's it's a little disjointed and it's not consistent 'em by you know if you like these characters and you like\nYour like these actors and ah you have that tolerance for oddball movies where they don't they kind of take twists and turns and you know there are intermittent laughs I'd I'd say\nDo for this an evening with Beverly lost limbs drawing up replies a directed and co written by Jim Hoskins it's rated R. at ... know whole theater in North Hollywood also\nWant to remind you the tickets are now on sale for our December second Sunday afternoon matinee screening of the artist is our next film week screening\nAt the theater at ace hotel downtown Los Angeles Sunday afternoon December second the artist a Hollywood historian and consulted on the ... will be with us and also our film we are critics layer loans dean and Wade major tickets KP C.
