I think\nThe movie really does get you to root for her and draws you into complicity with her scheme or with out sanitizing her or redeeming or even like she doesn't really need redemption\nNo and you see her I mean she's ... and she but you do see her humanity and you see that she is lonely and you see sort of um the frustrations of being an artist you kind of a writer who's out of step and whose work is not appreciating says she's sort of forced into this situation um and so you you haven't you haven't empathy for her if\nYou do and you also she does have you know sort of I guess the obligatory psychic role but in this case it really it accounts for a Richard ... plays a jak hawk who's the man that she you know he's he's a drifter kind of a bit of a a hustler himself\nAnd and you know ... and they become unlikely friends and eventual accomplices and their dynamic is is so witty and so it was so caustic and yet there's this affection that ... that that uh emerges in their dynamic that never feels forced\nThey have such a great chemistry together and and I like the way they created New York city in this era um it it's kind of dusty musty and and it feels like you really are going back to this particular time which was not that long ago that was the eighties right\nNow they're really Lee Israel she actually wrote\nLike authentic ... for four she started doing the\nForgery here I had written a biography of Dorothy kill gallon and uh another so that's ... yeah it was the ... the yeah the bank had yes and that kind of pushed her into the financial problems and then she started forging these letters by Dorothy Parker she had kind of a similar Dorothy Parker which\nAnd that's that's one of the wonderful things about the movie too and it shows that she kind of becomes a fraud and an artist yeah in time yeah it's a very much an appreciation of the art form it takes to forge something to write like and there's this part with him because nobody could write like Dorothy Parker and she kind of give them [laughter]\nSo you\nGet you should go see a Charles given your knowledge when she said can you ever forgive me is the film it's rated R. starring Melissa McCarthy and Richard III grant Mary Elle Heller the director the coal hollow center in jeopardy or the screenwriters it's at the arc light Hollywood and the landmark in West Los Angeles\nI live for drama is drawing Carey Mulligan Jake Gyllenhaal it's directed by Paul they know who also co wrote the screenplay with Zoe cars than Justin what'd you think of wildlife\nLike it was a very strong film is actually one of three uh at least three directing debuts that are opening this weekend one of two are directing the abuse by actors in this case\nPaul ... who wrote the screenplay with the actress and writer and his partner is that we ... them um and it stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Carey Mulligan as a married couple in great falls Montana in Nineteen sixty um\nIt was a portrait of the collapse of the marriage amendment that takes place over the course of the movie in a very measured intelligent somewhat deliberate fashion um and yet despite that slowness of pace which may be trying for some I was completely held and riveted by it partly because the performance was just so good\n'em join hall who I think under plays a bit more than he usually does as this man who is incredibly frustrated and uh his ... his masculinity feels under threatened he so he goes off to fight these forest fires that are away and his wife a play by Kurt ... and it's like it feels so resentful and abandoned by him when he goes off\nThat she uh\nBasically braces for liberation or I should say after he leaves and comes into this sort of defiant new understanding of herself Carey Mulligan at such a good actress in such an underappreciated one I have never seen her better on screen I think are saying well yeah same of ... and just the volatility promotion and also all the stories you'd say before worships\nUm is seen through the perspective of their fourteen year old son played by ... Australian actor named at ...\nHe's excellent to I guess I agree a hundred percent with everything you said um it's based on a Richard Ford novel he's one of my favorite novelists and his his his it really has the feel of Richard Ford novel come to life I think that that's over ... really did a good job of of adapting a that it's\nSet in the sixties and you feel that it's set in the sixties although I feel like Carey Mulligan characters more of a\nA contemporary kind of woman in many ways um\nIt's so detailed and meticulous and it's very as very elegantly done I'm Jake Gyllenhaal as you say is is very understated she's wonderful and it's told from the viewpoint of this boy who I think it's also just really great I mean the other ... and then there's another performance it's actually really good bill camp\nUm but yeah for ... for for his directorial debut it's complex it's this deep dive into this the psyche of his broken family and and um it invokes the era of really well I think he did a beautiful jak does he have a role in the film no not at all just directions railroad yeah\nEverybody said that the potential to detail in this movie is extraordinary and I think the whole Dana I'm kind of risk youths a a a stereotype we sometimes have about actors turn directors in for him that he he does not appear on screen and\nHe doesn't just the performances are so good but it's not just the performances it's not just actors indulging actors he pay so much attention to everything in the brain and he shoots a lot of this like from a distance to do you want you to get the environment and the atmosphere not just not just the characters\nAnd he and so I guess in a work together on really spark they did they both yeah here to that and uh do the right to I Can't remember maybe she wrote it yeah yeah they've collaborated before because I think the average ... ... oh okay so she had written and I both okay but whatever it is their their collaboration really works here\nUm and it was a bit like a play but it never has sort of that\nIt it's claustrophobic but not an stifling way it is for pre it sort of way\nThe movie is wildlife starting Carey Mulligan Jake Gyllenhaal directed by Paul Dana co wrote it with Zoe ... rated PG Thirteen it's at the landmark in West LA and the arc light in Hollywood the Danish thriller the guilty directed by Gustavo Mohler what'd you think Claudia\nI Love this movie I saw it at Sundance I've and I've seen it a few times since program different film festivals I'm speaking to posture phobic this one is confined to one location and it's\nKind of reminds me of a movie that came out a few years ago which I absolutely adored called walk with Tom Hardy where it all took place kind of in real time in in in a confined space in that case it was his car and this one it's um\nIt's in a police station and this is a guy who had been a detective and it's kind of demoted to being a um call center emergency calls that are person\nAnd he gets this call a of a woman who's been abducted for simply by her husband and so you know he is in the process of sort of\nA healthier and in the thriller takes twists and turns and its suspenseful and the lead actor Jacob ... is amazing he's a Swedish actor who's I think pretty big in ... um someone that we don't recognize necessarily but it's a very tight inefficient and edge of the ... kind of thriller\nThis fascinating about this movie is that you are watching ... face the whole time and he's just on the phone you never see a woman that he's talking to in Iraq and goes that's where the other characters that he was talking to over the phone\nOf this movie you know reminds me of a very famous phrase Hitchcock used employer just playing the audience like a violin and this movie does that without showing you a scene you'd actually\nForces you to imagine the worst of what he's describing editor Danish we might add if he has to read and they're looking for what you can\nYou could just read the subtitles the whole you know if I mean despite that the costs phobia it's visually interesting too he keeps it the director keeps a very compelling\nAnd there's a lot of intricate layer twists and turns and this and the narrative emerges with such clarity even as your just having to visualize so it's it's a very much it kind of demands and reward your attention [noise] um and it's it works really well because the sort of in character\nIs up you have some personal issues that come up and so this movie becomes very works very well the psychological portrait as well as with\nReal sounds fascinating the film is the guilty\nOr from Danish director Gustavo Mohler co wrote the screenplay it's rated R. to lend lease playoffs ...
