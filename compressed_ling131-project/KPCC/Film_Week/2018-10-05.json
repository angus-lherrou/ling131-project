because I actually enjoyed that him and I'm the last person that expected to I'm not a huge fan of this genre and I particularly dislike the way the trailers had and the ads had made the film looked like it was all about you know just bad I think the I think the one she says\nWe've had enough heroes and we're all this had enough here as a ... it's it's look\nTom Hardy is what makes this movie he is such a great actor we've seen him play bad guys you've seen him play good guy do we ... he can do more than any actor I can think of today who's as young as he is he\nIs what makes this character so good and ... when Eddie Brock is is contaminated by this venomous ... or\n... alien ... he then manages to sort of take on taking side and take on the other creature so it's almost like in you know in the actress has kind of thing where the the creatures inside him but it's funny it's funny as heck because of the way\nTom Hardy navigates the relationship between the two of them instead of it's almost like he's got these two voices in his head and it just it just made me laugh\nIt does give a whole new meaning to interior monologue I Will say that yes it that way and a good where are you\nKnow I don't think so uh [laughter] I\nGet ... ... they're they're they're now three studios er during marvel films there's Disney which is during models and by the universe there's Fox which is doing everything X. men and related to them\nAnd then Sony is kind of they still have one foot in the Spiderman right they've kinda they're sharing that with marvel now to try to figure that out and this is I guess technically part of the Spiderman a realm but they're doing this entirely independent of marvel and you can tell that\nThe marble entirely in well in in ... yeah yeah but But Kevin ... not sort of ... and see you right so you you can tell that there's kind of a missing they're trying to they're trying to find a tone here that is their own that you write\nAnd it it's not can't be enough or student can't be soon enough to really win me over it starts off very serious like a you know almost like a pie editor like a predator they'll miss your space ship coming back with these\nOrganisms that they've found other comment somewhere and then the crashes and one of them gets loose and next thing you know people are merging with some ... and making that voice\nAnd ... and and then about an hour in it starts getting kind of campy and weird and it's not just this demon ... not just in Beijing the body Snatchers thing he's making jokes and he's he's wise cracking if suddenly the symbiotic can speak English\nAnd has a sense of humor attitude and ... that comes so out of the blue and it wasn't that out of there and it was uh\nI should note Scott Rosenberg is one of the writers on this his who he's just he's got such a quick and ... that I I think you can really find him yet\nIf it if it'd lay the groundwork sooner like within the first ... like the way Starman did you know right John Carpenter Starman let you know right away we're going to be having fun\nWith that but I think that's part of the charm of it in ways that you don't expect it so it when it comes along you're like you're sort of delight in\nYou know I didn't you were alive delayed it or not people into the average elated I didn't love Michelle Williams in nor the way she was shot or led by the way ... having quite a week ... star is born and van and which I thought I didn't love the way it looked at looked sort of muddy\nAnd but it's good stuff for me but he is having it at that may be\nThe first time it to my memory that that itself in talk of his job at the top two grossing films when you see that's a good question I don't even remember same cinematographer having two films than we\nDo know he of course shop black swan was nominated for that he's been around long hair done a lot of really good at but um yeah other than that the look of the film which I didn't care for China and the time I had a good time in my lab it was fun ...\nEveryone in my theater was having a good time too\nSo you can imagine [laughter] All right he wasn't struck by them or tell them how to use it event Michelle Williams and\n... Ahmed Ruben Fisher the director therefore accredited screenwriters including Scott Rosenberg rated PG Thirteen in wide release and the frames John horned interviewed resigned mad about the film you can hear that with a link on our film we page or its KP C.

Regina Hall Russell Hornsby an algae Smith\nFollows the character of steel stark Carter as she lives in two worlds a poor mostly black neighborhood where she lives and the wealthy mostly white prep school she attends\nKnife or vote against John\n[noise] Lilian for this and that that was going on here I'm biracial to\nBasically Williams is artistic at any one of the reasons they call it get it and I hate my self forgive\nThe hate you give weighed\nAlmost almost I so you know Eighteen minutes of this movie it's about two hours and Fifteen minutes long it's a long movie\nUm the the first eighty some minutes is great absolutely terrific and then it kind of overplay its hand in a in a really unfortunate away the last fifty minutes which should have been about twenty five that could have lost twenty five minutes I could tell you exactly what it needed to lose\nAnd it would've been much much better film as it is it's worth seeing it's really worth seeing a if for no other reason among list and bird\nIs extraordinary and lead part she carries every second of this film on her shoulders\nAnd it is and is a very difficult emotional trajectory to sell to to work that character through all of these difficult paces all these things that she was juggling she has a white boyfriend she doesn't tell her family about her dad used to be a drug dealer\nHe's trying to do right by his kids they go to a prep school they're all of these dynamics that she's juggling and dealing with before the shooting and then the shooting just turns her world upside down inside out and she\nShe's just a force of nature she's amazing actress and then we seen her before and and uh yes she was in one of the hunger games movies when she was when she was younger so she's and she's been around for a little bit but this was really her coming out she is absolutely tremendous year and everything in the film that works it works because it has to go through her\nUm the now George Tillman who directed this previously did ah you know the barber shop movie soul food has a real Gloucester machine to his movies I've I've met Tillman in title or socially and they're just wonderful guys and that wonderful miss in them always comes out in the film sometimes to the point where it's maybe a little too polished\nAnd I was going into this thinking okay is is the George Tillman gloss\nGoing to be able to is it going to to undermine the grip that needs to come when this goes really really difficult\nAnd and he does the ... some of the best work he's ever done I mean as a director it's absolutely superb the only thing is that it in that last about fifty minutes and I and then I Would ... probably up to the novel and probably because young novelists tend to do this\nWhere they they will get to that crucial point where you want to you the story has to tie up you've got to hit your Daniel ... you got to hit all those high points\nAnd you wonder did I Do it well enough and you don't trust what you had written before that enough\nSo you sort of overdo it you over salad and there are about seven climax this year\nIt's a little bit over up there in a climax for for other movies it could have been scaled back and it would have been more powerful that would have let the those first Eighteen minutes really kind of work on you so I I think it's unfortunate that it doesn't rap out as well as it should it's a little clumsy at the end but the stuff that's good is really good\n... ... it wasn't she grew in how she was a screen stealing a performance was\nThe hate you give a movie starring a man but Stamberg directed by George Tillman junior Audrey Wells adapted screenplay from Angie Thomas's novel it's rated PG Thirteen added select theaters in Southern California\nWe have more to come on film week but also one of alert you to the only scheduled gubernatorial debate between Gavin Newsom and John Cox you'll hear it live Monday it's ten\nRight here on eighty nine point three K BCC and then I'll be hosting a state wide call in program listeners in San Francisco Los Angeles San Diego Paul will weigh in\nThere are less than five weeks until the mid term we talked a lot about how women are energized but since the cabin I hearing the attention has turned to men\nThere is a very scary time for young men in America when you can be a healthy of something that you may not be guilty of\nAnd it feels I'm its condescending and it it feels as though they're there to they they don't trust the audience to really make sense of what the of the story they are telling them that they didn't want to go back and do another cut\nIf that voice over was part of the original screenplay it's a huge mistake either way um it it really undermines the films are effective is\nBob ... is the film about Pablo Escobar and Virginia relay whole Javier ... Penelope Cruz star Fernando lay on day ...\nIs the director and screenwriter treated our you can see it at the AMC dining sunset in West Hollywood\nA lot to not lot a lot a is a Nineteen thirty for film that's being re released the movie is directed by John vehicle who also co wrote the screenplay for the film stars Dieter ...\nYeah this is a classic film and it's it's really an an early sound era masterpiece Johnny go was I think only twenty nine years old when he died was it tuberculosis flavor\nOf your losses and I was about I think a week or two weeks after the film was released\nWhich was extraordinary up until this time he had done some shorts and a longer short almost defeats\nOf zero for conduct which was really it kind of ... figure the four hundred blows very many ways a beautiful beautiful film he ...\nHe had a ... a wonderful sense of camera almost a ... a a father of the new wave in some way to the camera became an instrument for him and was able to sort of\nYou know make a move and make it flow um his imagery is so beautiful this is the story of a of a young couple who boarded boats there I'm from ... out in the ... in in France and ah there's a there's a complicated dynamic between the two of them there's also an old man on the boat and ... and a younger guy on the boat and\nUh she wants to explore the city when they get to parents she goes off and and has their own adventure\nAnd and then there's this sort of a fight between the two of them and it it you can't give too much away here but there's this lyrical iconic moment that ends up in in the water gorgeous gorgeous black and white them and how graffiti and and it it just sticks in your head\nHow's how's the print is this a ...\nIt's a lot of Russian restoration\nAnd and it's it's just poetry is pure poetry or this is one of those films that they will show you in film school as a as an example of you know this is a true Phil masterpiece and it's so sad because it was\nHis first and only one in nine years and years old his first and only feature film you're like well said you'd made you know short leading up to that and if you go is a really seminal figure because he's one of the he's he's one of these French artist who came from\nA to some degree and and I wish we could sway us you know do you do a good are Swiss but very much a part of the same culture where they come from this reactionary ... background\nAnd then sort of translate that into an artistic reflection of his father was a bit of a notorious anarchist in France and so there's there's there's a lot of there's a lot of baggage and his family background but he he wrestles with in in his art and it is it is pure poetry is allegory and it is a it is what it really one of the seminal films of all\nTime so you're a horrid horrid the directors or writers you think that the go influence\nI Would say well for sure I ...\nAbsolutely true photo was was influenced by this I Would I Would argue that even though they were contemporaries of the rental are in many respects influenced by you go I think\nSo yeah and she was so certainly also because the whole idea with the new wave was at the camera became a pan the camera with your writing instrument and be go you know he was like Twenty years ahead of that but yeah he he was he was right there with that and it would have been wonderful to see what he could have done had he lived\nMovie has a lot along from Nineteen thirty four Jones' ego the director and co screenwriter is drawing Dieter Harlow the film is unrated you can see it at the new our
