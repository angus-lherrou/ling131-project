it's just like having a voice for having a talented writing and then losing a part of that losing um local court or losing access to your you know hand to write it down it just it was\nTerrifying to lose that mode of expression that I was so in touch with that I so love die so cultivated for my whole entire life and it was your entire\nLife I mean that that was dancing was and and still is your your your life\nYeah I started when I was three ... and I retired ballet at forty seven but I'm fifty now and I just took a class and I did yoga this morning and I moved my body and and I felt good so I was happy\nAnd it's nice to hear so once you realized after your hip surgery and after the rehabilitation and physical therapy when you realized you could dance again\nBut it was time to leave the extreme dance in the New York city ballet did he change your identity to leave the New York city ballet you'd been with a ballet for Thirty years that I mean that was your your principles that was really like your identity and if one of the most famous ballet companies in the world\nYeah I I I moved to New York from Louisville, Kentucky when I was Fifteen\nMy ultimate focus was was the New York city ballet getting in hopefully and thriving in that company and um and I did I was there as a an apprentice when I was Seventeen I'm joined when I was Nineteen and\nGrew up there I you know everything I experienced as an adult\nHappened as a member of New York city ballet so it all connects to that place so to leave it as an adult I'm going into it as basically a child was\nScary really scary yeah I mean like who are you if you're not the principle of inner city of LA\nYeah and I know they give us our our um schedule a day or two days before so I Know every day when I'm supposed to do ... leaving your city ballet the world doesn't do that for me to do that myself [laughter]\nSo that was huge you know to sort of let myself no oh well if you want to sleep and you can sleep in you know that was like\nWell you know just letting go in and releasing and relaxing a little bit was huge\nWas letting go hard I mean it was so I'm something you don't really know how to do [noise] I've been strapped in you know physically\nStrapped in the point you strapped into a leotard in tights ... my hair's been strapped up [noise]\nFor my whole entire life\nAnd two on tie the shoes [noise] um I don't wear leotard anymore I wear T shirt and I wear pants I don't wear tights\nI generally where my hair looser and or or even in a braid now um I wear socks on my feet I don't like to be constricted now but that was safe than I was terrified to be on constricted and now I don't know another way I'd rather be so\nYeah it was from one extreme finding the safety and the other\nWhen you were describing how you address are you talking about on stage or off\nBoth on stage enough I I wake up I go to class at ten ten thirty in the morning on ... on a tight zone and shoes and my hair's up and I spend that day ... ... well like that until you know a ... day then I go and do a performance and everything was\nBecomes a little bit tighter [laughter] including the nervous system so everything's on a on a high ladder of like [noise]\nYou know I got a I've got to succeed I I Can't fault her I have to you know make that step happen I have to feel in the zone\nI'm In front of three thousand people tonight and then coming off of that from a performance is takes a while your adrenaline has pumped and\nYou calm down and maybe you go to sleep at midnight or one or if you can't sleep because you're nervous later than that and then you get up and you do it all again the next day I did that for\nDecades um and I don't consider myself a ballerina now I'm a I'm a former ballerina now so there's some of it's still in there but I don't um\n[noise] try to attain ... what I was in the same way anymore I've given it up I've let it go and it's life and we all have to do that at some point and\nIt's hard sometimes to do it in our culture because I think people are ashamed of getting older it's in their shame definitely people don't hide their age the way they used to because it's point last saw anybody needs to do is go on Google so what\n[laughter] bother to hide it but but still I think\nPeople are very often very self conscious about their age especially in professions where you're judged by your age and that covers a lot of professions but when you're judged visually by your age I mean I'm sure that's one of the reasons why so many people get cosmetic surgery\nYou know Mm yeah [noise] I've always been I mean I've always been proud of always been a while I'm this old never lied about my age and I know so\nBut but but and a ballet it must have been like wow I don't know she's like she's forty five now when she when she gonna retire how much more does she have left did you feel that from people\n[noise] I you know I heard later in my career my boss say we're going to outlast some of your your colleagues\nJust physically I can tell 'em until I was revved up about that I felt confident and yeah\nYou know I sure am and I and I did\nBut then at the same time he's the one that's okay now maybe you should rethink doing this particular roller this particular thing and you know and so you know he's kind of the master of of time ... Mr time [laughter] [noise]\nWhat was your mix between anger and gratitude [laughter] about oh maybe it's no longer time for you to be doing this wrong I think the role he was talking about was in the ... which you'd done every year\nYeah I was surprised I went into the meeting thinking it was about something else I had no idea that this was going to come up um\nThis was a murder trial I mastered Peter Martin's\nYeah and because I hadn't had any real pain in my body I mean I knew I wasn't twenty eight anymore but at the same time I ... I wasn't feeling\nPain and or boredom I still feel inspired and I'm so when it happened I was what you are you serious I shocked me and then it hurt really really bad and I cried a lot for a while um\nAnd I think the shock was was what hurt the most is because I didn't expect it how long\nAfter that meeting did you get injured\n[noise] um that happened in I think October two thousand eleven and [noise] by um January two thousand twelve I had pain mhm [noise] so two months and the pain never stopped in different areas of my body\nFor four years while it's a long time to be in the yeah yeah\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll shock similar if you're just joining us my guest is Wendy Whelan who was a principal dancer with the New York city ballet for Thirty years she retired from the company and twenty fourteen after making a comeback following a hip injury the new documentary restless creature is about that period of her life\nWill be back after a break this is

down\nYour junior Chang author of the art of logic tells us how logic and helpless or green\nOr at least disagree more hopefully it's all on science friday from WNYC studio\nTonight at midnight you're eighty nine point three gay PCC\nThis is fresh air if you're just joining us my guest is Wendy Whelan who was a principal ballerina with the New York city ballet for Thirty years\nIn twenty Thirteen hip injury led to reconstructive surgery in months of rehabilitation and physical therapy she returned to the New York city ballet for the spring twenty fourteen season and retired from the company that October after a triumph in performance she noticed contemporary dance\nNukem restless creature documents that period of her life from her surgery to her comeback it period during which you worried about whether she would dance again and how leaving the New York city ballet would alter her identity\n[noise] how did you get the hip injury that led to your pain into your surgery\n[noise] came out of nowhere literally came out of nowhere I um [noise]\nI slipped on ironically September eleventh two thousand twelve [noise] and um I knew something had happened I it was the smallest slip\nSo effort less and it looks like you're just kind of floating\nBut you're not I mean gravity kind of like this when you're on\nThe age doesn't stop for you [laughter] can you talk about what you're physically doing in that particular move\nIn that valley you're ... you're talking about is called ...\nAnd um that's the very last moment of the peace um and I always felt like I was um [noise] a switch blade in that moment\nMy partner ... he's he's like a magician and luckily for me I got to partner with him for about Fifteen Years [noise]\nAnd ah he's holding me in a certain way any lifts me up like a Jack knife from under my hips under my my my bottom [laughter] sort of taking my my ... my hips high up into the air and my legs are named Jack knife position\nAnd he dropped me back down any meals at the same time and I'm just\nSort of doing back dive holding on to my front foot\nBack bending with his support rotating cart willing backwards catching myself on the floor with my hands letting my legs follow me and sliding under his leg and two in Neal and he kneels behind me and me both look at the audience and the lights fade\nIt's just really like cool [noise]\nAnd how does it physically fields is just feel like well this is hard I'm really exerting myself or does it feel as fluid as it\nLooks feels heavenly feels like magic mhm feels like it was like there is no other place I'd rather be than making that movement right there then mhm yeah\nWell the importance of valley shoes when you're a ballerina like having like the exact right shoo oh you mean like the points you yeah\nI'm the one where you go up on your toes one where you go up ... yeah it needs to fit like a glove\n[noise] so it really needs to ... we practice pointing our feet working exercising our feet so that we can articulate\nUm the joints in the feet and the and create um shapes um sculpting defeat um because that's a huge part of our expression\nUm the footwork so when you get on a point you you uh do you want to be able to follow through with that articulation and not have it break the line or break the movement or break your ability to express to the most [noise]\nWith that but I think most dancers now start point work at twelve or so and all the way through your childhood and your and your young years you're trying to get that right she would fit you just write and to make your foot shape just right so it's honest [noise]\nTrue strong powerful gorgeous\n[noise] see you started dancing at the age of three yes him by twelve you were diagnosed with school Leo says how severe was it\nUm severe enough that the doctors wanted to treat me for it with some traction body casting\nAnd ultimately a Milwaukee brace so they wanted to halt the curve because if they didn't hold the curve when they found it the curve probably would've um accelerated to a place where I Would have needed surgery which ultimately would not have allowed me to have a ballet career\nSo we caught it really right at the crux of it either getting worse without treatment or halting and\nAnd uh respond to treatment and being a dancer a was a great thing the doctor told me back then he said the best things for ... says this was in Nineteen Seventy nine\nOr Nineteen eighty um our swimming and ballet was a great and therefore my body was flexible enough that it ... really responded to the treatment quickly I grew in inch and a half\nAfter a week of traction in the hospital and the doctors were thrilled and that really kind of\nPulled me away from the surgery side of things where as\nOne of my my hospital room mate didn't get so lucky and she ended up having to get a a rod and her spine [noise]\nSo when you had to wear a body cast mhm how did how did you keep up with dancing\n[laughter] well\nI was in a Fifteen pound body cast I'm so imagine one of those down vest that you can get it north face or one of the [noise] basically that made out of plaster was what I Lived in for it ended up being a month at a time over five months one summer\nAnd in between each casting I Would go back into the hospital and spend a week interaction with a head Halter on and leather straps holding my hips down towards the base of the bed and twelve pounds pulling on my head on\nHis head hold her [noise] so um as an ... uncomfortable as that was it really helped me straighten out my back [noise] and then I Would go into this body cast for a month for the time and my teacher said to me at the time living in Louisville, Kentucky she said you know you've done so well\nAnd I don't want you to lose your focus during the treatment right now so I Want you to come into the studio and your body cast and I want you to try to do whatever you can do we don't expect you to do this we don't expect to do that but just\nFeeling out move your body keep your brain\nFocused on what we're talking about in the class so that you just stay connected and um that was
