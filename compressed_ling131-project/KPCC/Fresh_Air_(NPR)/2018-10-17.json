land next to some railroad tracks and across the street from a liquor store and a coffee shop it's where they want to build permanent supportive housing for homeless people and many of the neighbors aren't having that you've heard my stories on the air this past week now check on my latest report at LAX dot com\n\nThis is eighty nine point three key PCC Pasadena Los Angeles a community service of Pasadena City College number one in associate degrees but transfer in Southern California learned more at Pasadena dot edu\nFrom WHYY in Philadelphia I'm Terry Gross with fresh air\nToday growing up with an accent mother who is addicted to heroin\nWe talked ... about his new graphic memoir for young adults hate kiddo how I lost my mother found my father and dealt with family addiction his mother started doing drugs like she was Thirteen his new book is nominated for a National Book award\nAnd assigning for one of his earlier books his wife overheard a woman telling a friend\nThat was his mother's parole officer and I went on the house to do a wellness check\nAnd he was a baby crying alone is created\nBy himself no one else in the house\nThat's an example of why of course asked his grandparents assumes legal custody when he was about to turn three welcome to being the child of an addict that's coming up on fresh air\nFirst news live from NPR News in Washington I'm neuron secretary of state Mike Pompeo is on his way to Ankara to speak with Turkish officials about the disappearance of writer ... who hasn't been seen in public since he entered the Saudi conflict and stumbled two weeks ago\nThe story is told the perspective of the the Seventeen year old Jared and you know it it's funny I didn't really think of it as a quote unquote you know grown up book\nBut really are a lot of grown ups have been reading it and responding to it and identifying with it because you know addiction touches so so many of us are either directly or just we're just one degree away from it it seems\nSo are the details about your mother that you felt were too upsetting to put in a book for young people\nI've been working on this book in one way or another since the early early to thousands and Everytime I Would sit down to write it would stop and hesitate because I Would I Would worry to myself well why don't people kind of thing and at first it was\nWhat are the people in the book going to think you know if I'm writing about them and um and I was shopping hesitate and then as my career grew in I became known as the the lunch lady guy I have a series of graphic novels about a lunch lady who fights ... crime and it's camping it's funny and\nI thought wow this is this is writing a book on the subject matter going to be in such contrast to that [noise] those happy books that I Would be putting my career on the line um\n... as I traveled the country and I met more and more and more young people who are dealing with this I realize that there's a sort of a responsibility for me to write this book I mean you know to go with a theme of comic books were with a great power becomes great responsibility now I have an audience of these kids who grow up with my books\nI'm able to deliver the story in a very unique away\nAnd I and I feel like I owe it to these readers to to put myself out there and I realize that if I if I was going to write memoir had just write it without any inhibition and I I wrote down the expression in El censor this for the radio but I said right like you don't give an ass\nAnd not that I don't care about the craft or care about the readers but I Can't worry about negative opinions you know I have to just write this and put out there so there are some things I learned about my mother later on in life\nUm but I couldn't give some of that knowledge to that Seventeen year old protagonist because that would have really affected his relationship with his mother and up but there there is one particular scene a because I did have to explain\nHow really how my mother fully went away you know what would take this woman away from her two year old almost three year old son\nAnd this is something I learned as an adult and I was able to find a way to share that in the story but not give that knowledge to the protagonist and when I was when I was a toddler she was in a very abusive relation\nYup and her boyfriend at the time came home and he and his colleagues had a drug deal gone bad and they murdered somebody and uh my my mother help them clean up and dispose of the evidence and and that's a big reason why she went away\nTo college you're heading that would have been doing it as a child\nWas upsetting to me as an adult him and I learned about it right before the birth of my first child and so I kind of you know what let me just mentally shove that we can focus on being a dad to the human being that I don't know how to take care of\nAnd then um some years later you know when I was really digging in researching this book I realize narrative Lee\nHave to explain to the readers fully why she's going away for so long um you know you don't go away that long for for shoplifting at the mall or or for stealing batteries from a convenience store um and I'll tell you like\nYou might be the ... six or seven person I've ever so the ... how to Terry and I share that for those young readers out there who are dealing with heavy issues at home so it took a long time for me to gain that courage to make this book\nNow I really understand why your grandparents insisted on getting legal custody of you because they were afraid you'd become a word of the state\nThat's exactly it that's exactly it and they were and they also are afraid I Would get hurt\nAnd what's interesting too is for for\nYou know I have a daughter and she's she's nine she'll be tempted to an end ... has been the sort of the forbidden fruit in her house um she really wanted to read it I was wondering about that yeah yeah and so you know imagine okay here here's your family history too you know child ah\nSo I sat down with her and I explained to her a lot of the aspects of this book before she would read it and and also made sure she read it before the book was published do a classmate didn't come in and say oh I I notice about your family and she didn't\nAnd so he is so intuitive\nAnd she has such a big heart when she heard the story she immediately said well she probably went along with it because she was maybe afraid that she would get murdered or maybe they wouldn't murder you as a baby as well\nWell well you know what one of the stories you tell in the book is that when you started living with your grandparents you were shot that they made breakfast free because even before you were three when you were living with your mother you wake up to an empty house and have to make your own breakfast\nThat is true and uh I remember them telling me this and you know again sometimes things in it as an adult come at you and you learn about these different aspects of your your youth and this is an in the book because again this is something that um I Would have learned later\nI'm after my grandparents passed I created an art scholarship and their name but the Worcester art museum where I attended classes and to sort of kick start the scholarship and let people know this was happening I had an exhibit at the ... museum and there was also coincided with my ten year anniversary of getting published\nAnd a woman came through the line with her children and dig settled they got their book signed and after they got their book signed late you know a couple of steps away and they were chatting with their friends or they didn't realize they were within earshot at my wife Gina and this woman said you know the last time I saw him\nHe was a baby and I was his mother's parole officer and I went on the house to do a wellness check and he was a baby crying alone in his crib by himself no one else in the house well there I was you know signing books\nSo it's it's wild you know there was certainly moments when you know I was more physical jeopardy than I ever realized but thankfully I had while I didn't have my birth parents take care of me I had other family members who took care of me as if\nThey were my parents [noise] All right let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is Jared J. ... he's the author of the new graphic memoir hate kids know how I lost my mother found my father and dealt with family addiction we'll be right back after this is ...\nHi this is Larry Magid there are eleven measures on the ballot that's a lot to study but I'm here to help with a live Boulder cram session joined me Wednesday night and

greater percentage of employment in the future especially in California that's to do with these uh Ninety nine point three KBC see\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Jared J. was asked to the desk picture books and a graphic\nNovels for young adults his new book is a graphic memoir is called ... how I lost my mother found my father and dealt with family addiction his mother was a heroin addict his grandparents to legal custody of him when he was a turning three\nAnd this is the story of his childhood\nSo your grandparents sound like they were very loving toward you but then they had pretty graph personalities particularly your grandmother I Want you to describe how you draw your grandmother and how you draw your grandmother's cigarettes which are typically hanging from her lips\n[laughter] yes I my grandparents loved me so much and you know despite all of the trauma that I was surrounded by their their love floated me through life and they're just about a decade gone now and I still very much feel that love and very much keeps me afloat\nThey were tricky people though you know um they drink quite a bit of a ... in fact they were\nThey were better when I was young then when my mother was young\nThey they were my grandmother could at times be violently drunk um when she was younger I guess I could sum up my grandmother with this had come home from school\nAnd somebody wrongs me and I tell the story about how this kid wrong me she would take the cigarette out of her mouth and say just tell them to go and their hat [laughter]\nNo\nAt the time I was in third grade and it sounds like such this like Great Depression World War two put down and here I Am in the eighties [laughter]\nAm I going to go back to school in Philly [laughter]\nThey were so lovingly crass though you know they'd curse around but it was never directed towards me and I remember they want to say like you know we were okay if you cursed but if you ever course at us you are in a significant amount of trouble young men you know um they smoke two packs a day each nah or and my grandfather\nJust be moans this movement of uh haven't places be non smoking you know airplanes you can't smoke on the plane like what an inconvenience to the point we said Jesus Christ by the time I die I'm going to get to heaven and they're going to say sorry no smoke\n[laughter] he died of lung cancer you die yeah you'd actually well at eighty one\n[laughter] any outlive your grandmother by a couple of years there's often a heavy smoker also heavy smoker yeah and I should say to\n'em you know she she died the summer before my wedding and unfortunately she died ah she died on a friday on my wedding shower was that Sunday\nMy grandparents are just before my third birthday which was at Christmas Time\nOf me within the next year and so there are probably a couple of years where I just had zero contact with her as a very young child what\nWas your understanding when you visited her at the halfway house was it was a halfway house or are we have facility\nI Believe it was a half I was just like she didn't live there's a spectrum house and listen to her and what's interesting is some of\nI just had a a release party in a book signing for a kid when my home town of western some old counselors actually attended and identify themselves to me so I was able to thank them for taking care of her back then\nUm [noise] I Wonder what did you learn about her from her it was it was very very brief interaction um you know I'm hoping to circle back and and get in touch with them if they can share what they can share with me but um\nI just remember how thrilled and excited I was to see her\nAnd and how devastated I was to separate from her knowing that she wasn't coming home with us and knowing that I had no idea when I Would see her next\n[noise] where are you afraid that you'd be using ... your mother did and because she had grant grandparents drank a lot like how did that affect you and when you got old enough to consider alcohol or drugs yeah I\nI you know I always feared I Would fall into that those those same steps I was always very prudish about you know having having a drink or anything like that and um\nI I knew addiction was in the family and it was hereditary\nAnd I I knew that it was dangerous territory to to dabble in things so uh you know come college remember my freshman year of college and I I was at University of Hartford I wasn't it when I was going to design just yet\nI remember that you suddenly given this freedom when you're drinking all the time and I remember sort of hitting a wall of like ... like I'm I'm drinking almost every single day this isn't healthy this isn't good I Need to get out of the situation um because I don't want to fall into that same traps of the ah my my both my parents had stuff and addictions and\nTheir addictions on both sides so\nAh so I was always very wary and very careful of that and um\nYou know so [noise] ... ... because of\nMy mother I mean um my mother was a very talented artist and when she was incarcerated or we she would send me letters and she would draw cartoons for me and a big part of how we communicated for many years was um was through art so\nShe would draw say she would drive me Snoopy and then she would request I maybe I draw her the pink panther so then I Would draw her the pink panther and then I Would write back and request Garfield\nAnd I remember as a very young person seeing how talented she was\nBut she had such squandered that talent uh because of because of the drugs and and that really was my driving force to to want to get published you know I was I was meeting book proposals to publishers when I was a junior in college\nSo I'm the first ... that you had published is when you are a freshman so I Love the story of school and the school newspaper with having a theme\nFor prom so it's like a ... and you submitted a prom cartoon that was published in the local western newspaper the telegram and cause that\nThis was an editorial cartoon contest that was all across the city for high school students and Mr ... was so brave to submit this you know who taught at holy name central Catholic high school this comic of mine a was chosen to be printed in the in the city paper so such a when you go you read the first line I'll read the second kid line\nHey man you got any protection\nWhat times guns knives or condoms\nYeah that is so great and if it were amazing that they published that fewer high school freshman so was that was a local paper\nThat was the first place to publish any of your work is that the same paper in which your grandparents read that your mother had oh deed and let's down face down on the sidewalk that's the same newspaper yeah I mean it was she survived the ... but um\nIt was I'm sure horrifying for the family to read about this in the newspaper they they probably didn't know before they read about it right\nThey did and that wasn't the first time they they learn news about Leslie in the newspaper I mean that's something that happened quite frequently\nAnd that's something that happened to me and my adult life for for the last few years of her life really the only way I can keep track of her was to go to the ... telegrams of Web sites and type in ... into the search field and find the latest court records\nWell if you're just joining us my guest is Jared J. ... and he's the author of picture books and he's the author of graphic novels for young readers his new graphic memoir is for kids a

up with family addiction\nHis mother was a heroin addict his grandparents gain legal custody of him when he was about to turn three he didn't even know who his father was until he was in high school because Africa is also known for his series lunch lady which is being adapted into\nA film and the ... was it the ... plus police squad and that's it and punt farm yes so [laughter] um you know I I should say um your\nMother died of an overdose Africa you knew you were married and had children how did you find out about that\nA phone call so um\nI had while I initially learned about the fact that she was tripping up\nFrom her directly I don't think she realized that she kind of let her secret up to me but she had these new housemates that she knew from the clinic and she did tell me the one summer that I'm One of her house mates had oh deed on heroin\nAnd that to me was all I Need to know because she really was a chameleon she had this great boyfriend for so many years they were both clean and sober together but when he died and then she took care of my grandfathers summer than he died and then she started hanging out with these other people I just knew it was going to be a downward spiral and\nWhen I saw her at a book event of mine um she she had all of these track marks on the back of her hand on her arm and she she blamed on the dog jumping up on her but I just knew my heart I knew and ah surely after my second child was born\nA this was December of two thousand and eleven she started getting arrested again and so in January of two thousand twelve\nHolly who was ... she used my aunts or by lineage but my sister or by heart and soul called me on the phone and she said did you see the paper today\nAs a hobby I live in North Hampton I live in our in western new agency the paper what happened and uh my mother was arrested for expressing false prescriptions at at pharmacies and I I went in person to talk to my mother had of her court date and she she is she assured me that she\nWas not using she was just selling it to a guy to make extra money and I said well that's really not going to convince me to bring my kids around here and I really had to put some distance between us at that point you know what I had a three year old a newborn and they needed their dad and I needed to be fully there for my children\nAnd uh and so yeah the the way I Would keep track of her she would she would get arrested 'em and they'd get arrested for driving without a license or or or you know she would be driving and the police officer tried to pull her over and she would try to run them\nShe just spend a little bit of time in jail again ah the last time I saw her was that a family funeral\nAnd that this was this would have been in spring of two thousand six team and we had a we had a nice connection you know and she said I Love you and I always will and I said mom I Love you and I always will and you know you do ... I Would worry I wake up in the middle of night thinking\nWhat if what if I'm wrong what if she really isn't using you know but then I realized that she wasn't alone because she was with she was running herself with other people just she wasn't making herself accessible to me\n[noise]\nAnd you're listening to talk on eighty nine point three KP Stacy I'm\nLorraine that's all I Hope this to you this coming Sunday at our open house you can find out all the information they BCC dot org I'll be broadcasting live\nFrom this very studio a new one o'clock this coming Sunday as part of our open house I help you come by and look at me and my a natural habitat behind glass [noise]\nUm it's not cage free but there is plenty of room to move around you can watch us as we do the program special broadcast Sunday at noon Iran eighty nine point three right now our focus on proposition twelve on your California ballot which would make changes in the housing for\nAn egg laying hens breeding pigs\nAnd kept raised for veal Josh block of yes on twelve noon humane society the U.S with us Bradley Miller of a Californians against cruelty cages and fraud Josh ... your response to Bradley Miller's claimed that centrally there's um a financial\nA ... investment here between this major egg producer in the Central Valley and the VP at the humane\nSociety well first so it's completely false uh and uh these wild conspiracy theories are are basically laughable supposedly is please let them plays Mr Miller\nA if you look at the trade publications that trade industry organizations that represent the factory farming groups\nThe national association of egg farmers the association ... California farmers they're against prop twelve national pork producers council California producers council against ... well not CNN is not an issue I mean at least I Know that they're they are completely against it\nAnd when you look at the environmental groups Mr ... Miller brought in ... in the environment there is literally not one environmental group on Mr Miller side every environmental group that has not been as has taken a position in favor of ... including the Sierra Club\nNatural resources Defense Council an earth justice and finally last point is that when you can find a hands in cages at least the food safety risk because their immune system breaks down that's why people eating food safety organization in the United states the center for food safety endorses ... well Mr Miller what are the environmental groups and opposition well\nFor one of the main farming association is an environmental organization we've been concerned about the detrimental impacts\nOf concentrated animal feeding operations like Central Valley since the early Nineteen eighties\nAnd what we're talking about here is doubling the number of factory farm animals that are going to be brought into the state that are banking on proposition twelve proposition twelve enriches the major companies it adopted their standards\nOne square foot is cruel it is inherently is cruel it doesn't matter who endorses it ages you as you do agree with us that one square foot was unacceptable now they're saying acceptable ages you as you used to be opposed to any use of cages\nSince then they lobbied for federal legislation that would have stabbed his cage is not cage free but cages is a national standard and would prohibit states from actually outlined cages\nSo we have a flip flopping organization that use proposition ... too and it's suppose of cage free by two thousand Fifteen as a fundraising device as a a promotional device\nAnd when the chickens come home to roost they're still being put in cages for\nMr Bach has has the humane society changed its position of course that he made seven states has led the charge to get animals out of cages for literally decades on and\nWe have done more than any organization to work with few corporations to announce cage free commitments to work with a legislative across the country commitments they were broken Mr Martin it's very tough being rude here thank you\nSo to to work with states to pass laws to ban the cage confinement of animals in fact who do you trust if you're a listener who do you trust you trust the ASPCA you trust more than six hundred California veterinarians who've endorsed you trust animal shelters up and down the state run in favor of this and when it comes down to it if you trust the environmental groups\nThe animal shelters California veterinarians and al ...\nHas gotten confused about this space is not going to understand why she probably not the only one 'cause we've thrown around a lot of different uh\nSpaces here so under proposition twelve on your November sixth ballot the current standard uh that the animal must be able to turn around freely lie down stand up and fully extend their limbs with wings and wings would be changed to ones\nWere such a mycologist it remains intact to rewrite here comes in for e it specifically says confining uncovered animal in a manner that prevents the animal from line down standing up for what's their limbs and turning around the reading assignments actually in a separate section gentleman\nPlease let me finish them correct me if I'm wrong when I'm done while you were right okay let me finish All right so under the current law I read the standard of what it is starting in twenty twenty I'm reading from the legislative analysts report\nProposition twelve would have the standard changed one square foot of floor space for egg laying hens with starting in twenty twenty two cage free housing maybe eating for for ... please let me finish\nFor a year I'll just leave let you guys go starting in twenty twenty breeding pig standard a would be the same twenty four square feet of floor space starting in twenty twenty two and four cats raised fruit deal forty three square feet of floor space would be the standard starting in twenty twenty and that would stay the same\nUnless you're a female enough ... less you're female cats 'cause they're allowing cash to stay in crates in California while pretending to regulate them another state\nOr Mr balk it when it comes down to the question is is\nShould we keep a status quo over animals are confined in cages because elections have consequences we all learn that here in Los Angeles we long learners across the country\nThe consequence is that if we don't pass this animals Romania cages if we do pass it will get a ... you will they will go cage free in fact it can be the most far reaching law for farm animals in history and if some oppose the most far reaching for farm animals in history\nThat's okay but that's just doesn't reflect Los Angeles is Mr Miller correct though when he says the legislature can mend this proposition to ease the standard for cage free where they can make it stronger\nAnd I'll be doing that with respect Mr mom let's have a let's have been honest friendly discussion here so the fact is this is that every leading animal group has agreed this is the most far reaching low for foreign ... Mr Miller quick closing comment this is an outright\nFlip flop on the issue of cages one square foot is cruel and no matter who says it isn't legalizing cages in the state of California when we already voted to have them illegal by two thousand and a Fifteen is obscene\nThank you very much Bradley Miller no on twelve a Josh Balk or the humane society the U.S yes on twelve and a will also have more on it tonight as a part of our voter Graham session\nLive seven o'clock to Crawford family forum you're not are already RSVP eat as a couple of weeks ago when it sold out we're sorry we're at Pasadena budge you can hear it live\nAnd the clock you're on eighty nine point three then you'd rears tomorrow morning at eleven o'clock right here on eighty nine point three from all of us at ... good afternoon fresh air is next [noise]\nAnd after fresh air to BBC News hour urine K PCC secretary of state Mike Pompeo finishes his swing through Saudi Arabia turkey so what's next for the ... case plus a mass shooting in Crimea a special report from Yemen and a taboo busting movie about the Catholic Church in Poland\nOn Tuesday October thirtieth at Chapman University joined K PCC in person for a look at the twenty Eighteen mid term elections it's free just RSVP K.

as the red light behind the scenes [laughter] when Mr Ed goes home after ...\nSeasons five of Bo Jack is on Netflix Comedy Central is rerunning season one and marine park and reviews the new book of Eleanor Roosevelt advice column that's on fresh air\nFirst news live from NPR News in Washington on Lakshmi Singh\nIf secretary of state Mike Pompeo has a good idea about the fate of ... after his meeting with Saudi Arabia's royal family and the Turkish government he's not sharing\nAnd uh I got there and I was this nobody and I didn't know anybody in town and there was this winding treacherous road up to get there which I was terrified of taking\nAnd I felt so disconnected from everything and that idea feeling simultaneously\nOn top of the world and also never more alone and isolated was the beginning of of of this character for me and I wanted to make a show about a character who had every opportunity for success and still couldn't find a way to be happy and then mixing that with leases animal drawings was the patch\nSo low jak as a horse is raising three human children in the sitcom horsing around\nIs that inspired by like different strokes about white wealthy businessmen his wife is deceased he's living on Park Avenue and he ... his late housekeepers to children who are African American ... and so it's just like unusual blended family that all the comedy is built around\nIt's actually based on a lot of things in different strokes are certainly an inspiration full house the Brady Bunch step by step I mean I think in the seventies and eighties and nineties there are a lot of sitcoms about\nDifferent family units blended family is an odd configurations of families and different ideas of of what makes a family so it felt very appropriate that in our world we have animals and people coexist thing that there would be a show about a horse bachelor\nRaising three human kids and and learning how to make a family together\nSo did you grow up on us TV shows\nI did yeah I'm a big fan of those shows the TGIF ABC wind up was a big part of my childhood I grew up Jewish and you know we we can never go out on Friday nights so we would stay in and watch family television together\nAnd those shows I mean a lot to me and you know one thing that I really enjoy exploring on Bo jak horsemen is\nOur cultures relationship with these you know some might say cheesy sitcoms of the eighties and nineties um and also bow jak zone relationship with being a part of it that even in ... ambivalence about being on this show that he knows it's not the height of art and sophistication but there are real people who come to him and say this show meant a lot to me\nAnd it means something and I like that\nWhile we're on the subject of cheesy um horsing around the show that ... start in\nHad a theme song and not many TV shows have theme songs anymore that explained the premise of the show yeah and so I Love that that horse in Iran actually has a theme song explaining what the shows about I thought we could listen to the theme song\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n[laughter] so that's the theme song for the show within a show on Bo jak horsemen I'm so why did you want a theme song for horsing around\nWell you know like you said you don't hear theme songs are certainly not expose a tour theme song so much in this day and age\nBut it does feel like a staple of those shows like the Brady Bunch of the perfect example of okay so you're just tuning and here's the premise of the show business through these characters are this is how it works um\nAnd it felt like a really fun way in like I I thought if you heard this song you would immediately know what kind of show that says\nSince bow jak as a horse did you ever watch Mr Ed you're too young to have grown up with it but I'm was that influence at all and he too like the bow jak horsemen series within the serious horsing around he too had a theme song that kind of explained\nThe premise of the show that he was a ... horse\nI you know I have seen a little Mr Ed it as a slightly before my time but I think the the nature of being my age is that when I stayed home sick from school\nI didn't have cable so I Would just watch whatever was on TV which was often older rerun so I Do have a bit of pop culture knowledge outside of my own experience\nUm and certainly part of the original pitch was what Mr Ed like behind the scenes right when [laughter] when Mr Ed goes home after students\nReally and that was helpful way to think about all that's very\nThat's really funny if you're just joining us my guest is Rafi ... Blacksburg and he's the creator and show runner of Bo jak horsemen an animated comedy tragedy [laughter] that's both really funny and sometimes\nReally really sad so we're going to take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air\nKatie cc supporters include UCLA Center for the yard of performance presenting\nBuild the Joneses analogy trilogy Saturday November third\nAnd Sunday November fourth at two PM at Royce Hall this new three part dance theater work focuses on memory and the effect of powerful events on the actions of individuals and more importantly on they're often on expressed in her life\nTickets that cat dot UCLA dot edu\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guess is ... Blacksburg he's the creator and show runner of the Netflix animated comedy drama series bow jak horsemen and um it's now in season five ... five was recently released on Netflix\nWhen I first started watching bow jak I thought oh this is such a funny show about the tropes of popular culture and then like the deeper I got into it I thought like wow there's some really lay emotionally upsetting things that happen in this\nYou know voting is an alcoholic you mean he sex is he has this ongoing monologue self destructive monologue and his head about how much she hates himself and how ... how how much he knows he's always doing the wrong thing and so what he does is is drink more\nUm invent things sometimes get like really dark and at the risk of I'm giving something away from an earlier season I'll say that Sarah Palin who\nIs the actress who plays bow jacks daughter adopted daughter on Bo jak sitcom horsing around um after she got out of rehab years later and he invited her\nTo get high which he should never have done she just got out of rehab [noise] she ended up oh dean at you know toward the end of the episode and it's it's kind of shocking I mean you know it's a comedy it's animated but you really emotionally unprepared for that\nYeah I think the the the pitch for the show you know what I went into Netflix was always going to start like your typical animated comedy and it's going to feel like as you're watching it like oh I get this I get what it is an over the course of the first season it was going to reveal itself to the audience as being something more\nAnd and darker and more interesting and kind of a goal was by the time you get to the end of the first season you're thinking oh my God I care about these characters went went up and they they tricked me um and so that\nTransition was really exciting to me and the idea that people aren't necessarily going to know what this is going in and one thing we really found is that\nIt is a very silly cards universe but it can also I think maybe because of that go to some very sincere dark a melancholy and even tragic places and that may be in a live action show some of these story beats would feel modeling or soccer in or you know a misery corny\nBut because it's animated and it's like a horse and its brightened colorful it just takes on a different feel and you can kind of sneak attack in the sadness and some funds surprising ways\nI liked it sneak attack into sadness and said in some fun ways [laughter] far north as accurate as a kind of sadness I like the final version [laughter] and and\nWell jak isn't such despair afterwards and feel so responsible he's driving any closes his eyes and nearly drives off the road but then opens his eyes just in time to save himself and I think that's a suicide attempt as opposed to him falling asleep at the wheel\nWhere I Would say it's a lazy suicide attempt right it's a suicide attempt at a plausible deniability well he's not actively killing himself but he's\nAllowing the universe to take its course you know what I mean I always felt like in a port and but maybe minor distinction to us that he is so despondent despairing that he was willing to do this but not so much that he was going to actively do it himself\nOne of the episodes that you have in the current season season five what you wrote is um an unusual episode because it's one long monologue ... mother has died she was never a nice mother she was always mean to him\nAnd during the last period of her life she had really bad dementia and low tech does not feel warmly toward her so this episode is all his eulogy for her so he's at a podium at a Mike her coffins at the side and he's not trying\nSeason five is currently on Netflix and season one is now being shown on Comedy Central\nSo you said that you regret some of the jokes from the first season and some of the ways ... bad behavior like sleeping with his co stars I'm being drunk all the time of being mean to people you just kind of regret turning some of those things and to jokes can you talk about that a little bit\nWell I you know I think regret is maybe a strong word and I I I don't know\nUm what a better word would be like you go with regret and it's it's not necessarily that we had bow jak doing these things um because I think it is part of the character and and I do think that we have fully investigated these actions and I think we've taken great pains to try not to\nGlamorize who Bo jak is um but I I think I have a firmer understanding of the power of narrative and the power of humor\nI think in the in the context of the show we were making in the context of\nAnimated shows in general are at the time when the show came out and also just TV shows about let's say bad dudes or you know dirt bags I think there is a a kind of joke\nWere feels like you're like holding someone to task but really you're playing it is like kind of cute are funny\nAnd I don't know if we always landed on the right line of that but I think there are moments in season one where maybe it feels like we're not just letting them off the hook what kind of taking his perspective on things right so if he says the sex thing or if he dismisses somebody\nThe obvious joke is not oh he's a bore and he shouldn't be saying that it almost feels like we're saying oh isn't it it's kind of cool and funny that he saying this even though we know we shouldn't be saying it like don't you kind of wish that you could say these things to you know what I mean and and that wasn't that wasn't intentional\nBut I think it's slippery I think that happens sometimes without us meeting too and I think there are a lot of comedy writers and I I Would include myself on those who sometimes think we have a better handle on what we're saying than we actually do\nAnd there's a kind of comedy that I think you could call ironic sexism or post racism\nOr yes our character is saying this thing but we you know the voice of the show don't agree with that and I think that distinction of maybe\nAre slippery then people will allow themselves to believe I don't know if you have the control over that that you think you do about how that goes out into the world and how people internalize that humor um you know I I grew up uh in the era of South Park\nAnd I think South Park is a brilliant show and there's so much that they do well and I there they've made me think about a lot of things in New ways um\nBut I they also have a lot of jokes about Jews and I remember being in middle school and high school and people like making jokes about me that they got from South park\nAnd obviously if you ask Matt and try it they would say well Carmen is not a role model what you're not supposed to think he's like cool or funnier charming but I think middle school or high school me who is the one of those jokes would say well what's the difference you know what what does that\nMean to me and I think I Am also guilty of of of making jokes like that in the mouth of Bo jak or some of our other characters and not always\nThinking about what are the longer ramifications of this on our culture\nIs there an example you can give of that of a joke that you may be regret or wish you had placed differently in it can actually\nSure I can give a couple of examples you know I I think a big one which I feel very comfortable talking about is a lot of the Jewish jokes we have had throughout the show and it's something that I myself as a Jew feel some ownership of and feel comfortable with and there's a lot of Holocaust jokes and\nI think maybe I believed in season one and two that we were passed anti Semitism and I think now I look around the world and I think that was naive on my part and I think we are not\nAs passed it is I had convinced myself that we were and thought that we were and now some of those jokes in the early seasons just hit me a little differently um another joke about somebody that I Am not as we have a joke in season to\n'em and bow jak is a very ... character and we had a a gag or he's going on this press tour and everyone's worried that he's going to say something offensive\nAnd uh they're going to Alaska and he has a line or about what we're going to Alaska\nWhat am I going to say that's going to send a bunch of inbred Eskimo barber marchers is the line and you know on paper I can defend that joke and I can say no the joke of that is not on the Alaskans it's about how stupid bow jak as and now he doesn't realize including the way it's set up as oh he is saying this offensive thing\nAnd not even knowing that it's offensive so I feel like technically we are in the right on this joke um but someone tweeted at me a couple of years ago and said you know I Am a native Alaskan myself\nAnd I was watching your show and there is not a lot of representation for my people on television and to watch this show make this joke about my people and knowing that this was the only reference in the show of my people and knowing that nobody who works on the show is of my people it it hurts\nAnd I cannot then say no but you are wrong because I did it correctly I you you misinterpreted it so you are wrong to be offended I have to hear that note and go oh you're right maybe weren't as careful about that as we should have been\n[noise] I Know I Know some ... become actually very difficult to do comedy because there's always somebody calling you out for saying something politically incorrect so I'm Wondering how you've changed the writing on the show with this kind of sensitivity\nThat you feel you didn't have in the first season and that you're trying to have no\nWell I mean first of all who says comedy should be easy like why why do you get free like oh this is my make is making my job harder yeah boom that that is what happens in life\nSometimes there are challenges in your job or your career and you have to learn how to take them and I think it's a good thing and I think this means that more people are being hurt because I don't think\nAll of a sudden just because I saw that tweet\nI I don't think that means that people were not offended or hurt by my humor before it just means now I can see it and now I Am aware of it and I think that is a good thing and I think it is a challenge to to to challenge your own preconceived notions of what is okay or what is funny or who are you making your comedy for\nAnd I think if you're a comedian who doesn't care about that\nThen fine make the comedy for the people that will not be offended and that will be your audience you know I Want to make comedy that that people who are perhaps disenfranchise or marginalized can't enjoy I don't want my comedy to exclude them so it's a challenge but I take on\nAnd it's sometimes hard to get that feedback and people say hey this really hurt me because my ego\nWants to say no it didn't you know because I Want\nTo say like no I I Am I Am smart I Am good I'm a good guy you don't understand I have good intentions but I I think hearing that really helps me and I I don't want to get to a place where I'm not hearing those notes or I feel like I don't have to hear those notes because I think it makes me a better more sensitive and more interesting writer\nIf you're just joining us my guess is ...
