and the um ... analyzed meters [laughter] yeah and it just makes you wonder like how did they do this\nHow do they do this without the kind of computer and digital technology that we have today\nIt was a it makes it even more astonishing I think you know what it is astonishing enough that human beings have ever walked in the moon but that they did it over fifty years ago um with the technology that they had\nYou know these capsules we're not really a I Would say we're not kind of reassuring to look at when you're about to get into them or they're tiny they're rickety are\nThey as you say are totally kind of analog and feel I mean I often they feel more like extensions of the machine age the MySpace age they feel like things that you would expect out of the world war two submarine or tank movie\nVery much the opposite I think of how at least my generation grew up thinking about space travel which was high tech which was you know it it was a everything having to do with space travel in the movies with sleek and grand and clean and just the epitome of technology um and really this was a\nThis was a time where you know we were being thrust into the future before the future it arrived and I just find that fascinating and you have a group of people literally making up as they go along\n[noise] you know an example of all the things that could possibly go wrong in um the gym and I ate flight the this is like the first there's going to be the test of the first space craft to dock with another spacecraft to see if that's possible [noise]\nAnd so you know a Neil Armstrong's on on that mission and as he's getting strapped in to the space capsule before takeoff\nOn this really daring and dangerous mission they realized his seatbelt isn't working like the mechanism stock and well one of the members of the tech ... says hey does anybody have a Swiss army knife and it just makes you think about if the seatbelt isn't working\nJust think about all the things that could possibly go wrong um and that's a kind of constant theme of the movie like all the things that could possibly go wrong and how amazing it is that any of this happened\nWas one of the big things I wanted to try to get across because I think uh we almost take the moon landing for granted today and and maybe it's because the sort of image of NASA at that time and and that we've lived with sense was the sort of high tech image you described in this kind of image of\nOf a sort of be hitting me of technology and the epitome of individuals this idea of superheroes basically walking among us who did these deeds that were almost easy for them because they were just so super heroic um\nAnd I think it's much more interesting to think of these people as ordinary human beings are working with the limited technology that they had you know scrounging things together figuring stuff out fixing things with Swiss army knives doing calculations with pencils and paper\nA and also you know the family is I think there's a whole untold story of kind of what this actually met on a family level and so to me it was really important to you know at every juncture be looking at Neal\nIn conjunction with with Janet with Jan and Armstrong who I was lucky to spend time with 'em before she passed away and and and and talk to about this period in their life and just you know what that means to a marriage what it means to\nA family where you're trying to raise kids you know in Neal's case to you know literally perform you know for example this Gemini mission which came disclosed resulting in his death\nOr something I didn't know about it was a total New York ... in space that almost cost the lives of two astronauts an end to the program right then in the mid sixties or any comes home and has to you know take out the trash including the pool and help make us gets breakfast in the morning how do you how do you balance those two things I think I just I found that fascinating\nYeah okay so you mentioned that it this mission nearly ended in catastrophe after um after his space craft\nStocks with the fuel spacecraft in space first time one space craft has docked with another\nThe whole thing gets out of control anything safe you know like the the the spacecraft that he's talked with\nThat's causing everything to be out of control so he ... and then realized no it's the spacecraft he's in a town of control and he's just kind of spinning and tumbling and it's noisy and it's it's it's vibrating like crazy can you talk about shooting that scene because you have several scenes\nWhere you can just experience\nThe the and the extremes of being I'm\nIn space capsule and this case because it's kind of lost control but in other cases you're entering or leaving earth's atmosphere and it's a ... right so why don't you talk about that spacecraft seen Africa after they dock\nWe wanted space flight to feel really physical in this movie you know and for you to feel the the the blood sweat and tears so to speak um but of course also those moments of of all and grand jury that surprisingly can kind of pop up um and I think what was interesting about the gym night mission was a\nYou know on the one hand you have this uh this incredible accomplishment of two vehicles documents space without without that accomplishment the moon landing would not have been possible so it was a necessary step a and it was the first step that America ever beat the Russians to an entire history of the space program or the Russians have beat America on every single other juncture beforehand\nAnd so you have this sort of you know everyone kind of feeling like a like royalty as they should\nAnd right away you know almost like a trick of fate\nThis problem you you described began and it's not just that it was a this you know can immediately life threatening issue but uh but also the confusion of it um and so keeping the camera inside the capsule as much as possible not sort of cutting out to a big wide shots that would\nThat would sort of overly explain things trying to really be subjective and immersive to what Neal himself and he and his and his colleague Dave Scott with the experience than I think that was really important to us\nAnd that was just one of many instances of you know I guess what I'd qualify as you're near failures or in certain cases failures that led the way to the success story of the moon landing um um so I think trying to remind audiences how fragile this all was how dangerous\nOr the lives that almost cost in some cases the lives that did cos\nI'm you know I think it helps us appreciate maybe just just a how hard earned that final moonwalk really was\nIntroducing here if you're just joining us my guess is Demian choose out and he directed the new movie first man that Neil Armstrong at an all a tip to be the first man to walk on the moon he also wrote and directed Lala land and whiplash we'll be right back this is ...\nNext month to do something we can get this way comes out so Dina every October the we could live free performs interactive gothic plays leading people through a cemetery andme mazel Liam will take you there that's due to we did a nine eighty nine point three Kate BCC\nIrritate PCC we want you to know how when and where to vote and all the issues in Canada and that's why we've got the K C C C voter game plan\nTo vote for that's up to you [noise]\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Damien ... who directed the new movie the first man that Neil Armstrong the space program in the sixties and Armstrong's walk on the moon he was the first man to walk on the moon and Damien says al also wrote and directed not our land and whiplash\nWhat could you have to experience yourself in order to convey the experience of being in a spacecraft that's out of control did you do any simulation exercises just you know you can viscerally experience it and therefore portraying well\nWe tried to shoot in in a way where we and the actors could be experiencing some version of it you know so instead of using green screen or kind of relying on digital effects to to sort of paint the picture we\nWe used full scale replicas of these capsules there were the you know sort of exactly the same size all the details were exactly the same our production designer an eighth and crowded an incredible job sort of rebuilding these things\nAnd we ... we would mount the you know we wouldn't fly them into space but we would mount them on the most control systems gambles that basically would move and rock back and forth quite violently if we needed them to\nUh and we would set those up against a giant Eli D screens so it's kind of like being in a simulator ride you sort of sit inside them and everything you can't see off the set you look out the window UC space imagery instead of you know film equipment or cruel or or or a green screen that will fill in later\nYou see the earth's spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had to kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule are simulating the sun so you get this kind of strobe you know meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors and for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know was kind of feeling if we can feel it onset if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to a to give that sense then\nThen the audience is gonna feel at the actors are going to be that much more in it you know the the sweat you see on screen will be revealed is shaking will be real even the some of the terrible the real the knowledgeable the rail and by extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nLet me get this straight so uh Ryan Gosling isn't this capsule that you are violently\nShaking so that it looks real answer that he's really experiencing all of the uh disorientation and just physical jostling um all of this\nYou know it was something in their character as sort of mid western I'm a kind of ... that they had that also you know it was very much a product of of of their time in their culture\nThat was just able to do the impossible without complaint and uh you know I really got a vivid sense of that when talking to Janet you know I I Would ask or things like you know ... well you know how did you how did you do this how did you you know how did you feel when ah you know you you're you're\nYou're moving from place to place you know since you say you're moving from a juniper hills in California where when they first moved there for Neal to be a you know test pilot be accepting and he's working in incredibly dangerous job they're living in a cabin with no running water no electricity\nOr and uh in the middle of nowhere a then they moved to Houston after a\nYou know after suffering a agree this loss as a family um and you know again Neal is work in a dangerous job and and away eighty percent of the time and who knows if you'll ever return I mean just you know how how did you cope and and she would uh several times just look at me and and almost with a shrug say well sink or swim\nThat really stuck with me just that it was as simple as that in a way um but of course that's complicated is that\nAnd uh you know so she vividly remember to so many of you know the kind of day by day activities and is this is a that we'd depicting the movie and a lot of it was even down to\nYou know lines of dialogue to quite emotional moment to the movie for example when when Janet a you know late in the film or a ... to her husband that you sit down and tell us kids before he goes off on this moon missions sits down and tells them that he may not return\nSo it made him do that in real life\nYeah yeah that that this is all you made a lot of this was is already recorded in Jim Hansen's book I'm a but a beginning to actually talk with her about it and you know talk through what that conversation actually wasn't than what the ensuing dinner table conversation actually was I mean\nA lot of that scene in the movies taken verbatim from ah from what she wrecked elected and from what her son's a wreck in March were incredibly helpful through the whole process of the movie recollect it\nYeah and in the senior attacking Batman apparently in real life to uh Neil Armstrong didn't really want to have that conversation with a sign saying like I might not make it back\nThat she demanded that he has to do and that she wasn't going to do it he has yucky and that and and he has been in this incredible like low key way without really that really showing emotion\nYeah I mean I I think uh for Neal in particular but it applies to both of them in order to\nYou know the only way you get through something like a mission like that or or or you know for example through some of the law says that they experienced as a family I'm the only way you can get through a release the only way they felt they could get through was was\nBy trying as hard as possible to hold those emotions in check but that is sometimes a difficult thing to do you know and I think I think Neal in the movie and I think you know a ... in real life it to a certain extent with someone who\nUh I think it was more afraid of engaging with those emotions and and uh actually sitting down and facing them\nUh uh you know and and and talking to people about them than he was a hurling themselves through the atmosphere and fly into the void of space you know he he was he was a man without any fear or they were a married couple without any fear\nExcept for this sort of deep ... fear that I think they constantly had to deal with day by day on the ground\n[noise] um congestion her which did the score for the film and you also work\nWith him on whiplash another land you met in college and I think the music is really good for the film and um\nI Know music is very important to you giving to the moon landing sequence um there's music that chance to me like part military part like western theme music and Star Trek refer to space has the final frontier [laughter]\nI don't intentionally to have a kind of western edge to catch the when I'm at sounds part military impact kinda galloping like horses in western [noise]\nUh well you know it was a I think the biggest thing for me was the rhythm of it was just the the that kind of relentless drive a that yeah you know good sound like horses galloping could sound like the machinery itself uh to me also just reflected Neal state of mind this was a\nYou know that that final stretch of the journey that final landing and and you kind of get a sense of it when you listen to the ... ah themselves it's is it an intercom when a comet\nYeah sorry yeah when you you know the actual audio or between the capsule and kept calm and mission control and what not um you know ... you can listen to all of that in real time or you can listen to all of it online and and uh\nUm it's just this uh you know there was sort of one thing after another that went wrong or almost went wrong\nUm and uh but I I get the sense that Neal was going to a was going to land that thing I wasn't going to be stopped and and uh you know a everyone had come too far at that point to turn around and and uh and you know so when you when you learn\nThings like the fact that they landed with you know only two percent of the you know gas remaining they landed within the thirty second window or by which point they would have had to do a mandatory aboard a you know or or\nOr or else basically die um you know those are things that I didn't really know about when I first thought about the moon landing um and uh you know so it felt like a music why should we could get into Neal is mine space if we can get into that sense of just a relentless on stopping drive um ah it would it would set the scene\nOkay let's hear some of that music and this is ... music from the score\nThat's landing music from just in her late to score\nFirst man and a movie about Neil Armstrong and his various space missions and then landing on the moon and becoming the first man to walk on the moon my ... now directed the movie he also directed not on land and went brash\nThey're saying that your film has become controversial for in some circles as that you didn't show Neal Armstrong planting the flat on among which is a you know famous moment that was related you know in real time on camera ...\nAn excerpt of the transcript from what I'm President Trump said to the conservative\nPublication the Daily Caller this is from September fourth\nThe interviewer asked for Trump's thoughts on the fact that the planning of the ... was not shown was asking you think that's upsetting and Trump says I think it's very unfortunate it's almost like they're proud of they tell us that they're embarrassed at the achievement coming from America I think it's a terrible thing\nBecause when you think of Neil Armstrong when you think about the landing on the moon you think about the American flag and I understand they don't do it for that reason I wouldn't even want to watch the movie\nMany do you think that people should go see the movie and Trump says that's up to them it really is and that's up to them I don't want to get into the world of boycotts and then he goes on ... and Nike\nThe controversy about the flag material in the movie you know I think it was a\nA pretty much exclusively among the people who hadn't seen the film and I have to say I understand very much the emotions that something like that or get aroused I think uh obviously the moon landing was an American achievement and an incredible one\nAnd the flag on the moon was a very important part of that which is why we we show it we show it several times though the flag standing there on the moon on the lunar surface in terms of actually uh you know mapping out each of the mission and mapping out you know ... and showing\nThe the physical sticking of the rod into the into the lunar soil and propping up at the flag a we made a choice entirely anesthetic Joyce not a political one too focused\nOn Neal's private moments on the moon ah during that time you know the the movies about the ten years leading up to the lunar landing um and so we only spent about eight minutes on the surface we really wanted to\nSpend that time to look at things that people didn't see things people didn't know about so what himself would be seeing as you first kind of emerged from the lunar module before the cameras even gone down and then after his famous line or his an sort of plan to walk off to the little west grader\nDuring which point he is spend time alone\nAway from any cameras a and so that's a part of the moon walk that no one really knows about I didn't know about before researching this\nUm those are the things I think there were really important to us in terms of uh in terms of process of what we show 'em but certainly showcase you not only the American flag on the lunar surface but just the ways in which this program was a product of America and paid for entirely by American taxpayers\nThat was something that was incredibly important for us to show that I think we we we do show and do justice to throughout the movie\nMy guest is Damien ... he directed the new movie first man and wrote and directed la la land and whiplash we'll talk more after a break this is fresh air\nDoes that change neck do you think sort of a any pressure expectations on the brewers versus Dodgers\nWell they've been through a a a a pretty tough week I mean they had that playoff game against the cubs are on on that regularly and and that was a I I was in Chicago watching the game\nI think I said last time on a on a at a in a cubs bar and [laughter] and uh you know that game was pressurize the entire time and then the brewers were really good they're pitching was really good\nUm so I don't I don't know how much pressure they really have him you may have experienced guys on this team especially once they got a Lorenzo Cain and was stock as in those two guys have been around and they'd been in World Series pressure and then you know like we said yellow is just plain good\nSo I don't I don't see that there's that much pressure I think the pressure is gonna come\nI'm ... I'm just kind of curious about that schedule where they have they have a five o'clock game our time and then at one o'clock game\nYou've got a chance to really smoked the brewers pitching staff in a ... in in twenty four hour time period um you know because they might in that second game do a ... game where they have a guy go handful of innings and another guy come in and and another guy come in\nI mean if the Dodgers when that first game in the bowl and then in the Bush decided to go to a bullpen game and the second one holy cow you could just you could just worked out a whole a whole a pitching staff in in twenty four hours time and and have a really nice lead come back to LA\nWhat do you think of that strategy of using both endgame young we thought that a lot during the regular season where there's really no starter starting the game and you know each ... going to do a couple innings um I Try to see it in the play or\nOpen days that it failed and this vale right now and I think it it it it works if your fish are good and if they're not than it does if he'd be a ... regular start or if he was any good right yeah ... well that and that's the thing is is that\nYou know one reason that you end up as a as a um a pitcher in the bullpen is because you don't have three pitches a or you can't set up guys you can't go you know eighty pitches or Ninety pitches or a hundred pitches you can go twenty full out and then you just there's nothing there after that\nSo um you know it works if you've got the guys and and financially I Would expect that at all live cheaper it's a lot cheaper\nToo so that explains the age of course later lowest they raised it to Tampa Bay rays that a lot to America and the walking it's got a low pay roll writer and let's say you got the Dodgers one of the highest Milwaukee one of the lower\nWell and that's why the the trade for y'all just so good because you know he's a relatively cheap he's like\nYou know uh this year I think it's something like six or seven million dollars and goes up to nine and it gets up to about Fifteen but they got 'em for four years if they want to still relatively young and it's cheap you know Fifteen now and they're talking about ms shot or maybe one thirty a crescendo right now gets thirty four so you know that's a lot of\nFans speaking of ... you think he's going to opt out with two years left on his contract as their big money years currently\nI ... yeah I'm going to give him Seventy five million dollars or you know I don't think so now I might have thought so at the start of the year but I don't think so now so he\nJust he wouldn't take that risk of for going the guaranteed thirty million\nLike if I was all he has to to make Seventy five million dollars over the next two seasons all he has to do is nothing\nYeah ... or say to the Dodgers uh can I have two more years on my contract and and tack on another I don't know however many millions of dollars he's gone a team that has a chance to go to the world series again which like you said it was a V. thing that he doesn't have an his resume ... World Series when\nThey'll the flip side to your scenario Nick about you know within twenty four hours the Dodgers burn out the brewers and then flip side is ... gets knocked out yeah or beauty or gets knocked it has like his second inning that he he gave up the grand slam in his last start\nAnd at that point your end of the Dodger bullpen and that's bad news you've got Pedro biased coming in the fourth inning or something\nWell they're talking about having Ross strip playing that he's fix this tipping is pitches business that has kept him out for a while uh so you know that wasn't the only problem yeah I Know what\nWas that was an ... want to I think it was his last start yeah and it was a lot more than just tipping\nPaid yeah exactly well and and and they do have they have a a decent number of guys but really for the Dodgers yeah those starters have to go some distance\nAlthough strictly has one of the best nicknames you know when the players have their nicknames on the back of this that yes you can strip or a guy named Ross strip there were some pretty buddy on the\nPlayers yeah this is the triple play a Martinez neck Roman with us talking about the Dodgers were their league championship series opener tomorrow with five o'clock\nBest of seven series with the Milwaukee Brewers Chris ... says the Dodgers are going to fold they don't have the gap when it comes to the pitching so he's he's a bullpen a skeptic\nA and scholars says on the air talked page yellow just kills Dodger pitcher and uh that's even before the recent hot streak I agree you need to pitch around him not let him be chew that sky or riding on the air talk pay\nBy the way that it is just I just wanted to make sure that I mentioned is if if if you're a baseball fan and you have the ... will be at a listen to Bob euchre on the\nBrewers radio broadcasts you gonna ... he's eighty four years old I don't know how much longer he's going to be a broadcaster funny oh my God it's is it just scream and and but he's also a a really good broadcast and we don't have too many of those kind of guys here in LA we've lost\nWe lost ... lost chick Hearn Bob Miller's has decided to retire off ... around all are now we we lost in ... there are just uh I I I you know he obviously huge baseball fan and I listen to just about everybody\nEuchre is the most entertaining guy right\nNow and thank goodness he hasn't retired yet today you know chick Hearn was still funny into his oh yeah yeah doing liquor Tallahassee\nAnd I ... at some point in the broadcast box you could start talking about using her sausages and pretzel bonds and then top it off with that seat or crest ice cream [laughter] it's hilarious I mean and I'm driving and I'm thinking I'm really hungry\nThat's great what landed on that what could be a better note\nThat day and our preview of the league championship series the Dodgers the brewers in of course on the American league side yet he has two powerhouse\nA chock full of talent teams the Houston Astros the defending champions who beat the Dodgers last year and the Boston Red Sox going to be quite a series on the American league side as well so pretty much guarantees\nA strong World Series or for a and for Nick I'm Lorraine naturally have a great afternoon fresh air with Terry Gross comes up next and we'll be back with you tomorrow\nYou have temp for

she was in college in the nineties women were told to protect themselves by carrying Mason learning self defense today many women on campus are saying no it's not\nIs you know it's boys who have to change the inches tuitions that has to change\nAlso can Tucker reviews in early recording by hazel Dickens and out is Gerard wrote a feminist perspective to blue grass and just in Chiang reviews first man\nVersus news Fifteen hours\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm neuron hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses are still without power after hurricane Michael in Georgia the governor is telling people to be patient from member station W. A. B. E. Susanna Capelouto reports\nRaising the demons casting off the shame you know it's a real like exercises on for them so to have it\nBe so publicly that cropped turned that has been extremely upsetting\n[noise] so um there's been times when the Judiciary Committee and then all of Congress have had to vote about whether\nThe woman who would use them in a federal harassment or assault was lying or telling the truth\nAnd if there's enough evidence to prevent\nThe Supreme Court nominee from becoming confirmed so there isn't the Anita Hill Clarence Thomas case and out of lousy for Brett Kavanaugh case and in both cases judiciary and Congress voted for the men and against the woman making the accusations\nLet's look at how colleges handled accusations you write about how colleges have developed their own system of helping to bring some kind of justice\nWhen accusations when women come forward to accuse\nI'm a fellow student of sexual assault or rape and they're not courts per se but they are some forms of proceedings can you give us a couple of examples of colleges that are doing this and how they do it like what their procedures are\nWell all colleges have to be doing it that's the rule you gotta have a title nine office and the title nine of us have to take any claims of sexual assault or misconduct or\n... or violent rape very seriously and they have them since two thousand nine eleven when Obama kind of lay down the law and said I Want all of you to um pursue this I Want girls to have an equal access to education and they can't if they're\nYou know dealing with trauma from a sexual assault and that's totally trailing great um since then as many people know universities have had a hard time putting these courts together Obama's guidance\nWas good but he almost didn't hold them enough about what they should do you know what do the records look like who should sit on the court he did say that he like everybody to use a\nStandard of the preponderance of evidence so it's more likely than not\nThat the act occurred um\nIt's so hard to prove so many of these cases that I think a lower standard is appropriate here also many attorneys do not agree with that um\nSo what what are these proceedings along [noise] do they bring people in who will support their point of view is there an investigation ... or\n... you know the number one thing to understand is that across the country all of these courts are different ... different according to whether the university wants to take this super seriously or not and if the university has the bonds to take it seriously\nI'm so real investigations are happening for short now universities don't have subpoena power so whichever students are going to talk to them\nThey'll send a letter to the accused and say you are being brought up on this they'll you know say okay well we're going to probably have our case and a couple of months so get everything ready and you know there is no\nReal system to help the accused him a lot of cases and the boys\nRarely author parents right there on their own they're at school they're afraid they ask somebody's you know older brother who sets them up with some attorney were may or may not have an idea of how to\nActually help this boy\nThen there'll be some sort of proceeding and you might have a fisheries professor who is the person who's going to judge or case where you might have actually a a former prosecutor it's completely random who is going to decide your fate\nPart of the reason why these college systems have developed to\nDeal with charges of sexual assault as because President Obama sent out basically a a letter of guidance right when when the law but it was a letter of guidance about how colleges should go about trying to handle accusations of sexual assault and this was built on\nTitle nine and so explain what title nine is which was passed\nAs a small part of a of a larger piece of legislation\nAnd signed by President Nixon in Nineteen Seventy two\nSuit title nine is just a short law that nobody in a university\nIt'd be discriminated against on the basis of gender and I knew it in the nineties as a law that would protect Women's Sports which of course it doesn't and this argument about whether title nine should cover sexual assault has been going on for many years\nPresident Trump secretary of education Betsy DeVos is changing the guidelines for sexual assault on campus and tell us about the changes that she's making or is on the verge of making\nThat diverse has been very concerned about the due process in a campus courts\nShe has also made it fairly clear that she is aligned with Trump in believing that this is a scarier time for boys so she is quite concerned about the accused students and things that\nYou know I mean you just had to her deputy set it to the New York times you know Ninety percent of the cases that they're seeing 'em involve just regret it sucks\nSo devise is concerned about due process rights she's concerned about false accusations um she's also concerned that Obama imposed these mandates by the at even though they were guidance he really did have the office for civil rights try to go to universities and\nSay open up your books I Want to see how you've been deciding the sexual assault cases and I'm here now and this is serious so she's really backed off of\nUm sending the OC are out but for the students really the most important\nThing is that she may change this\nDefinition of sexual assault which had previously been something kind of vague about unwelcome contract and you know various colleges had interpreted what sexual assault was on their own\nNow she's interested in saying okay well what would count it needs to be something that is severe and pervasive enough to deprive a student of education so what would happen if it was a one off sexual assault like lousy Fort described\nApplying for a close eye hand on a mouse um quote unquote and nothing happened even though she er she is thinking about it years later when he was afraid you'd be smothered to death she was afraid that she was going to be killed\nUnintentionally unintentionally mother to yeah\nAnd she was prevented from leaving 'em so is that the device trying to say title nine ... which mandates against gender discrimination on campus needs to be applied to discrimination against men because so many men are being wrongfully accused as that her case that is exactly what you're saying yeah\nShe's interested in this idea of gender discrimination claims both ways so um have her guidelines taken effect yet\nNo they haven't they were leaked to the New York times on there will be a notice from comment period a you know we have to see also if she's going to put these out these were draft that the times got their hands on\nMy guest is Vanessa ... is author of the new book blurred lines sex power and consent on campus we'll talk more after a break this is fresh air\nGuardsmen Roman hurricane Michael is winding down buddy still pounding rain onto the Carolinas will have a storm update for you that's on the next all things considered which afternoons would for

with therapies and beauty is in any celebration information and stand for the redwood dot org\nThis is fresh air let's get back to my interview with ... other of the new book blurred lines sex power and consent on campus\nSo let's talk about the definition of sexual assault and how that is maybe changing what what was the kind of common understanding of the definition of sexual assault in the three years you were talking to people on college campuses\nThere was a huge shift and the definition of sexual assault from like two thousand and fourteen to Seventeen while I was there and I watched as it happened um many students said to me that they weren't sure if groping\nCounted as sexual assault but maybe it has to be penetration 'em\nBy the end of the three years that idea was completely blown up the water 'em and I even had students say to me\nYou know sexual assault is maybe even the way you speak to people the way you a grass on people in speech and make them feel like justice or like dirty like a sexual object I mean they were thinking through this idea how far can we actually take this\nPart of her book is about the culture of fraternities and the frat parties that often lead to binge drinking\nOne of the fraternities you write about in your book is delta Kappa epsilon known as ... ... e which is at Yale George W. Bush was a ... I'm part of that fraternity and so was Brett Kavanaugh\nWhy did you decided to look at AT T and what did you learn about it in terms of the Senate sexual environment\nWell I think the deed at the time that Kavanaugh was there it was actually a pretty cool thing to be part of um it was a repository of future power and\nPeople like the ones you just described were in it but nobody who wasn't in deep cared about but over the years since the eighties um ... the ... very popular on American campuses you know millennials they like to join things\nOn your social network is so important right now in terms of moving forward getting a job being ... that to me being really help you um you know we've seen students really joined up with the Greek system so\nThe famous story with deep is the story and early two thousand tens\nWhere a group of pledges were marching across campus and went to the women's center where upon they chanted no means yes yes means in all um and some of the students who work at yell at the time\nReally thought that this was the straw that broke the camel's the hub for them in terms of the weight girls were being treated on the campus and\nThey ended up filing title nine complaint with office for civil rights about yell and particularly the\nUm and it was the first one that was filed during this kind of two thousand eleven Obama time when Obama said yes students tell us what's happening we want to hear from you what's going on on your campus says so it was a very important part of that history what are some of the\nColleges college administrators are trying to deal with fraternities and with the binge\nDrinking at fraternity parties there are some universities who had moved pledging either in January or they've moved it to sophomore year entirely because they realize that you know having kids start to pledge in September when the sexual assault risk is the highest is just\nMadness right now you have kids pledging fraud and who knows what kind of bears are going to be told to tape and they're going to be getting wasted every night as are hazed I mean this is just\nHideous um [noise]\nSo I think there are um some frogs that are are trying to bring in um courses about sexual assault trying to be more enlightened about it uh I returned and eventually [noise]\nSure there are some fraternities are doing that yeah definitely um I read extensively about widely in where I went to school which is not exactly known as the fried haven but there were a bunch of ... there and while I was reporting the book um they wetland decided to shut the all of those routes down [noise]\nSo you know I didn't notice until I read your book but I'm sororities are um by the Greeks code or whatever it is are already is aren't allowed to serve alcohol at their parties only fraternities\nCan do that and that's a kind of unequal status right there because it means that it's the men on campus you were going to control the party atmosphere since people expect alcohol at\nParties Oh absolutely I mean this is the key issues that universities have boys still really dominate\nThe social scene on college campuses not only are one in six American boys who go to a four year colleges are in profits at home\nWhich is the population that's up by half in the last decade guys get the kegs right guys by the drugs you can't even have parties at sororities in America that's the ... rules so the guy's got to have the\nParties at their houses and they set the rules and they set the costume theme and the theme is always something like Little Mermaid\nFor the girls to come really scantily close to I was just kind of shocked that the animal house east those would we used to think was just a small sliver of the American college experience and almost a joke\nHas really spread out across America where you can just do whatever you want to do and then when it's over it's all scrub and it's just that crazy thing you did in college ... no actually because there's a lot of girls coming out of here with a lot of traumatic experiences you know some\nWoman are saying now are we really need to do in order to like stop or at least diminishing the amount of sexual assault on campus is just stop rape culture what is meant by that so Reed\nCulture um is a term that really just tries to connect the dots between in American society that turns this blind eye to sexual assault and the true experience of girls which is that they are experiencing a lot of sexual assault so you know this rape culture is\nA culture where their rate myth that a woman's outfit or alcohol consumption has caused her weight\nAnd nobody questions these attitudes that box and the victim like nobody says it doesn't matter that you were dressed a certain way or doesn't matter how much you drank\nThey say well victims are kind of a week and they can lie and maybe they're just crazy or maybe they're gold diggers are all these reasons why\nA woman would make up the story maybe she's just\nTrying to lie so she didn't get in trouble with her boyfriend et cetera so what we really see about rung the younger generation is we use a whole to participate in that culture and also very differently than in the nineties when I was in college\nBack then of course you talked about sexual assault a lot in the early nineties during that PC era but what we were taught his carry me go to a self defense class right protect yourself\nBecause boys will be boys and the best you can do is make sure that your safe on your own announced these girls are saying no it's not our problem it's your problem right and there are signs will say things like\nDon't get raped and then they'll cross out\nSome of the word so let's do rape no it's boys who have to change its deep into ... that have to change this is about institutional accountability\nMuch about the message that young men and women are getting from pop feminism and I'll use Bianchi as an example here I mean she is a symbol of empowerment to so many women in so many men and women just\nI mean a door her understandably at the same time in so many of her concerts over the years she's she's dressed in very sexual lives clothing\nAnd a lot of the clothing it's and it's just to have a lot of women like pop stars and he'll pop stars [noise]\nUm it's it's very sexual lives in kind of designed to call attention to the most sexual areas of the body [noise]\nUm so you know you could see it one way like it's a sign of my sexual empowerment or you could see in another way I'm offering myself to you as an object as a sexual out as somebody\nI Want you to look at me sexually I Want you to see my power as being sexual power or at least partly ... actual power and I am inviting you to really focus your gaze on the most sexual parts of my body\nMhm and again you can see that as empowerment or you could see that as objective vacation and I'm just wondering\nIf you have any thoughts about that or if that's an issue that came up a lot when talking to young women on campus as well it's certainly\nNot an issue that came up when I spoke with the young women 'cause they completely believe it's empowering but it's an issue that came up a lot for me because I found myself really torn between those two ideas is this empowering or is this\nJenna grading um and you know being somebody who comes from second wave feminism item my knee jerk reaction is like you guys were calling the self objective vacation isn't that just a\nA ruse isn't that just somewhere justifying on this kind of\nWay that you're you're presenting yourself but after speaking to so many of these students I truly change my mind about that because I realized like this is how they grew up you know these kids that I interviewed in college just graduating now\nYou know Brittany spears was like it they were they were just tiny when Brittany spears without the culture has been so saturated with sex the entire time that they've been growing up they've been growing up around pornography\nAround fashion that is much much ... than anything that I grew up with so", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city":
