extremely upsetting\n[noise] so um there's been two times when the Judiciary Committee and then all of Congress have had to vote about whether the woman who accused the men of federal harassment or assault was lying or telling the truth\nAnd if there was enough evidence to prevent the Supreme Court nominee from becoming confirmed so there was the the Anita Hill Clarence Thomas case and other lousy for Brett Kavanaugh case and\nIn both cases judiciary and Congress voted for the men and against the woman making the accusations let's look at how colleges handled accusations you write about how colleges have developed their own system of helping to bring some kind of justice\nWhen accusations and women come forward to accuse\nI'm a fellow student of sexual assault or rape and they're not courts per se but they are some forms of proceedings can you give us a couple of examples of colleges that are doing this and how they do it like what their procedures are\nWell all colleges have to be doing it it's the rule [laughter] you've got to have a title nine office and the title nine office has to take any claims of sexual assault or misconduct or\nGroping or violent rape very seriously and they have them since two thousand nine eleven when Obama kind of lay down the law and said I Want all of you to um pursue this I Want girls to have an equal access to education and they can't if they're\nYou know dealing with trauma from a sexual assault and that's totally trailing great um since then as many people know universities have had a hard time putting these courts together Obama's guidance\nWas good but he almost didn't hold them enough about what they should do you know what do the records look like who should sit on the court he did say that he like everybody to use a\nStandard of the preponderance of the evidence so it's more likely than not\nThe act occurred um it's so hard to prove so many of these cases that I think a lower standard is appropriate here although many attorneys do not agree with that um\nSo what what are these proceedings along [noise] do they bring people in who will support their point of view\nIs there an investigation ... or\n... you know the number one thing to understand is that across the country all of these courts are different and they're different according to whether the university wants to take this super seriously or not and if the university has the bonds to take it seriously\nI'm so real investigations are happening for short now universities don't have subpoena power so whichever students are going to talk to them they'll send a letter\nTo the accused and say you are being brought up on this they'll you know say okay well we're going to probably have our case in a couple of months so get everything ready and you know there's no real system to help the accused in a lot of cases and the boys\nRarely call their parents right there on their own or at school they're afraid they ask somebody's you know older brother who sets them up with some attorney were may or may not have an idea of how to\nActually help this boy then there'll be some sort of proceeding and\nYou might have a fisheries professor who is the person who's going to judge or case where you might have actually a a former prosecutor it's completely random who is going to decide your fate\nPart of the reason why\nThese college systems have developed to\nDeal with charges of sexual assault as President Obama sent out basically a a letter of guidance right or was it wasn't a law but it was a letter of guidance about how colleges should go about trying to handle accusations of sexual assault and this was built on\nTitle nine and so explain what title nine is which was passed\nAs a small part of a of a larger piece of legislation\nAnd signed by President Nixon in Nineteen Seventy two suit title nine is just on a\nShort law that nobody in a university should be discriminated against on the basis of gender\nAnd I knew it in the nineties as a law that would protect Women's Sports which of course it doesn't and this argument about whether title nine should cover sexual assault has been going on for many years\nPresident Trump's secretary of education Betsy divorce is changing the guidelines for sexual assault on campus and tell us about the changes that she's making or is on the verge of making that diverse has been very\nConcerned about the due process in a campus courts\nShe has also made it fairly clear that she is aligned with Trump in believing that this is a scarier time for boys so she is quite concerned about the accused students and thinks that\nYou know I mean you just had to her deputy set it to the New York times you know Ninety percent of the cases that they're seeing 'em involve just regret it\nSucks so devise is concerned about due process rights she's concerned about false accusations um she's also concerned that Obama imposed these mandates by the at even though they were guidance he really did have the office for civil rights to try to go to universities and\nSay open up your books I Want to see how you've been deciding the sexual assault cases and I'm here now and this is serious so she's really backed off of\nUm sending the OC are out but for the students really the most important thing is that she may change this definition of sexual assault\nWhich had previously been something kind of vague about unwelcome contacting you know various colleges headed interpreted what sexual assault was on their own\nNow she's interested in saying okay what would count it needs to be something that is severe and pervasive enough to deprive a student of education so what would happen if it was a one off sexual assault like blog before it described\nApplying for a close eye hand on a mouse um quote unquote and nothing happened even though she er she is thinking about ... years later when he was afraid you'd be smothered to death [noise] she was afraid that she was going to be\nKilled unintentionally unintentionally mother to yeah\nAnd she was prevented from leaving 'em so as betcha device trying to say title nine ... which mandate against gender discrimination on campus needs to be applied to discrimination against men because so many men are being wrongfully accused as that her case that is exactly what you're saying yeah\nShe's interested in this idea of gender discrimination claims both ways\nSo um have her guidelines taken effect yet no they haven't they were leaked to the New York times on there will be a notice and comment period or you know we have to see also if she's going to put these out these were draft that the times got their hands on\n[noise] my guest is Vanessa ... is author of the new book blurred lines sex power

else see why more women in LA choose cedar Sinai for breast cancer treatment call one eight hundred cedars one\nThis is fresh air let's get back to my interview with ... author of the new book blurred lines sex power and consent on campus\nSo let's talk about the definition of sexual assault and how that is maybe changing what what was the kind of common understanding of the definition of sexual assault in the three years you were talking to people on college campuses\nThere was a huge shift and the definition of sexual assault from like two thousand and fourteen to Seventeen while I was there and I watched as it happened um\nMany students said to me that they weren't sure if groping counted as sexual assault but maybe it has to be penetration 'em\nBy the end of those three years that idea was completely blown up the water 'em and I even had students say to me\nWell I think the deed at the time that Kavanaugh was there it was actually a pretty cool thing to be part of um it was a repository of ...\nAnd people like the ones you just described were in it but nobody wasn't in deep cared about the ... over the years since the eighties\nUm fraught so become very popular on American campuses you know millennials they like to join things\nOn your social network is so important right now in terms of moving forward getting a job being ... that to me being really help you um you know we've seen students really joined up with the Greek system\nSo the famous story was deep is the story and early two thousand tens\nWhere it groups pledges were marching across campus and went to the women's center where upon they chanted no means yes yes means anal on and some of the students who work at yell at the time\nReally thought that this was the straw that broke the camel's back up for them in terms of the weight girls were being treated on the campus and\nThey ended up filing title nine complaint with office of for civil rights about yell and particularly the\nUm and it was the first one that was filed during this kind of two thousand eleven Obama time when Obama said yes students tell us what's happening we want to hear from you what's going on on your campuses so it was a very important part of that history what are some of the ways\nColleges college administrators are trying to deal with fraternities and with the binge\nDrinking a fraternity parties there are some universities who had moved pledging either in January or they've moved it to sophomore year entirely because they realize that you know having kids start to pledge in September when the sexual assault risk is the highest is just\nMadness right now you have kids pledging fraud and who knows what kind of bears are going to be told to tape and they're going to be getting wasted every night as are hazed I mean this is just\nHideous um [noise]\nSo I think there are um some frogs that are are trying to bring in um courses about sexual assault trying to be more enlightened about it uh I return it extensively\nSure there are some fraternities are doing that yeah definitely um I Would extensively about widely in where I went to school which is you know not exactly known as the fried haven but there were a bunch of friends there and while I was reporting the book um they wetland decided to shut the all of those routes down [noise]\nSo you know I didn't notice until I read your book but I'm sororities are um by the Greeks code or or whatever it is sororities aren't allowed to serve alcohol at their parties only fraternities can do that\nAnd that's a kind of unequal status right there because it means that it's the men on campus you were going to control the party atmosphere since people expect alcohol at\nParties Oh absolutely I mean this is the key issue that universities\nHave boys still really dominate the social scene on college campuses not only are one in six American boys who go to a four year colleges are in profits at home\nWhich is the population that's up by half in the last decade guys get the kegs right guys by the drugs\nYou can't even have parties at sororities in America that's the pan ... rules so the guy has got to have the parties at their houses and they set the rules and they said the costume theme and the theme is always something like Little Mermaid\nFor the girls to come really scantily closed so I Would just kind of shocked that the animal house eat those which we used to think was just a small sliver of the American college experience and almost a joke\nHas really spread out across America where you can just do whatever you want to do and then when it's over it's all ... and it's just that crazy thing you did in college ... no actually because there's a lot of girls coming out of here with a lot of traumatic experiences you know some woman are saying\nNow ... what we really need to do in order to like stop or at least diminishing the amount of sexual assault on campus is just stop rape culture what is meant by that ...\nCulture um is a term that really just tries to connect the dots between in American society that turns this blind eye to sexual assault and the true experience of girls which is that they are experiencing a lot of sexual assault so you know this rape culture is\nA culture where the raid mess that it wasn't outfit or alcohol consumption has caused her rape\nAnd nobody questions these attitudes that box and the victim like nobody says it doesn't matter that you were dressed a certain way or it doesn't matter how much\nYou drank they say well victims\nAre kind of a week and they can lie and maybe they're just crazy or maybe they're gold diggers there's all these reasons why\nA woman would make up the story maybe she's just trying to lie so she didn't get in trouble with her boyfriend cetera\nSo what we really see about rung the younger generation is his refusal to participate in that culture and also very differently than in the nineties when I was in college\nBack then of course we talked about sexual assault a lot in the early nineties during you know that PC era but what we were taught his carry me go to a self defense class right protect yourself\nBecause boys will be boys and the best you can do is make sure that your say on your own now these girls are saying no it's not our problem it's your problem right and there are signs will say things like\nDon't get raped and then they'll cross out\nSome of the word so that's don't rape no it's boys who have to change its the inches tuitions that have to change this is about institutional accountability\nThat isn't about the message that young men and women are getting from pop feminism and all your fiance as an example here I mean she is a symbol of empowerment to so many women in so many men and women just\nI mean a door her understandably at the same time in so many of her concerts over the years she's she's dressed in very sexual allies clothing\nAnd a lot of the clothing it's and there's a ... a lot of women like pop stars and he'll pop stars [noise]\nUm it's it's very sexual lives in kind of designed to call attention to the most sexual areas of the body [noise]\nUm so you know you could see it one way like it's a sign of my sexual empowerment or you could see it another way I'm offering myself to you as an object\nAs a sexual out as somebody I Want you to look at me sexually I Want you to see my power as being sexual power or at least partly ... sexual power and I am inviting you to really focus your gaze on a more sexual parts of my body\nMhm and and again you can see that as empowerment or you could see that as objective vacation and I'm just wondering\nIf you have any thoughts about that or if that's an issue that came up a lot when talking to young women on campuses\nWell it's certainly not an issue that came up when I spoke with the young women 'cause they completely believe it's empowering but it's an issue that came up a lot for me because I found myself really torn between those two ideas is is empowering or is this\nDenigrating 'em and you know being somebody who comes from second wave feminism I Am my knee jerk reaction is like you guys were calling the south objective vacation\nIsn't that just a a ruse isn't that just somewhere justifying on this kind of\nThat you're you're presenting yourself but after speaking to so many of these students I truly change my mind about that because I realized like this is how they grew up\nThese kids that I interviewed in college just graduating now\nYou know Brittany spears and like they were they were just tiny when Brittany spears without the culture has been so saturated with sex the entire time that they've been growing up they've been growing up around pornography around fashion and that is much much ... than anything that I grew up with\nSo they don't have the same\nIdea about oh if I trust this way makes me look like a slut because this is the way people dress now there is such a casual way and you're right in a lot of countries of the beyond say or\nKaty Perry Rionda you know it's it's crossing a line wave from scanty to something makes really sexual but this is what they believe is empowering to them now we have all sorts of data also saying that they have\nHuge amount of nervousness about it and they feel and anxious and depressed disguised them like their social media posts et cetera so there's there's a flipside to that that they were adamant with me that this was\nA the right stuff in terms of uh of of the Apollo love the right on the show so meticulous of course as you know not not just a movie it's a big old it's a big old theory or in of course the acting\nA these are just extraordinary to add hair so Sam Washington everybody's in that movie but I suppose if we if we can all the way back to the fifties writes I I think that's when I mean there's Nineteen twenty nine to there was a woman on the moon but\nIn the fifties when I think they tried we try to start thinking about space travel is ... realistic way so you have a movie like a rocket ship ...\nUh which is about a a a mission to the moon which goes or a ride and they end up on Mars which is a little crazy [laughter]\nAn accurate [laughter] attention was ... and they they experience things like I'm from asteroids storms and things like that they were thinking about stuff like that conquest of the moon\nCompulsive ... about Nineteen fifty five or something like that they they they have air locks in that movie they're really thinking about the way that would actually have to work their names are being aliens or you know but other than that were there\n... if you'd been when we get to the sixties when just the space travel itself becomes relevant as you said two thousand one in films like that\nI'm In in the seventies all become space opera of course you know the star wars and and all of the ... knock off the star wars and then and then I suppose in the eighties and nineties we get back to cause like serious space travel again red planet\nA mission to Mars with the promise them things like that there's still usually some sort of aspect of a horror film or something going on with the technology they're working really hard on getting the technology right by the time you\nGet there there's one when I was a kid I remember that that I like more ruined was the movie about a astronauts who who get a you know trap no way no way to return Nineteen sixty nine so I Would have been ten years old for for me and it was released just after the Apollo eleven\nMoon landing won the Oscar for best visual effects and NASA\nProvided um authentic replicas of equipment and an early sky lab mock up for that film ruined from Nineteen sixty nine a band in Culver City says and has\nNot necessarily realistic but his favorite space film a star trek to the wrath of Khan which has not great performance by Ricardo months all bond\nUm I think probably his best performance in a whole career of terrific performances but\nThat's that's such a great well let's talk with Theresa who joins us from van eyes to reach the your favorite a space film\nLarry Bird didn't plan it\nAltered pigeon yeah Forbidden Planet Nineteen fifty six Fred Wilcox directed that movie the technology the state for one thing that was a studio film that was not a B movie\nOr a ... and all it was very lush looking yeah of course it's just the temperature is The Tempest reconstructive uh and uh it's it's just lovely really love the planet yeah so Theresa that that's still a you're faced his favorite space film\nAll right we're Forbidden Planet All right thanks so much a bill in the San Gabriel valley says Apollo Thirteen is one of my two favorite movies it satisfies the space program side of me uh and I'm Wondering if first man might replace that I also love\nTwo thousand one I I consider a bill says Star Wars Star Trek more as popular psi phi swipe put them in a little bit of a a different category I as opposed to movies like the Martian that are uh are are would have more realism minute NATO what'd you think of the Martian\nI thought it was a wonderful movie the book I highly recommend reading it having 'cause he goes into excruciating details you can actually make sure that it makes sense so I thought uh the movie was quite accurate\nI think the technology challenges and the technology solutions that\nUh the lead character came up with were correct I think the premise was a bit flood which was the absolute last of the communication signal because you always invariably have multiple antennas so that was my one issue and of course we do have an orbiting a with several satellites in orbit Mars specifically the Mars Reconnaissance orbiter so I'm pretty sure\nI'm a they would've been able to see that he was on the surface before that other than that\nAt my Internet it was a wonderful an accurate engineering\nSo interstellar as I recall there was some controversy about the science is depicted in that film was very very popular movie what what'd you think of it well\nI absolutely love interstellar and I'll tell you one of my guilty\nPleasure of international plane travel as I always watch interest still hard every flight that I I Do absolutely love it so ... was a part of that movie in terms of providing um you know technically and put so I think a lot of it's just really thinking outside of the box and I think part of what makes science fiction so wonderful\nThough is that you can't always think about things in the context of how we do understand physics how we do understand particle physics or quantum mechanics so I think\nThat movie tried to make us think outside the box and perhaps when a bit too far but\nAt the same time it was very entertaining it was very beautifully done\nYeah ah Pepe writes red planet with Val Kilmer in Kerry and more\nYeah that sounds like something you would have seemed to regulate written is on my list and again\nI'm a working real hard on the science and the technology that movie and then they have to turn that robot into a monster because you know you gotta have something else going on in the movie but they're working real hard on that's speculative science the space suits and things like that which I saw the new ...\nFor ... and they look a lot like this ... suits and Richland sort of we were one of those uh you know on earth and Mars would be like\nThat movie I haven't seen from Nineteen sixty eight that apparently Robert Altman was directing called count down if you heard of this film who can't sell yeah I was seeing this this variety article that goes back a few years ago but\nUm apparently has a Cold War thriller about two American astronauts\nTrying to beat the Soviets to the moon but Altman was fired by Warner Brothers according to variety because he wouldn't re shoot you had the overlapping dialogue thing and they didn't want that and he refused to ... when he was fired by the film but apparently um\nNASA granted a Altman a tremendous access\nFor doing that film so that's fifty years ago this year\nThat film [noise] All right ah any any other she wanted to add to your list\nOh I'm I'm just interested nobody's called in to say anything about the release got for me the U.S.'s which I'm fine with I'm fine [noise]\nUm yeah I mean it is an interesting point like why do we always need to throw a monster into a space movie why can't space just be awesome enough and and to me that that is frustrating I think space on its own should be grade I was released got made alien movies where there wasn't always um poisonous plant that they would take people over I think just being stranded enough\nRight every Anita you should make your own film now so you're such a

showed\nThe one shot and affects normally you would never reproduce that would never become a still is is the sexy girl walking away from you out of focus a shot that no one would ever produced all the still in the show are ones that would never be produced I did a whole theory called marks\nWhere I just took photographs off the floor when I was making the movie Packer\nOf the tape marks the crew puts down at the actors have to have to stay in focus and that's the only thing in the shop everything that would be in the movie is called the actors the costumes props and all that's left is the one thing you can't show in a movie still\nSince a few of the shots in your book allude to you know erotic movies or or porn movies I'm Wondering how you discover pornography as a kid [noise] gee how did I\nDiscover point as a kid Peyton place was the first dirty book I ever read and I had heard about it certainly men bingo was another one and that's like kind of a great movie\nUm and playboy playboy was the first thing that you could ever really see now gay porn was a very very different thing there was a store called Sherman's downtown that had those magazines like them and vigor and they were supposedly muscle man magazines but it was it was kind of a coded thing was the first gay magazines I ever saw\nDid your father have a pornographic books or or ... magazines you in that you could sneak peek that\nNo he didn't but he did have Peyton place and uh I did read his copy of Peyton place\nEveryone had Peyton place my grandfather had pain ties Peyton place was\nThe biggest number one bestseller for weeks and weeks and weeks\nAnd it led to Jackie's then lead to Jackie Collins that led to that entire genre of work but um but she did it first and she did it best and she had such great titles another one of her books with the tight white collar about a ... that's such a good size [laughter]\nBut but she didn't handle success or well I mean she divorced her husband she moved to a plaza hotel and she drank too much and died basic rights so that's not the best a success story but the book was so famous that when I went back\nTo New Hampshire where where she wrote the book they still talk about her [laughter] and the town in the library I only had one tattered copy\nBut I did go to her grave and grace has been a great heroine of mind\nWhen you started finding pornography and straight pornography what was the like\nWhat was it like reading or seeing photos that were fantasizing women's bodies when women's bodies weren't when it was about friends\nWell when I looked at those pictures I always looked at it in a way to see how far could go the same way I went to\nUm heterosexual sex location movies all the time that had no male nudity to see how far could go I was interested in how the taboos would fall how it started with a new discount movies where the first things I saw and and you would see\nBare breast some women and sometimes asses but once in a while a male asked but they had to be playing volleyball so you know that was not so erotic to me but I've never had a night where I met horny let's put it that way [laughter]\nHow do you get to see the new this can't movies and these were these digital movies at 'em ups extensively was supposed to be documentaries about healthy alternative lifestyles in general and they didn't really about the nudity where do they play where did you get to see them\nI can tell you right where one of my favorite theaters the wrecks movie theater in Baltimore which is now at church at when I was young it started out by saw the wizard of Oz there but it later became a new the movie theater I not only saw noodles canned movies I saw the early Russ Meyer movies I saw a\n... and it was one man alone to who fought the censorship or we had the mail in censorship board and um censorship has always been something I fought\nSo um I've always dealt with censorship so direct theater was where I got a lot of my film education in Baltimore\nJohn Waters speaking to Terry Gross in two thousand four more after a break this fresh air\nMy Roman interest rates around dogs are down the president says the Federal Reserve is out of control on the next all things considered we'll talk with a former fed official we dated for ... nine points for Eighteen\nOkay BCC supporters include Netflix resenting the Netflix Original film twenty two July from the director of Captain Phillips end the Bourne ultimatum comes the true story of a day that changed a nation now on Netflix and in select theaters [noise]\nThis is fresh air let's get back in ... two thousand four interview with filmmaker John Waters the Baltimore museum of art in his hometown has just launched a three month retrospective exhibition of his visual art it's called John Waters indecent exposure and runs through January six\n[noise] did you feel guilty for for your ... your case about violating all the standards of decency\nNo I never felt guilty um I I always knew I told the story before but I was young I heard my parents talking about me you know you listen to the top of the steps and my mom said oh he's just an odd duck\nAnd I thought well that's it you know so I I didn't really ever care\nThat the other kids weren't interested in what I resent because as well I have a very rich fantasy life\nAnd my parents I'm allowed that I had a little stage even as a kid uh I I my parents bought me a reel to reel tape recorder so I could tape songs I was the first download her ever because I was a real real tape recorder tape songs off the radio but then so I could sing them on lip sync them basically\nSo I always I was a puppeteer as a kid I I had a I had a job I had a career when I was twelve years old so puppeteer\nSo I always had an outlet for this that that was encouraged even though the work I was doing not exactly the work that they wished I was doing but but I I guess they figured it was this or nothing maybe or prison [laughter]\nBut they were very supportive which was very I'm very very encouraging and I I always say that if if you've got a kid that doesn't fit in is rebelling in any way encouraging if your if your daughter comes home and she just had her entire face tattooed what you can you do maybe she'll open a tattoo parlor that will do well that's all you can you got to deal with what you got\nSince you didn't feel guilty about watching things in being obsessively interesting interested in things that weren't supposed to be healthy did you go the other direction if he could well I might as well planned up to the hilt and envy you know take on the pose of of the pervert [noise]\nOh I never thought of it that way I\nI I took one I had to create a persona for myself in the beginning when we made these movies because I didn't have any advertising and no one knew who was what we had to think of a way to to publicize the movies and divine and I did that sort of as as a [laughter]\nI was the director and he was the same movie star and certainly I dressed weirdly but um it was always confusing I never um my audience in the beginning\nWas never gay or straight it was gay people didn't like other gay people let's say three it was hippies that didn't like hippies it was it was always the outsider of another outsider group that that's that's what my audience began with and certainly I'm\nIn his book role models John Waters named some of the people who would inspired him and explained why\nSome like Tennessee Williams weren't that's surprising but others were like one of the female former followers of Charles Manson or like popular fifty singing star Johnny Mathis [noise]\nOh little\nSilly little moment you know if you\nShow says on things that a\n\nSmall General Motors welcome back to fresh air is really great to be there for me\nSo I'm going to start by asking you to read from the first chapter role models in this chapter is about Johnny Mathis who was shockingly [laughter] one of your role model so why don't you read an excerpt at our church\nI Wish I were Johnny Mathis from mainstream so popular so ironic your perfect effortlessly boy I should over Seventy years old with a voice that still makes all of America or want to make out heavenly warm yes I'll say it out loud wonderful wonderful\nIs it because Johnny Memphis is the polar opposite of me a man whose greatest hits album was on the billboard charts for four hundred and Ninety ... consecutive weeks versus me a cult filmmaker whose core audience no matter how much I crossed over consists of minorities who can't even fit in with their own minorities\nDo we secretly idolize or imagine opposites\nShunned orders reading from his new book role models I was shocked to see that Johnny Mathis [laughter] it was like the lead chapter he probably lost [laughter] well I mean he's as a singer he's such a like a romantic and you're so not in your art I Can't speak about your private life so what is the attraction\nWill because Johnny Mathis is the opposite of me because Johnny Mathis to me is the kind of mainstream that\nI Will never ever be able to have and everybody wants to have hit flights are\nBut at the same time zone in Memphis said to me I always wanted to be a jazz singer so in a way you're opposite sometimes isn't exactly what you believe to be too\nI didn't know Johnny Mathis and to get to meet him was not easy because I'm sure that Google me and\nI'd be nervous too [laughter] so um he was lovely thought when I went to his house and everything\nSo I always assumed that the reason why Johnny Mathis didn't do a lot of interviews with because he was in the closet and didn't want to have to well I wrote\nThat saying that I was not coming to him with any agenda sects of moral racial anything and I didn't and I didn't\nAnd I I never asking those questions I don't really think obviously if you wanted to talk about any of his personal life he did he he just said some of my fans think their mothers' Johnny Mathis you know and I know what he meant what does he have to share his public life with I'm not always for that\nYou know I get weary of reading these people that tell every personal thing to reporters they just met that day and that's what I really don't have friends that's what friends are for not reporters\nSo you mentioned Tennessee Williams he's a chapter in your book role models and I'm going to ask you to read an excerpt of your chapter in Tennessee Williams\nThis one is called a okay the kindness of strangers\nLet me just say this is John Waters gassed his new book is called role models in each chapter is about somebody else who in one way or another was a role model or an inspiration for him so this is Tennessee Williams\nYears later Tennessee Williams saved my life the first time I went to a gay bar I was Seventeen years old it was called the hot and it was in Washington DC some referred to it if the chicken and it was filled with early Nineteen sixties gay men and fluffy sweaters who cruise one another by calling table to table on phones provided by the bar\nI may be clear but I invest I remember thinking still reading everything Tennessee Williams wrote I knew he would understand my dilemma\nTennessee never seemed to fit the gay stereotype even them and sexual ambiguity in turmoil were always made appealing and exciting and therefore my type doesn't know who I Am he stated according to legend and even if the sex lives with his character weren't always healthy they certainly seemed hearty\nTennessee Williams was in a gay cliche so I had the confidence to try to not be one myself gay was not enough it was a good start however [laughter]\nSo he gave you confidence to be gay but not set a stereotype of what was going to have\nMe the confidence to be a beatnik really to get beat neck or to not even be to be a beatnik was gay that's very different you know you went into a field of all different kinds of rebels\nAnd their sexuality was always still my friends are it doesn't matter if they're gay or straight if I'm friendly with somebody that has literally no interest to me whether I like the person or not\nI'm and I'm always amazed by people that say um oh you should go this age and he has all gay people or whatever like ... all black people that are being good or bad enough work out\nSo um I always liked the gay people that had trouble even sitting in the gay stereotype because I don't like rules of any kind and I see people that break them with happiness and I'm not bringing pain to themselves\nSo how have you changed\nIn terms of what you want to do with with your same unless people's interest in your life because in some ways you've turned yourself into your art in it 'cause you've you'd do shows yeah when that shows you've written were personally uh you know all over the years and the people are dying here that you\nWell I don't know I'm I use my own personality to find out about others my personality is why probably I mean for something in the house or why the outsider pornographers I left in the house let me in and trusted me\nAnd I think I've only written about people that that I look up to the ... even if they've had terrible things happen to live because they've had a more extreme life than I've ever had an and I respect people I I as a writer every day I think\nWhat would you like to be that person and if you're a journalist or a writer you get to be that person wouldn't everybody liked a barge in people's house and they have a personal questions I don't get why everybody doesn't want to do that but when you're running a book you're allowed to do that that's acceptable\nAnd that's why people tell me everything on airplanes strangers confided to me the most deepest darkest secrets\nAnd I think 'cause they think oh understand and I generally do understand I've taught in prison I've counseled people I I I actually would be a good defense lawyer I Would be a good count for I Would be a good shrink actually\nAnd I believe in all those things I've been arrested I've been to the psychiatrist so I think you have to participate in whatever business it in your you were trying to be involved and\nSo getting back to Tennessee Williams you've read all of his books and you've read the wall of lots of people [laughter] you collect books you have over a thousand four hundred well looks all cataloged\nI'd like to read books I don't collect books sometimes struggles service for like looks right read them yeah I like to read um people always say to me how can you read so much and it's easy you don't have a boyfriend or girlfriend and you don't watch television simply read all the time\nAnd I'm On airplanes all the time so um it it's I Love to read as how I relax I don't find that are composed and cataloging them as being just being nice to my airs\n[laughter] and you have ... of course as much of a control freak as I Am you don't think I have my ... and I even know where I'm going to be buried we all blocked lots a lot of my friends for the people's temple graveyard\nWell I Know and you said at a ... is it the same salmon herring that divides in um so why why if you don't my asking why do you want to be buried\nBecause I Love the idea of graveyards I like people visiting I used to going through graveyards when I was young and vine would still flowers for parties we'd have a couple of beers I like the atmosphere I liked the worms go in the worms go out I'm both maybe I Believe in the resurrection the only thing I've ever talked to ... sounds like a good idea\nBut then I panic about real estate prices and what we're supposed to wear and are we knew so I go into that in the ... my paranoia about the recession\nYou're the only person I've ever asked her to who wants to be very 'cause like you really liked graveyards [laughter]\nOh yeah I Do like a lot of people like grave us are peaceful quiet and then we're all going to be birds all her friends kind of one stop shopping\nYou know if you want to come you can say Hi Maine cod to everybody around and um I I liked the idea of it it's um and my mother at first I thought it would be stretched into my own family 'cause I think it's a great idea because up your sister's going to be buried were husband you\nKnow so so um I I liked the idea of field there that you're not getting married next no I was afraid\nTo tell them they they thought it was a fine idea they're totally understood I went to the graveyard where he is buried\nWhen when quote lining my father founded and making motive\nMeat prices that I didn't know I never bought a great but it sounds like a rip off to me and they showed me like tunes like they thought Rudolph Valentino is coming out\nThere they were going to say [laughter] and um and I thought\nWait a minute so I went and asked the woman were divided up because I like to ... and she told me a price I said I'll take a double [laughter] I got like a lot of room around me too because the prices quite fair\nBathrooms [laughter] you're better [laughter] to have you thought it through like what kind of like too soon you\nKnow if I I kind of want it to be modeled after ... and I want mine to just say my father's it's the same and I didn't realize until I saw recently his grave are 'cause he only died a
