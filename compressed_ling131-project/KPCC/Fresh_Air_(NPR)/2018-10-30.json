one thing that\nWe've seen over the generations is a far lower rate of adultery an extra marital sex or the baby boomers\nYou know ... or or the ... generation to God cheat the most and we're doing it less as a big generation gap there\nOr the other broad trend that we always have to think about ... urge is that marriage has become a has become almost the status good\nOr for the wealthy now the people who are married are much more likely to have college degrees ah people who don't have a college degree is less likely to be married so it certainly change marriage has changed a lot so\nBy the by definition then um these are people with more economically stable lives there perhaps more rooted because they're you know they are able to [noise] they're able to have more stable lives generally then their marriages would reflect that\nAbsolutely\nI'm forty years ago there was no gap in marriage by education now there's a huge gap\nUm so the just the whole\nLife courses changed it used to be

... you know had to get married and they just started happening and you know I didn't married now twenty six years and you know it like that so maybe an exception\n[noise] yeah well and again these are averages so they're going to be a lot of people who have a lot of sex before they get married and great a marital relationships afterwards and and I'm sure there are the opposite people who come

observation\nYeah this is relating to some staying at a professor said a bit of it filled out an age I think that sort of the ideal is to find a happy medium you know not too\nMany partners but also not to do business in my experience most of my friends that had you know very happy marriages they didn't necessarily start off with the first person however they also didn't you know sleep around a lot before they got married\nYeah so there was selectivity anyway\nUh so ... you're talking about the Goldilocks approach of\nHaving just the right number of sexual partners and but you know my thought would be too is is a under what conditions were do sexual relationships where they positive you know we're not on sexual experiences are necessarily positive and\nAnd if they were parts of relationships wherever those early your relationship and there's a lot of complexity that's associated with this too but\nA professor ... are your thoughts about read that sort of you know maybe

expletives in it and like some of it on the page would it do you know what I mean I like I wasn't sure if you were writing that out word for word if you were saying just like go with it and then filming and editing\nI take that as a massive compliment because\nThat style of writing is so deliberate and I wanted the kids to improvise but they were obsessed\nWith becoming great actors and becoming these characters and learning this screenplay and for me it took three years in twenty draft you deliberately right every I'm In like an expletive\nWithin reason behind it well really and uh-huh and that's very intentional and that's you know capturing very realistic dialogue\nThat seems improvise is a complement to these young performers acting and you know really deliberate thought in how these people speak to one another [noise]\nDid you learn to speak that way\n[noise] yes I think I was taught and maybe culturally we were taught at that time if you're a man and you express\nYour feelings are you express that something hurts you then you should be made fun of and that kind of repression leads to anger and anger leads to bad behavior and I think I wanted to show a film about young men with an inability to express themselves\nBut the thing is like you or as a child and then as a young teen you were writing like skips for The Simpsons I'm not on a professional ... you were just like\nWriting that's for The Simpsons so you only had both ambition and also a a facility for words you lived in a world of words you wanted to communicate on the page and I'm thinking one must have been like for you to have this urge to write to communicate to make written jokes\nReferring to pop culture with characters in it I mean that's what The Simpsons is all about and at the same time feel like but you're not supposed to express yourself\nBecause you're a boy yeah and I'm not I'm not victimizing myself I think as a straight white male I have more privileged and I can't even comprehend of course yeah bone in my last\nYear you were kind of suppressing something that came really natural to you that you really\nRight right and I also I have always been expected to be a certain type of thing and I played right into that out of my own and security as a person and I as a kid was very funny identifies a writer first and foremost in my life\nUh after just brother person uncle stuff like that first occupation I Would lift it would be a writer\nAnd then going into a culture where that kind of verbal communication or emotional communication is mocked\nAnd then on top of that you know even when I became a well known public figure I think the reality of comedy and being overweight and all this stuff\nAllowed for jokes and punches to be made about me and towards me which turned me angry here which made me communicate worse and then when you're funny\nYou become a bit mean all speak for myself you think of the thing to hurt the other person 'cause you assume they're about to hurt you\nIt all plays into each other and it's very weird cyclical thing and then I became famous as an overweight comedian and then I felt like I wasn't given the respect as a human being\nA lot of humor as like self deprecating humor and\nSelf deprecating humor doesn't go over and that kind of like teen masculine and I'm like athletic culture I say this as an outsider to\nAll of that [laughter] but then anyway did you have an impulse toward self deprecating humor\nBut no I knew that that wouldn't be appropriate to the scene that you were in I think\nMy point is I'm trying to even in my twenties even going through a career publicly going through my twenties publicly\nEither being mean and defensive or self deprecating to a point where you are beating yourself up to feel like you deserve a see the table are both unhealthy for me because\nObviously being mean makes you feel bad when you go home if you have a heart which I Do and then and being defensive or beating yourself up gives you a real problem with your self esteem and\nThe way I related that in mid nineties or tried to express that within the character of Stevie is this person's currency in his life is his ability to take abuse and to take pay\nAnd I don't want to give away the end of the film but the film along with my own journey has been a tremendous amount about self acceptance\nDo his issues are are different than yours and his way of resolving and it's different than yours but that's the the core emotional issue that you're getting\nYeah is that we all beat ourselves up I explore male self abuse in the film is something that I found after doing a lot of research very troubling and fascinating um literal sibling abuse troubling and fascinating\nAnd watch skateboarding is a natural draw to someone who takes hits whether inflicted from someone else or themself\nWhy do you think it's a natural draw for somebody in that position\nBecause to be graded skateboarding you have to be willing to slam on your face down ten stairs on concrete over and over and over and over and over again and there's something punishing about that in self punishing about that and there's a great\nReward that is true we earned even if it's just for you where\nAre you willing to do that when you wanted to skate\nVery briefly in a time where I think I invited pain but I quickly grew out of inviting physical pain in my life and more emotional\n[laughter] good for you [laughter] yeah I'm I'm at my scars\nOn these guys are inside [laughter] ... yeah it's just a general recklessness which are related you are related to this kid's loneliness and so even though this isn't my story\nI wanted to show someone going through deep pain and a real sense of hope through community even if that Comey is has deep flaws to it like small mindedness prejudice massage any\nThat for this kid it's still provided something hopeful and perhaps these young men will grow up in and learn some of this stuff\nWould you have a dream of getting on a skateboard now [noise]\nAh yeah I Dream about it every night I honestly Terry when I tell you I Would trade a lot in my life to be able to do certain tricks\nRight okay ... or dream would you unreality [laughter] ever considered buying an escape or now\nI landed a kick foot in front of our cast and crew in order just add of being so exciting exhilarated by everyone skating but be to just prove that this is something that at one point was a massive part of my life\nThis is fresh air I'm Terry Gross let's get back to my interview with Jonah Hill he became famous for playing a high school student in the comedy Superbad he was in several other films produced and directed by Jeff ... Patel he received Oscar nominations for best supporting actor for his dramatic rules in money ball and the wolf of Wall Street he\nStarts with Emma Stone and the new Netflix series maniac\nAnd he's just made is directing debut with the new film mid nineties which he also wrote it's about a subculture skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties the period when Jonah Hill was skateboarding\nSo um we were talking about loving movies wanting to write and to direct how did you start acting and how old were you when you started to realize not only wanted to do it but that you were good at\nWashing their two very different answers to that question my goal my whole life was to be a writer and director to say this is a dream\nWhat's happening now is like an understatement um\nAnd when I went to new school in New York I Would write these one act play and we would often put them up bars and um\nWhen I Would have actors read\nI had really bad bedside manner because I didn't understand why they wouldn't do it in the way that you wrote it and my friend pulled me aside really generously as a good friend and was like look like you need to learn how to talk to actors they don't like\nThey don't like auditioning you know and they don't like working with you and so I took an acting class\nTo learn how I'd want to be spoken to\nAs an actor so maybe I can speak more eloquently and lovingly towards actors and I was such an insecure person that I got such positive feedback in the acting class\nDerailed me for sixteen years [laughter] and and in this amazing derailment in this amazing education in film and film school and also finding a new expression that is another creative expression that\nThat's so interesting that you really wanted to direct and you took the acting class just to learn how to speak with her to actors that's that's weird that's crazy that's interesting\nA complement can reroute you for sixteen years [laughter]\nDo you find the right complement for the right insecure person and they can change your life did you agree that you were good\nYes I Am struggle with taking complements ah my instinct is to make a joke or say no I'm but where I'm at in my life is I don't really want to\nBe so negative towards myself and try and be kind to myself and the truth is I I I did think I always get it acted mhm\n[noise] and then is it fair to say that you kind of found a different kind of drive than the skateboarding tried that you found like maybe your real\nTribe was Judd Apatow circle of actors and writers even though you weren't in freaks and geeks you were in so many Judd Apatow directed and produced movies how did you become part of the ... tribe well I met\nActually the caffeine or dry hired a mid nineties Alice and Jones is judge catching director and that's why I hired her for my first film because she she's the one who introduced me to judge I after I did I heard Huckabee's I met some casting directors because uh\nYou know I got like an Asian off of that and then ... me to judge and brought me in to read for that little one line and four year old virgin and I don't know then I stuck around\n[noise] so there's one specific line I'm going to ask you about 'cause this line fits so well with what we were talking about before about\nHaving to learn a kind of masculinity an attitude that you hadn't learned and skateboard culture and you might be able to gas line I'm going to ask you about\nThis from Superbad which you start in with um with Michael Cera and um [noise] your your your high school kid and this and you know you're not\nPart of the cool crowd at all and one of the really popular high school girls play by Emma Stone who you know ... or within the Netflix series MANIAC I love her yeah I from a distance I Love her to [laughter]\nThan the decision of what he has the honor for as a person could use a an actor\nGood good good that always makes me happy to hear but anyway she's going to be throwing a party well her parents are gone and she needs somebody to buy alcohol and even though you're under age you just said you're going to get the alcohol you know bring it to the party and be the hero and so you're you're trying to tell the Michael Cera character\nOr about this and he's kind of skeptical of this is a very good idea the Iliad and be able to do it\nAnd then you say and I'm going to say like the really clean version of this because it's much too expletive laced for us to play this on the radio that you basically say\nYou know have girls saying I was so drunk last night I shouldn't have had sex with that guy we can be that mistake\nSo gosh that sounds you know I mean women are so furious about how teenage boys an adult men tried to get girls and women drunk or drummed to get them into bad\nI mean it's literally horrified [laughter]\nWhat a hard thing to hear because the idea behind that is this young man is hoping the young woman is showing ... braided that her judgment would be so poor that she would make a mistake by sleeping with him\nAnd that is incredibly wrong and I didn't write that film so I think comedy\nHas a really hard time and the aging process because things that are funny at a moment or people might laugh at us times change that was never right\nBut for some reason it was okay to make a joke about it at that point where as of course it's not now hearing it now sounds terrific how does this sound you\nAwful [laughter] but it didn't sound good to me than either I didn't like the idea that that kind of like disregard for girls are women just like that never sounded upsetting yeah yeah\n[laughter] I was deeply upsetting or you know what to be honest with you I was twenty three and I not that that's an excuse but I don't think I had the emotional maturity\nTo understand that those words are that joke would be so horrible you know because that's the reality I don't think I ever thought of that as a reality 'cause it's not my experience and so now thinking of that as a reality is very hard to hear\nYeah well thank you for being reflective about that [noise] so um so it's been interesting Thirteen Years later after super bad to see how you and how ... how and Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg\nHave evolved you know and that and the subject you've all taken on since then because I think I think things have changed\n[noise] yeah and I literally can only speak for myself and as an actor in that moment I didn't see how hard that is and how ugly that joke is I don't want to speak for the filmmakers 'cause this is such a larger\nHard issue where a Thirteen year old joke stands now when I hear that it's very disturbing but I also know those people that wrote it and they're really good people so it's just so complicated I never want to be hurtful to anybody either side\n[noise] why don't we take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is Jonah Hill you know him as an actor but he's now a director and screenwriter his directorial debut is called mid nineties we'll be right back this is fresh air\nGuitarists a capitalist\n[noise] a purist\nFor the news they all need the journalists at
