with David Kaplan author of the new book the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court's assault on the constitution\nWe'll also talk about what comes to appointees Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh mean for the future of the court and will consider the significance of having a chief justice John Roberts was also considered the most likely swing vote\nYou will be the first chief justice in eighty plus years who is in the middle such as that is of the court will truly be his court\nAnd Kentucky reviews Kurd vials seventh album bottle it in that's coming up on fresh air\nFirst news\nFrom NPR News in Washington I'm Lakshmi Singh a federal grand jury is now indicting the suspect in the Pittsburgh synagogue mass\nShooting on forty four counts including hate crimes that's up from twenty nine\nI think this court like past courts will have an activist agenda that doesn't mean conservative or liberal as such means interventionist but yes I think this court with five conservatives and three of them quite resolute um will start\nLooking to overturn federal regulation and federal power generally if you're a liberal or if you if you're someone who by and large like what the court has done over the last fifty years you've got far more important issues to worry about than abortion alone what are the issues\nFederal power I think there is a vast federal administrative\nState that passes all kinds of regulations whether it's on securities law\nSafety in the workplace clean air clean water\nAnd the power of those agencies is by and large left alone by Congress that's a choice by Congress they could rein in those agencies if they want it to a ... view that that administrative state is one of the reasons the federal government has run amok and\nThe movement conservatives in this White House not the social and religious conservatives they're grail used to rein in federal power they don't care about roe v Wade such they're perfectly happy to talk about Ravi wait\nTo get the support of religious conservatives but I think in justices cabinet and justice Gorsuch for example they have a friend in trying to rein in federal power and to use federal courts to say enough is enough\n[noise] so um I mean Steve Bannon was in the Trump Administration he tapped to back the goal of deconstructing the administrative state and you're saying the Trump administration's still has that goal\nAnd in the book they said that that was a decisive factor in choosing Neil Gorsuch for the bench oh what's his record on a deconstructing the administrator state\nHe has written extensively\nAs a lower court judge and in speeches and larvae articles about doing precisely that and it is one of his opinions when he was on the lower federal appeals court that most caught the attention of the Trump White house\nThat's what got their attention not his views on abortion and same sex marriage or other social issues and and Brett Kavanaugh is not\nFar behind I think in those two justices as well as justice is Thomas and Alito and probably the chief justice John Roberts I think you argued we have five votes\nTo overturn what's called Chevron deference which were first to a decision in the Nineteen eighties where the Supreme Court said\nThat agencies like the EPA the securities and Exchange Commission or OSHA um ought to be given a very wide berth\nIn their decision making we at the court should defer to those regulations and rulings I think you will see Chevron deference in great jeopardy\nOr their other priorities you think this new court will have\nI think it is possible that you'll see this court a hearken back\nTo the days of the Nineteen thirties and Nineteen twenties when the court would strike down what we now regard as garden variety uncontroversial regulation of the workplace and strike it down on First Amendment grounds on grounds of so called economic\nLiberty people forget a but once upon a time at the turn of the century and for the next Thirty years the Supreme Court struck down minimum wage laws and maximum our laws or regulations concerning workplace safety they did so\nIn the name of economic liberty no Ventura early FDR proposed court packing and was loudly critical of the court and the court change gears in Nineteen thirty seven the famous switch in time that save nine and for\nThe last eight years the courts interest in liberty has largely focused on individual liberty and you've got decisions for example like Rosie wave on abortion but I think it is possible that you may see that pendulum swing back\n[noise] if you're just joining us my guest is David Kaplan he's the author of the new book the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court's assault on the constitution we'll be right back after a short break this is ...\nNick Romans you the headline story in the final days before an election swing voters or do they don't want them and do what they always planned to do

highland park from James Beard award winning shifts Nancy silver tuned in ... Molina open daily more a triple being pizza dot com\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is David a caplin he's the author of the new book the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court assault on the constitution he's also former legal affairs editor at Newsweek\nSo I have a question and I suspect you won't be able to answer but I'd love to know the answer to that I really want to know what the justices think of how Brett Kavanaugh I handled himself\nAt his confirmation hearings when he was questioned about Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual assault and let it us justices who were already seated on the court thought he had a judicial temperament do you have anything that you can tell us about that\nI stayed in touch with some of the justices I've interviewed I've stayed in touch with them since the book has come out I guess like an offer to thoughts one leaving aside the specifics\nOf Dr Ford's testimony and Kavanaugh's response the justices can stand seeing the court placed a in the mail system\nThey they think it's bad for the court they think it's embarrassing and while they'll watch the hearings are on TV you know they have cable at the court they live in a marble temple but they can still watch TV and they hate it\nHaving said that I think part of the reaction this time was having a specific most of the justices no\nCabinet chief justice Roberts served briefly I think with cabin on the DC circuit in ... if not they live near each other in suburban Washington they belong to the same clubs eat at the same restaurants there are other piece and Elena Kagan\nJustice Kagan when she was dean at Harvard law school tired cabinet to ah come teach there so they all know Kavanaugh they knew know him far more than they knew Neil Gorsuch when he joined the court and they like Kevin ... and they were spectrum there is a reason\nThat Kavanaugh was the leading so cold feet or judge in the country that is the judges who send their own law clerks up to the Supreme Court to then clerk for justice has Kavanaugh was the leader in the country incidentally I think second place was Merrick Garland\nStill on the federal appeals court in Washington and ... who of course was Obama's pick\nTo succeed Scully in two thousand sixteen\n[noise] so I think there are a lot of concerns now that we have two justices\nIn the Supreme Court who has been accused of sexual misconduct Clarence Thomas the sexual harassment and Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault and these men might have decisive votes in matters pertaining to gender equality sexual assault or sexual harassment issues [noise]\nAnd it questions the credibility of the quote court because they might be very biased in their opinions\nWhether they're biased or as you know have the appearance of bias is a real problem for the court and there is no real solution I don't for example I think you will see recusal\nIn such areas of the law I don't think you'll see Kevin recused herself anymore than Clarence Thomas ... part of that is it's hard for justice to recuse himself\nOr herself at a lower court you can always substitute in a new judge you can't do that\nOn the Supreme Court there nine justices if one doesn't sit in the case then you're down to a they don't like even numbers of justices but we'll we'll Kavanaugh bend over backwards in in such cases to try to undo the concern people have that's\nSuch dime store psychology is beyond my pay grade they're certainly isn't any indication in his opinions to date of a bias but you know his performance after Dr Ford testify\nTalking about how this was a vast left wing conspiracy the Clintons and all that even if he apologized for try to in Wall Street journal op ed piece\nI think that in some respects a leaves him\nIn an even tougher position than he might in a sexual harassment case there are a lot of cases that if they don't involve the Clinton specifically obviously they involve politics and a cabinet or you could argue showed huge true partisan shelf\nSome people who follow the court have suggested that Kevin ... might have been selected\nTo be the nominee because after having worked on the Clinton impeachment he\nSubsequently said that he thinks a sitting president shouldn't be subjected to criminal charges um because it takes up too much time it takes time away from other crises that the president has to help handle and\nI've read that brief yeah by ... why not\nI Believe in simple explanations simple explanation is that\nKavanaugh leaving aside ideology and political credentials is as respected a federal judge in the country as almost anybody if you ask liberals and conservatives apart from ideology who are the most respected\nUh appeals court judges in the country Kavanaugh would be on anybody's list of twenty he's enough of an intellect technocrat a scholar to make that list and I think when you take that um basic credential and in fact during the games close relationship\nWith him that would made him the odds on favorite here's another\nQuestion that you also might not be able to answer I Would love to know\nHow the justices what they think of what President Trump has said about judges he's insulted judges he used the term so called judge to describe one judge during the campaign he called\nChief justice Roberts an absolute disaster he said Roberts gave us Obamacare it might as well be called Roberts' care\nHe did not say that in a positive way another time he claimed that Roberts voted to uphold Obamacare the Affordable CARE Act because he wanted to be popular inside the beltway [noise] um\nYou're right that Neil Gorsuch nearly withdrew his nomination after Trump insulted him\nAnd this was after Senator Richard Blumenthal had had his me meeting with nominee Neil Gorsuch and said that Gorsuch had called Trump's attacks on the federal judiciary disheartening and demoralizing\nWhat if anything can you tell us about how the justices feel about what the president has said about\nWell every single one of them that I talked to the extent that I could\nGet I'm Talking a little or use some body language are all appalled by him how come we're not be appalled by him generally in terms of his attacks on the federal judiciary I think they are especially\nAnnoyed perturbed and I went to some extent aggrieved because they think it wound up the integrity of the judiciary which has a limited capacity to fight back I was struck by something I report in the book that Roberts chief justice Roberts during the two thousand sixteen\nPresidential campaign ... confided to a friend\nThat he was outraged by candidate Trump's attacks\nOn Roberts Roberts in effect saying I've been a loyal Republican my whole life I worked in the Reagan Administration I helped the Bush campaign in Bush Gore how can anybody seriously question\nMy credentials I was struck by that that the chief justice of the United states would particularly care what the presidential candidate thought because long after that candidates gone weather is elected president or not we chief justice Roberts will still be occupying the Senate seat of the marble temple and will be there for decades\nSince this is the era of the John Roberts court in two ways one is that he's the chief justice but also he is now considered to be the swing vote so he is really the most decisive factor in the court now right\nCorrect he will be the first chief justice in eighty plus years who is in the middle such as it is of the court it'll will truly be his court and he will have the potential for quote unquote greatness\nWhen he's demonstrated at his greatest moment of the court in the Obamacare ruling has he demonstrated it in any other moment\nNo [laughter] not really it may be on the margins of some rulings but the two important projects for this chief justice have been deregulating\nCampaign finance Citizens United and all that and removing a racial preferences from America life whether it's in college admissions or a how the voting rights act in Nineteen sixty sixty five is applied and he\nFirmly believes in the conservative agenda on those two issues if you look at what he's done in those areas don't confuse him\nFor a moderate he's not but I think he holds the potential to apply the brakes and I think to the extent we see the court\nFurther placed into the males drum in coming years now that it's got five votes on a lot of issues I think you may see this chief justice take his views about the courts integrity and place them ahead of his own particular views on this or that issue\nJohn Roberts wrote the majority decision that go to the voting rights act\nAnd that kind of decided in favor of voting restrictions as opposed to voting rights [noise] um so ... went and future voting restrictions vote versus voting rights decisions come to this day in court did you think the court will continue to vote on the side of restrictions\nWell yeah I they they gutted much of the ring writes active Nineteen sixty five but I think that's as I argue in the book that's one area where the courts adventurous Zimmer arrogance is pronounced the voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five\nOr you can like or dislike on the merits as a way to eliminate vestiges of slavery in southern states and and and other states we would discriminatory practices in voting laws and practices\nBut Congress passed a law\nAnd reopen the law uncontroversial e periodically why is it the court's role to override that democratic preference\nWhy is it um that those who brought the challenge against the voting rights act\nSomehow you need to have their ledge writes a vindicated by the Supreme Court instead of just relying on legislators I'm mystified by the decision but you know it's a conservative decision not John Roberts is a high mark\nSaid John Roberts was the swing vote on upholding the Affordable CARE Act and you write that he had to draft of his decision what was the differences between those two draft and why did he have two of them\nWe knew that Roberts from prior recording had switched votes\nIn the Obamacare ruling in two thousand twelve and had infuriated the other conservatives on the court but I learned and reporters in the book that even though he voted initially\nIn the private conference of the justices right after the oral argument in the courtroom even though we initially voted to strike down the law he immediately went back to his chambers and instructed his law clerks\nTo draft to different opinions one that resulted in the law being struck down\nBy the second opinion that resulted in the AC eighty four to ... Iraq being upheld biggest Roberts was betwixt and between and because we're four justices on each side he knew\nHe was the swing vote he knew he was the decisive vote he would control the writing of of of the ruling and he wanted to see what both opinions looked like and sometimes as justices will say Roberts and otherwise the opinion just doesn't right\nAnd he quickly came to the conclusion that the law ought to be upheld I think Roberts and the best sense of the word in a close case decided\nI'm going to give the benefit of the doubt to the legislature and he decided as an institutional matter to strike down the Affordable CARE Act in the middle of a presidential election year would put the Supreme Court smack\nIn the vortex of that presidential election and that would be bad for the court\nIf you're just joining us my guest is David a capital and he's the author of the new book the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court's assault on the constitution he's also the former legal affairs editor of Newsweek we're going to take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air\nI'm Suzanne watt laid on the next MORNING EDITION\nThey won California is a lot for California lottery\nSurprising story of how we got the lotto and what it says about money in our direct democracy weekdays on eighty nine point three key PCC\nCared BCC supporters include goes in Beverly Hills presenting high noon an exhibition of new paintings by Dan colon opening reception friday November second from six to eight PM more at good goes E.
