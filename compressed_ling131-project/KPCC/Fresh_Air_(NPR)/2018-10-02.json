Stevens President Trump is slamming Senate Democrats and the fight over Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination and parents Giles Snyder reports on the president's Monday Night rally in Tennessee\n[noise] so how did you find out what he was telling them how do you do that\n[laughter] [noise] we were digging at that for quite a long time not getting I'm not making a whole lot of progress\nUm I had gone to a an event or Kislyak was speaking even\nAnd ah he was speaking he's a physicist by training of all things and he was speaking at a conference in Washington and I showed up and sat down next to sit down next to him and started covering him with questions and\nHe started answering them a and sort of caught me off guard he wouldn't tell me what he talked about ... but he uh admitted that he had long standing relationship with someone and had many conversations with them\nThe thing that I think one thing to change the dynamic was a column um that David Ignatius a columnist for the Washington Post wrote\nThat just posed these questions we know that Mike Flynn had conversations with the Russian ambassador we know what when those occurred we deserve answers from this new administration about what was said\nAnd that put the white and I put the White House under some pressure and it was their answers and they're misleading and dishonest answers that then unleashed the sourcing that we needed to get to the bottom of it did this come to you\nWell so we what happens is\nAfter after that Ignatius column you have incoming White House officials including Sean Spicer and vice president Pence going on television and saying we've talked to Mike Flynn sanctions were not discussed in those conversations absolutely not nothing to it\nThat's when I'm longstanding sources for reporters at the post started here started to tell us\nNot true not true you guys need to look into this that's not true and it was you know I'm through the reporting of my colleagues adamant us Ellen not ashamed of myself in trying to get out that\nThat will ultimately got nine sources are telling us consistently that Flynn had in fact discuss sanctions with\nChris Lee I can in fact it signaled that they could expect some relief from sanctions when Trump was in office so you know there's a scene in the book that I write about which one of my colleagues at him and says I'm a terrific national security reporter\nIs meeting with a source and he has this certain method about that when he has conversations\nSources he'll often bring a piece of paper that will have a list of facts that he wants to check would that source and he's going through that list of the facts and in this case it's about Flynn and Kislyak\nAnd uh at that moment that he gets the first sort of indication from a highly reliable source that the White House position on this\nIs false that Flynn's claims that Pence's claims that Sean Spicer is claims need to be scrutinized further that they're not honest and that's what sets in motion the sort of really\nOf verve and push on our end to get to the bottom of it\n[noise] see your your team contacts Flynn to say we're publishing this story basically saying that you lied and that you did have phone conversations with the Russian ambassador about lifting sanctions after Trump takes office and then of course denied it and denied it and denied it\nAnd then you had to decide you didn't publish anyways you and your editors had to decide how was that decision made\nThat was a sort of one of the more fascinating and interesting episodes I've ever lived through as a reporter\nI'm so when we write stories like this you know basically accusing a very senior government official of not being honest with the public and there's a very high bar there uh before you before you can publish something like that you want to have\nEverything locked down and in fact in this case we had a colleague Karen DeYoung who had a previously scheduled interview with Flynn in his office in the west wing of the White House and so we huddled with her before she went over she was going to talk to him about foreign policy objectives of the new administration and so forth\nAnd asked her to at the very end of her interview with him raise this question with him on last time to tell him look post is close to publishing stories saying that you did discuss sanctions would Kislyak how to respond\nIn that in that moment he doubles down and tells her no no and he repeats that several times no no no basically did not happen so Karen comes out of that meeting and called us and tells us this and we actually hit pause on the storyline that night we were ready to publish that story that night but the\nSort of the the strenuous denial the nature of the denial from him made us think okay we [laughter]\nWe need to double check we need to there's we need to hold off and just make shouldn't make double sure that we're right on this that night I'm we talked about it in the post newsroom the next morning I went into a meeting with Marty Baron Cameron bar other senior editors at the Washington Post and laid out our sourcing\nThat's the first time I I I ever used the word number nine I later I said we have nine different sources telling us this is true and and described that sourcing to those editors\nAnd came out of that meeting with a green light I mean when when we laid out those details laid out our sourcing and the ... we had gone to to try to to nail this down I'm Marty Baron and others were were didn't hesitate you know we're going forward with the story we need to tell Mike Flynn what we're doing\nSo that sets in motion another interaction with when that was amazing so we call the White House we say we have the denial we're going to use that on the record we're going forward with the story anyway we're confident our sources and then the White House blinks Flint Blake's\nComes back to us calls me it through a spokesman calls me and says for the first time\nI'm Mr Flynn is no longer certain that those sanctions were not discussed and that call if you can't be sure that the subject didn't come up\nAnd that was just so different from the categorical denial we had gotten I don't know sixteen hours earlier that we knew that we were we knew we were right and that's when we published\n[noise] so when Flynn was forced out of the Trump Administration\n... how did that feel free to do you do feel like proud that you've broken such a consequential story [noise]\nUm do you feel like good like truth has been out and like I really like to know what it feels like that was that was a really yeah sure if they're really big thing very very early in the Trump Administration\nAll the all of the above Terry so sure absolutely proud of our of our work proud that we would have been able to accomplish something of such consequence proud that we were um\nYou know especially in this climate where the process is under constant siege an attack that we were able to do work that still mad that\nThat mattered in your head immediate impact all of that\nI mean not that part of it felt great um I mean for me I had I had actually known Flynn for\nFor a long time probably a decade or so had interviewed him many times I'm overseas and at the Pentagon and other positions\nAnd always liked him I took no pleasure in his ouster I'm In his his resignation um and what came next for him I mean that didn't that didn't make me happy but at the same time I just the I yeah I mean it was\nAs a reporter there is there is nothing better than to be able to get to the bottom of a complex story that there are so many people who are trying to prevent you from getting it\n[noise] did you face consequences did you get troll do a lot as a result of having an mask this lie\nI mean the ... the ... absolutely so troll the law attacked a lot um and that has not really a beta [laughter]\nI mean that that continues now not just for me but for a lot of reporters covering the this administration at this really highly politically charged time where we're living through I'm On the other hand we're things happened that had never happened to me as a reporter\nUm several of us started getting\nCards ... actual letters in the in the mail or thanks for readers from faraway places um notes on on our even on my doorstep at home I Would walk through the neighborhood and suddenly people would stop me and thanked me and\nI mean that was that was felt great too and it was odd it was something I had never experienced\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guess is Washington Post reporter Brad Miller he covers intelligence and national security he's part of the team that shared a Pulitzer this year for national coverage his new book is called The Apprentice Trump Russia and the ... version of American democracy we'll be right back\nThis is fresh air\nWe're adding a brand new show to keep the ... election if a college called America on the line from WNYC and it's on Monday through Thursday nights at seven it's part of the key PCC voter game plan\n[noise] next time on the frame actor rhythm ed has two new movies a new song and a lot to say about representation and stuffy period drama Tuesday at three thirty five eighty nine point three K PCC [noise]\nThere was a lot of Republican opposition to making any of this public and a lot of that opposition\nAnd from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell can you describe the wage he tried to prevent anything from going public about Russian interference\nThere is a long gap between when the U.S government through its intelligence services learns what Russia's doing and when the public finally learn about it a and there's a lot of second guessing even now about why the Obama administration didn't tell the public more or earlier\nThere are scenes in the book I write about in late August or the early August timeframe late July timeframe John Brennan who was CIA director at the time becoming increasingly concerned about what was happening the WikiLeaks dump it already occurred\nHe sort of holes himself up inside his office at CIA headquarters on the seventh floor for two straight days deep into the night each day poring over all of the agencies Russian intelligence at the end of this exercise he's just convinced that Russia and he has any sitting on new intelligence in fact that tells him\nThat the Kremlin is playing a bigger game here than anybody has to that point realized that they're not just in it to try to disrupt the election but they are trying to help elect Trump and damage Hillary Clinton and he calls the White House that week calls them in early August I Need to get in to see the president\nAfter his meeting with Obama\nThe game plan involves brand and then trying to reach out to congressional leadership this is sort of an all hands on deck moment for the U.S government they want to make sure the leadership in Congress is aware of what's happening in the election so Brennan starts calling\nYou know the Senate and house leadership to committed the leadership of the committee the relevant committees and so forth and setting up one\nOn one briefings with these people\nAnd uh that's really unusual for CIA director to do and he finds you know that the Democrats are lining up at his door that to to me and learn about what's happening Republicans are putting them off\nIn fact he doesn't even get to talk to some of the senior Republicans until almost a month later sort of the August recess timeframe but nevertheless this is a you know an alarming development that some Republicans are showing very little interest in\nUm he'd finally gets into a conversation a private meeting with Mitch McConnell and we write about this and the book and Brennan feels like he's coming to these leaders would\nFrightening information overwhelming information solid intelligence that shows that Russia has this objective they're trying to screw in our screw up the election and try to install Donald Trump\nAnd then he ends up in a shouting match with McConnell because McConnell's reaction is something he just Brennan fails to anticipate is deeply troubled by McConnell is saying well if you basically tells him\nIf you come forward this administration comes forward and accuses rush of trying to help and help elect Donald Trump\nI Will consider that interference in the election and I will and I will call the administration out on that I Will accused the administration of trying to interfere in the election I mean it's astonishing here's the Senate majority leader\nBeing told that Russia's interfering in the election and he's saying I'm not willing to issue any kind of statement or take any action that would let the public know that but I Will accuse you of interfering election\n[noise] you you right who had weaponized intelligence McConnell and the GOP weaponized denial\nYeah because they the because of their refusal to sign on to even any kind of a public statement that would uh explicitly say Russia's interfering in this election Russia's trying to tilt the outcome of this election the Obama team felt sort of\nHandcuffed I'm now ... you could argue that they that they really weren't in that they had lots of ways they could have come forward and talk publicly about it\nBut the Obama administration is hoping to do this in a bipartisan way and so determined to do it in a bipartisan way that when newness and McConnell and others refused to go along they're sort of stock\nThey can't see a way past that it takes them months to figure out a way to get a statement out did even then only glancing Lee gets at the idea that Russia's interfering in the election with a certain purpose\n[noise] you know when Mitch McConnell finally agreed to releasing a joint statement of Democrats and Republicans about Russian interference and this was in late September\nUm was a letter to state election officials from off for leaders of Congress warning of unnamed ... Malik factors that are seeking to use cyberattacks to disrupt the administration of our elections\nAnd an urge states to quote ensure that their network infrastructure is secure it made no mention of Russia\nSo even when McConnell given Einstein's statement there's not only no mention of hurting Hillary Clinton and helping Donald Trump there's no even mentioned of of Russia it's so they are just\nHonest thing to look packets of stars they look back on that now I'm because given what McConnell and others in government knew at that time that statement is so watered down is to be virtually meaningless [noise] um so\nSo meanwhile John Brennan who's trying to convince McConnell look Russia's interfering in the election and McConnell is saying oh yeah if you say that again going to say you're interfering in the election so brand and recently lost his security clearance\nAnd McConnell is down to the Senate majority leader I'm I'm Wondering and I don't know um\nI don't know if you can answer this at all\nBut if it can be proven that McConnell knew that Russia was trying to interfere in our election and influence the outcome of it\nAnd then tried to cover it up to deny that it was happening is that treason is that like legally treason\nI don't want to use words like treason [noise] um but I write about many cases that are really distressing um that tell us that we're in a different political year than anything we've that we've seen in this country for a long time\nUm where political imperatives where loyalty to party or party considerations\nSeem to overwhelm everything else including\nThe concern for the country and its in its core institutions I mean what's more Coors than\nAnd election an American election for president of the United states\nWhat is more deserving of protection um and putting above all party considerations than that and yet and we see numerous cases through this period in which um when senior officials learn about this and I think Mitch McConnell is one of them\nTheir impulse is to protect the party interests to try to protect the prospect of the Trump victory over the sanctity of the election itself I mean it's\nIt's um it's a troubling thing and it didn't always it wasn't always this way\n[noise] let me re introduce\nYou here if you're just joining us my guest is Greg Miller he covers national security and intelligence for the Washington Post now he has a new book called The Apprentice Trump Russia and the ... version of American democracy and they take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air\nLife from here with steely starts it's brand new season this weekend in San Francisco then had to cross the country with some exciting new cast members including comedian Mike Yard with a tough job [noise]\nI got to make a room full of people were problems\nLot of problems in his room right now\nIn New musical director Mike Elizondo he'd producer and songwriter who's worked with everyone from Fiona Apple to Jay Z life comes in Saturday's at seven on eighty nine point three key PCC\nThe b._b._c. will services that provide you with the F ... expects you the woman at a changing world with reporters around the globe we provide religious stories and analysis you do this I'll see you guide through the news yeah ... that's the b._b._c. ...\nListen for BBC News hour every afternoon at one eighty nine point three key BCC [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from this fishing\nAnd from progressive insurance offering or weights or by home insurance with their home quote explore it's custom quotes in ratings are available online\nMore effort restive dot com or one eight hundred progressive now that it's progressive and from the I.

joining us guest is Greg Milner he covers national security and intelligence for the Washington Post he shared a Pulitzer Prize this year for national reporting now he has a new book called The Apprentice Trump Russia innocent version of American democracy\nMy understanding is that there are members of the Trump Administration who have been told that they had to sign non disclosure agreements which means that they wouldn't be able to divulge\nAnything to a reporter like you if you called them and this is an attempt to prevent any kind of damaging information about the Trump Administration friend from getting out to the public do you know when somebody you're speaking to has signed a non disclosure agreement\nCan cope live in a healthy way with seem content like this regularly\nWell I Believe that the uh responsibility shared between the employer and the employee in this circumstance and on the part of the employer I with the things that are\nProviding predictability in more general sense maybe there are three things that the help us to cope with a stressful or a traumatic events\nThat one is predictability to his consent and the three is a control or so in that case are clearly defining the parameters of the job um and what kind of haunted one could be expected to be exposed to is important\nHaving clear consent from the employees that they're willing and ready to engage with that content and then the last thing just control meaning having the opportunity for the employee at any point to withdraw from the job if it's too much\nIf if someone um is used to seeing terrible content on a on a daily basis or or frequent basis and let's take for an example the sexual abuse of a child something that I'm\nFor any of us to see that is going to be deeply disturbing if you're exposed to that on a on a regular basis\nIs it possible to be in Newark to that is it possible that some way be psychologically protected\nIn the frequency or preparation for seeing that in a way that the rest of us wouldn't be\nAt the differential processes such that uh uh some people become a less reactive to such content or or become desensitized\nOr with less emotional reaction uh and some become a much more so\nUh and so the the the there was low predictability as to who will respond in what way but it's certainly something that can lead to a post traumatic stress and potentially posture medic stress disorder\nAnd if ... if there's no way to determine in advance that means anyone who's applying to be a moderator from one of these companies wouldn't necessarily know whether they could really indoor this without psychological harm\nAnd that's about right I don't think that people have a clear sense of protecting their own reactions to content of the time\nRight manual made and bird UCLA professor a with us\nSteve Williams uh was representing the a former moderator Facebook here out how do people get these jobs today after showing anything uh to the perspective companies like Facebook 'em to show that you know they think they could tolerate this\n[noise] you know um and again a while we're somewhat limited but we can talk about for our particular client based on Facebook's nondisclosure agreement from what has been reported in the media there's there's very little done and really in practical terms\nThere's not much that can be done to prepare someone for the experience of seeing the headings\nUm rapes murder suicide sexual abuse over and over and over again on a daily basis I'm no matter how we might think we can prepare ourselves for it it's a quite a different thing when you're actually viewing that and I\nDon't think there is really a comparison I think this is an issue of you know our society now and platforms like Facebook didn't exist before nothing's really prepared us for um\nPeople needing to function in the role because humans do this no computers of\nProtecting the rest of us from seeing such offensive in harmful um and hateful I'm content on the Internet so\nWhile you know efforts you might be made to tell you you're going to see things that are shocking or things that are of uncomfortable there's really nothing that can prepare a person\nFor what it's like to see it over and over and over again every day I'm nonstop\nBut professor made and burg are there are some people who can effectively compartmentalized this stuff and it just becomes part of the job and doesn't have a negative effect on them personally\nUh I cannot to answer it in the context of food the specific material that is being discussed but in general as far as traumatic events people can a process that in a way that does not lead to post traumatic stress disorder yes\nJerry in Irvine you're on TALK\nMany years ago Larry I interviewed Holocaust survivors people would be the death camps along with other volunteers and we have very strict\nUm guidelines we weren't allowed to work I think more than two hours a day on these things and you do not only here for ... things but we also look at archival footage\nAnd I can tell you at that time before the Internet people dropping like flies they were going to do something good for humanity and they we I myself would have the minor anxiety attacks I couldn't sleep at night I\nHad nightmares and other people I spoke to same experiences\nBut since that time I'm heartened to know the psychologist who pioneered all kinds of ah um screen devices that can\nTell who has a hearty a reserve psychological resilience a week of all your first responders equally where I've seen the accidents are horrible catastrophes a police officers firefighters et cetera so there is certain characteristics of some people God Bless him wherever that in their personality who\nCan handle this so I'm I I was disappointed to hear this discussion that more ... than needed him he's somebody it's for a good fit between the work and who they are\nJerry I appreciate you sharing your experience being an interviewer of of of Holocaust survivors professor made in ...\nAh how robust is that screening\nAnd not enough to be used as a strong predictor or a I think that there was a great deal of work is being done and attempts to continue being made to to gain more predictability ah\nAs far as human response to these events or images but it's not enough to be productive enough to be used in practical terms\nYeah Jerry talking about first responders because of course they they have to compartmentalize to the point that they can go into action under some of the most terrible circumstances we could we can possibly imagine\nA professor ... thank you very much appreciate your being with us UCLA clinical professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and

and some of the people who have been appointed have conflicts of interest or unqualified making them unprepared to deal with many of them\nPotentially catastrophic the risks of them\nThe risks of a nuclear armed\nAnd many of them are not risk most people will see [noise]\nFirst news\n[noise]\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Laurie London\nPresident Trump is in Philadelphia today but before departing reporters caught up with him on the White House lawn with more questions about Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh among other things they asked how he would feel if the report shows Kavanaugh lied to Congress\nAnd that gets taken down and they kind of like you look at the specific instances of what happens why it happened in almost every case there's some Trump supporter or Trump appointee who has some narrow financial interest in the removal of the data\nYou write about the environmental protection agency but that seems to fit with one of the themes that you write about in your book the office at the EPA that give scientific input\nTo the presidential administration the office of the science advisor the plan is according to an anonymous source that the New York times reported on the plan is to eliminate that job altogether\nDoes that fit into the themes that you've seen in three departments that you write about\nWell you know it's funny because the broad impulse so the Trump Administration has been just not to fill the jobs I mean the top seven hundred jobs in the administration\nHalf of them are still unfilled and the ones that are filled are filled often very oddly by people who don't have the expertise for the job so I Would say the broader pattern is one of just general neglected misunderstand\nWhat there's no question that Trump has been specifically hostile to environmental regulation and to the idea of climate change\nAnd it's pretty clear that the reason he's off though as he's got he's backed by by fossil fuels people um and where you do find places in ... in in my stories where\nWhere you can see the hand that handed work\nEither removing climate change data for websites are filling jobs that would be specifically addressing\nClimate and the environment with people who are totally inappropriate for the job so for example ah in the agriculture department the chief scientist the person who's in charge of distributing the three billion dollars a year the agriculture department distributes to for basic research\nThis research is done is done now almost entirely to find ways to adapt the food supply to climate change um I mean it's ... it's ... it's absolutely critical is not going to be done in the private sector\nThey head of his job to a right wing talk show radio host or who had backed trumping I mean it's just that kind of thing is going on throughout the administration\n[noise] spoken to fresh air is Dave Davies about a year ago after your second article on how Trump is running the federal government was published in Vanity Fair and and with the navy focused on the department of energy and agriculture you've added in your book the department of commerce and want to take a look at that\nAnd you're right that the department of commerce and very little to do with directly with commerce and if in fact forbidden by law from engaging in business and you say that the department of commerce should really be called the department of information or the department of data why\nBecause that's what it does it's you know inside of the department of commerce or you have\nThe census for example which is the best picture we have of ourselves as a society you have the ... a collection and assimilation of all the economic statistics and above all more than half the budget of the department is spent gathering weather and climate data I mean the national weather services inside the department of commerce\nAnd one of the great opportunities that exists with the federal government is the the better use of the day they collect all of a sudden we're able to parse the data and wait and use the data in ways we've never be able to use it\nAnd that's a seemingly something that the that the person that Trump put in charge of the Commerce Department Wilbur Ross is not interested in he sees the job is kind of like cheap trade negotiator which is odd because we have achieved trade negotiator\nAnd one of the big like data pools that um the Commerce Department is responsible for is the U.S census\nAnd the head of the Commerce Department Wilbur Ross is not now involved in a lawsuit pertaining to a question on ... um I I don't think there's definitive or not the question on the twenty Eighteen census whether it's on there and\nWhile they're still is still argument about whether they're going to insert on the census a question of establishing whether the person who's reply to this as a citizen what we'll do is queer the responses to the census\nLet's let's talk about why because a lot of people will be afraid to answer that question\nWill be a lot of people will be afraid to answer the question or people will be suspicious of the motives of the census takers\nRight and and a lot of immigrants live with somebody who isn't here legally so even if you're here legally if you know someone who isn't you might be afraid to say that you're an immigrant\nThink at this point that even people who are here who are legal who are fearful though actually let's back up a second\nBut even the gun to prepare them for the census I mean the the the real problem with the census is that it's way behind schedule when it hasn't been budget it for so there's some question whether they're going to be able to pull off the census in the first place but then how you pull it off\nIs another question in there and starting this they're inserting a question that seems designed to dissuade especially Latino from answering it\nAnd one of the consequences if Latinos are underrepresented in the census\nFor starters you don't get a picture a correct picture of the ... congressional districts so we're districts need to be with redrawn because of shifting in the population they won't be redrawn of late one of the things we've learned is just how valuable the data the government collects is researchers have been\nDoing things with this data that they've never been able to do before and so for example\nUm we wouldn't know that there was an opioid crisis in the country\nIf the data on prescription drugs had not been made available and not been possible if we don't have a picture of what the society looks like there's all sorts of misunderstanding of the society that will occur\nSo that people suing Wilbur Ross the plaintiffs include over a dozen states and big cities who say that he acted improperly and trying to add this question about are you um\nAre you a U.S citizen I'm that he acted improperly and trying to add that to the census\nAnd the states and cities fear their political representation will be calculated incorrectly because they will be missed represented in the sense is if this question discourages immigrants from answering\nSo Wilbur Ross ... did you were you surprised at the choice of him to head the department of commerce since as you say commerce has more to do about data and I don't want to sound ages here but I'm\nData and how it's collected and how it's interpreted has is changing so rapidly\nAnd I have no idea if he's kept up with what data means anymore\nWell we know he was falling asleep and meetings where he was supposed to be learning about the department and I know that the people who tried to explain to him how the department worked came away and these were Republicans who who are brought in to try to explain how the department worked to him\nFound that he was really utterly disinterested in anything but trade so even if he was an eighty he just wasn't particularly interested in the mission is apartment an additive at\nWhat became very curious is that the exposure of his finances they put them in a bad order with the White House you know he had to declare as financial holdings ... when he was nominated for\nThe job and it turned out he had two billion dollars less than the Forbes rich lifted calculated him having and four of us who watches this investigation discovers that he'd been lying to the fore rich list all along\nWhich then apparently caused Trump to think a lot less of him but he you know he is an odd choice he's very odd choice because with that department really needs is someone who's really comfortable with technology\n[noise] well if you're just joining us my guess is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist risk and the book is

undoing project and all of which have been bestsellers his new book the fifth risk is about the federal government under Trump and it examines the energy agriculture and commerce departments [noise]\nYou know I'm learning there's so much attention being paid to what's happening in the White House and to the mall or investigation and now to um that Kavanaugh's confirmation story\nAnd not as much attention is being paid what's happening on the cabinet level on a department level and I'm Wondering if there's a lot of action happening in the department level like the three departments you write about no agriculture commerce energy\nThat most of us aren't paying that much attention to even though it's it's being reported on\nIt seems to me are you in your book you're basically saying you could predict some of the problems with the federal government was going to have under President Trump by looking at the transition\n'em and looking at the ... candidacy so let's let's go to there the first chapter is about the transition before Trump wasn't even elected because the transition process is supposed to start with each candidate each candidate is supposed to be preparing\nAt some point as if they were going to become president so that their briefed and they're up to speed if they do become president so the first sentence in your book is Christina Chris Christie noticed a piece in the New York times that's how it all started what was the article Christie notice and what did this article start\nSo there was a piece in the times to describe the meeting that occurred between the Obama administration\nAnd all of the remaining presidential campaign so it was Hillary Clinton's campaign Trump's campaign this is still with the before the Republican primary was over there were four or five of the campaigns and had set representatives and the reason is that happened was\nBy law the outgoing administration is required to prepare for the transition\nAnd by law anybody who's likely to get elected the cat is the two major parties are required to prepare to receive the the briefings\nAnd Christie saw this and he saw that the person the Trump campaign said nothing about government and so he called Corey Lewandowski was running a campaign said look I'll go do it if no one else will because we really need someone someone who understands government to get involved it surprised\nMe that after learning that the Trump Administration had nobody who could fill this role and didn't seem to care very much about filling this role that Christie was still so in support of Trump and wanted to run their transition\nI think there are a couple of things going towards one is as Christie makes quite clear but as other people have pointed out\nTrump didn't run to when he he didn't have an acceptance speech on the or the ... election he was running for ... as an exercise and brand building and so his whole attitude towards preparing to be president was why bother and would you\nAll told him he had to spend money either his money or campaign money to build a transition team he'd become furious and when you heard it was millions of dollars each scream at one point he said to Christie you know if we win you and I can leave the victory party two hours early and figure out everything we need to figure out about the government\nSo we're both not smart\nYeah well that's if that's right so this is another theme that underlies all of this and that in the Trump operation the presence of rich people Trump and especially in Jared Kushner there's this sense that\nThey both think that because they're rich they must be smart but the combination of not wanting to spend the money not actually thinking he's gonna win\nAnd not being really interested in the subject it all leads Trump's to neglect\nThe transition effort but this is where it gets curious Christie does wrangle a few million raise a few million dollars to abide by the federal law and he builds actually I think are quite good transition they had hundreds of people who were really qualified to go into the various departments\nAnd receive the government from their ... the Obama administration is so the bottom and Mr ... has has built this great course and how the government works it's it's you know hundreds of briefing books that have been compiled over the past year\nAnd it's not an ideological briefings you give the same briefing whether the Democrat or Republican wins and it it really is just explaining how they dealt with problems\nSo you understood so this is how we dealt with the Zika virus so if you have another pandemic or through a threat of pandemic here's how you might do it you might disagree with how we did it but but this is how we did it at an awful lot of what's supposed to go on there is just that this is these are the problems this is what this department does\nThis is how you do it and Trump took all those people who are meant to receive those briefings and fired them the day after the election so we had nobody to go into these places to receive the briefings why did he fire them\nGreat question the simple short answer is that Jared Kushner told him to\nAnd the jar cushion that did not like the idea of Chris Christie running the operation because Chris Christie as as a prosecutor in New Jersey had put Kushner's father in jail but that really doesn't explain it I don't say because there was no reason Trump had to listen to cushion are and there's also no reason you couldn't have just fired Christian kept everybody else on board\nI think what happened was that the number of people who were in Trump's ear and especially Michael Flynn\nWho wanted to be the national security advisor\nOr were left off the list of people who are going to get job important jobs in the government and they were left off the list because the transition timid vetted all these people and found the problems with them\nSo some of those problematic people wanted important jobs in government and they persuaded Trump to get rid of this operation that was going to forbid them from having them\nI think that's what happened and a couple that with that is a ... was Trump's total\nDisdain for an indifference to the government I mean if he had any awareness of the complexity operation he was about to have to run or you're terrified to get rid of the people who were going to help them do it but he really I think he really thought I just don't need to know about that\n[noise] so was there like a last straw for Chris Christie that got him fired [noise]\nI think what happened was this that they allowed Chris Christie to build this transition team because Christie explained it was the law they had to do it they didn't have any choice Trump pay no attention didn't take it seriously was irritated when every heard money was being sped\nBut no one really focused on it because no one thought it was ever going to be used that they didn't think they were going to win so Jared Kushner although we oversaw it kind of closely\nAnd made sure that Christie wasn't doing anything he didn't approve of didn't ever really imagine that Christie was going to be in a position of real authority because Donald Trump is not going to win the minute it became real they focused I think it was he was never going to be allowed to do the job because but they never thought the job was going to be done\nIf you're just joining us my guess is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fifth risk and the

group funded with millions of dollars from Exxon Mobil and Koch Industries\nThat basically represents their point of view [noise] so what was the landing team and what was piled tasked with doing\nSo landing team is a grand phrase for what arrived at the department of energy because it was really just pile and he didn't show up until a month after the election\nAnd he would have been in theory tasked with receiving you know hundreds of hours of briefings from people in the department of energy who to prepare them but he what he did instead was met met for about an hour with a couple of people in the secretary's office and listen politely and didn't take notes\nAnd the people who were\nRunning the department of jihad the impression that he had no interest in what they had to say\nOne
