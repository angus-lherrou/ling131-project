{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "To take over seats the Republicans currently hold\nMe all these things have ... to about public and Congress keep voting ... Madison singing mainland and being condition\nAnd I would say two of them are races where Republicans are very very clearly in danger and those are the races in Nevada and Arizona and Nevada you've got senator Dean Heller\nRunning for reelection in a state that did not vote for Trump where it is really tough for Republicans to win state wide elections and where he has a record now on health care especially to shadow him in that campaign\nHeller focus promise and voted for repeal deciding how his trailer I think that gives a complete one eighty they decided not to process from the blame Dean Heller voted to advance would let your industry judge people ... up to five times more than younger people\nAnd then Arizona is a state that has changed a lot similar to Nevada but a little bit redder\nWhere you have a vacancy or an open seat because Jeff Flake is retiring right and you have to women running against each other and send them a on the Democratic side Martha ... on the Republican side and it's a really really interesting test of just how purple Arizona and become\nThe two of their seats are longer shots for Democrats they're essentially red states where Democrats hope that just a distinctively appealing candidate\nCan make something happen one of those in Tennessee the open seat where Bob Corker is retiring where Democrats were recruited\nThe popular former governor Phil Bredesen to run against Marsha Blackburn on the Republican side\nAnd then there's Texas which that's probably the most closely watched long shot race in the country where Ted Cruz is running for re election against but to work the Texan tendency races are really a lot more like the races where the Democrats are on defense user races that are tests of weather\nReally any Democrat can win that statewide race because if Phil Bredesen can't win and Tennessee probably no Democrat\nIn Tennessee so let's say that out all your instincts and leanings and pronounced occasions here are correct we have six Democrats who are definitely in danger for Republicans who are in danger but really only two and a serious way\nMeaning when you count all those up Democrats could lose six seats and only gain for likely fewer so the Republicans not only hold on to the Senate they actually gain seats and if\nThat is entirely possible at the end of the day is probably more likely that Republicans gain seats in the Senate than the Democrats take the majority in\nThe Senate got it and what should we take away from all of this that the Democrats look very likely to take back the house\nAnd the Republicans look likely to hold or even gain a greater majority in the Senate what does that tell us about our country in this moment and about how Congress represents this country and this moment\nWell it tells us of the Senate is much more representative of smaller more rural states and the house is more representative of the more densely populated areas in the country and they're at least for right now at least in the Trump era\nThose are communities that are practically living on different planets politically if we're at a place where you could have a pretty solid national tied one way or another a tide strong enough\nTo put Democrats control the house\nAnd it not only doesn't touch the Senate but actually the Senate goes the other way\nThat just speaks to the enormous division in American experiences between the two parts of the country that these chambers represent really differently does it say something as well about whether or not those chambers will represent the country\nWell it says something about how they're designed to represent the country that the Senate does not supposed to be representative of the population it's supposed to give smaller less populous states a stronger hand in Washington so that they agree to participate in the federal government\nAnd don't just get sort of rolled over by big cities like New York and Chicago and Los Angeles and it's a source of enormous\nConcern to Democrats right now about their political future that if they can't win\nThese rural states that are just not demographically representative of the country as a whole and certainly not representative of the Democratic coalition what does that mean for them as a party and twenty twenty and twenty two for the foreseeable future because the Gulf is only going to get bigger\nAnd what I think it means crack arises that Democrats represent more of America but they represent less of American government\nIs the electoral college on steroids right that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote Donald Trump won the presidency you are likely\nTo have Democrats make very very strong gains in the house or even take control the house and they are probably not going to see anything like those kinds of strong games on the side of level and it's because the Senate not supposed to work that way the same way the electoral college is not supposed to work though [noise]\nFor the experience of a cat a nomination is that the Senate is not as representative of the United states at this moment ... ... it's the Senate that is decisive and these monumental decisions like who's on the Supreme Court like whether or not but Kavanaugh should be a justice that's where\nYou can be looking at some really really serious turbulence in the years ahead\nIf Democrats find themselves very consistently winning the popular vote in national elections winning controls the house winning important governorships and yet they can't really take control of government because the Senate is the way it is [noise]\n[noise] Mm [noise]\nCouch thank you very much\nThe daily supported by fracture creating modern photo decor and gifts by printing photos

written in English and published in the u._k. that's on fresh air [noise]\n\nFirst news live from NPR News in Washington I'm neuron six days after hurricane Michael hand parts of the Florida Panhandle are still without electricity or potable water and NPR's Quil Lawrence reports many are still missing after the storm\nShock rather than laughing out of I truly like enjoying that joke thoroughly\nAnd that is a joke around my maybe you just don't need to joke about slavery like that I'm sure there's a great slavery joke but I haven't cracked that not yet and it's fine for me to not tell garbage ones in the meantime\nSo you're talking about your discomfort in comedy clubs performing when you started out and it took you to like last year [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] I'm like you can really do it but you and just go William started\nThe comedy podcast you do queens and you know you you also just talked about wanting to do comedy in an environment where we're clear people in trans people could come and not feel like they risk being the butt of a joke\nBut that's how it is on to do queens I mean when you and Jessica Williams who's your partner on that show up put it together like what was your goal in terms of the kinds of comics you wanted a showcase because it starts with you and and her\nYou know talking in a funny way by things that recently happened to you and then you bring up several um you know stand up comics to perform it and it's done from a theater [noise]\nUm so so what was what was your goal in terms of showcasing comics and creating a type of environment for the audience and for the performers\nThe fact that it's on HBO Now is it we started working together four years ago is truly bonkers crazy banana sandwich and the best way possible and um when Justin I met\nAnd just even for her her and I ... I just always known as they go all washes late night shows and it usually be you know straight white guys getting these opportunities and every once in a while I see a woman or every once in awhile to like a\nBlack guy and I would just see it and I'll be like oh okay yeah all these people are fun and not take anything away from the people that did get those spots\nBut I'm like I'm surrounded by so many funny women so many funny people of color so many funny we're people who might not get those same opportunities to submit their taped to a book or to get green led to talk about different things from their perspective and so when Jackson I met we were just kind of like\nYou know so many hilarious people who don't have\nMaybe the platform that they can to express themselves in a way we're like well it would be really dope no pun intended but it'd be really up to not only have a show that sort of the show cases\nYou know my improv injustice improv abilities both singular and together but also use the shows a platform to just bring our friends along it'd be like we're supporting everybody this is a show for everybody if you are funny there's no reason why you're not going to be on the show and I think a lot of times you would just here you know\nAnd the industry oh they're just like our desert Ernie funny black women are we just don't know where to look and I'm like\nThat ... doesn't fly with me where there are so many talented amazing people and if you're not looking them it's either out of laziness or the fact that you really don't care\n[noise] so you're pretty successful now in comedy and with your podcast and HBO specials of to do queens but for years you made next to nothing as a comment yes\nYes and and you were getting like dining calls from the student loans that you owed you were nearly evicted from your apartment but you were given a reprieve of like several weeks or a couple of months to raise the\nFive thousand dollars that you needed to stay in your apartment how did you handle the anxiety\nOf not being able to pay your student loans and then not being able to afford to have an apartment and nearly beings if it\nYeah you know there were a lot of tears just like not being able to sleep at night there's a lot of feeling like a failure of feeling like\nMaybe me trying to pursue comedy's a little nutty because I really didn't start making a really solid living doing comedy until eight and a half years and and\nUm you know I was kind of like well maybe it shouldn't take this long ... there are other people around me where it's like it is not taking them eight years to sort of like you know get their career going the way they want to and you know looking back on and now I'm just kind of like you can't\nControl when that happens I think\nYes it was kind of irritating that it took me this long but I think I was\nSo fully ready for the opportunities that arose by that point so like you know to to queens being a HBO didn't scare me having to write a book didn't scare me it's like a cabin blogging in writing for three\nFour years making what fifty bucks a blog post okay yeah I can just writing this book is going to be hard but I'm not gonna run away from it\nLet me introduce you here if you're just joining us my guest is comic an actor Phoebe Robinson who hosts the podcast and HBO specials too to queens with Jessica Williams and she has a new book which is called everything's trash but it's okay we're going to take a short break and then be right back this is fresh air\nHard this is learning that there are eleven measures on the ballot that's all I Want to study but I'm here to help the live voters ... joined me Wednesday night a seven year are they denying voice we can do see seat [noise]\nNot from on the frame very before he took his wife ... driven interviewed for a journalist and sausage rivers the twenty five years later they're conversation Peter drink which movie through there three thirty five even aren't going three\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guess is comedian and actor Phoebe Robbins and who hosts the podcast to dope queens with Jessica Williams they closed it together and they also have a series of four HBO specials by the same name and they have four more set for twenty Nineteen right city\nYes I'm so excited and now he has a new\nBook called everything's trash but it's okay you and your brother went to a private Catholic high school and he said you were one of two or three black students and the whole school and you were the only black person and you're graduating class what is your parents and you there\nI was the only black girl and my graduate oh okay okay yeah so there was four four ... four of us black students know graduating class I was only black girl I'm you know my parents\nAre huge into education and they are just like that is the key to everything they were like if you want to have like a really full happy like fulfilled life\nEducation is the way to go so they send us the Gilmore academy and it was my brother totally like excelled and you know was like an a student and like Mr popular and like ... truly just like rocked it out and I was\nA hot mess like like was such a slacker but yes I Know I'm going to go more than I was kind of like hosting and like not really like\nLiving up to my potential which infuriated them so much but yeah I they I think they just want us to have like all the advantages they could possibly give us in life and I think\nThough was kind of like a a crummy student there I think I did learn a lot like it did work study there so I think from like a young age like fourteen Fifteen I always like was learning you have to earn your keep you have to like work hard to be able to be in a place that you're you're in [noise] so when you weigh\nThe discomfort of being like the only black girl and you're graduating class with the fact that you probably did get a really good education ... um how does the balance come out\n[noise] I think you and I think it was worth it I Will say it would have been nice if there was another black girl\nAnd my great I think there was like one black girl in my class and there was one Indian girl and\nOne Asian girl and I'm sure will be you know not to be like it's nice to have like a matching that but it would it be nice if we can of each like you know looked across you know during math and saw someone else who look like us [noise] whenever we talk about like representation like diversity I don't think sometimes people\nFully understand how hard it is to not see yourself especially if you're living in society or culture where\nYou are so reflected at every possible turn\nI think it's hard to like um imagine what it's like to not have laughed and so you know I I Do think that like if there was like a ... queens that would've been\nA game changer for me to just like here to black women like young black woman oh well I'm thirty four but I'm like hey young black women [laughter] but you know to hear to like young black women talking about\nOh this one time I got my hair done at the salon and they did this to my hair and like totally like mess it up I couldn't talk about\nBy black hair woes and high school with like Laura\nShe doesn't know she doesn't she just wakes up and she has ... ... ...\nLike straight here like she didn't have to go through like what I had to go through and so\nI think in the end it worked out okay but I did have to do a lot of work on myself I did have to kind of like be OK\nWith being out numbered in a way and not letting that make me so sad and then also I think I was very lucky to be a child in the nineties with like ... or you know Martin Family Matters and girlfriends and all these sort of shows\nWhere you could still see you know like Tracy Ellis Ross or I could still see like ... or Kim Fields and be like oh okay cool so I could kind of see what I could be like if I was you know an older black woman you write about\nHow I was dating and I would just wait for someone asked me out and have no one asked me I just wouldn't day which is so ignorant and also leg huh what's he talking about you got a job you could ask people out so you know that's just really where I was and so\nYou know I think interracial dating is just really tricky for a lot of people because I think a lot of times people want to find a reason for why you're not dating within your tribe and\nI'm always just kind of like you just meet who you meet and if the timing is right like I met British bake off at a YouTube concert L O L truly like hilarious 'cause his band was over there for you to at the time and\nYou know we sort of hit it off like not eat like not even right away I was like I don't care about the guns they focus on you do but I can visualize British big office I kind of dope and then we just ended up dating from nearby again that\nWas not it just wasn't pre planned I like didn't even like really give him a second glance way\nI I met him so I mentioned that you and Jessica Williams hosts to Des Moines you have your own podcast I'm caught so many white guys and which you interview people as opposed to doing stand up\nAnd I interviewed you and I was really fun I really enjoy that a lot I was really glad I did\nThat um so how did so many white guys get its name\nWell because you know most podcast are hosted by white guys and then they interview other white guys and you're like cool\n[laughter] you're gonna have you're gonna have steak and eggs every day okay enjoy your life\nUm and so I just kind of wanted to be like I'm going to poke fun of like there's so many white guys but actually the thing is there's only one token white guy for a season the rest of the episodes are just women where people people of color and those are like the majority of the guests\nSo now that you're I'm starting to be cast in roles um do you look at the casting\nCalls or the equivalent and because um you write something very funny about that and and your first book but are there are kind of casting calls were you know know that they are not there are definitely like not entertaining idea of having a black person in that role like is there any kind of coded language that you can see\nWhen a black person would even conceivably be cast in the real\nThe lead [laughter] you're like oh so the leaves going to be ... [laughter] okay so I'm the best friend okay cool cool I got that\nYou want me to sound like this okay I'm not going to do that but I think there were two big things that I have you know when I started acting like pretty recently I had to have a conversation with myself before I even like going to my agents or whatever\nAnd I was always like I don't want to think was part of a wife answering a damn phone\nCall from her husband and giving him some motivation I don't want to do that I don't want to be on the other line being like you got this baby I have no ... no life\nI'm just at home holding unfolded laundry I Will never you will never see I I hate to use the word never but you will never see me on screen holding a basket of unfolded laundry I Will not\nDo it if you were living alone and doing your own laundry that would be perfectly fine\nThat's okay but if I'm like on the phone with Chaney Tatum and he's out you know freaking saving the president and I'm at home at stepping on a lego but folding his you know gym shorts that's not the part for me\nUm you know I think the language in it or a casting call is like\nAll American as whites beautiful but doesn't know it is white ah and then usually obey like open to all ethnicities is when you know that that is\nOh that's a robot so that they can envision someone not white doing it but it's like all the rules\nShould be open to ethnicity do you know what I mean like there there is no reason why it took you know twenty some odd years for that it'd be a crazy Rich Asians there's no there's no excuse for that\nThey could have been leads and romantic comedies this whole time and so whenever I see that stuff I always think about like ... and she's five as long as it's like not inappropriate in terms of language or sex is this a part that when she gets older\nWould I be embarrassed to show her that I did you know what I mean and so that's kind of always like sort of my needle and how I operate and it's it's hard being in an industry where\nYou know if you're not the mainstream sort of thing you're just not going to be considered but I think on the flip side what's great right now is that\nThis is an industry where creators shine where they can swim where you can have I can easily re you could have you know a Phoebe adjusted could do to to ... to have an ad in a lot of you can have all these sorts of people sort of just creating their own opportunities in our own lanes\nPhoebe Robinson it's just been great to have you on our show thank you so much\nTeri and honestly this has been a delight on my life and we got to hang out I Know we're supposed to see Bruno Mars together and we couldn't do it\nNo because we're both working so [laughter] yes let me know none of the deaf leopard who do you have on that one

...\nGreat to have you with us Ken Starr with us his new book contempt a memoir of the Clinton investigation\nMr star what about a sitting president or having to sit for a deposition in a civil lawsuit has happened to Bill Clinton question is whether you know President Trump would ever have to send that to be deposed in a civil\nAction you can do you think the president's ah shut to have to you know typically dissent against those cases while in office\n[noise] yes I Do uh Larry and uh the Supreme Court or the United states in a case arising out of the ... Jones a lawsuit and public\nOrban Jones alleged that that than a governor of Arkansas had a at a at a very um shall I say provocative\nWay uh had engaged in a sexual harassment and she was an employee of uh of the Arkansas state government\nAnd the president uh inter posed a defense and ... several defenses but the key one for this conversation I said the president I say should be immune during his or her presidency from a civil lawsuit\nI disagreed with that position I disagreed strongly with it and importantly the Supreme Court the United states unanimously rejected that proposition\nWhat stand to keep a sitting president from being tied up with a variety of of civil lawsuits at least until they're dismissed or Judy gated\nWell you're right that's the downside of uh our system where it's easy to to bring a lawsuit a and so there is that a concern that the president articulated but what he was seeking was something that the constitution does not provide the constitution provides\nA in terms of the policy of individuals being held responsible of that provides for immunity of four members of Congress is that in the house and the so called speech debate clause but\nThere's no such a provision to protect the president and one of the things by the way to judge Kavanaugh as the judge a road and this came out of the confirmation hearings that was a very I found helpful and illuminating discussion was this is an issue the very policy concerns Larry that you well articulate\nOr policy concerns that the Congress should take a thoughtful look at and perhaps grant some sort of temporary immunity but\nThe constitution does not if Congress wants to do that a then let it pass a law just as it's done for those who served in in a uniform called the soldiers and sailors really fact\nMr star at when you started in this position the investigation with one place then took off in their direction over allegations of of perjury and the president's deposition ... when he was asked about\nHis relationship with Monica Lewinsky do you have any regrets about pursuing that would you have any options with whether to pursue that or not\nI did not have an option of just letting the allegations are set\nAnd so what we did was and this one of the things Larry I describe in the book and I don't think that this part of the story is\nWell understood by the American people then or certainly not now we took the information that we have that the president was encouraging individuals to commit perjury there is about to commit perjury himself which he did\nUm and we took that to the attorney general the United states uh and she'd Janet Reno appointed obviously by President Clinton assessed that information and she made the determination that it had to be investigated she went to the three judge court that has appointed me and said we need to extend and expand\nA the a jurisdiction the author worthy\nOf the star investigations now include these new matters this is of course not made a public until until considerably later So Doug regret I have to come back to the regret is that a Larry I Wish Janet Reno had had\nA sort of reservists and national reserve unit so to speak that she could have called up\nAnd said you'd go investigate this can is trying to go to Pepperdine University\nI tried back in the spring of Ninety seven this is no gender da da\nAnd [noise] I was still looking forward to going to Pepperdine in the summer hopefully of Ninety eight that didn't happen or a bus in any event she I don't think had that option available so as a practical necessity I think she went to our investigation shit confidence in our investigation\nAre professionals and we'd already secured fourteen\nA criminal convictions and the Arkansas phase of the investigation uh that was unfortunate I Wish I had found no criminality in Arkansas but we certainly did\nA and had a very hard fought jury trial\nConvicting the president of the first lady's a a business partners and Hillary Clinton's client Madison guaranteed savings and loans owners shaves ensues and McDougal the sitting governor of the state\nSo anyway we had a track record we had a track record of professionalism and success so I don't think there was a practical alternative I regret that there wasn't\n[noise] we're talking with Ken Starr his new book contempt a memoir of the Clinton investigation\nUh what do you think is is I misunderstood about you buy the pop like I'm not much of this ... really designed to to tell your side of this you know what what do you think is the biggest from your\nPoint of view misconception about you\nThat uh parts of the investigation may not have been duly authorized a but they were off by the attorney general there were checks and balances in place so that the uh independent counsel yours truly was\nNot just investigating anything that I wanted to investigate that was a a misconception I was a misconception that was fostered by\nThe very effective communicators at the at the at the Clinton White house who like to suggest that this was a well the president used the term and his surrogates used the term this is a witch hunt and that brings us back to the very first question that it's very difficult to investigate a president\nAt one of the things that I Wish this was as a regret that then attorney\nGeneral Janet Reno did not rise up and to say look this investigation the Lewinsky phases one that I personally authorized so pleased got stopped saying that the investigation is out of control or whatever\nI think that would have been helpful and uh that uh alas did not happen and I think that\nContributes to this misunderstanding as to the nature of the investigation although I haven't even said now of a

mother that you felt were too upsetting to put in a book for young people\nI've been working on this book in one way or another since the early early to thousands and Everytime I Would sit down to write it I Would stop and hesitate because I Would I Would worry to myself well why don't people kind of thing and at first it was\nWhat are the people in the book going to think you know if I'm writing about them and um and I was shopping hesitate and then as my career grew in I became known as the the lunch lady guy I have a series of graphic novels about a lunch lady who fights ... crime and it's camping it's funny and\nI thought wow is this is writing a book on the subject matter going to be in such contrast to that [noise] those happy books that I Would be putting my career on the line [noise] um\n... as I traveled the country and I met more and more and more young people who are dealing with this I realize that there's a sort of a responsibility for me to write this book I mean\nYou know to go with a theme of comic books with a great power becomes great responsibility now I have an audience of these kids who grow up with my books I'm able to deliver the story in a very unique away\nAnd I and I feel like I owe it to these readers to to put myself out there\nI realize that if I if I was going to write memoir I had to just write it without any inhibition and I I wrote down the expression and I'll I'll censor this for the radio but I said right like you don't give an ass\nAnd not that I don't care about the craft or care about the readers but I Can't worry about negative opinions you know I have to just write this and put out there so there are some things I learned about my mother later on in life\nUm but I couldn't give some of that knowledge to that Seventeen year old protagonist because that would have really affected his relationship with his mother mhm and uh but there there is one particular scene a because I did have to explain\nHow really how my mother fully went away you know what would take this woman away from her two year old almost three year old son\nAnd this is something I learned as an adult\nAnd I was able to find a way to share that in the story but not give that knowledge to the protagonist and when I was when I was a toddler she was in a very abusive relationship and her boyfriend at the time came home and he and his colleagues had a drug deal gone bad and they'd murdered somebody\nAnd uh my my mother help them clean up and dispose of the evidence and and that's a big reason why she went away\nTo college you're heading that would have been seen as a child\nWas upsetting to me as an adult him and I learned about it right before the birth of my first child and so I kind of you know what let me just mentally shove that [laughter] so we can focus on being a dad to the human being that I don't know how to take care of\nAnd then um some years later you know when I was really digging in researching this book I realize narrative Lee\nI have to explain to the readers fully why she's going away for so long um\nYou know you don't go away that long for for shoplifting at the mall\nOr or for stealing batteries from a convenience store\nUm and I'll tell you like you might be the ... six or seven person I've ever so the ... how to Terry and I and I share that for those young readers out there who are dealing with heady issues at home so it took a long time for me to gain that courage to make this book\nNow I really understand why your grandparents insisted on getting legal custody of you 'cause they were afraid you'd become a word of the state\nExactly it that's exactly it and they were and they also are free and I would get hurt\nAnd what's interesting too is for it for\nYou know I have a daughter and she's she's nine she'll be ten soon ... and ... has been this sort of the forbidden fruit in our house I'm just really wanted to read it I was wondering about that yeah yeah and so you know imagine okay here here's your family history too you know child ah\nSo I sat down with her and I explained her a lot of the aspects of this book before she would read it and and also made sure she read it before the book was published do a classmate didn't come in and say oh I I Know this about your family and she didn't and so he is\nOf and she has such a big heart when she heard the story she immediately said well she probably went along with it because she was maybe afraid that she would get murdered or maybe they would murder you as a baby as well\nWell ... you know ... one of the stories you tell in the book is that when you started living with your grandparents were shot that they made breakfast free because even before you were three when you were living with your mother you wake up to an empty house and have to make your own breakfast\n[noise] that's true and uh I remember them telling me this and you know again sometimes things in that as an adult come at you and you learn about these different aspects of your your youth and this is an in the book because again this is something that um I Would have learned later\nI'm after my grandparents passed I created an art scholarship in their name but the Worcester art museum where I attended classes and to sort of kick start the scholarship and let people know this was happening I had an exhibit at the ... museum and it was also coincided with my ten year anniversary of getting published\nAnd a woman came through the line with her children and they suddenly got their book signed and after they got their book sign they you know a couple of steps away and they were chatting with their friends or they didn't realize they were with an ear shot at my wife Gina\nAnd this woman said you know the last time I saw him he was a baby and I was his mother's parole officer\nAnd I went on the house to do a wellness check and he was a baby crying alone in his crib by himself no one else in the house well there I was you know signing books so it's it's wild you know there was certainly moments when\nYou know I was more physical jeopardy than I ever realized but thankfully I had\nWhile I didn't have my birth parents take care of me I had other family members who took care of me as if\nThey were my parents [noise] All right let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my

'cause ask a best picture books and a graphic\nNovels for young adults his new book is a graphic memoir is called ... how I lost my mother found my father and dealt with family addiction his mother was a heroin addict his grandparents took legal custody of him when he was a turning three\nAnd this is a story of his childhood\nSo your grandparents sound like they were very loving toward you but that they had pretty graph personalities particularly your grandmother I Want you to describe how you draw your grandmother and how you draw your grandmother's cigarettes which are typically hanging from her lips\n[laughter] yes I my grandparents loved me so much and you know despite all of the trauma that I was surrounded by their their love floated me through life and they're just about a decade gone now and I still very much feel that love and I very much keeps me afloat [noise]\nThey were tricky people though you know um they drink quite a bit uh in fact they were\nThey were better when I was young then when my mother was\nYoung they they were my grandmother could at times be violently drunk um when she was younger I guess I could sum up my grandmother with this had come home from school\nAnd somebody wrong to me and I tell the story about how this kid wrong me she would take the cigarette out of her mouth and say just tell me to go on their hat [laughter]\nNo at the time\nI was in third grade and it sounds like such this like Great Depression World War two put down and here I Am in the eighties [laughter]\nAm I going to go back to school [laughter]\nThey were so lovingly crafts though you know they curse around but it was never directed towards me and I remember they want to say like you know we're okay if you Kurds but if you ever course at us you are in a significant amount of trouble young men you know [noise] um they smoke two packs a day each nah or and my grandfather\nJust be moans this movement of uh having places be non smoking you know airplanes you can't smoke on the plane like what an inconvenience to the point where she said Jesus Christ by the time I die I'm going to get to heaven and they're going to say sorry no smoke\n[laughter] he died of lung cancer you die yeah you'd actually well at eighty one\n[laughter] any outlive your grandmother by a couple of years there's often a heavy smoker also heavy smoker yeah and I should say to\n'em you know she she died the summer before my wedding and that unfortunately she died ah she got on a friday or my wife's wedding shower was that Sunday\nHeck you know is about his life as the child of a mother who was addicted to heroin she was absent during most of his childhood because she was in and out of rehab and also did time in prison before he turned three his grandparents assume legal custody they raised him\nSo let's get back to talking about your family um your mother was a heroin addict what age were you when you first visited her in a halfway house\nI probably was in kindergarten and and I and I say that just based on the fact that I remember being super obsessed with smart so I have photos of us visiting her at Christmas Time and and I was getting opening ...\nPresents and stuff and and also based on my teeth I mean I'm really looking back in my family photos and then looking at my children and where they are with losing getting teeth to try to try to pin down certain dates on how old I was at certain moments so you know I came to live with my grandparents\nAre just before my third birthday which was at Christmas Time they gained legal custody of me within the next year and so there are probably a couple of years where I just had zero contact with there was a very young child\nWhat was your understanding when you visited her at the halfway house was it was a halfway house or are we have personally\nI Believe it was a ... she didn't live there's a spectrum house and it wasn't er and what's interesting is some of I just had a a release party in a book signing for a kid on my own kind of western some old counsellors actually attended and identify themselves to me so I was able to thank them for taking care of her back then\nUm I Wonder what did you learn about her from them it was it was very very brief interaction um\nYou know I'm hoping to circle back in and get in touch with them if they can share what they can share with me but um I just remember how thrilled and excited I was to see her\nAnd then how devastated I was just separate from her knowing that she wasn't coming home with us and knowing that I had no idea when I Would see her next\n[noise] where are you afraid that you'd be using ... mother did and because she had grant grandparents drank a lot like how did that affect you and when you got old enough to consider alcohol or drugs yeah I I you\nKnow I always feared I Would fall into that those those same step so it was always very prudish about you know having a having a drink or anything like that and um [noise]\nI I knew addiction was in the family and it was hereditary\nAnd I I knew that it was dangerous territory to to dabble in things so uh you know come college remember my freshman year of college and I was at University of Hartford I wasn't it when I was going to design just yet\nI remember that you suddenly given this freedom when you're drinking all the time and I remember sort of hitting a wall of like ... like I'm I'm drinking almost every single day this is unhealthy this isn't good I Need to get out of the situation um because I don't want to fall into that same traps of the uh my my both my parents had stuff and addictions and\nTheir addictions on both sides so\nAh so I was always very wary and very careful of that and um\nYou know so ... ... because of\nMy mother I mean um my mother was a very talented artist and when she was incarcerated or we she would send me letters and she would draw cartoons for me and a big part of how we communicated for many years was um was through art so\nShe would draw say she would drive me Snoopy and then she would request I maybe I draw her the pink panther so then I Would draw her the pink panther and then I Would write back and request Garfield\nAnd I remember as a very young person seeing how talented she was\nBut she had such squandered that talent uh because of because of the drugs and and that really was my driving force to to want to get published you know I was I was meeting book proposals to publishers when I was a junior in college\nSo I'm the first cartoon that you had published is when you are a freshman go a lot of the store go [laughter] and the school newspaper with having a theme\nFor prom so it's like a prompt team and you submitted a prom cartoon that was published in the local western newspaper the telegram and cause that\nThis was an editorial cartoon contest that was all across the city for high school students and Mr ...\nWas so brave to submit this you know who taught at holy name central Catholic high school this comic of mine a was chosen to be printed in the in the city paper so such or when you go you read the first line I'll read the second kid line\nHey man you got any protection\nWhat times guns knives or condoms\nYeah that is so great and if it were amazing that they published that fewer high school freshmen so was that well it's a local paper that was the first place to publish any of your work is that the same paper in which your grandparents read that\nYour mother had oh deed and what's down face down on the sidewalk that's the same newspaper yeah I mean it was she survived the ... but um it was I'm sure horrifying for the family to read about this in the newspaper they they probably didn't know before they read about it right\nThey did and that wasn't the first time they they learn news about Leslie in the newspaper I mean that's something that happened quite frequently and that's something that happened to me and my adult life for for the last few years of her life really the only way I can keep track of her\nWas to go to the ... telegrams of Web sites and type in ... into the search field and find the latest court records\nOr if
