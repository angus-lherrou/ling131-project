you know but that's not conscious but it must be happening somehow\nSo at what point did you know a that is going to be the subject of my movie\nTrying to I had I had a good friend uh when I was going through the ... when my husband and I were in the process of doing our own you know artificial reproductive technology slash adoption by any means necessary approach to try and have a baby\nI had a friend a girlfriend her name's Rebecca and she's a documentary filmmaker and she was my confidant and when I spoke to her\nAbout what was happening she always said you know you should write the stuff down this would be really great material for a movie and I was horrified and just for poll students like that is never going to happen Rebecca I Would never write about this stuff\nAnd obviously now I have a movie and I should write about it and I don't know exactly when I thought it was legal uh emotionally legal for myself but I did notice and actually Rebecca is one of the people among my friends soon after my own struggle with trying to\nFigure out how to get a baby um a lot of people I knew were\nStarting to fall fall into that situation also so I felt like it was almost a mini epidemic among my friends\nUm and who were very specific kind of subset of New York people who had unusual lives sort of freelance\nLives that were writers and artists and filmmakers and journalists and they didn't have\nUm you know steady income and the same as nothing was regular that maybe they didn't have health insurance maybe they held on light not unlike the characters in the movie they held on to their you know New York existence by their fingernails because they don't rent stabilized apartment they had tiny apartments how are they going to start families they were\nPursuing their career and then suddenly they looked around and realize that they were\nYou know forty or over and\nOh my God we better you know what a you know they were arriving late to the table\nSo a spoiler on how many children do you have children I Do I have an eight year old who's almost nine is that near to him the most dedicated\nIt is [laughter] okay and you can look at I was before we always think nobody's going to that because like the very very end\nLike right before you know thinking New York state for letting us shoot here like no one's sticking around for that\nYou mind me asking if you adopted if you did I have yes\nWe did do we actually were pursuing not unlike the characters in the movie all the sort of differently [noise]\nWe were pursuing international adoption and ... simultaneously um and uh yeah we were doing those things at the same time it was kind of like whatever happens first wins and an IV F. one and we got pregnant and finally had mia Taylor who was my daughter\nTo the movie starts with the Catherine on character\nOn her bed in her bikini underwear lying on her hip but to kind of sexy pose\nBut what's really happening is that she's waiting for her husband to inject her was whatever the hormone is that she's getting at that moment\nAnd it's a great shot to show how what should be a very sexual process you know what I mean like yeah making love and then conceiving\nWhen you're having to go through fertility treatments it's it's like it's injections and pills and you know all this stuff that's like\nNot only not sexy but it also kind of is going to have an effect on your body because you're you're ingesting all these hormone yes yeah um and I said can you talk about that shock and you talk about like framing it as something that looks like it's going to be really sexual erotic it's not\nThere's also sounds so before you you kind of come into the senior hearing Paul and Paul has an amazing kind of whisper voice and she sang screwed over and you're hearing breath and it sounds sort of like a your overhearing kind of a bedroom\nScene and then you arrive and then it's a shot of Katherine slower hunch um you don't see any heads or it's not attached it's kind of her lower body a laid out on the bed and then Paul arrives above her and pulls her underpants down a ...\nBut to expose sort of her hunch and you see a wedding ring any lowers at and then he says are you ready and she says yeah he's like okay here we go and he starts counting one two three and you think they're going to like try some neurotic act\nBecause there's all there's preparation and instead he lifts up a hyper during the MEK needle and an interim muscular needle and you know spears it into her but and then you got wide and you see wow that is not a sex scene that as a medical situation\n[noise] and and to compare it to a pregnancy like instead of the has been put in his\nHand or the partner are putting their hand on you know the president belly feeling their baby inside he's kinda like stabbing her was needles in her belly and her and her head and I'm\n... ... ... again it's just\nNot the moment that you dream of when you dream of having a baby and that's going to be like it can\nLead ride that moment but that process is just so so different yeah\nIt it's pretty alienating in the body department I mean and then of course it's even taken to a new level when\nInstead of having your husband insemination you you're lying in a you know kind of a stir up some having a you know endocrinologist between your legs are with some strange catheter device saying okay let's get pregnant\nAnd uh it's not your husband it's the doctor [laughter] that's pretty strange too\nAnd you shoot those scenes in Mr ups [laughter] and the fertility clinic from the point of view Catherine ... who you're seeing the doctor you're seeing her legs on the steps through her point of view yeah there was one of you so many women have had so many times [laughter]\nUm yeah and I'm ... I actually have um the doctors don't come off very well in your movie was that your experience I actually had\nGreat doctors it's a very bizarre job um I Love Dennis O'Hara who played Dr ... and uh\nHe it's a weird job because there's a salesmanship I mean first of all you know it's not an indictment about the fertility industry um because the fertility industry makes amazing things occur but it's not an easy fix\nWell that leads to another scene that I Want to play the captain Han character is a writer and she has a new\nBook that's about to be published a novel that's called women's studies and her\nHer age and cause her and said have you seen the car and Catherine hon says no no no and so she runs through her email to open the PDF of the cover and she looks at the cover and she's horrified because the covers of you know Kevin has a feminist and the character and and in the novel\nA on the cover there's a woman\nAnd there's like white flowing dress and a field of like purple and green and\nIt's so quote feminine and like old fashioned feminine and so she's mortified and so here's the conversation she has with her husband afterwards or who's played by Paul Giamatti I should mention that as they're attacking she's finishing brushing her teeth\nAre so solar trade for what\nCollege is sending its ideology alive and I have a career in their\nHand out just send them
