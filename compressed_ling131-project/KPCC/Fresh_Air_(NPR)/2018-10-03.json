{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Is the degree to which Brett is not representing himself accurately not the behavior itself well\nI think Robin makes a good point here which is that it's the idea of lying under oath that really disturbs people I think\nPeople could overlook excessive drinking may be some crafts comments I've talked to people who said you know I did worse than bread did whatever it was but the idea that he would be untruthful about this a sitting judge\nWho's nominated for the Supreme Court that he would be dishonest and belligerent about these things on the stand in front of the nation in front of the Senate Judiciary committee\nReally oppose them ... that is the kind of thing where people say do you think like it's the cover up not the crime\nWhen all this reporting started the question originally but we were all asking was do Brett Kavanaugh commit these alleged acts of sexual assault and now the question is in the process of defending himself against those charges\nDo Kevin not knowingly mislead and to see the public and also members of United States Senate about what seem in comparison to those original allegations like smaller matters\nI think that's absolutely right I think you've got what is a very grave\nAnd relevance to character and ability to serve on the Supreme Court\nAccusations about an attempted sexual assault many years ago\nAnd then you have these behavioral aspects about drinking and possibly blacking out and whether he could stand up straight and\nBragging about her a NATO alumni club which may have seem like very marginal details even a week ago mhm but now they seem to be front and center in evaluating the truthfulness and really the fitness of this judge\nI think one area that we perhaps haven't dealt into enough is this idea of what being blackout drunk means I think that sometimes it's conflated with passing out and it's easy for Brett Kavanaugh to say that he doesn't have a memory of doing that or didn't do that there is a feeling among many people I talked to\nThat he was often in that condition so that some of these events which were so formative to those who experience them may have been meaningless or non existent to him and that is something that they you know fully entertain as possible\nAnd I'm hearing the same thing there was one alumnus I talked to\nWho said he actually believes both Christine Blasey Ford and he believes Brett Kavanaugh he thinks Brett Kavanaugh at least in terms of the lousy Ford accusation is telling the truth as he recalls that he thinks the missing link\nThat might help the connective tissue for the two accounts is the Kavanaugh at that time had an over drinking problem he blocked out and he truly doesn't remember ...\nSo now that there was an FBI investigation into Dr budget for the allegation or the people that you've been talking to Robin from Brett Kavanaugh's time of you are they saying what effect that FBI investigation is having on their decision to come forward and share their recollections\nI have several people who even have yet to share information with me who now said they're waiting to tell what they know to the FBI\nAnd then as these days have passed they've lost faith in the idea that they're going to hear from the FBI and in some cases some of them have taken it among themselves to reach out to the FBI on their own [laughter]\nSo you're saying that there are more stories about Brett Kavanaugh that we haven't heard yet and that they may be filtering through the FBI\nIt seems that there's more connecting the dots that could happen and that even now some of these sources are holding out hope\nThat it goes straight to the people evaluating\nJudge Kavanaugh for this position rather than through the press and threw me as a reporter but that they are going to come back to me if they don't end up feeling satisfaction about the fact that the FBI is taking their concerns and experience and stories seriously\nAnd ... what are your sources telling you about the FBI investigation and how it fits into their feeling compelled to come forward\nI'm hearing similar things to what Robin is I'm hearing that people would prefer to talk to an FBI\nAgent than to me and that they want to see this process done thoroughly behind the scenes without necessarily introducing things into the public realm that could be damaging before they're properly evaluated in the right context\nI Do know of people as well that had been expecting their phone to ring and it hasn't so there is a frustration that this is not\nBeing done in a terribly thorough fashion\nThink that when you talk to people who went to college with him there is this concern now that if the Senate Judiciary committee and the FBI are unable to kind of pin down the facts and prove out the stories\nThat that becomes the litmus test for judge cabinets fitness one in fact the question now is larger\nAnd it has to do with whether his character is worthy or whether it's on the truth and whether he's telling the truth\n\nRobin Kate thank you very much and thank you thank you\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWith the FBI investigation

Stevens\nGround is I'll have to be chanting we want to have a knowledge President Trump address a political rally there late Tuesday president mocked the woman accusing\nTo the presidential administration the office of the science advisor the plan is according to an anonymous source that the New York times reported on the plan is to eliminate that job altogether\nDoes that fit into the themes that you've seen in the three departments that you write about\nWell you know it's funny because the broad impulse so the Trump Administration has been just not to fill the jobs I mean the top seven hundred jobs in the administration\nHalf of them are still on the field and the ones that are filled are filled often very Ali by people who don't have the expertise for the job so I Would say the broader pattern is one of just general neglected misunderstanding\nOr there's no question that Trump has been specifically hostile to environmental regulation and to the idea of climate change\nAnd it's pretty clear that the reason he's off the oil is he's got he's backed by by fossil fuels people um and where you do find places in ... in in my stories where\nWhere you can see the hand that handed work either removing climate change data for websites are filling jobs that would be specifically addressing\nClimate and the environment with people who are totally inappropriate for the job so for example ah in the agriculture department the chief scientist the person who's in charge of distributing the three billion dollars a year the agriculture department distributes to for basic research\nThis research is done is done now almost entirely to find ways to adapt the food supply to climate change um I mean it's ... it's ... it's absolutely critical is not going to be done in the private sector\nThey head of his job to a right wing talk show radio host or who had backed trumping I mean it's just that kind of thing is going on throughout the administration [noise]\nSpoken to fresh air is Dave Davies about a year ago after your second article on how Trump is running the federal government was published in Vanity Fair and and with the navy focused on the department of energy and agriculture you've added in your book the department of commerce and want to take a look at that\nAnd you're right that the department of commerce has very little to do it directly with commerce and if in fact forbidden by law from engaging in business and you say that the department of commerce should really be called the department of information or the department of data why\nBecause that's what it does it's you know inside of the department of commerce you have\nThe census for example which is the best picture we have of ourselves as a society you have the a collection and assimilation of all the economic statistics and above all more than half the budget of the department is spent gathering weather and climate data I mean the national weather services inside the department of commerce\nAnd one of the great opportunities that exists with the federal government is the the better use of the day that collects all of a sudden we're able to parse the date in in ... and use the data in ways we've never been able to use it\nAnd that's a seemingly something that the that the person that Trump put in charge of the Commerce Department Wilbur Ross is not interested in ... he sees the job is kind of like cheap trade negotiator which is odd because we have achieved trade negotiator\nAnd one of the big like ... data pool that um the Commerce Department is responsible for is the U.S census\nAnd the head of the Commerce Department Wilbur Ross is not now involved in a lawsuit pertaining to a question on census um I I don't know if there's a definitive or not the question on the twenty Eighteen census whether it's on there and\nWhile they're still is still argument about whether they're going to insert on the steps is a question of establishing whether the person who's reply to this as a citizen what we'll do is we are the responses to the census\nLet's let's talk about why because a lot of people will be afraid to answer that\nQuestion will be will be will be afraid to answer the question or people will be suspicious of the motives of the census takers\nRight and ... and a lot of immigrants live with somebody who isn't here legally so even if you're here legally if you know someone who isn't you might be afraid to say that you're an immigrant\nI think at this point that even people who are here who are legal who are fearful mhm though actually back up a second they haven't even the gun to prepare them for the census I mean the the the real problem with the census is that it's way behind schedule and it hasn't been budget it for\nSo there's some question whether they're going to be able to pull off the census in the first place but then how you pull it off\nIs another question in there and studying this they're inserting a question that seems designed to dissuade especially Latino from answering it\nAnd one of the consequences if Latinos are underrepresented in the census\nFor starters you don't get a picture a correct picture of the ... congressional districts so we're districts need to be with redrawn because of shifting in the population they won't be redrawn\nOf late one of the things we've learned is just how valuable the data the government collects is researchers have been doing things with this data that they've never been able to do before and so for example\nUm we wouldn't know that there was an opioid crisis in the country if the data on prescription drugs had not been made available and not been possible\nIf we don't have a picture of what the society looks like there's all sorts of misunderstanding of the society that will occur\nSo the people suing Wilbur Ross the plaintiffs include over a dozen states in big cities who say that he acted improperly and trying to add this question about are you um\nAre you a U.S citizen I'm that he acted improperly and trying to add that to the census\nAnd the states and cities fear their political representation will be calculated incorrectly because they will be missed represented in the sense is if this question discourages immigrants from answering so\nWilbur Ross ... did you were you surprised at the choice of him to head the department of commerce since as you say commerce has more to do about data and I don't want to sound ages here but I'm data and how it's collected and how it's interpreted has is changing so rapidly\nAnd I have no idea if he's kept up with what data means anymore\nWell we know he was falling asleep in meetings where he was supposed to be learning about the department and I know that the people who try to explain to him how the department worked came away and these were Republicans who who are brought in to try to explain how the department work to him\nFound that he was really utterly disinterested in anything but trade so even if he was an eighty he just wasn't particularly interested in the mission of the department an additive at\nWhat became very curious is that the exposure of his finances they put them in a bad odor with the White House you know he had to declare as financial holdings ... when he was nominated for\nThe job and it turned out he had two billion dollars less than the Forbes rich list a calculated him having and four of us who watches this investigation discovers that he'd been lying to the fore rich list all along\nWhich then apparently caused Trump to think a lot less of him but he you know he is an odd choice he's very odd choice because with that department really needs is someone who's really comfortable with technology\n[noise] well if you're just joining us my guess is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist risk and the book is about the federal government under President Trump and the book looks at the energy agriculture and commerce departments\nWe're going to take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air\nI'm Suzanne ... on the next MORNING EDITION among some pre and

helping Korean parents understand developmental disabilities and how to get their kids the help they need that story for the rest of the day's news on\nMORNING EDITION we faced 'til nine on eating I point free keeping the the [noise]\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis he's best known for his books like money ball the big short and the undoing project all of which have been bestsellers his new book the fifth risk is about the federal government under Trump and it examines the energy agriculture\nAnd commerce departments now among and there's so much attention being paid to what's happening in the White House and to the mother investigation and now to um the Kavanaugh confirmations story\nAnd not as much attention is being paid what's happening on the cabinet level on a department level and I'm Wondering if there's a lot of action happening in the department level like the three departments you write about you know agriculture commerce energy\nThat most of us aren't paying that much attention to even though it's it's being reported on\nBut it's not it never seems to be like the sexiest story\nAnd never will be and that's the problem I mean it's like where society of distracted drivers we're not paying attention to the thing that matters most\nThere is this enterprise that is not a tree we had a prize the biggest ... ... ... doesn't function without the government government is is it's been subjected to decades and decades of of abuse and scorn in his collected rough\nWas by law the outgoing administration is required to prepare for the transition\nAnd by law anybody who's likely to get elected the cat is the two major parties are required to prepare to receive the the briefings\nAnd Christie saw this and he saw that the person that Trump's campaign said nothing about government and so he called Corey Lewandowski was running a campaign said look I'll go do it if no one else will because we really need someone someone who understands government to get involved\nIt surprised me that after learning that the Trump Administration had nobody who could fill this role in didn't seem to care very much about filling this role that Christie was still so in support of Trump and wanted to run their transition\nI think there are a couple of things going on at once one is as Christie makes quite clear but as other people have pointed out\nSub didn't run into when he he didn't have an acceptance speech on the other night of the election he was running for as an exercise in brand building\nAnd so his whole attitude towards preparing to be president was why bother and when people told him he had to spend money\nEither his money or campaign money to build a transition team he'd become furious and when you heard it was millions of dollars each scream at one point he said to ... you know if we win you and I can leave the victory party two hours early and figure out everything we need to figure out about the government\nSo that we're above that smart\nYeah let's say if that's right so this is another theme that underlies all of this and that in the Trump operation the presence of rich people from an especially and Jared Kushner there's this sense that\nThey both think that because they're rich they must be smart but the combination of not wanting to spend the money not actually thinking he's going to win\nAnd not being really interested in the subject at all leads Trump's to neglect the transition effort\nBut this is where it gets curious Christie does wrangle a few may raise a few million dollars to abide by the federal law any bills actually I think a quite good transition they had hundreds of people who were really qualified to go into the various departments and\nReceive the government from the ... the Obama administration is so the bottom and missed ration has has built this great course and how the government works it's it's you know hundreds of briefing books have been compiled over the past year\nAnd it's not an ideological briefings you give the same briefing whether the Democrat or Republican wins\nAnd it it really is just explaining how they dealt with problems\nAnd so you understood so this is how we dealt with does equal virus so if you have another pandemic or through a threat of pandemic here's how you might do it you might disagree with how we did it but but this is how we did it and an awful lot of what's supposed to go on there is just that this is these are the problems this is what this department does\nThis is how you do it and Trump took all those people who are meant to receive those briefings and fired them the day after the election so we had nobody to go into these places to receive the briefings why did he fire them\nGreat question the simple short answer is that Jared Kushner told into and the jar cushion that did not like the idea of Chris Christie running the operation because Chris Christie as as a prosecutor in New Jersey had put cushion his father in jail\nBut that really doesn't explain it I don't say because there was no reason Trump had to listen to cushion there and there's also no reason you couldn't have just fired Christian kept everybody else on board\nI think what happened was that a number of people who are in Trump's ear and especially Michael Flynn\nWho wanted to be the national security advisor\nOr were left off the list of people who are going to get jobs important jobs and the government and they were left off the list because the transition timid vet it all these people and found the problems with them\nSo some of those problematic people wanted important jobs in government and they persuaded Trump to get rid of this operation that was going to forbid them from having them\nI think that's what happened in a couple that with that is a ... was Trump's total disdain for an indifference to the government I mean if he had any awareness of the complexity operation he was about\nTo have to run a unit terrified to get rid of the people who are going to help them do it but he really I think he really thought I just don't need to know about that\n[noise] so was there like a last straw for Chris Christie that got him fired\n[noise] I think what happened was this that they allowed Chris Christie to build this transition team because Christie explained it was a law they had to do what they didn't have any choice Trump pay no attention didn't take it seriously was irritated when every heard money was being spent\nBut no one really focused on it because no one thought it was ever going to be used that they didn't think they were going to win so Jared Kushner although he oversaw it kind of closely\nAnd made sure that Christie wasn't doing anything he didn't approve of didn't ever really imagine that Christie was going to be in a position of real authority because Donald Trump is not going to win the minute it became real they focused I think it was he was never going to be allowed to do the job because but they never thought the job was going to be done\nIf you're just joining us my guess is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist risk and the book

primarily\nOn stage theatre and concert dance votes on Broadway off Broadway and internationally and as different obviously than you know film and TV but the theater community has embraced a surveys and getting feedback from the audience as well and in my experience it\nYou know it often can create something of a a Frank and musical or drink and he played it doesn't feel you can feel that there are thousands of people's input\nInto this is rather than the creative genius visions staying true to what it is for better or for worse\nAnd does that happen even in non profit smaller theatre I mean certainly we can imagine where you've got a you know commercial theater you've got investors very concerned about the risk involved but you find that even I'm at the university nonprofit level\nAt the university level not so much because we're not facing the same exactly like you said we don't have investors and all that\nWe the the way that the feedback would work in that case is more like seasons election what kinds of shows are we interested in as well as regional subscription houses are going to try to obviously please their base with the shows that they use but not so much the content within the use of cells\nSo is your concern a particularly ... subscriptions which are kind of the bread and butter cause the consistent revenue for nonprofit the or the concern is that they'll just end up doing the same kinds of shows that get positive feedback and not really fulfill their artistic mission\nThat does seem to happen unfortunately a lot of the time there are some really you know injected a theaters and urges addresses around the country\nWho will buck against that and a lot of time does end up being the trailblazers of theater ... you know the one in San Diego for example\nUm

just for polston like that is never going to happen Rebecca I Would never write about this stuff\nAnd obviously now I have a movie and I should write about it and I don't know exactly when I thought it was\nLegal uh emotionally legal for myself but I did notice and actually we're back is one of the people among my friends soon after my own struggle with trying to figure out how to get a baby um a lot of people I knew were\nStarting to fall fall into that situation also so I felt like it was almost a mini epidemic among my friends um and who were very specific kind of subset of New York people who had unusual\nLives sort of freelance lives that were writers and artists and filmmakers and journalists and they didn't have um you know steady income and\nThe same as nothing was regular that maybe they didn't have health insurance maybe they held on light not unlike the characters in the movie they held on to their you know New York existence by their fingernails because they don't rent stabilized apartment they had tiny apartments how are they going to start families they were\nPursuing their career and then suddenly they looked around and realize that\nThey were you know forty or over and oh my God we better you know what a you know they were arriving late to the table\nSo a spoiler on how many children do you have children I Do I have an eight year old has almost nine is that me it to him the most dedicated\nIt is [laughter] okay and you can at eyes [laughter] before we always think nobody is going to say that because like the very very end like right before you know thinking New York state for letting a shoot here like no one's sticking around for that [noise]\nUm so I always thought it was so buried no one would notice now I have to stick around to the end of the credits that I can come from it's ... yeah\nShe was at Lincoln Center last night we I mean the movie premiered at the New York\nFilm festival last night and so which was a huge like fantasy of mine because I've been going to the New York ... festival as a total\nLike nerdy young film person forever and never had a movie there and last night was the first\nTime and it was super exciting and actually no it was an audience but I did an eye on stage I was thinking everyone and then I said something about knowing that kind of it's like she's here isn't she and someone yelled out no and it was her [laughter] that was out there but of course she was there and yeah we got three songs from her which was really great\nDo you mind me asking if you adopted if you did I have yes\nWe did do we actually were pursuing not unlike the characters in the movie other sort of differently [noise]\nWe were pursuing international adoption and I've yet to simultaneously um and uh yeah we were doing those things at the same time it was kind of like whatever happens first wins and an IV F. one and we got pregnant and finally had mia Taylor who was my daughter\nOkay we'll talk about that moral [laughter] a ventilator let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us I guess just hemorrhaging and she wrote and directed the new film private life it opens in theaters and will be on Netflix starting this Friday we'll be right back this is fresh air\nOn Sunday Brazilians vote for their next president and polls suggest many women are not happy with the choice\nYou've had enough and not only women vote yells you mean the community and all minorities in the world and feel like\nThey are not represented in politics\nI'm Ari Shapiro women are protesting Brazil's leading candidate with the hashtags not hear that story on the next all things considered from NPR News we take the poor on eighty nine point three key PCC\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is camera Jenkins she wrote and directed the new film private life during Paul Giamatti and Catherine on as a couple of trying to conceive each of them having problems with fertility so they're trying alternate means ivy F egg donor\nKind of you name it [laughter] and adoption um\nSo it's a comedy but it gets to like really serious issues within about marriage and about all the complications of trying to conceive [noise]\nUm she also made the savages and slums of Beverly Hills so the movie starts with the Catherine on character\nOn her bed in her bikini underwear relying on her hip but to kind of sexy pose\nBut what really happening is that she's waiting for her husband to inject her was whatever the hormone is that she's getting at that moment\nAnd it's a great shot to show\nHow what should be a very sexual process you know what I mean like yeah making love and then conceiving when you're having to go through fertility treatments it's it's like it's injections and pills and you know all this stuff that's like\nNot only not sexy but it also kind of it's going to have an effect on your body because you're you're ingesting all these hormone yes yeah um and I said can you talk about that shock and you talk about like framing it as something that looks like it's going to be really factual erotic it's not\nAnd there's also sounds so before you you kind of come into the senior hearing Paul and Paul has an amazing kind of whisper your voice and she sang screwed over and you're hearing breath and it sounds sort of like a your overhearing kind of a bedroom\nScene and then you arrive and then it's a shot of Catherine's lower hunch\nUm you don't see any heads are you it's not attached it's kind of her lower body a laid out on the bad and then Paul arrives above her and pulls her underpants down a little bit to expose sort of her\nHunch and you see a wedding ring any lowers at and then he says are you ready and she says yeah and he's like okay here we go and he starts counting one two three and you think they're going to like try some neurotic act\nBecause there's all there's preparation and instead he lifts up a hyper during the make needle and an inter muscular needle and you know spears it into her but and then you got wide and you see wow that is not a sex scene that as a medical situation\n[noise] and and to compare it to a pregnancy that instead of\nThe has been put in his hand or the partner are putting their hands on you know the president belly feeling their baby inside he's kinda like stabbing her was needles in her belly and her\nAnd her head and I'm a ... ... again it's just it's not the moment that you dream of when you dream of having a baby and what that's going to be like it can lead ride that moment but that process is just so so different yeah\nIt it's pretty alienating in the body department I mean and then of course it's even taken to a new level when\nInstead of having your husband insemination you you're lying in a you know kind of a stir up some having a you know endocrinologist between your legs are with some strange catheter device saying okay let's get pregnant\nAnd uh it's not your husband it's the doctor [laughter] that's pretty strange too\nAnd you shoot those scenes in the stir ups [laughter] and the fertility clinic from the point of view Catherine ... figure skating the doctor you're seeing her legs on the steps through her point of view of you out of use so many women have had so many times [laughter]\nYeah um yeah and I'm ... I actually um the doctors don't come off very well on your movie was that your parents I actually had great Dr ... it's a very\nBizarre job um I Love Dennis O'Hara who played Dr ... and uh\nHe it's a weird job because there's a salesmanship I mean first of all you know it's not an indictment about the fertility industry um because the fertility industry makes amazing things occur but it's not an easy fix\nTrying to have a baby has become like a full time job for each of them it's emotionally draining and it's raining their savings to and it's become a source of friction in the relationship\nI think it's fair to say than in your movie you give pretty equal weight to how the husband and wife are experiencing trying to conceive or to adopt and they they each have their own like emotional crises that they have to go through\nAnd I think it's interesting that you did that you didn't just try to do the woman's point of view and have the man be like totally and comprehending and and cold and you know not going not going through his own issues\nYeah I Love I like I'm Glad you said that and I love Paul's portrait\nOf I'm Richard her husband and I think when I set out to do it I remember thinking to myself oh this is a mutual midlife crisis\nThis is happening to both of them and in a way sometimes I think of it like a buddy movie and I did this was the savages too when you're writing some thing that's so character driven sometimes you need to create order in your brain because it's not a genre\nAnd I remember thinking with is that it was like a buddy movie\nAnd instead of getting in a car and driving across the country I don't know a bank heist or something they're getting in a car and driving through like infertility land was important to me that it was a mutual\nI don't know crisis that it wasn't just her problem or I mean they're both falling apart they're they ah you know as they're heading up against the limitations of being a human being simultaneously it's not just her\nOne of the differences though is that it's the woman at the gas in ... character who's getting these hormonal injections that are affecting her mood they're affecting her whole like body balance so I think that that's\n\n... ... calls here emotionally incompetent [laughter] no no no incontinent continents ... yes because she says oh my God my shrink cut her really weird name for it I think I Can't imagine that often and I know it's emotionally incontinent and that's why\nThe said a character goes ooh gross oh that's great oh that's funny yeah so did you go through that of feeling like you you didn't understand your own emotions that they were kind of a little out of control for you yeah I mean\nFor taking hormones I mean I think that just even if you weren't taking hormones or if the hormones themselves didn't make you feel like that the process of going through the\nYou know going through ivy out for ... is so bizarre that psychologically it's upsetting and then on top of it\nYou're injecting yourself with hormones that make you feel crazy and weird and it's just such a non natural ... nothing as Paul later says there's ... there's been nothing natural about this so far [noise]\nWhy should we start now I mean it's so not natural that it does you and um but you know there's a lot of indignities on the mail from the male point of view too I mean because you're saying oh but she has all the injections he sits in a collection room where he's you know expected to produce a sample\nUm and that's pretty demoralizing and then he has Berman blockage and has to go through some procedure it's off screen but that has to do with some kind of biopsies in his testicle I mean it they're they're getting it from both ends\nYou know when he has to do the sperm donation he's watching really awful [laughter]\nI think really cheap awful porn and it looked like that was supplied by the fertility clinic is that right\nYeah well they that's what they do that's always such a bizarre like if you go you know you open a drawer at a doctor's office and stuff with porn magazines that just seems like somebody actually to go out and go shopping for those and bring them to the office like that's a you know that's [laughter]\nThat's medicine I don't know it's you know a medical office and somebody has to go pick up\nGo down the street and pick out some porn magazines and some videos\nUploaded money's just like rolling his eyes instead of getting a rouse [laughter] he's rolling your eyes at the point I I was hoping I'd find something better do you know [laughter] like something yeah yeah it's not very good call is not ready to call it yeah [laughter] okay um so um during the process of when\nTrying alternate path of either conceiving do various fertility treatments or of adoption did you have to ask yourself what would it mean for a child to really feel like your child\nYeah um but then I think something kind of takes I mean there is this presumption as a heterosexual couple that you have all the equipment to do this old fashioned thing which is to you know give birth to a child that represents\nHalf of you and half of your partner and when it is taken away for some reason\nI think it's traumatizing at first and then I think kind of like the characters in the movie you tip toed towards different ideas of what it's really about is it about\nGiving birth to a baby or is it about becoming a parent\nUm what is that what is the end goal and it it just starts changing and shifting I always find it really interesting when people like in the movie I there's like a lot of I don't know if the right word is comedy of manners or like\nWhen people are just saying oh my God I don't know why why why don't they just adopt and just as always tell us I was like oh my God why would they be going through this why don't they just adopt as if adopting is just the easiest thing in the planet\nLike oh you just go out to you know target and pick up a kid or something it's very difficult to adopt I mean it's complicated um egg donation is complicated IDF is complicated every way you have to get a baby that isn't lying in bed and having sex is complicated and people are so judgmental\nFrom the outside like well why don't they just adopt there's all these children out in the world that need adoption and nobody says that to people that go and have sex nobody climbs into their head and say oh no why are you having sex right now\nTo have a baby 'cause there's all these unwanted children out there you should go you know it's so presumptuous it's so um [noise] it's so interesting and it's such a hot button thing for people I remember when my husband and I were in the throes of our fertility stuff\nRealizing that the people that I should be talking to the most for comfort and perspective we're all my gay friends\nBecause any of my gay friends that were trying to have babies had to pursue complicated arrangements to get their kids they didn't have the opportunity to just lie in bed and have sex and have a baby so that was so normalized and gay people that want to have babies that I really was like this is where I should hang out\nI shouldn't hang out with all the header as [laughter]\nHave had such a great way where they can get drunk in line bed and have sex and I have a baby I'm just hanging out with all my gay friends because they know what this feels like because they have to figure out\nAn unusual path to getting a child not the you know old fashioned way let's put it that way so I really found like that was a safe place to be like a and it gave me a lot of perspective\nIf you're just joining us my guest is hemorrhaging and she wrote and directed the new film private life which shares Paul Giamatti and Catherine hon
