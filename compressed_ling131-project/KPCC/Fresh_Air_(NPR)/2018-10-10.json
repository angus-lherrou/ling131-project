edu\nFrom WHYY in Philadelphia and Terry Gross with fresh air\nToday how Paris governments political campaigns even street gangs are using social media to push propaganda and disinformation and here\nWith the real world consequences like how could the W. singer and Emerson working authors have like war the weaponization of social media that explain how fake social media accounts and bonds masquerading as humans hijack\nSocial networks algorithms pushed messages into news feed and make\nThem ... it's about one third of the online conversation related to ... that were these artificial voices even just a couple of months ago the Mexican election same percentage of of course they played a huge impact in the American twenty sixteen election many people think it's going to do the same in the upcoming vote\nAnd John Powers using new movie based on the story of the ... eleven terrorist attack on a summer camp in Norway [noise]\nFirst news\nLive from NPR News in Washington on child Snyder mandatory evacuations have been ordered for more than a hundred thousand people on Florida's panhandle hurricane Michael remains a category three storm but\nAnd you had this wonderful double effect where at the local level\nIraqi soldiers are looking down at their smartphones and they're seeing a what seems like an ISIS victory playing out on the screens in their hands\nAnd then it becomes one ah causes them to decide to run away this um army that's much larger backed by the most powerful military in the world the U.S military as tanks it as helicopters and the like and yet ah what's playing out on social media\nChanges the dynamics of the battlefield but simultaneously that it changes the way the rest of us look at the world and fear it you get this phenomena where more Americans are afraid of terrorism at that point then they were in the weeks after nine eleven\nAnd so it shows the power of social media and how it can sort of rewriting the narrative\nAnd then turn that incident as leverage it into a plane out with impact on our own politics as part of the changes in the twenty sixteen election\nYou also cite an example from another part of the world's where a social media can lead to an can affect a events on the ground and this is in Chicago where social media taunts interacts with gang gang violence in ways that can be deadly you want to give us an example of that\nSure we tell the story of a ship on Thomas who had grown up from an early age interested in music\nAnd was a very successful emerging rapper ... outside of Chicago but unfortunately he'd also been drawn into the gang scene he was a gangster disciple and they wanted everyone to know it\nSo he often across Instagram YouTube would broadcast his affiliation with the disciples and he was the subject of not one or two but three assassination attempts by rival gang members he survives the first two\nAnd as he survives rather than you know are thinking twice or maybe laying low for a bit he posts bold new videos on YouTube physically challenging these folks that come at him again\nWhat we've seen in a gang violence across this country is that much of that has migrated to social media\nBecause so much of being in a gang is about face and it's about fronting\nIt matters a great deal if someone say finds your Facebook it to counter trolls you or a leaves a disrespectful Instagram comment and something else that's happened as this gave violence moves to social media is that it also means that violence is no longer\nWho's few day for a particular block but gangs are the same franchise even if there are many miles apart might start fighting each other over something that originated on line\nSo so if someone calls you out on line you're going to respond and it may not it may be on line but it may also be on the street right\nAnd that's the difference between a gang feuds in the past is if two people ... yelled words or the other in the street I'm only the people around them would hear it and the moment would be done if you posted online\nThe whole world is watching at least in their perception and it sticks up there until something is done about it and that's why it's at the origin of so many of these uh fights and not just\nA eighty percent of fights in school sparked from something on line but also of course the state of gang killings\nAnd what's interesting in a little bit scary is that we see the same phenomena of Internet beef at the gang level moving up to levels of drug cartels all the way to how it's changed a diplomacy how it's changed politics\nWe have this question of what happens when leaders of nations are interacting in the same way when they're having these beliefs in front of the world\nWill make it harder for them to negotiate if the whole world knows that they've been insulted and they've done nothing about it\nYou have an interesting kind of look at ... at the development of mass communications you say that the Internet is the most consequential communications development since the invention of the written word and that it really got super charged when everything could be\nDone on smartphones and\nThere are many examples where social media has have been used to fuel popular uprisings the most striking example in the Arab Arab Spring and the time a lot of people talking about social media is being this powerful democratizing force I mean now you know expression is in the hands of everyone\nThe trouble is the authoritarian regimes also had access to the tool how did they strike back\nTheir spring was probably the high point of the techno optimism about the Internet and social media you have everything from a national media sources describing it's a liberating power to people in Egypt are literally naming their kids Facebook but then\nAuthoritarians figure it out they figure out how to fight back um we use this idea of like war to express that there's two sides to it and so there's always a back and forth and so we've seen is that authoritarian to figure it out also how to use social media\nAnd a couple of key ways one is that it gives them a new way of monitoring their population and what they're thinking of what they're saying ah for example there's the question on line or does reach we equal endorsement\nWell now we finally have the answer a the example we use as a journalist and turkey who reach wheat something or just for a couple of minutes before he takes it down and yet it lands and a Turkish prison so governments can use the power of the law to monitor\nThen you have this new model that China is presenting which um is this almost a perverse incentive system it's called the social credit system where essentially all your different online activities everything from what you say to a what you buy\nCan all be monitored and has brought together and to a single score of your social trustworthiness so for example or if you buy diapers your score goes up because you're a good parent if you play video games too long your score goes down because you're screwing around\nThat score than is used to uh give you rewards and society everything from a free\nCharges of your smartphone at coffee shops to a negative side you can't take planes it's used in job evaluations it's even used in dating profiles affects uh how attractive the person you're going to be able to go on dates or even Mary\nAnd I what's notable about this what goes in a way that or will never could've imagined\nIs the network side of it your score reflects not only what you do but what everyone else in your network does so if for example your brother is not being positive enough about the regime online your score will go down so then you'll go to your brother and say hey you know get it together\nAnd this is this a strange way of using technology in essence to steer us to a behavior that at least in China the government wants\nSo people who who have phones and do a lot of social media will have a social credit score the aim is so that eventually everyone will get one\n\nThe goal of it is to achieve a what's known as mass control to steer an entire population towards a certain direction\nIt's not just the idea that um you will have your online activity but the government will force you to have this kind of Internet presence or for example there are certain places in China where there are police checkpoints physical checkpoints where they will check your smartphone to ensure that you have the votes that allows monitoring of you\nWrite and just just to get a sense of the region does I mean do we know how many people now have social credit scores in China is it hundreds of thousands tens of millions\nI Believe it's tens of millions this is a gradually escalating process with a couple of different companies that are doing this piecemeal but it's the stated intent of the Chinese Communist party that this will be a unitary score in place for every Chinese internet user of which there about eight hundred million by the year twenty twenty\nWell the other fascinating story you tell about China is they realize how commentary on social media can affect opinion and so they have ... and a large army of people whose job it is to comment favorably on the government policies right\nThat's right and it is a very large army I started out in the tens of thousands moved to the hundreds of thousands and now one estimate has it as high as three million of these are folks who are known as part of the the fifty cent army\nAnd their job uh and it it has its own training programs in a credit station systems their job is to monitor and infiltrate political conversations on we chat another Chinese platforms and basically cede positive things about the Chinese government\nEmerson broken writes about conflict in social media he was recently a research fellow at the council on Foreign Relations VW singer is a strategist at New America at a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\nWill continue our conversation in just a moment this is fresh air\n... see see we want you to know how when and where to vote and all the issues in Canada and that's why we've got the K BCC voter game plan you vote for that stuff you\nKnow for the California report comes from the California health care foundation with a new partnership C section and other maternity care ratings for local hospitals are now available on yeah [noise]\nGerman girlfriend and what's interesting is that when reports then circulate online that Angie as a fake cheese and\nThe tax the people going after her basically to say that they're part of this a conspiracy theory and you get this strange outcome where her fake messages get greater traction than the messages debunking her famous\nSo Andrew Jackson was a fake but she attracted\nA lot of ... quite a following on social media was that because she was so compelling or was it because there were many many other fake accounts or robotic accounts that were re tweeting or stuff so\nAnd she was a ... she was a machine voice masquerading as a human on line\nAnd each of those as powerful in and of themselves but where they gain their true power is creating what are known as ... nets so for example a Angie was only one of at least sixty thousand Russian accounts in a single ... that infects Twitter almost like a cancer\nAnd its war being and twisting the American political dialogue\nBut what's fascinating is that it's not just about persuading the targets it's about hijacking the network's own algorithms so these botnets Dr viral\nDifferent points of view that didn't push that up into the news feed it makes them trends to people even outside those networks begin to see them\nAnd the impact of this can be seen in examples that range from a brags that\nAbout one third of the online conversation related to ... that were these artificial voices to or even just a couple of months ago the Mexican election same percentage one third where these artificial voices and of course they played a huge impact in the American twenty sixteen election many people think it's going to do the same in the upcoming vote\n... just to be sure we understand us and we all know that you can establish a fake account or make up a name and get on the social media platform like Twitter and there are a lot of those but you're saying this this sixty thousand ... actually robotically generated accounts generating their messages is that right\nYes one of the challenges the space is that\nUh we don't have a good handle on the lingo so you'll hear a lot of discussion of Russian trolls will trolls are basically you know people on line or trying to provoke some kind of emotional response usually to make you angry\nBut when we're talking about the Russian operations they broke into two parts there were sock puppets those are real humans behind the account who are posing as something that they are not so at some a Russian hipster in St Petersburg\nWho's acting like they are an American veteran a grandmother from Texas but then you have also bots these are machines these are algorithms that are basically pushing out messages automatically\nThe combination of the two can be incredibly powerful because the sock puppets can say one thing and then the box can drive that message viral by having thousands or tens of thousands of voices echo it out further\nYou know repeatedly these social media platforms like Twitter get rid of these accounts but they have ways to automatically regenerate\nAnd what's worrying as we look ahead is that these pots don't necessarily need to be active now something that these Russian operatives but anyone who wants to manipulate social media conversation something they're increasingly doing is creating accounts and having them lie dormant\nAnd have a history of messages that seem authentic and benign and not related to a hot political event so when they activate them months or years down the road it will be much harder to detect that as something other than a real person\nYou said an amazing number here you said when Donald Trump announced for president in twenty Fifteen fifty eight percent of his Facebook followers were from outside the United states right how how do we know that is\nSo you're able to detect the origin of accounts or one of the new rules of the game when everything is on line is it out in the open\nSo you can follow it you can see the patterns of behavior maybe one of the more notable aspects of a Donald Trump's a follower account is that\nAh at that point in time about four percent supposedly lived in Mexico now of course these were not real Mexican citizens behind these accounts these were in essence fake followers\nCreated to give the semblance of a massive online following that can then be turned into a real on line following by driving your messages viral\nRight but at fifty eight percent of the followers from outside the u._s. can we infer that a lot of them are fake\nYes a vast majority of them were they were basically a bot accounts generated out of what are known as click farms are these are almost you think of like a\nSweatshop factory it's the same thing for people that are essentially being paid to click on accounts in places like the Philippines or Bangladesh and then you combine these physical people with pots and you can give you a a much greater power in politics\nYou know that's been written about the Russian efforts to interfere in the American twenty sixteen election was seen indictments give us your sense of the scale and impact of this effort\nThe challenge with this is that the information about it came out in little dribs and drabs and the result is that the scale of it is not appreciated by most people just how big in number but an extent the campaign was so for example if you're looking at Facebook\nAre now ... says you know roughly over a hundred and forty million Americans about half the population solve some aspect of a Russian um information misinformation pushed on line\nTo you move over to other platforms like for example Twitter where it's literally a hundreds of millions of messages being retreated back and forth\nA great illustration of this would be one single account um Tennessee GOP that was a posing as if it was the hub for Tennessee Republicans we now know that it was one of these Russian sitting in St Petersburg\nIt was the seventh most red account on election day not the seventh most read of the thousands of Russian accounts but the seventh most red overall to you saw similar campaigns playing out on Instagram to er there's actually one that was just detected a couple of weeks ago on Reddit\nAnd the impact of this was not just what the Russians were pushing the echo effect and to the broader population including the media itself one of the uh accounts that was um posing as a young American Woman\nShe was actually quoted in everything from a Washington Post to New York times to USA Today and the like\nAs if she was a real young American Woman and actually again it was one of these Russians behind it and so you know it's up for the historians to uh you know argue about whether it swung the election or not and such a close election what we can say is the scale of it wasn't meant\nAnd that the Russians believe it worked because they're coming back for more they're doing it in the election right now\nEmerging broken writes about

W singer strategist at New America at a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\nI'm interested in your sense of how a social media wars affected opinions about the um Kavanaugh's confirmation controversy I mean this was a case where there were facts in dispute a lot of strongly held opinions do you have any sense of\nHim they must have been social media campaigns what kind of impact they had on how this was perceived and you know the enduring impact it'll have on our discourse\nIf you were watching your social media feeds during the Kavanaugh hearings in many ways it felt like a war going back and forth and\nBut residents are pushing back about the site of facilities or housing in those locations K PCC Orange County reporter Joel rep local with us Jill in orange county you've got the added layer here the judge a David Carter is that I'm a ... and exchange where people being moved out of the Santa Ana\nRiverbed we're living long term along the banks there that they're happy to be units a thousand created in various locations throughout the county to accommodate that how does that factor into what fortunes going through\nJudge Carter actually it's actually shelter space that he has\nSort of decided anyway the history of ... are not enough to have a permanent housing yeah so it's a little bit different but it's related I'll tell you how um and and so you know and this is because of a couple court precedents\nUh basically cities have to show that they have shelter space available if they want to be able to enforce anti camping lives um anti loitering laws and you know to be able to\nRemove that person who sleeping in your car got to be a price for that exactly um interestingly judge Carter in the court hearings had mentioned this particular project that I profiled I'm\nIn his counts of sort of what different areas of the county or doing um but it is permanent housing and it's different than shelter but I think what's interesting you know and he has been very clear that he wants the county and he he wants shelter spread out he wants everyone to do their part\nUh and if you don't have a pipeline to get people from shelters into housing and then you just end up with the same problem he can't keep keep people in shelters forever and won't stay there for one thing because they're tend to not be great places to stay for a long period of time\nAnd and you know it really is it's it's kind of the first layer of that pipeline and if you don't have housing on the other side then you've got a problem you have the same problem\nRight uh let's take another listener called this is from Michael in uh Atlanta park there in West forwards and um so ... what is your thoughts about this\n... I I've been following it and go into the council meetings and this strictly affects me\nBeing that it's in my neighborhood on them less than a three blocks from the proposed site and also as the other callers that uh the lucky motel and in some other potential um areas like the armory which is gonna be reopening um I think the main thing for the residents are area concerned as it's not that we don't nobody want\nDoesn't want to help the homeless um I have family members that are ... run recovery center in a bullets in locally um I help out all the time over there um I think our main concern is one obviously the area I'm is not a\nBig fight that we need to be putting this um this\nFrom the supportive housing in the basically the residents are looking for an area that is a little bit more um industrial away from schools um this is literally walking just as one of our local parks um two schools a liquor store and many other things that are\nClose to our neighborhood to um be information that ah most residents um how did you uh videos of um basically talking with red um\nEmployees of pathways or hope was um they were given scenarios as in um\nThe employees of what happens if a resident of the ... housing is caught doing drugs in the facility on\nWhat would a top was a pope do um they basically said oh well they're going to do it out in your neighborhood anyways where would you rather them do it in the neighborhood or I'm here within their and then we would say would not be terms for I'm\nBeing kicked out of the out of the facility and they said no not necessarily\nWe can't make them pay rent we can't make them go seek services these are all the things that we were told them that are on the website it probably is hope that uh everybody has told that this is how we're going to abide by it but when we speak to the employees a path was hope he was going to be running this facility they basically are\nTotally opposite and it doesn't give the residents a good fuel\nRight hold on I appreciate it Michael let's bring back say all of a United in homelessness in orange county United Way your response to the concerns he's expressing as residents of that community\nYeah so I'm part of the the kind of\nPhilosophy behind a permanent supportive housing is them to make it low barrier so that people have how those chronic needs whether that as a physical health condition and mental health condition a potentially some kind of substance abuse or addiction\nIssue um it so that that can be addressed while somebody isn't housing if you think about it while you're sleeping outside it's really quite impossible to get clean and sober it's always happen to be your issues and so I'm for permanent supportive housing and um\nYou have at least agreement just like you have at least like you were I Would have a lease agreement\nUm and there are not kind of control over what I can do in my own home so I can consume alcohol in my own home\nI could potentially use drugs in my own home um but that's not a violation of my least but if I'm doing that in a public setting than that it's worth that becomes a problem and every operator permanent supportive housing that I Know if behavior like that\nIs happening in a public setting they would absolutely\nYou know investigate that they will contact the police if needed they take that very very seriously and they take their relationships with their neighbors very very serious\nWhat what about the resident concerns about parks and schools nearby residents are concerned that\nIf someone might get high or be acting radical use a result of psychiatric condition um that they're you know leaving where they're living nearby a coming by schools coming by park your what's your response to that concern\nI think that's something that may be a concern but again I just sort of want to go back to the fact that we currently have people who have those behaviors that are on our streets already and let it is impossible really for those behaviors and to be addressed for their health concerns to be addressed while somebody is on the streets\nAnd the best chance that somebody has of getting\nTheir health concerns addressed is when they're in permanent supportive housing and I can say from the research study that the University of California Irvine did I'm looking at homelessness we know that people's behavior changes when their house\nSo I can share with you that there's a one hundred percent reduction\nWhite chronically homeless are housed in permanent supportive housing or they're not during behaviors that caused him to get arrested um their health also improves there's a Seventy eight percent reduction in ambulance ride once people are housed in there is a forty three percent reduction and visits to the air are\nSo I can tell you that the data shows the people's behavior does change when their house\nBack saying thank you so much from United Way Orange County and United in

to look at when you're about to get into them or they're tiny they're rickety are\nThey as you say are totally kind of analog and feel I mean uh often they feel more like extensions of the machine age the MySpace age they feel like things that you would expect out of the world war two submarine or tank movie\nVery much the opposite I think of how at least my generation grew up thinking about space travel which was high tech which was you know it it was a everything having to do with space travel in the movies was sleek and grand and clean and just the epitome of technology um and really this was a\nThis is a time where you know we were being thrust into the future before the future it arrived I just find that fascinating and you have a group of people literally making it up as they go along [noise]\nYou know an example of all the things that could possibly go wrong in the gym and I ate flight the U.S is like the first there's going to be the test of the first space craft to dock with another spacecraft to see if that's possible\nMhm and so you know a Neil Armstrong's on on that mission and as he's getting strapped in to the space capsule before takeoff\nAnd there's really daring and dangerous mission they realize you seatbelt isn't working like the mechanism stock and well one of the members of the tech who says hey does anybody have a Swiss army knife and it just makes you think about if the seatbelt isn't working just\nThink about all the things that could possibly go wrong um and like I kind of constant theme of the movie like all the things that could possibly go wrong and how amazing it is that any of this happened\nIt was one of the big things I wanted to try to get across because I think uh we almost take the moon landing for granted today and and maybe it's because the sort of image of NASA at that time and and that we've lived with sense was this sort of high tech image you described in this kind of image of\nOf a sort of be hitting me of technology and the epitome of individuals' this idea of superheroes basically walking among us who did these deeds that were almost easy for them because they were just so super heroic um\nI think it's much more interesting to think of these people as ordinary human beings are working with the limited technology that they had you know scrounging things together figuring stuff out fixing things with Swiss army knives doing calculations with pencils and paper\nA and also you know the families I think there's a whole untold story of kind of what this actually met on a family level and so to me it was really important to\nYou know at every juncture be looking at Neal in conjunction with with Janet withdrawn and Armstrong who I was lucky to spend time with 'em before she passed away and and and and talk to about this period in their life and just you know what that means to a marriage what it means to\nA family where you're trying to raise kids you know it it Neal's case to you know literally perform you know for example this Gemini mission which came disclosed resulting in his death\nOr something I didn't know about it was a total New York it asked her fee in space that almost cost the lives of two astronauts an end to the program right then in the mid sixties or any comes home and has to you know take out the trash including the pool and help make us gets breakfast in the morning how do you how do you balance those two things I think I just I found that fascinating\nYeah okay so you mentioned that the ... this mission nearly ended in catastrophe after um after his space craft\nDocs with the fuel spacecraft in space the first time one space craft has docked with another\nThe whole thing gets out of control anything said like the the the spacecraft that he's talked with that's causing everything to be out of control so he ... and then realized no it's the spacecraft he's in out of control and he just kind of spinning and and tumbling and it's noisy\nAnd it's it's it's vibrating like crazy can you talk about shooting that scene because you have several scenes where you can just experience the the and the extreme\nIn I'm In space capsule and this case because it's kind of lost control but in other cases you're entering or leaving earth's atmosphere and it said to her rocky cried no so why don't you talk about that spacecraft seen Africa after they dock\nWe wanted space flight to feel really physical in this movie you know and for you to feel the the the blood sweat and tears so to speak um but of course also those moments of of all and grand jury that surprisingly can kind of pop up um and I think what was interesting about the Gemini mission was a\nYou know on the one hand you have this uh this incredible accomplishment of two vehicles documents space without without that accomplishment the moon landing would not have been possible so it was a necessary step a and it was the first step that America ever beat the Russians to an entire history of the space program or the Russians have beat America on every single other juncture beforehand\nAnd so you have this or you know everyone kind of feeling like ah like royalty as they should\nAnd right away you know almost like a trick to say\nThis problem you you described began and it's not just that it was a this you know can immediately life threatening issue but uh but also the confusion of it um and so keeping the camera inside the capsule as much as possible not sort of cutting out to big wide shots that would\nThat would sort of overly explain things trying to really be subjective and immersive to what Neal himself and he and his and his colleague Dave Scott would be experience than I think that was really important to us\nAnd that was just one of many instances of you know I guess what I'd qualify as you're near failures or in certain cases failures that led the way to the success story of the moon landing um um so I think trying to remind audiences how fragile this all was how dangerous\nOr the lives that almost cost in some cases the lives of did cos\nI'm you know I think it helps us appreciate maybe just just how hard earned that final moonwalk really was\n[noise] let me reintroduce Ian if you're just joining us my guess is Demian choose out and he directed the new movie first man that Neil Armstrong at an all a tip to be the first man to walk on the moon he also wrote and directed Lala land and whiplash we'll be right back this is ...\nIn Florida thousands of people are under mandatory evacuation orders but officials are worried not

S. E. E. dot com slash clean energy\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Daniel ... who directed the new movie the first man that Neil Armstrong the space program in the sixties in Armstrong's walk on the moon he was the first man to walk on the moon and Damien ... also wrote and directed not our land and whiplash\nWhat did you have to experience yourself in order to convey the experience of being in a spacecraft that's out of control did you do any simulation exercises you can viscerally experience it and\nTherefore portraying well\nWe tried to shoot in in a way where we and the actors could be experiencing some version of it you know so instead of using green screen or kind of relying on digital effects to to sort of paint the picture we\nWe used a full scale replicas of these capsules they were the you know sort of exactly the same size all the details were exactly the same our production designer Nathan Crowley didn't incredible job sort of rebuilding these things\nAnd we ... we would mount the you know we wouldn't fly them into space but we would mount them on the most control systems gambles that basically wouldn't move and rock back and forth\nQuite violently if we needed them to uh and we would set those up against a ... D screens so it's kind of like being in a simulator ride you sort of sit inside them and everything you can't see office at you look out the window you see space imagery instead of you know film equipment or cruel or or or a green screen that will fill in later\nYou see the earth's spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had to kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule are simulating the sun so you get this kind of strobe you know meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors in for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know was kind of feeling if we can feel it onset if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to ah to give that sense then\nThen the audience is going to feel at the actors are gonna be that much more in it you know the the sweat you see on screen will be real the shaking will be real even some of the terrible the real the knowledge that will be real and by extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nI liked twentieth Nineteen sixty nine I'm ... and became the first human to walk on the moon\nAnd you mentioned you had the chance to talk with I'm Janet Armstrong who was Neil Armstrong's life they were married for thirty six years and then I'm divorced\nUm what were some things you learn from her that help you understand what she and she's portrayed by Claire foie and let Armstrong we're going shrewd during this period in the sixties when he was an astronaut\nA well one thing I think that new one gene and had in common was this ability to put on his face and in moments of incredible uh you know upheaval I'm you know that ... that they were able uh\nYou know it was something in their character as sort of mid western I'm a kind of ... that they had that ultimately you know it was very much a product of of of their time and their culture that was just able to do the impossible without complaint\nAnd uh you know I really got a vivid sense of that when talking to Janet you know I I Would ask or things like you know ... well you know how did you\nHow did you do this how did you you know how did you feel when ah you know ... you're you're you're moving from place to place to say you're moving from a juniper hills in California where when they first moved there for Neal to be a you know test pilot VX Fifteen he's\nWorking in incredibly dangerous job they're living in a cabin with no running water no electricity or and in the middle of nowhere a then they moved to Houston after a\nYou know after suffering a agree this last as a family um and you know again Neal is work in a dangerous job in in a way eighty percent of the time and who knows if you'll ever return I mean just you know how how did you cope and and she would uh several times just look at me and an almost with a shrug say well sink or swim\nThat really stuck with me just that it was as simple as that in a way um but of course that's complicated is that and uh you know so she vividly remember to so many of you know the kind of day by day activities and instances of that we picked in a movie and a lot of it was even down to\nYou know lines of dialogue to quite emotional moments in the movie for example when when Janet a you know late in the film or a ...\nThat you sit down and tell us kids before he goes off on his moon missions sits down and tells them that he may not return though\nIt made him do that in real life\nYeah yeah that that this is all you made a lot of this was is already recorded and Jimmy instance book I'm a but a beginning to actually talk with her about it and you know talk through what that conversation actually wasn't than what the dinner table conversation actually was\nA lot of that scene in the movies taken verbatim from ah from what she wrecked elected in from what her son's a wreck in March were incredibly helpful through the whole process the movie recollect it\nYeah and in the senior attacking Batman apparently in real life to uh Neil Armstrong didn't really want to have that conversation with his sons saying like I might not make it back\nLike she demanded that he has to do and that she wasn't going to do it he has yet and and he has been in this incredible like\nLow key way without really that really showing emotion\nYeah I mean I I think uh for Neal in particular but it applies to both of them in order to you know the only way you get through something like a mission like that\nOr or or you know for example through\nSome of the law says that they experienced as a family I'm the only way you can get through a release the only way they felt they could get through was was\nBy trying as hard as possible to hold those emotions in check but that's sometimes a difficult thing to do you know and I think I think Neal in the movie and I think you know a ... in real life it to a certain extent with someone who\nUh I think it was more afraid of engaging with those emotions and and are actually sitting down and facing them uh uh you know and and and talking to people about them than he was a hurling themselves through the atmosphere and flying into the void of space you know he he was he was a man without any fear\nOr they were a married couple without any fear\nExcept for this sort of deep ... fear that I think they constantly had to deal with day by day on the\nGround [noise] um congestion her which did the score for the film and you also work\nWith him on whiplash la la land you met in college and I think the music is really good for the film and um I Know music is\nVery important to you during the the moon landing sequence um there's music that has to me like part military part like western theme music and you Star Trek refer to space has the final frontier [laughter]\nI don't intentionally to have a kind of western an edge to catch the rhythm sounds part military impact kinda galloping like horses and a western\n[noise] uh well you know it was a I think the biggest thing for me was the rhythm of it was just the the that kind of relentless drive a that yeah you know good sound like horses galloping could sound like the machinery itself uh to me also just reflected Neal state of mind this was a\nYou know that that final stretch of the journey that final landing and and you kind of get a sense of it when you listen to the coms are themselves to the inner Homs is that when you get\nThe ah sorry yeah when you you know the actual audio between the capsule and kept calm and mission control and whatnot um you know ... you can listen to all of that in real time or you can listen to all of it online and and uh\nUm it's just this uh you know there was sort of one thing after another that went wrong or almost went wrong um and uh but I I get the sense that Neal was going to ah was going to land that thing I wasn't going to be stopped in and uh you know a everyone had come too far at that point to turn around and and uh\nAnd you know so when you when you learn things like the fact that they landed with you know only two percent of the you know gas\nRemaining they landed within the thirty second window or by which point they would have had to do a mandatory aboard a you know or or or or else\nBasically die um you know those are things that I didn't really know about when I first thought about the moon landing um and uh you know so it felt like a music why should we could get in to Neal's mine space if we can get into that sense of just relentless on stopping drive um ah it would it would set the scene\nOkay let's hear some of that music and this is moon landing music from the score\nX. men landing music fan just in her late to score\nFirst man and a movie that Neil Armstrong and his various space missions and then landing on the moon and becoming the first man to walk on the moon my guest Demian ... directed the movie he also directed not on land and whiplash\nThis thing that your film has become controversial for in some circles as that you didn't show Neal Armstrong planting the flat on among which is a you know famous moment that was related you know in real time on camera from the moon\nIn an excerpt of the transcript from what I'm President Trump said to the conservative publication\nThe Daily Caller and this is from September fourth\nThe interviewer asked for Trump's thoughts on the fact that the planning of the ... was not shown he was asked do you think that's upsetting and Trump says I think it's very unfortunate it's almost like they're proud of they tell me it's like they're embarrassed at the achievement coming from America I think it's a terrible thing\nBecause when you think of Neil Armstrong when you think about the landing on the moon you think about the American flags and I understand they don't do it for that reason I wouldn't even want to watch the movie\nMany do you think other people should go see the movie and Trump says that's up to them it really is and that's up to them I don't want to get into the world of boycotts and then he goes on to talk about ... and Nike\nOr the controversy about the flag material in the movie you know I think it was a\nA pretty much exclusively among the people who hadn't seen the film and I have to say I understand very much the emotions that something like that or get aroused I think uh obviously the moon landing was an American achievement and an incredible one\nAnd the flag on the moon was a very important part of that which is why we we show it we show it several times though the flag standing there on the moon on the lunar surface in terms of actually uh you know mapping out each of the mission and mapping out you know ... and showing\nThe you know the physical sticking up the rod into the into the lunar soil and propping up at the flag\nA we made a choice entirely anesthetic choice not a political one to focus on\nNeal's private moments on the moon ah during that time you know the the movies about the ten years leading up to the lunar landing um and so we only spent about eight minutes on the surface we really wanted to", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "10"}
