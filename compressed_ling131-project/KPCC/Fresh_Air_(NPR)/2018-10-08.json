{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Uh the uh organizations saying the need for serious action on climate change a is imminent and that much must be done because of the seriousness of it in a seriousness of it and done right now\nA Mac in garden grove listening on ... see see what did you think of the two candidates this morning\nShow as I said earlier you don't really care much about social issues really are different in mixed household are tired of identity politics there was that you give us any details about lowering taxes are getting a bigger bang for our\nOur family want strong public safety and just see like Governor Brown dangerous predators out is not interested in getting dangerous illegal alien like a master gene homelessness is rampant in California and it is or where it was it that I'm the mayor\nAs law enforcement tired of hearing sanctuary state concepts ... savor that's absolutely true safety comes from overly participate community no matter what their immigration status is why we're in any of these roads that we have\nA Mac let me just break ins with the debate itself as opposed to the policies of the two candidates\nDid you think that John Cox since I was like you you you support is Kansas the did you make the points sufficiently last hour or two to reinforce what you wanted him to say\nWell is going up against ... only wants to do one debate and he's a slick politician like just one of the points that I was supposed to make was we'll pay for treatment roads the last Twenty years we have some of the highest taxes wire that was horrible\nAnd those are the seeds to go along with those type of philosophies we don't eat prop sick it again in\n... so it sounds like you're you're saying given the the limit of only one debate and the comparative inexperience a as a politician a of John Cox that sounds like you you thought he did okay let's talk next with Richard in Anaheim\nRichard how did you think the candidates distinguish themselves\nLarry I'm what I I walked away with was a that this is the ... version of Trump coming to office uh I was\nJust stunned by John Fox complete lack of understanding of how\nGovernment works how policy initiatives are developed a policy debates with the legislature I think the best example of this was his complete under ... Andy misunderstanding\nOr I should say lack of understanding about how the California budget deficit was created that blood Schwarzenegger into office we've gone through this uh you know many years now and everybody has come to a consensus that the\nThat the repeal of the vehicle licensing fee under Gray Davis um and that brought Schwarzenegger I should say recall Gray Davis and ... and they ended up as blue an eight billion dollar hole in the budget and we've struggled for years until Jerry Brown came in\nTo office to Rick ... we cover from that\nSo you got caught Cox didn't didn't um take that up insufficient detail and show his knowledge of that I'm Sean Walsh Republican political strategist do your thoughts about that critique\nOh I actually don't agree I'm really done a great at all with regards to how state government works um I Do think that if um you brought sanctuary cities and that legislation very hard to the legislature you at pressure them and I do think if you actually put it on the statewide ballot you\nProbably would see a repeal of that says you so you've got a lot of activist\nOr folks in the state legislature I'm not sure the state legislatures totally on the line but with the public at least\nListening to the various a self described Democrat moderate and conservative Democrat colors on this radio program I Do think that Mr Cox is right that or if you use both of those vehicles that are available to them from a policy perspective you could actually see change\nMatt Rodriguez democratic strategist\nWho I thought that was one of the few times when Cox actually had something resembling a specific one of the problems he has he has a sort of thematic a general when there's corruption campaign finance we you know we need to do things better but he didn't have any policy prescriptions to match and I don't mean that he had to be so specifically kid have two or three things to say\nYou know you wouldn't want to run a campaign you won't have a theme some kind of messaging something to match and say one or two things that are simple for people to understand sequels doing this here's what I Would do to change it here's a policy prescription just a one or two lines and he was never able to get there\nSo secret is a contentious thing there are questions of what they should do about that building more housing even Gavin admitted that but I I thought Cox was never able to sit there and say but here's how I'm going to actually get that done I'm going to actually do this is the type of policy prescription that will do\nActs and I think he was never quite able to get out a second gear on that\nSean we're we're do 'em do Republicans do you think support Cox even if they have concerns about\nHis inexperience about um his views expressed earlier about President Trump even if you know some Republicans Europe problems with the president do you think that is where they're likely going to land or a fair number of I'm not going to vote for governor\n[noise] I I think they land there I mean look if you look at the kind of withering of the Republican Party from from a voting percentage allowed and go into the kinds of state the Republicans that are kind of hang in there are the most probably leaning more conservative or the most dedicated and determined Republican so I think\nAs a small block they pretty much stay with Mr Cox the question is\nDid Mr Cox do enough to appeal to people who have moved over into the no party preference category\nAnd did he do enough to appeal to you know the folks that have been on this call the conservative Democrats that have issues with sanctuary cities or the train to nowhere et cetera so I'm not sure he got far enough into the Democratic ranks to move it but I Do think he he held his Republican base math\nProblem he probably did I you know like you know Gavin is not a natural fit for any of these Republican it does it is interesting that when we were talking about his months ago before the primary about whether or something like an interviewer goes or John John had gotten out of the primary what this might have meant 'cause it would've been a lot of these are the more moderate in Republican moderate Democrats and a Republican voters might have been more up for grabs\nCox looks like he's going to go more on on a base no he doesn't have a lot of money he's been running most mostly a base ... campaign he just doesn't have the political experience to broaden out his appeal this might have been a real interesting race for more of a moderate to conservative Democrat running against Gabby and trying to push him to the left\nIt might have opened up different areas of the state to\nAh to voting for somebody else but it looks like this was going to run around for the general party lines and that's not enough for a Republican in California against a Democrat\nGregory in South central Los Angeles listening at Cape BCC is with an organization called black Republicans\nSaid Gavin Newsom agenda hasn't helped any African Americans in South Los Angeles LA's the epicenter of sanctuary cities and most of the liberal agenda is Gregory puts it isn't

father released before he died now Adams written the forward to a book of his father's unpublished writings Adam remembers when his father was composing his best known song hallelujah\nTook um twelve years started when I was very very young right here versus three eighty four verses to it so I remember coming down to the kitchen table and he was there was another one string guitar and his underwear [noise]\nThey're always be versus sold hundreds of versions have been recorded there was a moratorium on that so you know in my family is that right and is that for me to different grocery reframe please refrain from Plano [noise]\nWe'll see [noise] that's coming up on fresh air [noise]\nFirst news\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Windsor Johnston President Trump is keeping a top Justice Department official on the job for now NPR's Scott Horsley reports deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein traveled with Trump to Florida earlier today\nHad such an inevitable wave and command of language so I'm hesitant and I I didn't even know whether I should I I'm not certain I should be speaking\nAbout him but um but it's a stirring subject and um I have been enlisted time enlisted in the\nIn the campaign to let everybody know how wonderful I think he was [noise]\nDo you feel protective of his privacy 'cause\nIn my opinion like your father was very um elliptical in his writing and a pretty private about his life you alluded to a lot of things in his songs but never quite came out and said that many direct way\nOh I I'm not certain that's that's true in terms of the use of the word direct\nOkay but I Will say that um\nTo speak on his behalf feels like a little bit of a transgression you know you have a man who has designed as life around trying to not demystify a process um\nAnd uh his work really does speak for itself [noise] ah so you know of course I urge people to just consulted if they're interested in it uh it's it yes it's complete with\nContradictions you know you go from things that are actually quite direct to things that are mysterious and elusive and designed to be transcended because of it I'm like he was preoccupied with the uh the broken this of things the the symmetry of things [noise]\nYou know as he says forget your perfect offering\nUm there's a crack in everything or in his most famous on hallelujah it doesn't matter what you heard a whole year the broken hallelujah so he was always preoccupied with the idea of the imperfection of things\nYeah there's there's a crack and everything and that's that's where the light gets in I don't have the line exactly at my fingertips but I mean it's\n... yeah ring the bells that still can wring forget your perfect offering there is a crack in everything that's how the light gets and\nYeah so do you like whatever like can get through the crack to ask you know I mean you see the light but he sees the thing that only has a crack that lets the light and ... you know the ... they always have the ... of everything is I think what I'm trying to say I'm so\nOh yeah I I I remember him dancing so beautifully around these kinds of questions which I think he uh was irritated by [laughter]\nVery core and when I say that I don't mean to be disparaging of the person I'm constructing the questions I think it's natural for us to be curious and to articulate our concerns or thoughts are questions\nBut I think it's also natural for the quote unquote artists to\nPreserve the kind of mystery I'm and to not talk about the mechanics almost like a porno you know this goes in here that goes in there there's something bigger than the mechanics and that is the end the end result the stirring quality of of what is the result of an artist at work\nAnd um you know I think he uh has he said you know I put my paper had on my concussion and dance he tried on many occasions to to dance around questions or a cooperate Tibet as best he could and I feel like such a shabby imposter trying to\nUm be the ... for him you know the ambassador of this particular book which I had very little to do with frankly others and offering a title for it or\nHe wrote a very eloquent introduction which I Will be quoting as time goes on here [laughter]\nThank you so I ... I think you you said he left behind like lockers worth of notebooks what are you dealing with them I mean you describe me like he was always riding there's always a cocktail napkins and pages and\nIn his pocket she found a notebook in the freezer and one's um so what what are you doing with the findings\nIt's amazing there's so much paperwork to go through a ... from the simplest point of view is the are the archival work which is assembling everything and trying to pay homage to it for posterity then there's a the completion of works of his in this instance it's the flame this book\nUm and then there were also some songs which I was tasked with finishing you know you may know I ah I produced his last record for the\nCall you want a darker and while working with him many many poems were red sometimes to a mere kick drum\nJust from meter for tempo and so there's this sense of responsibility to keep the songs alive is he always used to say\nI Want to play the title song on the final album that was released when your father Leonard Cohen was still alive it's called you on a darker and then we'll talk about working with him on it and this is it's what can I say it's a great song [noise]\nIf you she means I'm pretty regularly if scientists to lower my boss is a shame you was dark [noise] ... [noise]\n\n\nA ... a\nIn\nThe human brain [noise] million candles and burning for thousands of never won a darker [noise]\n\n\n[noise] oh that's Leonard calling from the final album that was released while he was alive the title track you want a\nDarker I guessed as his son Adam ... who wrote the introduction to a new collection of ... final pounds ... lyrics and drawings called the flame\nThat's on it so much about facing death and of having a God who allows suffering and accepting the suffering but yet not being like happy about it or trying to make it seem like sufferings great\n[laughter] you know you're not trying to be spiritual and dismissive way of of all the suffering that we indoor [noise] um I I Want to read what he wrote about you for the liner notes of this album he wrote that without\nYour contribution there would be no record he said at a certain point after over a year of intense labor both\nPat who wrote the melodies and I went to Natalie broke down with severe back injuries and other disagreeable visitations in my case the situation was bleak the discomfort acute and the project was abandoned\nAdam sensed that my recovery if not my survival depended on my getting back to work he took over the project establish me in a medical charity kissing and brought these unfinished sons to completion preserving of course many hats hunting musical themes\nIn his because of my sons loving encouragement and skilled administration that the sun's exist in their presence forum I cannot think of enough what\nWere you able to do for him physically to make it possible for him to record the album he mentions you put him in the medical ... can you describe the sad about that that you helped create for him\nI think maybe the more interesting things certainly to me would be to to just say that\nWe were writing some kind of mysterious wind and the grace of the occasion there was an urgency to the entire mission and of course it had to do with a serious health issues he was a mobilized you had a multiple compression fractures\nOf his spine and it involved an incredible monastic effort on his part to [noise]\nTo be present and to deliver the way he did but\nThere's something about his work in general not just on the last album but in this book and in general\nHe she invites you into your own inner life because he takes the inner life seriously\nHe's not like one of these contemporaries I won't mention any names but there are many wonderful contemporaries of his who have been my estimation become misspell jacks during the ... because they're somehow they succumb to the temptation of going back into their older catalog\nAnd their regurgitate in things whereas this man was speaking from the very wrong that he found himself at in life\nLet me re introduce you if you're just joining us my guest is Adam Cohen and he's the son of Leonard Cohen and now there's a new collection of Leonard Cohen\nFinal lyrics homes notebook injuries and drawings and these are all collected in the new book the flame and Adam Cohn wrote the introduction\nTo it when they take a short break and then we'll be right back this is fresh air\nPBC

writing\nI mean when I was really young\nI remember him composing hallelujah\nYou remember him writing it oh yeah and I remember him being your took um twelve years [laughter]\nSo you know started it started when I was very very young at here versus I think three eighty four verses to that song I remember coming down to the kitchen table and he was there was an island string guitar in his underwear\nAnd are there to always be versus to consult and I remember even being invited to sing I'm\nWith a group of people in New York City when he was recording the song for his own album which by the way Sony at the time didn't want to put out [noise] um\n[noise] isn't it amazing an amazing turn of events to have this man's popularity have have grown you know he lived in a kind of comic anonymity if you buy those too if you buy that unlikely union [noise]\nAnd um two grown in popularity so much at the end of his life and for to get back to question for me to have\nSat on the side of the stage you know watching my old man at five years old and all the way up to and to my forties um the whole canon of his work is is living inside of me is playing in my head is triggered by conversation\nYeah so for hallelujah as you say there's no there were eighty four versus I don't think he ever recorded all eighty four\nFoot did it take twelve years and eighty four versus before he considered it completed because of dissatisfaction with the versus that he'd previously written or because there's still so much you wanted to say in the format of that song\nIs the popular a poem states of poem is never finished would rather abandoned\n[laughter] do you think he was frustrated working on it for so long or that it was satisfying\nI think I'm frustration was expected um ... ... the success of being\nWell to let it go was was the unexpected you know I think as I say he was very vocational from the early stage she would wake up earlier than anybody you knew to black and pages\nAnd uh and gave up an enormous amount for what he would for referred to as compromised norm is amount\nOr go back to that song came so far for beauty left so much behind my patience and my family my master piece on signed\n[noise] you know you quote that you know some people subscribe to to the philosophy first thought that thought and that's often attributed to a one of the beat writers but your father believed last thought best thought [laughter] yeah he he edited I take it he edited his songs a lot he went through a lot of traffic\nIt was a constant process of filtration and refined for certain\nSo why why don't we hear hallelujah your father's version short\n[laughter] this is Leonard yeah go ahead more ... there was a moratorium on that song you know in my family so how is that right is that for ... yeah refrain please refrain from playing ... because\nI think he felt like a you know who's going to cause Leonard Cohen fatigue or something or you know where you're give give some other songs a chance to get played [noise] um it was it was partly joke and partly zone exhaustion I think with with the song\n[noise] so in spite of the moratorium your family has on hallelujah I think I think we'll play in any way are you okay with that\nOh God I'm going to report due to the bully believe\n[laughter] okay I hear it\nYou\n\nReally\nDo [noise]\n[noise]\nOr\nThat's Leonard Cohen singing hallelujah and my guest is Leonard Cohen son Adam Cohen and there's an he wrote the introduction to a new collection of passion immensely published Leonard cone um lyrics\nPoems notebook injuries and drawings and it's called\nThe flame um so you know at hallelujah I think like two hundred people have recorded hallelujah and um it but it didn't become well known until just about the recorded at like maybe ten years or more after your father recorded it\nAnd which is just so strange but um it's a sign of\nHow I think there's a period of years when your father's genius west and fully knowledge when you know he had the initial period of hits and then I think people are just a lot of people just kind of drifted away and then rediscovered him\nAnd um what was it like for you and for him during that period one when I think he'd been a little bit forgotten\nYeah [laughter]\nI feel like my father probably felt like his whole life um was characterized by that by that description that he did have been forgotten forgotten by the angels forgotten by the or the you know cupid a forgotten buddy um [noise]\nI Know that he was not satisfied\nUh it was a seeker I wasn't satisfied with either the position that he had for the most part I'm In society he wasn't happy with society itself that would that ... deep in the conflict\nHe wasn't he wasn't satisfied with the people that you've chosen to be around him he wasn't satisfied with his role as a father he wasn't satisfied with his role as a lover I'm\nAnd through all this layer upon layer of dissatisfaction you somehow mustard I'm an incredible buoyancy and ability to be a\nUm one of the most delightful people anyone ever came across and um it wasn't with any sense of bitterness or judgment I think he just felt like a you have this\nShabby little life and his only solve this was ... was the work itself\nAnd that's what made the end of his life that more astonishing and surprising and delicious you know this is a unexpected\nAbility to fill you know twenty thousand seats and in any major city in the world these reviews from people that were like you know this you're likely we're reviewing the Sistine Chapel itself\nUm the was accompanied by commercial success and accolades and\nTo see him take his hat off you know and I think we jubilant audiences one after the other was to humanity was genuinely surprised and delighted by the reception that he thought he was never going to get in life\nWhen I saw him probably in the late to thousands like two thousand nine maybe I I Can't remember what year it was it was kind of like being in a church or synagogue there was this\nSense of like ... the devotion of its fans to him and his devotion to the music and two things larger\nAnd he ended up with what struck me as the benediction and I forget exactly what he said but you know to those of you who are going home you know to your family's enjoy your family's in to those of you who live alone\nEnjoying your solitude and I thought like people don't say that that's such a beautiful thing to say that your lovely wife sending people home and sending home people who are going home alone and joy your solitaire\nYeah maybe songs find you and your solitude yeah and so I mean the blood banks to actually be the exact quote has made the blessings find you and your solitude I thought that was just beautiful\nWell this is a man who as he says and I think you've you've just played it well you know although we had a reputation as a a ladies' man you know he was he had the greatest teeth
