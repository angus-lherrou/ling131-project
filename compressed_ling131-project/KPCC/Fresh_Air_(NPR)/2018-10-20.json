filled extraordinary people I knew and he became this coast\nOn today's fresh air we hear from David Sheff and from Nick who was on the street nearly died and went to rehab numerous times before getting clean each\nTime that I relapsed after going the treatment I don't think that that meant that those treatment centers bailed me or anything or that it just was that I just wasn't ready\nDavid who's a journalist will also tell us what he learned about the science of addiction from his research for a subsequent book clean also Justin Chang reviews the new film can you ever forgive me starring Melissa McCarthy as a writer and literary forge or\nFirst news law you from NPR News in Washington I'm Jim hawk\nSaudi Arabia is now claiming the Washington Post columnist ... died inside their consulate understood bowl after a fight broke out the report aired by the Saudi state news agency says Eighteen people are under arrest including to advisors to the Saudi crown prince\nUm I think it did because I spent a lot of time when I was high\nTalking to my friends into myself and the other ... anybody would listen about how I was right and how I had the right to do this stuff and\nUm you know I was justifying it all over and over so I think I probably wouldn't have spent that much time trying to convince myself and try to convince everyone else if there wasn't a little piece of me that was um you know did recognize a what a monster\nI'd turned into the other weird thing about crystal math is you know do stuff like um things that you know if I took a part of my computer 'cause it wasn't working and then took apart my cell phone I could\nPut it all back together with my cell phone in the computer and then I Would make this like super computer something I mean you know it's like stuff that really made sense to me at the time\nAnd if you'd asked me I Would have thought that I was being totally rational but you know I obviously I was in and it just completely messes\nUp your perception of reality\nNow how old were you when you started using and how long did you use\nUm well I I mean I started like smoking pot and stuff and when I was you know I'm ... consistently I guess when I was like twelve as smoking pot a lot ah and then you know in high school and I you know smoke pot and drank and stuff but not super habitually but\nI guess when I was a Seventeen was really when I started smoking pot every day\nAnd then I started doing mushrooms enough and then\nEverything else so I lost it I guess from you know when I was Seventeen and twenty five now and I have two years sober so it must have been from about Seventeen to twenty three you know but with periods of interruption when I was in rehab are sober or whatever\nYeah but there's there's a lot of guilt feelings that you express I'm In your memoir about your son's addiction and you you worry whether it's anything you did or Saturday didn't do I didn't say that might have led to his addiction or prevented him from\nGiving it up sooner during this period when you felt guilty what did you feel guilty you know what were the things that you thought you might have contributed to\nI felt guilty about everything I tried to look back in our lives and to say\nYou know what was it that ultimately caused Nick to go so out of control and to come so close to dying you know was it the divorce you know when he was young\nYou know wasn't the fact that I used drugs and that I was open about it and um you know was it was too liberal and my I just didn't set limits that he needed I guess the ultimate\nAnswer is that I feel that it's unknowable what would cause a child to become so self destructive um when you go to Ellen on which which um yeah I I I I went through a lot of meetings\nAnd found it very useful or they say you know you didn't cause it you can't control it you can't cure it um you know that you can't cure it you can't control it I Believe you didn't cause it or not a hundred percent there yet\nNickel in your father was blaming himself for your addiction um where are you blaming him to\nUm sometimes absolutely yeah it's it's easier to blame other people don't have to look at yourself um so what are\nGood at what did you blame when you when you would kind of put it on on him or at least but some of it on him what did you put their\n[noise] oh I don't know I mean uh uh some of it was um yeah sure about the divorce and you know moving me out of the city what I was little and I mean you know I'm here I mean anything just you know refusing to let me borrow the car that night or something I mean you know I um\nYeah I mean I definitely spent a lot of time being really really angry with both my parents you know with everybody I mean part of that I think was was just a you know another aspect of for another I'm part of denial or or whatever and and not wanting to\nTake responsibility for my actions and things yeah\n[noise] there were times when you went to rehab willingly in times when you went against your will is that correct\nYes absolutely did it make a difference to the outcome whether you went there willingly or whether you went there against your will\nUm ... no not really I mean you know each rehab that I went to act like really helped me a lot and I learned more and more about myself and I learned more and more about you know this disease and and you know what it takes to stay sober and how to sort of learn how to take care of yourself and love yourself and everything\nI mean each time that I relapsed after going the treatment I don't think that that meant that the treatment centers bailed me or anything or that it just was that I just wasn't ready you know\nThis last treatment center I went to I was absolutely did not want to go you know this is to to a little over two years ago and I was basically coerced into treatment and I you know once I got there I didn't want to stay there and it's not fun you know what I mean you're being told what to do every second of the day and\nYou know you have to sleep and room with three other people and so it's not like I mean if I could do if I could have done it without having to go to rehab I definitely would have preferred to do that and it's expensive to you know it's it's it's hard you know for sure\nYou know a lot of people say that if you're in ... you're not gonna\nYou're not really going to be ready\nTo stop until your bottom doubt you seem to hit bottom like a whole bunch of times one of which was when you're on guard so badly infected\nFrom shooting up that um when you went to the when you finally went to the emergency room the doctor thought he might need to amputate your arm somebody when you started would need to educate your arm yeah um so how how come incidents that weren't enough to get you to think well I'd better stop I'm killing myself\nUm well I guess I'm a part of it I again is that I think that killing myself was okay with me you know I mean I I sort of knew that that was what I was doing and and I I was sort of resigned\nTo that and also you know I I guess there's a point where you feel like you've gone so far\nDown that building your life back after you know having let everyone down again and having you know disappointed people and and you know I'm overdrawn your bank account and lost her cellphone lost her job and\nYou know lost her car and\nI mean it just feels like at certain points like just start over and to try to rebuild my whole life again it's just too much and so you know I might as well just ride this out till the end and just you know see it through until yeah until I'd I'd do die you know and\nBut um but there was I mean there was something inside of me that I guess believed that maybe things get better somehow even against all you know rationale or whatever\nAnd that little bit of hope you know was what was what I was able to to hold onto and and um that's gotten me here thank God so\nWe're listening to an interview with Nick chef and his father David Sheff recorded in two thousand date\nNick shift memoir about who struggled with addiction is called tweak growing up on methamphetamines David chefs memoir about his son's addiction is called beautiful boy which is also the name of the new movie based on both memoirs we'll hear more on this conversation after a break this is fresh air\nI this is Larry mantle next time on film we got critics review Halloween [noise] forty years after the original Jamie Lee Curtis returns this time is a grandmother\nFilm directed by

Israel and author who turns her art India deception when she can make ends meet now playing in select theaters\nThis is fresh air let's get back to ... interview with David shift in his son Nick chef they both written memoirs about coping with Nick's addiction to methamphetamines memoirs which are the basis of the new film beautiful boy starring Steve Carell\n[noise] I I think one of the things that you both had trouble with\nIn the rehab programs was the quote God top you know in the ... anonymous model\nYou look toward a higher power to give you strains and there's a saying that goes let go and let God David you describe in your memoir how ... year you were or are still are in an atheist and raise Nick without religion um did\nEither too I just felt guilty you asked me about what I felt guilty for I felt guilty for that too when we heard from some people that the only way to get sober and stay sober is\nTo embrace that and they try to broaden it by saying you know God can be whatever you conceive him to be it's a higher power and things like that it was like I Would say that it was just an excuse\nTo resist but I think ultimately\nI learned and I think he learned that you could not deny some of those basic principles including the first one which is your\nNick didn't agree for a long time it's just that that he was powerless over his addiction he thought he was in control he had to nearly died more than once before he finally I think accepted that and once you accept that I think you're in the door\nUm but I just I I think that that God thing you know in twelve step program an undercover I think it is a huge problem because I Try I spent a lotta timing trying so hard to practice prayer and doing all this stuff to make myself you know come to believe\nAnd ultimately you know when I sit with myself and the quiet moments you know when I'm Alone\nYou know I don't believe you know I think that for people who are just fundamentally you don't believe in God or any you know reason to this world or anything I think that they are at at a disadvantage in terms of getting help through these these kind of programs absolutely\nAnd we are their neurological system is different a different part of the brain is in control you know we think about addiction as a morally reprehensible choice but uh addicts act crazy because in a way that they are\nSo you know you're right in the book that I'm going through detox is just the first step you know after you've given up the drug and you've come out the other end you still need treatment\nAnd maybe not just you know twelve step kind of program maybe you really need psychiatric treatment and medication to help you through whatever the problem was that ... to your addiction and the first place\nThere was a really dangerous idea for so long that all someone how to do was get off drugs that had to detox fairly had to go through cold turkey and they would wake up in the morning and there'd Be Sober\nBeing sober is just the first step getting off drugs is just the first up and then treatment really begins if someone has psychological disorders most often they haven't been diagnosed whether they have or haven't they need to be treated if someone is struggling and some other ways in their life they\nNeed help you write that young people are more susceptible to addiction and an addiction is especially\nDangerous for young people and this all has to do with the development of their brain the part of the brain known as the prefrontal cortex is still developing when you're young to talk about the importance of that part of the brain in any I'm persons development and and then in addiction\nWhat kids are the most vulnerable to becoming addicted you know it's a really stressful time and their lives I mean we've you know being an adolescent is really hard but they're also is this underlying\nTeenagers' brains are developing more rapidly than at any other time in their lives but all the um parts of the brain don't develop at the same time the final part of the brain which is associated with judgment in rational thinking is lagging a so it's not in control and meanwhile the first part of the brain to develop\nIf the rear portion which is associated with pleasure sinking seeking an impulsiveness so it's in control we always think about teenagers being impulsive you know they want to experiment they have all kinds of crazy reckless behavior a lot of it is because of that their brain hasn't developed to the point\nWhere they can moderate these impulses\nSo it's much more likely that kids are going to use drugs and they're more likely to use them excessively\nSo the development of even slower the part of the brain that normally would regulate was help kids make better decisions isn't in control so they start using more and there's this cycle\nAnd that's where addiction comes from a Ninety percent of the people who become addicted started using when they were teenagers before they were Eighteen [noise]\nA lot of memoirs written by people who had been addict start within hitting bottom\nYou know the the absolutely worst imaginable thing that happened to them because of their addiction\nAnd then they hit bottom and then they go into rehab and they seek treatment and then things start to turn around and then the the book kind of begins and so many stories just like addict stories that are are you know are told you know start again with like hitting bottom and\nI think a lot of people assume that if you love somebody who is addicted to a substance\nThat until they hit bottom and until they really realize that their life is at stake that their dignity is at stake that there's there's no way they're going to give up\nYou know the drug or alcohol and you make a point in the book that that's not necessarily true that if you love somebody who's an addict you don't need to wait till they hit bottom you can intervene and perhaps intervene effectively\nIf you love someone who's an addict and their use is life threatening you don't wait until they hit bottom because that can mean that they're going to die you have to do everything you can to get them in treatment and now we know\nThat it's too dangerous to wait for a person to hit bottom I mean people were told that they had to let their kids you know their husbands or wives whoever it was they had to stand back not to intervene let them hit bottom so they would crawl into a treatment center and say please help me\nThat idea it's so dangerous that have killed so many people\nThe other problem with it is that this is a progressive disease which means as long as it's not being treated it gets worse addiction as a disease like anything else it's like cancer like heart disease like diabetes and we know\nYou know at the first signs of serious illness we want to seek treatment\nIf someone in our families had early warning signs of any of those diseases we would bring them to a doctor to figure out what is going on we would not wait until the disease progressed so we want to intervene in the second we get a sense of there's a problem\nBut you know with addiction and this is different from cancer a person has to be willing to change to stop using\nAnd um I mean you can lock them up in an environment where they can't get drugs you or you know whether that's prison or or you know put them in rehab where there's not going to be any drugs\nBut when they get out you know unless there's constant surveillance they still have to make that decision to\nTo not use 'em\nLet let me give me an example of a story that you've told about your son um when he was addicted that he would call you\nYou know from the street and say you have to pick me up I think I'm dying you have to come get me and take me home and you you didn't want to do that 'cause you've been burned before you take them home and he would he'd steal from you he would do things that would be dangerous for your younger children to observe [noise]\nUm so you finally said to him no I'll pick you up and I'll take you to rehab and your son said no I don't want to go to rehab doesn't work for me you need to take me home and you said\nCall back when you're ready to go to rehab and you hung up so if you had to do that over again would you think that that was the right way of handling it\nNo I tried though so many times to get him into treatment and I would do anything it took I Would drag him off the streets I searched for him when I could find him you know I I\nI just did whatever it took to get him into treatment and it hadn't worked every time he\nWould go into treatment he would do fine for a while and then he would relapse so my assumption was that relapse proved that the treatment hadn't worked but I now know is that many times not always but many times relapse as a part of this disease\nSo addicts get sober a it's a chronic illness the craving doesn't go away unless it's being treated and relapses common\nThat means that even though there was resistance going back into treatment\nEvery time I had to do whatever I could to get into treatment and when they called up begging me to go back telling me that he was going to die\nSo many times I I had succumbed I mean all I wanted to do with never mind to to to get him help but I just wanted to see him to see that he was alive\nBut I finally listen to the messages of these rehab programs that talk about this tough love thing and that he had to hit bottom and I hung up the phone and I kept\nBazaars thing I'd ever done and he did call you know just a few days later and said he was ready to go into treatment but he absolutely could have died\nIn that story you basically had two options and I can think of one has to say well if I'm not driving you rehab I'm not picking up at all and the other is okay I'll take you home you chose the if I'm not driving you to rehab I'm not taking new home in a while and you think you're lucky that he didn't die as a result and then he chose to go to rehab a few days later\nSo in retrospect do you think you'd have ... you should have chosen the other option is which is would have been I'll take your home and maybe you wouldn't have gone to rehab\nI think that every situation is different in retrospect it was fine in retrospect you know it worked but\nIf I was there again I Would have gone to get him and brought him home\nAnd John everything I could to get him into treatment because every day he was out there it was so dangerous I mean that night I didn't sleep of course I was just petrified and I had a reason to because he could have gone out and scored an overdose and died\nIf I got him home at least it would have been off the streets\nAnd I may have been able to get him back in treatment and I would have done everything I could to get him back the way I feel now yeah you want to get your kid off the streets it's too dangerous out
