with fresh air\nWe\n\nDid a poll dino who played a boy preacher and there will be blood a moody teenager and Little Miss sunshine and betrayed Brian Wilson in love and mercy dino co wrote and directed the new film adaptation of Richard forwards novel wildlife\nAbout a teenager who's unmoored watching his parents' marriage fall apart and doesn't know who to side with Jake Gyllenhaal and Carey Mulligan play the parents the story reminded they know about what he experienced when his parents' marriage started to unravel\nI think somebody else might have wanted to make a film about a kid rebels for me I remember sort of standing in the middle\nFeeling the ground shake and not wanting things to tip\nAnd Kevin White had reviews re issue of music by you know Rhoda [noise]\nFirst news\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Shay Stevens President Trump opened in ... Wisconsin campaign rally by denouncing bomb threats against several high ranking Democrats and others Marty Michael ... of member station WBUR WN reports\nI just remember I moved to a new town when I was fourteen\nYour home is sort of the edge of the world when you moved somewhere new ... because you don't know what's outside of it you don't have friends yet\nYou know school is not yet a release um it's sort of scary to go there for the first time and so we grew up in a one bedroom apartment in Manhattan I'm really close with my family maybe too close and I remember when my parents started having\nYou know struggles and their relationship sort of what a profound and I guess difficult moment that was for me so this book\nSort of reflected back to me how family is one of the greatest loves in our life\nAnd because of that it's also sometimes one of the greatest sources struggle in our life and he was able to capture that with compassion\nIn the clip that we just heard the parents are fighting and one of them says to the teenage boy what do you think Joe how awkward is that asking a teenage boy to weigh in on the battle between his parents were you in that position [noise]\nWell I think so and I think that's something I related to in this character I think somebody else might have wanted to make a film about I'm a kid rebels writer or something from their youth but for me\nI remember sort of standing in the middle feeling the ground shake and not wanting things to tip so Joe and I have something in common and and Richard forward and I have something in common in that regard I was somebody who wanted to keep things together so if something like that had been posed to me\nUm you know I wouldn't have said\nYou know I'm you know out of your like what are you know I Would have tried to actually understand what was going on and and then it can I help\nDid your parents separate well my parents have an interesting situation which is they separated they like the end of this book strangely which is out there in the film have resume living together a few years ago\nThey never got officially divorced but we did not always lived together [noise]\nYou were fourteen when your parents separated the character and wildlife is sixteen and the novel yeah but he's fourteen in the movie did you make um fourteen in the movie 'cause that was your age when your parents separate\nI made him fourteen because that's when I moved to a new town as to bring some family those in the film and that\nFelt like where I was emotionally connected to a time in my life I wouldn't say that officially when my parents separated I think there was actually previous to that there was some ins and outs in the relationship um [noise] so for me that was\nLike spiritually the right age to sort of put myself into the story\nAnother a kind of see him in the book is that this fourteen or sixteen year old boy is getting different narratives from his mother and his father as\nGoing through this turbulent period of their marriage and he has to decide who's right who to believe and um that's really tricky when you love both your parents and they're telling a different stories about what your future is going to be like is that something that you relate to also\nAbsolutely and that actually you've now reminded me of probably my the most exciting first hit I got on the book\nWas this feeling of the mystery of who are parents are do do do you know when you suddenly realize like they are past life without the problems are that they're real people you know in in sort of seeing them as a\nWhole people which means they're flawed people and that was exciting to me I I sort of had to get to know Jerry Anne Janette better probably as a means of understanding my own experience maybe being put in the middle as you say but especially Jeannette I was like this woman is so complicated and mysterious him\nAnd sexual yeah which is I think that's a really difficult for the teenager to deal with especially because she kind of includes him in a suction that she's doing\nYes and and I how I feel about that is this woman has probably been a good mother for fourteen years and the good wife and I think the data's tried in in in his way and I think they've done their best in many ways but suddenly like one day the rug pulled out from under you the charade as up\nAnd it's just like this kid is sort of been kicked out into the wild right you know it's like okay\nTime's up you this is welcome to the real\nWorld [noise] so you directly asked Richard Ford for rights to adapt his novel wildlife into a movie and he wrote\nBack to you in a letter he wrote back is included or at least excerpted in the press kits for your movie I'd like you to read that letter integrate letter\nI'm grateful to you for your interest in my book but I should also say this in hopes of actually encouraging you my book is my book your picture where you to make it as your picture you we're moviemakers fidelity to my novel is of no great concern to many\nEstablished your own values means go read the book behind so it doesn't get in the way\nThanks for reading that so was that liberating to read that like\nThe writer of the book is saying do your thing I'm okay\nI could not have written something better myself that you wouldn't want somebody like that to say to you I I was shocked and moved it is an incredible bit of wisdom and permission so considering how much I Meyer is writing in general and especially how much this book move me and how much it meant to me\nTo have that sense of permission was incredibly important\n[noise] we're there are lines from the book that you wanted to make sure we're in the movie and there's no voice over so it all the lines are dial up\nThat's right so the book is the first person and actually looking back on the event\nVery tempting to his voiceover especially because the language is so beautiful\nWe sort of set a challenge for ourselves immediately like let's try and not choose what let's see if we can do it without voiceover let's try to make this present tense and let's put it on the experience of witnessing this through the boys are starting to eat in a childhood you know it's sort of be opening image and slowly build back the layers of his portrait so that was the goal\nAnd their lines that I felt like had to be in the film that probably are not now do do you know because it just keeps growing and that's one of the most beautiful things experience of making a first film is the growth meaning\nWriting the script and putting so much working at the script honestly for for a few years because you just as an actor\nBelieving that the foundation is is kind of what we all stand from you know and and jump off of 'em and then suddenly bringing actors into it we're asking you questions were bringing subjects that you might not have even thought of\nAn emotion passes through them and it fills out something and suddenly you don't need that line that you thought was the essence of the film or something um you know in fact there is a line that's\nCut from the film that I think is really important which is warn the character named Moran Miller play by bill camp says to the kid Joe\nSometimes you have to do the wrong thing to prove that you're alive for me that line just pulled me over when I read it um\nI couldn't wait to put it in the film and then the edit room we didn't need it ...\nInteresting because it it kind of says that when I probably shouldn't even shouldn't even say now [laughter]\n[noise] do you have a lot more anxiety as a director and then you do as an actor\nAnd it's such a different kind of anxiety tell me about the difference [noise]\nIt was one a migraine and want us to them again [laughter] I don't I think that for me acting is just a bit more lonely\nBecause you do so much of the work on your own and then you arrive kind of hopefully full so to speak and and then you're with your scene partners\nIn your director and but directing is I'm\nSo collaborative it's more like you know\nPlaying in an orchestra or something and maybe you're you're one of the you know you're the leader maybe I don't mean arrogant man just me and that's the that's the job you're dumb\nAnd honestly one of the hard things for me was that I didn't have any alone time 'cause I'm quite used about somebody's always asking you a question somebody that you have to make millions decisions that day\nBut I loved that feeling of collaboration with every little bit of the crew and sort of just helping to create like a space where we could all kind of go to work together and you're almost like parenting like you're just trying to get the best out of every body and I found that really gratifying\nIf you're just joining us and I guess this fall day no we've probably know as an actor from films like there will be blood Little Miss sunshine and love and mercy now he directed his first film it's an adaptation of the Richard Ford novel wildlife the movie's called wildlife too will be back\nAfter a short break this is fresh air\nKBC supporters include triple the pizza a Roman style pizzeria in highland park offering indoor and outdoor seating beer and wine plus takeout\nAnd deliberate open daily moral triple being pizza DACA [noise] the James Irvine foundation expanding economic and political opportunity for Californians were working but struggling with poverty [noise] more at Irvine die or\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guess is Paul day no great actor who's films include there will be blood love and mercy Little Miss sunshine he's in a new Showtime series called escape at Dannemora\nIn your movies and in some of those you scream as you're being beaten up and you have different kinds of talk about different kinds of screens for different circumstance because you have like really high pitched screams like deeper screams and now they're in softer screams\nAnd that's very funny it's fun to build a character and I think that you do ask yourself where's the energy in this person's body for example right or their shoulders you know a little bit more back than mine\nAnd then I think the same with the voice you know you asked yourself or is this person living in the front or the back or ... you know the throat yeah with the mouse or the um and I mean it's really small subtle you know stuff but at least ask the questions and maybe try to you know\nIt's one of the questions you asked is this character stay strong or did they become a week when they're being being ensure\nAnd are they injuries there are they enjoying this are they you know terrified what what's the I mean how does that affect the screen [noise]\nUm well usually at that point you've tried to lay the groundwork so that when the moment comes it comes the way it's meant to ... or ... you know so I don't know that I Would intellectual lives like that but certainly something I'm may think about is um\nLike for example one of the times you're talking about as prisoners on the phone call prisoners and you know that person was somebody who was would be traumatized and abuse are very young age\nAnd I felt like his body was sort of frozen um you know the way that you react when you're scared your shoulders go up a little bit you know your neck gets a little tight and so then you know carrying\nThe history and cause the body holes that information your body does you know it it's a holding some of your history you're emotional life and and it does for all of us and and that is a part of the voice\nYou were directed at eight at age twenty two by one of the greatest directors of our time about how much energy and whether there's things you learned from him about directing about how to work with actors that you try to\nUm carry through and the rest of your acting career and now in your first time directorial effort\n[noise] yeah Paul I think has a lot of love I think he loves his actors and his crew\nHe has a an incredible eye for detail I think it's definitely been important for me um I've been wanting to have been a filmmaker for a long time to seen directors like this go to work meaning to see them wait for the oil drip to be right even though time and money is you know burning\nI remember one time or in a costume fitting you know him noticing something in the stitching of the tie that nobody else would have noticed you know I'm just sort of the focus the care\nAnd the integrity and it's also important when you see somebody like him I'm able to enjoy their work and and have a moment of fun probably too but I absolutely loved working with him and and frankly many of the directors I've worked with I think that the common theme is really um hard work\nThat talk about your found love and mercy and this is a story of Brian Wilson\nMost famous for for me to poison quest for his solo albums and I'm In this film there's two versions of Brian Wilson is the version you play when he's younger during the beach boys era and then the version later in life when he's having serious mental health issues and\nI'm reading listening that part of the play by drunk he sat\nSo I Want to pay scene from love and mercy you've been in this scene writing a God only knows great song and you play it for your father and your if your father who's played by bill camp in the movie is an abusive control freak he's various are carrying with his sons\nAnd I'm very hypercritical nothing's ever good enough for him and so you're playing the song for him while he's sitting and looking very tense and smoking has pipe so here's Paul day now and bill camp in a scene from having mercy\nA\nLast verse will be one more time in the chorus will harmonize over and over there\nSo rough I Know but it's gotten their wife or cause was she's I mean it'll get better that the vocal counterpoint to back it was for real soulful\nOr you don't want my advice for my lovely\nAnd just tell me what you think it's usually\nI'm living on her own\n[laughter] we're still family\nAmazon fired her own father that don't want to start or do you argue I say something he'll argue but don't say anything\n[noise] forget what forget what you don't like the song I never said that in cell\nJust say something I Would change the title the country's a tuna called God only knows fifty five\nFifty or eyeing that\nDid you close your eyes like I asked you to tell me and I think if you close your eyes you must see five\nSomething is happening it's like being blind but because you're blind you can see more don't you think it's a spiritual kind of thing\nI don't know what you're talking\nI close my eyes students yesterday\n[noise]\nI don't know maybe it could be something with a writing arranging your eyes French horn on it and flutes tambourine sleigh bells piano base real complex key shifts\nFrankly if you really want to do I don't care for\nUs to wishy washy if you leave me why leave me life will go on why go on living it's not like the beach boys on your brothers are going to hate it ... it's a suicide note fish you just say it could be something with the right arrangement well I gave in another thought okay\nIf you can't keep your voice down in my house\nSo that's my guest Paul day no and bill camp in a scene from love and mercy the full day notice brand will send him to a camp as his father Mary Wilson\nIsn't really upsetting seen I mean\nThat only knows it's such a beautiful song and the fact that his father either can't here that are doesn't want to hear that\nAnd that he's being so mean to such a musical genius it's very upsetting but in any way you had to seeing in a way that approximate it [laughter] you know Brian loss and you're at the piano or are you actually I Know you're doing the singing and I've seen you actually playing of course\nYeah and that's seen that's just live you know I'm playing and singing on camera that's not done after the fact you know that was just in the same\nYou used to be in a band called moved a new guitarist and um did you know how to play piano\nI could probably get formed a few chords but not really and you know frankly learning this music for this film of emergency\nListening to it or is probably one of the greatest joys I've ever had in my life professionally or personally I loved this music so much you know a particularly pet salads and smile\nI don't know Brian for somebody who struggled so much you get so much light in him and he met him\nYes yeah and when he when we talked about music he still felt like a school boy about it you know and you could be quite uncomfortable about most things but if you were with him and got him to music you know he he really but but by late inside of him I mean\nYou know he's he's really he's giving a piece of himself\nTo us and I think he wanted to help people heal which is such a considering the struggles that he had and you just heard in this scene you know to want to\nGive give that I'm through your music to somebody else who's experiencing you know um it's just such a beautiful generosity and and gift and you're listening to that scene now it's um you know not it's not just upsetting because he's in musical genius you mean he's offering himself to his dad\nYou know and we can get totally are jak did yeah unseen decor changes in love and mercy are so beautiful and so unpredictable and um so what did you have to learn those words like you'd you know how to play those scores let alone the sequencing of them\nNo no no no and I really started from basics and um and that was just so beautiful to have the piano opened up to me through Bryan I'm because the voice things did he teach you the court's not Brian a guy named area and isn't as bad as um helped me out and uh you know just started practicing day by day\nAnd saying we're doing vocal exercises you know and and and that's a really nice routine for somebody preparing for something let's say let me do thirty minutes a day of of singing at first and in this amount of piano and slowly you know learn you learn your chops sort of build them up get comfy\nBut I'm the other really fascinating thing about learning through ... through Bryan as his left hand the bass notes\nReally incredible um and that's really what changes the court off and he's not always you know emphasizing the route note um would you would say if you're playing a gee you know she's often emphasizing a different I'm new in the voice thing and that changes the entire sound of the court and it's actually something that I Believe Paul McCartney\nDot com or to a comprehensive treatment Center for autism and other neural developmental differences the physician led multi disciplinary team works to harness the insides of emerging narrow science now open at ... dot com [noise]\n[laughter]\n\n[noise] you're listening to talk on eighty nine point three ... see see we're talking about the growing trends of counter service restaurants ... places coffee shops using eye pad that they flipped around for you to sign with your finger tip\nOn your credit card purchase and typically pops up as part of the process\nHe suggested tip percentage\nAnd asking what you think about that again you know traditionally wasn't that long ago that there wasn't even a tip jar for counter service places just assumed you know that this ... this is not a tip to service then we started seeing tip jars typically at these locations\nAnd now the tip jar um if it's gone has evolved or a is now alongside the iPad form added way for you to tip\nAnd my question is for counter service do you think that's right where it eight six six eight nine three key PCC or the air talk page K.

P. C.

Nike school and this is what they're called you're either a Nike school and Under Armour school or in a de to school so let's say you're in Nike school and you're a basketball team is in the NC double a tournament\nWell you've got the Nike swoosh on your sneakers that's on your trunks it's on your Jersey or if you wear a wrist bands it's it's on your wrist bands if you wear a head band it's on your head band\nSo what they get in return for this money is the right to turn players who are ostensibly amateurs into human billboards\nRight and the contracts are very detailed right the players have to wear only their gear and they give the university bonuses if they do well that the shoe companies do\nWell as the teams do well if you're a Nike school and and you reached the final four or if you win the national championship your coach is sure to get a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand dollar bonus\nOn top of his multimillion dollar salary the assistant coaches are probably going to get a bonus the school may get more money the\nOnly ones who don't benefit monetarily or the players\nBut does does it does that bonus come from the shoe company or no I mean they\nIt comes from the shoe company yes directly from the shoe company and these are\nReally not big sums of money for the shoe companies you know Nike\nIs a multibillion dollar global company so it was a deed is Under Armour a little less so but these are huge businesses and the money that that seems to to us perhaps so big\nIt's not that big for them and it also means they don't really have to advertise like they used to I mean if you've got ten players on the court and there are running around in your insignia is\nWhy bother to advertise you know these are human action figures wearing your stuff\nFor tens of millions of Americans to watch and it makes advertising are\nReally redundant at that point it's much cheaper way to do it\nBig time college basketball programs obviously want the best players so there are scouting and competition in recruiting them and I think most of us would figure this would focus on\nHigh school players you know juniors and seniors who who prove that they have the chops and they visit their families they do what whatever to try and get them interested in their program\nI learn from your book this starch much much earlier how young are players when they start getting attention\nFifth or sixth grade players are as young as\nTen or eleven years old when the basketball ... the scouts start looking at them and saying are you a future college prospect are you a future NBA prospect\nAnd there are several reasons for this one of them is the size of players who make it to a big time college basketball and the NBA\nYou know there's somewhere between six foot three\nAnd seven feet and up so that really narrows the population so if you're looking at a young kid you're going to mostly look at a kid who's already begun already athletic and for that reason and some other reasons\nIt is relatively easier in basketball to look at a sixth or seventh grader and correctly say this kid's going to be at least a college player so it becomes worse it for the scouts to then prow the sidelines of fifth and sixth grade basketball tournaments\nAre their national publications or online sites that actually rate these players that have a lot of readers\nYes there are publications and scouting services that look at kids as young as fifth grade or one of them is called whose scoop it's run by a man named Clark Francis who I encountered several years ago and you know there are elements of Clark\nWhen you meet him that that you may not take him seriously he's a guy you know\nSpends his life looking at little basketball players the funny thing about him is if you go back and look at his towels sheets from five or six years ago and you look at the fifth and sixth graders who really\nMore in big time college basketball now or in the pros so we certainly not write all the time but he's not bad at at picking out the best players so what Clark Francis does whether you take him seriously or not is he lays down a foundation for people who then scout\nHigh school and middle school players and he sort of sets the sort of number of players who may be looked at\nAnd live recruiting services are and other business another way that young grass roots or high school players generate income for other people\nNow they're not just watching these kids in school jams right there is something called the grassroots basketball network explain who runs that how it works\nThe main recruiting grounds which I've also heard described as a hunting grounds is no longer high school basketball you know a high school game features maybe one star\nThe kid maybe six six and he's playing against a five ten kid\nSo what's the shoe companies created was the grassroots basketball circuit and that put all the best players against each other in these pressurized situations\nThat's where the college coaches go to scout and the person who created this ... sometimes called the godfather of grassroots basketball and sunny was a brilliant salesman an a and a brilliant\nSort of hustler in his own way so he realized the two things one was that to put all the best players together was going to create a better recruiting situation but he also realized that\nBig time college coaches really don't want to go to small town after small town and scout players they like to go to Las Vegas and stay in five star hotels or go to Chicago Orlando and stay in five star hotels and watch a bunch of the best players so sunny not only put the best players together\nBut he created a situation that's coaches loved\nRight so you have these tournaments that occur I'm In Chicago or Orlando or Las Vegas\nWhere the best players come in these prospects these kids their families take the ... and we're talking about middle school kids and a lot of cases right\nAnd there are these people who are not agents but you might call them runners street agents who sort of specialize in building relationships you describe a tournament in Las Vegas I think in July you want to just kind of paint that picture for us\nLas Vegas hosts some of the biggest grassroots tournaments so in July you will have a couple of hundred teams all age groups and a thousand or more pliers a couple of hundred\nCollege coaches and they're playing in gyms all over Los Vegas some of them are staying on the strip and they are being scout at not only by coaches not only by college coaches but also by\nThese characters who exist on the fringes I think of it almost like boxing back in the day these sort of Damon Runyon ask characters\nWho are there to sort of see what's in it for them and the one hand there can be seen as colorful but also just like boxing back in the day\nThey're exploited their dealers in human athletic flash and they are trying to get their hooks into kids and get their hooks into families\nAnd get into their inner circles and then to see what's in it for me can I deal this kid to a particular college can I associate him with a particular NBA agent\nAnd this is very much the scene on the grass roots circuit it's known and it's it's part of the background\nAre are there are kids who when they're you know twelve Thirteen fourteen kind of become celebrities kind of think of themselves as a business\nAbsolutely there are there are kids who you know this is their life and one of the things that really struck me when I have been around grassroots basketball\nIs the kids who referred to themselves as being in the business of basketball because that's how it feels to them they may be twelve or Thirteen Years old but they're in the business of basketball\n[noise] Michael ... book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino the story of corruption scandal in the big business of college basketball we'll continue our conversation after a short break this is fresh air\nMinds Nick Roman recovering addict in rural Missouri say what they call the methane explosion in that state is a warning for the whole country that story and the next all things considered we can't do that for an eighty nine point three Katie\nIt was about a year ago that federal authorities announced this\nSprawling indictment um what was it about what what did they allege the alleged that\nPlayers on the grass roots are used basketball circuit were\nBeing basically bribed to attend certain colleges um the money and many of the cases was to come from the shoe company that\nSponsored the college team they were going to in this case Adidas although there was evidence in the trial that strongly indicated that Nike and Under Armour are engaged in the same kind of activity so\nIn the three cases that\nWill be tried there are four assistant coaches at major programs charged and there were several\nOther figures on the grass roots circuit sort of sometimes called St runners or go betweens or consultants for the shoe companies they have also been charged and the question in each of these cases is we're there federal crimes committed or where they're just\nViolations of the NC double lays amateur ism rules which are not federal crimes right\nSo it seems clear from the evidence that there were relationships which seem to violate recruiting rules and the money changed hands right\nAbsolutely there's no doubt that money changed hands by the way relatively small amounts of money in the grand scheme of what we use apparel companies\nGenerate and and making profit\nThis young man named Brian Boeing junior who went by the nickname tugs a was a much sought after recruit ultimately signed\nUm with the University of Louisville which was poached by Rick Pitino just before the indictments and the events leading to his signing are among those involved in the criminal case what kind of money went to his family\nAre in front of them\nHundred thousand dollars was promised to Bryan Boeing juniors father that would be Brian Boeing senior although one hundred thousand dollars only Nineteen thousand five hundred was ever delivered the money was to have come from a dean\nIs that Nineteen thousand five hundred dollars is one quarter of one percent of the nearly eight million dollar annual salary than coach Rick Pitino was making so that to me is a pretty stark reminder of the inequity\nOf this whole youth basketball seen ... and then there was evidence that that wasn't the first time that Brian bones dad had taken money based on his son's athletic ability\nIt was clearly not the first time that Brian bone senior had taken money\nHe testified in court or under immunity from prosecution that he had taken money\nRepeatedly um four in return for his son playing for particular used teams or particular private high school in Indiana and there was a moment in court where\nThe defense attorney of Christian Dawkins one of the the runner these street agent said Brian bone senior on cross examination so you've been pimping out your namesake since she was fourteen years old\nAnd Bryan Boone senior only quibble about the age she paused for a second and then he said well maybe Fifteen or sixteen years old\nRight and is there any evidence that Brian bone and the kid himself knew about this or saw any of the money\nRyan Bowen junior had told the FBI and he told me when I interviewed him and he has told everyone he did not know\nThe money was exchanged that money was received by his father there's been no evidence that he didn't know he went from\nThe University of Louisville to the University of South Carolina he transferred last year the fact that the University of South Carolina took him in\nIs an indication that they certainly believed that that he had no knowledge of this but the NC double a still said\nYou can't play basketball last year and then ruled that he could not play college basketball this year and Brian bone junior is gone off to play professionally in Australia a end is over there now in Sydney has become one of\nA thousand overseas player is trying to attract the attention of NBA scouts he missed out on what is by far the easier route which is to play in college to be on TV to be known and just take that glide path right into the NBA\nSo Rick Pitino is that the coach was on the cover of the book um\nThe book is kind of about this system of corruption in recruitment but Pitino is a fascinating character\nUm you say it's not hard to make the case he's the best college basketball coach of his generation that tactical and motivational genius and to give us a sense an example of what he does it special\nRick Pitino one to national championships won the Kentucky won\nAt Louisville you also coach the Boston Celtics and the New York Knicks two of the more key franchises in professional basketball in college basketball particularly at Louisville he did something that's almost never done he won with out the best players most final four teams\nMost national champions are stocked with first round draft picks Hi first round draft picks of the NBA which are called lottery picks Rick Pitino one without those guys he coached\nGood players not great players he got them to play merciless defense they played so intense that he was a motivational on a tactical genius\nAnd you know by the way I Love watching him coach and he would stand on the sideline in in an athletic position with his knees bent and you know its head peering out over the court often one foot on the court and its hands behind him\nAnd I always got the feeling that he put his hands behind him because he was so intense that if they weren't there he would reach out and grab the balls that came by but he was just this amazing coach\nAnd in some ways you know that for him to be caught up in this is\nA a predictable and and be tragic\n[noise] now he lost his job he was not charged in the criminal case but ah Louisville overstated and he was given his walking papers after the indictment came out but you're right that this was not his first brush with scandal what were some of the others\nAre more than a decade ago Rick Pitino had a sexual ethic nation in a closed restaurant I'm with a woman who then tried to extort him\nAnd she was sent off to prison but he was the star prosecution witness who had to then recount in court\nThis incident where the woman who just met in a bank get everybody left the restaurant was terribly embarrassing and I would say\nAfter that Pitino was just a basketball coach um which of course he always was but I I don't think he could be seen as a necessarily a mentor to young men the second incident was in many ways more serious in Louisville it became known as stripper gate\nAnd what struck the gate was was four years of parties in the basketball dorm\nNot very far from ... office sponsored by a local escort and paid for by a member of Pitino staff and women danced and there were sexual favors for recruits and for current players and\nIn the ... in the NC double lays lexicon it's strange lexicon this was road to be\nIn permissible benefits to amateur players and Louisville actually lost its two thousand Thirteen national title over stripper gate so that was sort of in that was sort of strike one strike to end this recruiting scandal um and Pitino was not charged\nUm but it involved staff members and involved a recruit it involves Louisville\nMove it was a central thread in the FBI and Justice Department case\n... and in the strip or gay case we're talking about high school recruits coming to Louisville coming to a dorm where there were sexual things going on um what did Pitino say about\n\nRick Pitino who's written a couple of leadership books um but it's not really a model of of leader that most people would recognize employees is sort of circular logic when things go wrong\nAnd in the case of stripper gate and and there was an echo of this and the recruiting scandal he says I tell everyone to follow the rules\nSometimes they don't follow the rules and when they don't follow the rules they don't tell me about it because they know how angry I Would be so\nIn stripper gate and in this recruiting scandal there were people just one layer below him his assistant coaches or in one case is director of basketball operations who were
