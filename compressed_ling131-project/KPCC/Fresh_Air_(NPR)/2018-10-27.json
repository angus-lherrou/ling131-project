Bush is relative success with Hispanic voters\nThere is a feeling in a conventional wisdom that the only way to speak to Hispanics is with regard to immigration issues ... and I think that impulse to see this voting bloc as absolutely monolithic is part of what\nHas led to this ingrained political apathy\nSo because both parties have for so long struggled maybe even failed to understand that Latinos are not ... that there are a variety of interest and issues\nAnd passions in this electorate that they're both still talking to them as if they were among the with and that it's that blind spot inside both parties that further alienates Latino voters\nAbsolutely ...\nAround sixty percent of registered Latino voters nationwide or not even being contacted by these campaigns and when they are it's largely focused on President Trump and his comments which didn't motivate them to turn out in twenty sixteen and about immigration policy which we've been hearing about for\nDecades how much longer are we going to endorse so many little five ... enough and that kind of brings us back\nTo that ad we started our conversation talking about this outside group that's what you know group\nVery much worried that Hispanic voters are being ignored by both parties but especially the Democrats decided to take matters into its own hands but in doing so and creating this ad\nFocuses on this one issue immigration that pretty much ignores this political diversity that you just described to kind of commits the same sentence in a sense\nRight exactly and it's also coming out just two weeks before the election and so you know of course this ad you know had shock value to it which is supposed to grab eyeballs but the truth is that there's only so much that you can do in the last two weeks before an election\nIf in the run up to November you haven't made sustained contact with some of these voters about the various issues that they're interested [laughter]\n\nSo I guess in a sense because this mid term already feels like a little bit of a wash when it comes to Latino voters it's a question of who gets to them in time for the next presidential election twenty twenty\nAnd what we find is a real chicken and egg situation when we're trying to figure out how to bat\nWhich you know voters and get them to turn out are they not showing up because nobody is reaching out to them or are people not reaching out to them because they're not showing young\n[noise] and [noise] and and the [noise]\nSay thank you very much for having [noise]\n\n\nThe daily is supported by carbon night offering secure data protection solutions for businesses including automatic back up the servers advanced end point protection high availability and disaster recovery solutions and automated data migration learn more at ... dot com\nAnd by fracture creating modern photo decor and gifts by printing photos directly on glass a fracture is an image frame andme out all in one hand made in a carbon neutral Florida factory learn more attracted me dot com slash daily\n[noise] the daily it's powered by the journalism of the New York times and is distributed by ... pm American public meeting\nYou can go deeper into the stories you hear on the daily\nNY Times dot com slash [noise]\n\nYou trust KP sci fi too old elected officials accountable and provide you with balance reporting an in depth analysis so we laid off all member Dr until after\nThe midterm elections we rely on your financial support to make trustworthy programming for KP CCN NPR possible do donate today to power responsible reliable journalism\nThat matters to you and your community and show your support for a fundraiser free election season give now at ... dot org and thanks\nThe investigation continues into the suspicious packages tend to critics of President Trump will have the latest also Russian trolls draw to influence American by reading about what ball players kneel during the anthem\nWhat their efforts were aimed at we're sowing discord so if you're attempting to divide people this is a pretty great subject and\nSaturday on weekend edition from NPR News new tomorrow morning starting at five on eighty nine point\nThree KBC C.

Stevens authorities say the Florida Man accused of sending Thirteen package bombs to prominent Democrats is already charged with five federal crimes as NPR's Quil Lawrence reports the suspect was arrested friday near Fort Lauderdale\n... yeah [laughter] I mean all of that is true the the I mean it would never really was his particular drug of choice I mean he always prefer amphetamine he likes the drugs but\nHe did use heroin and the song does come out of his own experience which is you know I think another element of lose work you know it was grounded in his own life\nHe would make the point and it's a point worth making ... you know he is not all the characters in these songs but you know close enough\n[noise] you know one of the things that's so fascinating about Lou Reed is that okay so this is one of the really early songs that he writes heroin\nAnd at the time he's working for a quick writing songs to order he's writing like knock off of like surf sons and their families about Detroit and California and a phone call the ostrich which was supposed to be like a novelty dance on to start a novelty craze that never got started on ... and before that\nUm he was discovered at like a high school dance um that he was playing with like an early high school band and he was brought to Bob shatter record producer who is also Jetta epitaph grandfather [laughter]\n... yeah yeah and ... have them like record a few things like writing record iffy things and one of the songs I really want to play this [laughter] when I was called merry go round and so how old was Lou Reed when he records that\nWell you know she began recording really road was in high school you know and he you know kind of continued to make records after that but you know you could really see the kinds of influences that he was working with at this point\nI mean a certain sense has worked at ... I Hope to him 'cause it was wide working in a form writing emergency room you know they would you know just kind of okay you know surf music is happening you know right turns her songs or love do up you know right about you do up songs or read a bunch of songs about cars are songs about teenage love tragedy\nAnd so merry go round is kind of an expression of that period of his writing where it's identifiable as ... but also you can hear him working through a you know the various kinds of genres but she was a kind of task to work\nWith it's just so the guy who writes like heroin and writing for waiting for the man writes this lyric from merry go round I walking home every day from school but still you treat me like a fool [laughter]\nAbsolutely this is a very interesting thing about\nSo I mean I think there were those both those part I mean people would ask me I knew him\nAnd you know people would ask you know like so you know if you run into Lou Reed what his liver you talk about how we talk about like Lesley Gore by ... roller under\nYou know he loved pop music and that was true at the same time as he also wasn't always doing that by any means but he was taking pop elements even you know on that first of all the underground record if you listen to attract like you know there she goes again nobody lifts\nYou know Marvin Gaye hitchhiked for the risk\nThere's an element of loving what pop music is and all of those teenager motions in a certain way you know this is the kind of overstatement it's a little sentimental but in many ways it's kind of true I mean lose deep\nPassionate love of doo wop in that kind of adolescent swept away on the wings of love and it was very essential emotion for him and it remain that way\nSo let's hear merry go round 'cause you really hearing Lou Reid's voice but he hasn't quite be calm\nAnd very very popular so that hearing about hockey town [noise] really [noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThat was Louis before the velvet underground when is he still\nIn high school any records that [noise] um I think so yeah All right I'm\nOkay and and I guess is Anthony to Curtis who has a new biography of ... called Lou Reed alive we're going to take a short break and then we'll be right back this is ...\nHi this is Lorraine natural next time on film we got critics review this area a remake some forty years after ... our genders original Dakota Johnson until just went through the storage film week every Saturday at noon here on eighty nine point three key PCC\nKeep you see the Los Angeles magazine new vendors Susan every side showcasing locally sourced ingredients in food stuff including farm fresh green like you know cheese is weird faces and more now available on newsstands\nIf you're just joining us my gas is Anthony to Curtis a contributing editor at Rolling Stone magazine and now the author of a new biography of lead\nI Want to ask you about a period of Lou Reid's life that a lot of people have spoken about\nI think he chose not to speak about it publicly\nAnd I'm Talking about the period where he had a electroshock therapy electron ... therapy and this is when he was in college and I'd always heard that this was because his parents were afraid that he was gay what did you learn about the electric shock therapy and why he had\nWell I think that Lou was acting out in a variety of ways while he was in high school you know she was certainly using drugs wild mood swings you know we definitely enjoy getting under particularly his father's skin\nAnd he also was acting out like you know people would see his kind of gay life almost in formative terms you know you'd walk around and you know limp arrested and you know shaking his hips and all this stuff in front of his father as a way to essentially aggravate him\nBut there were more serious problems with him you know I think that's a you know certainly the drug use and the rebellious knows the family was very conventional and you know as a kind of\nYou know middle or upper middle class a Jewish family in the suburbs you know they went in consulted doctors about the kind of problems that they saw\nAnd the doctors are advised this you know electro convulsed with therapy which reads so it's a kind of torture he wrote about it he wrote a song called kill your sons about it which is kind of an insect stern palm center music\nAnd to him it was a ... you know it was a very decisive dividing line in terms of his relationship with his parents but one thing I learned from talking to his sister and other people who knew him well back then it was parents really loved him and his father\nI mean his mother feel guilty about the shock treatments for the rest of her life until she died I think his father thought that he did the best he could do was you know lose creating a lot of problems and he needed to address them somehow\nBut you also write that once when ... came home from college\nThat he was basically like non functional and his parents were concerned that he was in a terribly deep depression the doctor said you know he might have schizophrenia am I getting this right yes and that's that that that that also figure into\nThe the shock treatments and his sister tells you oh our parents were were very liberal and they weren't homophobic so it wasn't about their fear of him being gay but I was thinking what like everybody was homophobic then\nWell that's right and that's the thing I don't think they were more homo phobic than back you know they were just kind of a conventional suburban ... Louis bringing into their life everything that they were supposed to not have to deal with any more after having left the city there was a vision of the suburbs when they moved in the Nineteen fifties as this kind of\nEden of peace and you know lose various outrages under which they would certainly have filed a you know he's going to gay bars and acting out\nAs a gay person you know we're elements of that but it wasn't like we're going to make him straight you know I don't I just don't think that was part of it we mentioned\nWhen you mention gay bars and and him being gay but he's also with a lot of girls at the time I\nWell yeah that's true and that and there are people\nI mean this was a really I mean it's a very it's an issue very much at the moment interestingly because I'm kind of gone around the block you think he was on it like flu it in his actual alley yeah I mean one of his girlfriend's a describes them as inter\nAnd [laughter] it's kind of interesting usage I think you know there was part of Lu I think that was up for anything and\nBut I've had gay friends gay male friends I write to me and say you know you describe this element of Lou but he was really gay\nAnd the other day I got one of those and it was you know as a pretty stern email that you know made me think about what I had written I had lunch with one of his former girlfriends she was saying look there's no way Louis gauge\nHis sexuality with something I think you know as you gauge the adage you so you wanted to see you know and I I think Louis kind of hoping to go and wherever that was\nUm you know needy is a word that came up a lot a and talking about lose relationship would lovers and um [noise] uh you know part of that\nIs you know he I mean ... hated being alone a at any time and so you know that obviously the demands on the relationship but also he wanted\nYou know these women you know in in certain instances to come and work for him you know it was lighting designer our manager or just be with him all the time or you know record companies would call them and just say no look lose you know feeling this or doing that is it possible for you to calm and you know calm him down\nI'm so there was that but there was also you know they also talked for about a kind of sweetness I mean Shelly all been his college girlfriend um there's just a delightful person I've gotten to know are a bit\nUh talk about you know just the difficult I mean who would hide drugs and her dorm room you actually gotten kicked out of schools could have gotten arrested you know it was you know it was not a nice thing to do to somebody that you cared about\nBut you know as you were talking about the difficulties of I mean always having affairs are boys and girls and using drugs and\nAnd that you just said you know but still like Lew is the only boyfriend I ever had who on Valentine's Day give me you know this gigantic red heart shaped box of chocolates you know and\nHe loved it I mean there was a kind of conventional allergy to him you know he would a gesture like that would you would seem really meaningful to him he married his second wife on Valentine's Day and\nYou know those kinds of aspects of who he was um you know ... what ran through this kind of double ... you know there's this kind of burying these women in himself at the same time as you know that are kind of sweetness that you wouldn't necessarily anticipate that\n... that his first wife told you that he physically abused her which is he did which is why she finally left him right did you hear that from from any of the other women here as well\n[noise] uh no I did not uh and although you know there were other instances of other women who were less casually involved with them\nOr you know it was you know I'm a part of who he was I mean that kind of anger and desire for control manifested itself and that you know obviously despicable way a and\nYou know yeah Betty certainly felt it you know there was a um\nYou know I don't this is not to justify this there's a song called Caroline says two on Berlin\nAnd uh the lyrics go Caroline says she gets up off the floor you could hit me all you want to but I Love you anymore and first of all I mean for lines that's like a little movie\nAnd it gets that the kind of desperation in hitter you know I think that there was a an incredible level of fear of abandonment and\nAnd terror and that's what motivated his violence you know it it was you know the no way I mean it was I mean it doesn't matter what the motivations were to a certain extent unless you're trying to understand this person um you know it's it's a heinous act\nBut it it's coming out of a kind of desperation I mean it's less about hostility than ah than it is a ... about a kind of self hatred and and fear\nAnd he's out there like me and drinking and using drugs and who knows how how that's affecting him to certainly I don't know much out of connects not that's not helpful if you have a bad temper and if you have a tendency to be out of control\n[laughter] certainly not yeah certainly not and it was a you know that was very much part of his life um you know in those days I'm\nOne of his partners for about three years was transferred his um ... Shaffir\nYeah yep yep she was\nAnd so they were together for three years and um he dedicated his um Coney Island baby to her her name uh west Rachel I'm what can you tell us about Rachel in her relationship with really well that's a you know that kind of story\nRight it is extremely complicated subject and I'll Try to distill it you know ... you know he met a\nRachel in an after hours bar and just really fell in love with her and this was one of the revelations of the book\nTo me you know I knew about Rachel I mean he wrote about her so uh yeah I was aware that she existed but you know in my mind you know in a casual ... Lew he's wild he'll do anything but in fact you know there was a real depth to that relationship and you know they had\nYou know they live together or they entertain together they went out together it was bowl I mean if uh you know if a if a rock star of loose stature did that now it would be\nYou know regarded shocking and you know certainly in the seventies you know it was you know just kind of unheard of\nBut um you know there was genuine affection there and also ritual is kind of also a kind of road manager for the ... very interesting thing I was a contemporary peace where\nA a writer named Caroline Kuhn a British writer was writing about being with Louis Rachel never kind of arguing like Louis saying what's going on here like you are supposed to take care of me like why am I taking care of you and it was sort of playful and it was a fight and there was also a reality to it you know like\nYou're supposed to be arranging the cars to the venue and you're supposed to be talking about what I Need like\nThe ... you know uh why am I looking after you know you and your problems\nBut Rachel how the secret life you know Rachel was out on the street and would um you know she pulled a knife on the girls who was looking at Lew backstage at the bottom line you know just wander off\nOr you know people will recall seeing a Rachel a you know beaten up not as a result of her relationship would loose seemingly but you know just out of the other kind of\nA situation that you would get involved in and it was\nA you know in that kind of thing I think really has an appeal for Lu the idea that I think anybody who\nDidn't fully um submit to him he didn't fully become part of his world who kept something to themselves or I think that that only kind of enticed his interest and uh you know a\nRachel's life as a hustler was who was something I think that had a real appeal for them\nWell let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is Anthony ... is the author of Lou Reed uh life will be right back this is fresh air [noise]\nThe the the the supporters include the NFL presenting Beethoven's fifth this weekend to both Disney concert hall the Los Angeles philharmonic rings tonight the iconic energy and inexorable power as Beethoven symphony number five\n... some phone glittering elegant fifth piano concerto that this weekend tickets at ... dot com\nWhen you listen to ... you hear factual index award winning news covering Southern California in the world is an important part of our funding comes from the under writers who support our programming\nUnderwriting is a great way to get your name out to his staff in diverse audience it's a mutually beneficial partnership your business gets great exposure while you support facts based independent journalism on Katie the fee for more information on becoming an underwriter physically PCC dot org slash underwriting\nOh\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from progressive insurance offering a way to buy a home insurance with their home quote explorer tool custom quotes in rates are available online learn more progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive now that's progressive\nAnd from tulip pictures presenting ... inspired by events and Mexico's Bermuda Triangle the zone of silence to save her son's life a woman must find a stone that holds the power to turn back time in ...\nTheaters today this is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Anthony ...
