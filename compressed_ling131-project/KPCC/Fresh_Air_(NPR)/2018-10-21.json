PCC in years to come\nAll I I think that uh Southern California public radio and LA is in Cape BCC and I'm unheard of LA are going to continue to grow\nAnd it's not just because other people are abandoning the field um I I think that the service that we provide is absolutely critical to um the I I think we are a lynchpin within specific and cultural fabric of this community and I think that that's going to continue and grow and and then that's that's my expectation\nAlright bales a great working with you as always thanks for leading things off the appreciate my pleasure Hi Bill Davis\nCEO presidents Southern California public radio joining us on this special broadcast from studio ... away at eighty nine point three K PCC\nFrom the ... broadcast center in Pasadena where today thousands of K PCC listeners are coming through on our annual open house if you want to see\nStudio away or right there on your route laptop or your phone you can visit Facebook dot com slash ski PCC our Facebook page we are streaming live right now with me as a ... outlook character who is our program director at\nCape BCC south thanks so much for coming in talking for a few minutes late to be there so sad outlets was talking about the composition of cake D.C sees the audience we see the kind of age range and regional ranges people come through here today you know ... ... what a key PCC listeners have in common from your perspective\nThey're curious they like to learn\nUh they they like being entertained that's part of it to 'em but then this is this is fantastic because uh they're they're right here ah you know\nI never had a chance to connect with ... with radio when I was when I was a kid and I loved the radio I was a radio junkie yeah and you see the passion and these people just coming out and being able to connect with us now clearly were in the studio and we're saying Hi and they're looking in\n'em but to tour the studios to see the people they listen to every day to interact with them\nYou know that's something we could never do\nUm we didn't even know what they look like\nIf if you remember back then so you know our audience here there and they're totally passionate they bring their kids um they want to meet all the people not only just the the uh the ... air talent they wanted me to everybody and they have questions there once I get out there I'm sure I'm going to get on board and\nI'm sure you will yeah one of the things I Love is is that as you said the people that are on the air it's just a little tip of the iceberg of everything that that goes on and that's one of the reasons we're doing is ours to give a sense\nOf of all the people that it takes to bring you the programming on Cape BCC and I think that's\nPart of the fun is so when you listen you realize oh it's not just you know one person saying that might we know that intellectually but I've met the news editors I met the people in the development department I met the program director he gives you a very different feel when you tune in right\nRight there's a lot that goes on behind the curtain so to speak yeah and when you come here and see everything that goes into the whole operation or not just from the the the product but development or underwriting uh every everything upstairs where the officers are it it's a big operation one\nOf your principal jobs is to\nDetermine where we're going and sort of in this larger media landscape and as you look at\nGeneral usage of radio declining overtime pod casting being a you know more popular a streaming in the car ... how do you think live radio competes water water the ways that Kay PCC another public radio stations can deal with that overall change\nRight well there's there's two ... two answers to that is\nOh one we create content we create important relevant content that could be what we say is platform agnostic\nOr you could listen to it on your computer you can listen to it on demand a little bit later or you can listen to it live and that that is the radio factor so so how do we keep radio relevant\nIt we our current we are in the moment we are relevant to what our audience wants to hear at that specific time\nAnd I think we're doing that better than we ever have and that to me is the secret sauce of of radio\n... in it and to me it doesn't really matter what the platform is my\nMy mother lessons you know through Alexa shift if she missed an episode of air talks say or you know Mrs that take two segments should just it doesn't really matter the platform because it it's the the intimacy of audio to me is the same regardless of how it's delivered\nI I totally agree I I I think that the two factors really is and what do you want to listen to something later\nOr is is there something you need to hear immediately and and that's the that's the key to radio or listening to radio on line or any of those other platforms Alexa for example on line [noise]\nUm but being in the moment and relevant and local and talking about what's important to your\nSpecific listening audience which which is the greater Los Angeles area uh that's what keeps us different sets us apart from other mediums that might be out\nThere [noise] All right ... thanks so much to really return on a salad I have conversations that go on at some length about the nature of radio that changing audio landscape 'cause\nWe're both ... radio nerds growing up with it and\nAnd love the media men it's fun to be able to talk about the ways in which it's evolving well that's just one of the conversations
