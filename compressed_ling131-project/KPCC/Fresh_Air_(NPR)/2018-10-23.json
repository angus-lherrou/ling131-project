his daughter had just cause him with the news about the fifty thousand people on the painting lens and they both rechecked their voter registration when when you check that she was all good too yeah OK and found out that they were okay but there was really indicative of the type of panic that's going around especially among black voter\n[noise] Hi my name's to settle for five I met another\nWoman

lingered beneath the surface in Georgia politics these are majority African American voters either just proportionately voters who don't come out in mid term and this is just another reason\nThat may make it more difficult for them to do so or make them feel as if this is not a race that is for folks\nLike they can tell us how great\nIt is also gotten worse since early voting began this week

paramedics because he wanted to make sure his boat without ... and people in those communities think that this is an intentional effort from ... to make sure that the Democratic parts of Georgia have a hard time as possible and try to vote because perhaps there aren't enough polls\nBecause eight percent of all polling locations have been closed in Georgia and the last six years and this year with

legislatures are particularly important to the side things like gerrymandering drawing the districts for voting\nAnd deciding kind of who how in the states and that's a really important power that

Stevens President Trump campaigned alongside his one time Republican rival Ted Cruz on Monday NPR's Scott Horsley reports that Cruz is facing a competitive reelection race in the traditional leave red state of Texas\nHow difficult yet Jimmy always so witty and kind of fascinating she was so I I I got a lot of the the characters from that and then the rest you know I kind of conjured in in created\nSo it was something I thought it was a very deep telling detail about Lee Israel's personality is that she had a Twenty one year old cat who was like in from\nAnd I'm at old and living under the bed and I'm her apartment was infested with flies yeah and\nShe writes I found no connection between the flies and my cat litter box although it should've been clear\nThat she was doing what my grandmother and you know used to call her business under my dad and her business was attracting flies I did not smell anything rather like those serial killers who garnish their flats with hacked off human parts but never seem bothered by or even aware of\nThe stench and I can't help but wonder like\nHow you see on the film that the whole underneath her bed it's just covered with cat who and she's totally unaware of it but when someone else walks in an apartment they they have to leave 'cause it's smell so much so you have to ask yourself right when you were playing her like how could you not have noticed\nWell how how far into denial and there was such an inner I thought you know there was such an inner spiral for Lee in terms of\nJust shutting down and pushing people away and and and going inward and so much play I kind of there was there seem to be such a struggle and interior struggle\nFor her and so much a kind of anger and frustration and it was it a point in her life where the one thing she could do which was right in she was a great writer [noise]\nShe was being told she was obsolete and I think she was just no longer you know just as though in the same way that she was not flexible are capable enough of simply starting a new career or even getting a job and just dealing with people she she did not have that\nAbility she could only do the one thing and I I think the more her life spiraled out the less\nShe could you know see what was literally right there in front of her with like you know I I think there's a thing when people kind of just start to barricade on the interior of themselves that they're you know you do truly become in denial of what's right in front of your face\nIf you're just joining us my guess is Melissa McCarthy and she stars in the new movie can you ever forgive me\n[noise] so I Want to ask you about something you did so well which is playing Sean Spicer and Saturday Night live\nPresent Trump's first press secretary who had a very oppositional relationship with the press so here's a here's here's the the leaving at least here here's your first outing as Sean Spicer on Saturday Night live [laughter]\nThink we\nShould [noise] me too\n[laughter]\n\n[laughter] you know\nAnd now his Supreme Court pick on the national TV when he entered the room\nGreeted him with\nFind that everyone\n[laughter]\n\nWas [noise]\nSomething else [noise] now\nWell how's your core screening of finding [laughter]\nForget show everybody\nThen if he's going to polish the national park system [noise]\n[laughter] right [laughter] and which aren't I was ... what do you think listening back to it\nI it's strange to hear back I forgot I'm just kind of how truly absurd it it was and yet kind of true to form so I also rattling\nI always wanted to know whose idea was it for you to play Spicer did they call you it's that does that in a lot of folks call you and ask you to do it or did you suggest the idea to them\nNo ... no I did not suggested I Would never ever have thought of that than a million years um my friend can sublet that's I'm\nOne of the head writers at us and now that I Know you know going back to the ground links theater in Los Angeles uh he called and said would you ever come in and do Spicer I wrote something that I I think you can play and I was like what the the what I Can't play him I don't\nI don't you in person nations I'm not a man I don't know I have I have no interest it's not in my wheel house and he just kept saying you know I think could do it I think you know just come and can I can I send you to read\nAnd I I think I said I don't think it's quite my thing and and then I Believe the next day I saw\nAnother rather you know insane press conference where I thought well this is weirder than anything I could actually do like we can't even we can't even match it on us and now it's so absurd and I just thought\nOkay I'm going to come in and read it and talk to you guys about it and\nYou know I think and then the the real humbling blow as I thought well how how long is it going to take like can can we even get me to look like him and the really lovely a special effects guy there just said oh yeah those are going to be hard at all that will take like a half an hour\nWhich I thought oh I thought it might be harder to switch over to a man that really was it and they got it down to like you know at one point we were doing it and like you know Fifteen minutes but\nIt was just thought to I think I got the ... I started to think may maybe it's time to kind of hold hold a mirror up and to see if anyone realizes how kind of ridiculous they're being\nSo one of the things that you became famous for within that sketches the moving podium which you kind of Dr aggressively [laughter] reporters and then there was like one a one sketch we actually drove it down was the Fifth Avenue in Manhattan\nWe were all over Manhattan in that podium which was very surreal shooting it I I think I pitched it at one point of you know do we go\nWe kind of ceiling to the to the sunset and I think I just actually thought it would be fun to drive kind of a Segway podium around Manhattan I didn't think they would ever let me do it all is said why is that what it was on\nWell it was kind of based on that some you know these incredible people built this whole rigs so it was kind of a podium sitting on a a Segway type of contraption but they've built they built this whole thing and and rigged it but\nIt was weird there were just\nYou know all up and down the streets there were all these people watching and then you can I'd look up into the building and just see you know hundreds of people kind of press against the glass and I thought this is the most surreal moment I'll probably ever have\nIf you're just joining us my guest is Melissa McCarthy and she's now starting in the new movie can you ever forgive me so we'll be right back after a break this is fresh air [noise]\nHealthcare is a problem that people in his district face every single day in New Jersey with fewer than three weeks until the midterms repealing Obamacare is a major issue at a hotly contested congressional race issue of leaving many voters on the phone [noise] have you decided to have\nI don't know I'm a little bit on\nThat one I'm not sure that's on the next MORNING EDITION from NPR News ... eighty nine for three Cape you see that\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Melissa McCarthy she's starring in a new movie can you ever forgive me which is based on a memoir by Lee Israel\nWho when she started being unable to sell new book ideas decided to forge letters by literary greats and make money selling those four letters as if they were originals\nSo something else you're very famous for as your role and bridesmaids and the most famous or maybe I should say infamous scene [laughter]\nWhen the bride and the bridesmaids get food poisoning as they're trying I like really expensive fancy bridal dresses yet and you know bridesmaids dresses and they get like super sick and of course there aren't enough bathrooms so you end up sitting on the bathroom sink in your expensive gallon that you're trying on in the whole scene is very intentionally gross\nAnd I'm Wondering how you felt about that scene because part of a of the scene part of a point of the movie is that you know women can do gross that comedy just as men can and it really wasn't a point of it okay and then ...\nNone of us felt that way about it and that that scene was actually kind of injected into the film\nKind of late into the process and I think at first everyone bristled at it and thought we don't want to do this grossing for the sake of gross it really isn't any of our humor we didn't find it funny\nAnd people would put boxes of cats I cannot drive I always thought it was kind of sad and and terrible but we we take 'em in and as kids we'd love it\nThink I think it did definitely frightened parents\nOf my friends the first time you know the first time I got taken home\nThere was always a bit of a catch in my chest of like when they finally get down to a gravel road than they pull into the driveway there are going to be twenty five cats that rush out to the car in a very friendly way but it does seem like oh and this is this is how will all be killed\nAnd I just remember the first time parents were always like oh my God oh my God I'm like it's fine I'll get out here I'll just get out here and they're like well why do you have so many cats\nAnd you know it's like an eighty eight year old kid you're like well I'm you know we just take them in and it's not as weird as it looks meanwhile you know they were just like get out get out of the car\nWhen did you see them you must have had a lot of cat food there's a lot of cat food there were we'd make like big pictures of food I remember using ... have not thought about this\nWe believe these carnation powdered milk and we'd like rip up bread and lots of cat food and make this kind of stoop concoction and then go out on the back porch and you know and call all the cats and\nThat's a lot of have to come running at one point you know especially if some of the cats were new we're in a little more slightly feral my mom was very I'm aware\nOf making sure all the cats got pets so they got used to people and used to being around and she's really sweet so Sandy would always pet each cat while they were eating and make sure that they get used to like people touching them and at one point she was out there doing that and when she stood up\nShe realized that one of the cats was a skunk\n[laughter] she she had been chatting and heading this kind of like you like that is that a good\nDinner or and then she stood up and the light that she had been blocking with her body the light hit the skunk\nSo yeah it was a all all were welcome I guess is the take away their hope she didn't get sprayed by the skunk she didn't it just kept eating she got you know it's probably the only time for sure that got hit by a human\nMelissa McCarthy at what point did you start thinking about uh either acting or comedy which came first like acting or comedy that combination standup\nStandup came first I'm In kind of\nSuddenly and I moved to New York when I was twenty kind of out of the blue or hadn't living in Boulder, Colorado I'm not sure exactly what I was doing or why it was even there I moved there with my sister and then just it was still kind of lingering\nAnd ah had a friend come and see me and say why are you in Boulder and I said I don't know I only want to be in New York so three days later I moved to New York city\nThat night he found a place to do stand up the next an open Mike night the next day because\nNot necessarily talked about stand up but I think\nI kind of did a lot of telling stories and like to you know I found it fun to make people laugh and our first night he said you should do your you're going to do an open Mike night tomorrow night and they said All right I think because I was twenty and\nYou just kind of think everything's not a big deal I figure you know now I Would be terrified but at twenty I just went okay that seems fine we're not doing anything else and I went up on stage the second night I was in New York and\nI kinda thought oh I think this is what I'm going to do and I remember calling my parents saying I'm not going to go back to school\nI had planned on finishing up at FIT I hadn't finished school is the fashion I wanted to yes and I wanted to do women's clothing it's kind of all I kind of ever thought about from you know my grandmother was a seamstress maybe that was embedded in me but\nIt was really my it's what I did on you know I really loved it I Love making clothes I loved\nWatching other designer studying what they did I Love the whole process I was always sketching and then they did stand up one night and I just thought I think I'm gonna go this direction\nDo you remember any of the material you did that first night\nI Do strange I'm sure it was terrible uh I was at stand up in New York I'm for an open Mike and I remember I first of all I hadn't written anything I just kind of got up on state I didn't know that you were supposed to write I mean just oblivious oblivious to any any preparation or\nAnd they went up on stage and you know I had a big way gone and kind of a very eccentric you know I think it was like a silver\nMetallic kind of trench coat dress and and I remember just starting to talk about being in New York and being so\nTall and and wealthy and having everyone love you so much and I think at first it really through people as um you know it seems so you get hysterical and narcissistic and I thought oh they're not liking this\nAnd they wouldn't harder and I kept complimenting myself more and more but in ways that these were not factual compliments I was saying everything I wasn't\nI had you know Thirteen since I was not tall I was not fabulous and I'm sought after in New York so I Do remember that feeling of them realizing that I'm making fun of myself I'm not complimenting myself\nAnd then when they started to laugh I just thought oh this is really fun and this is really strange and fun and such a tight rope backed of where they didn't like me a minute ago and now I think it's okay and then I could say anything because they knew it wasn't\nSerious and I think I pulled somebody up on stage and talked about us being engaged\nAnd he was clearly there with a date [laughter] and I didn't really know how to do jokes are just kind of\nAgain I went on as a character I went on his missed why I never would have gone on his myself but through a character I could\nBe more ridiculous than more bold and brazen and I would not go and just popped out on someone's lap and talk about how much they love me but as this character I could and I just felt a great freedom in that ... would you always dress the way you describe a\n... yeah I was always recognize lately completely ... in a different I was always in a huge wig some very elaborate\nCostume 'em but oh almost club kiddy but not as alternative at that point I was living with a one of my still best friends ... who now is a shoe designer but at the time he was at FIT so he was making all these different clothes so I Would wear you know I Would\nGrab things that he was making for class and we would go out and\nGo do stand up that night and they would throw in one of his like you know we we're ... swing caper some kind of scuba suits thing and it just seem so fun it was all so much more ridiculous than in fun and I just thought well why not what else do you get to wear like a scuba dress out\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll talk more if you're just joining us my guess is Melissa McCarthy and she stars in a new movie called

career so um did you perform at gay clubs\nI did duplex is one of my favorite places to\nI just loved it also because [noise] you know the heckling wasn't there which is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer and probably better than I did I didn't um\n[noise] it when you went into a regular comedy club something that I really didn't like was there's this element there was always one\nSo he's one guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go club to a club like are you actually the same guy [laughter] and it was the always

election to go into different ways it could be tainted by voter suppression or it could be remembered as an election which voting rights works better for millions of people\nToday we talk with Ari Berman author of give us the ballot and senior reporter for Mother Jones about how the outcome and key mid term elections could be affected by voting\nRestrictions through voter ID laws through proof of citizenship loss to register by purging the voting rolls by cutting early voting and by closing polling places\nAnd I'll talk about Kansas and Georgia where the secretary of state who oversees the election is also the Republican gubernatorial candidate\nThere is an inherent conflict of interest because secretaries of state or the ... election officials in their states and so they decide how voting laws in their states are designed to implement it that coming up on fresh air\nFirst news lie from NPR News in Washington on Lakshmi Singh Turkish media are now reporting that investigators have found clothing in a Saudi consular vehicle in his stumble that may have belonged to slain journalist ...\nI think that a number of different things Georgia has done has earned a state that moniker but more recently this issue exploded because the news emerged it was reported by the Associated Press that Brian ... office the secretary of state's office in Georgia\nWas blocking fifty three thousand voter registrations in that state Seventy percent from African Americans eighty percent from people of color what was happening as people were submitting voter registration applications and if it didn't exactly match if their names on the voter registration forms didn't exactly match\nOther state database as these voters were sent a letter\nTelling them that their applications were pending and they needed to provide more information to election officials and this was very confusing to people because even though these pending voters could show up\nAnd vote at the polls with the correct id they couldn't vote by mail but they could vote at the polls\nIf you got a letter in the military that said there was a problem with your registration you probably would think that you weren't eligible to vote so they set off widespread confusion the fact that Brian ... secretary of state was running for office at the same time his office was doing this and that he was running against Stacey Abrams\nWho could be the first black woman governor in us history\nThat really made this a huge national story\nAnd Stacey Abrams is actually a voting rights activists\nStacey Abrams is the voting rights activists and the big picture in this race is that these two candidates have a very different view of voting rights in this country Stacey Abrams a Democrat is running to become the first black woman governor and us history she needs very high black voter turnout and in fact she has made it\nHer goal to register a lot of new bloc voters she started a group and twenty Thirteen called the New Georgia project that had the intent and purpose of registering more black voters\nBrian Kemp on the other hand the Republican is very reliant on support from white voters in Georgia and so his view of the electorate and his view of voting rights is that it's necessary to restrict access to the ballot and in fact the people that are most\nAffected by his policies are the kind of people that are going to be most likely to vote for states to a room so there's there's a clash between their two ideologies\nThese two figures have clashed themselves because when Stacey Abrams founded this group called the New Georgia project and twenty fourteen they submitted eighty five thousand voter registration applicants to ... office\nAnd cancer blocked about half of those registrations from going through and he claimed that there was fraud going on within Abrams group the New Georgia project\nUltimately there were no fraud charges that were filed against the group's however this battle between these two people Brian Kevin Stacey Abrams\nDates back a few election cycles so when I saw they were running against each other I knew that voting rights was going to be a major issue in this race although I don't think anyone quite soft the issue is going to blow up quite as much as it did\nYou know the exact match rule where your voter registration has to exactly match your voter ID I understand how hard that can be I mean I have a passport and your driver's license and one has a middle initial and one has a middle name and and trying to change the passport\nAnd there's so much I tried and failed I really tried and so I still have to work on that it's not fast and it's confusing which for him to use which office to go to I got run advice so it's not simple to change that kind of\nReally minor discrepancy\nIf it makes you feel any better you're not alone Terry there in Wisconsin was thinking about adopting a similar exact match system the six retired judges who helped oversee elections there they ran this test and four out of the six judges in Wisconsin failed the exact match system\nBecause their names on their voter registration forms were different than their names in state databases and so this kind of exact match system is known as disenfranchisement by typo\nBecause when you submit a voter registration form if you have\nA hyphen missing on your name if you have an apostrophe missing if you use palm on one form and Thomas on another your former is going to be blocked by the state of Georgia\nAnd what's interesting to me is that Georgia first tried to put this policy in place in two thousand nine when it previously had to approve its voting changes with the federal government under the voting rights act\nAnd the federal government actually blocked this exact match system from going into effect because they said it was discriminatory against minority voters were more likely to be flagged\nBy this system then when Brian Kemp was elected in twenty ten he started doing this administratively he was sued and twenty sixteen by the lawyers committee for civil\nI it's a voting rights group because thirty five thousand registrations were flagged as pending under the exact match system and there was a huge racial disparity in terms of who was flat and temps office actors that he was going to stop doing this system but\nWhat happened is the Georgia legislature basically reauthorize the law gave voters more time to do this and so a lot of people didn't even realize this law was backed into effect they thought and I was one of those people that thought\nThis was blocked in twenty sixty and how is Brian Kemp doing this again and that's only when I realized that the Georgia legislature had reauthorized respond given kept new powers that a federal lawsuit was meant to prevent\nWhy are people of color more impacted by this exact match law than a white people are\nThat's a very good question and that was the question that I posed to a number of voting rights lawyers recently and what they told me is that\nBasically the names of people who are African American or Latino or Asian American tend to be more unfamiliar to election workers so they might have names that don't match\nOn the databases from one form to another or election officials might actually enter\nThe correct name incorrectly or because they're confused by the spelling or they don't recognize\nThe name and so I think that basically people of different kinds of backgrounds are sometimes unfamiliar to the largely white officials that are running Georgia's elections I think that's one of the reasons why a lot of people of color are ending up on these pending registration lists\nAre there other ways that Brian Kemp as secretary of state has restricted voting rights\nYes so there was recently a very interesting report by the U.S commission on civil rights a very historic group that's been monitoring civil rights for for many years\nAnd they looked at the different ways\nIn which voting is being targeted and they found five different ways that voting is being targeted through voter ID laws through proof of citizenship lost to register by purging the voting rolls by cutting early voting and by closing polling places\nThey found that Georgia was the only state that has adopted all five of these voting restrictions so it's not just one thing that Georgia is doing\nGeorgia has closed two hundred and fourteen polling places in recent years they have cut back on early voting they have aggressively purge the voter rolls Georgia has purge almost ten percent of people\nFrom its voting rolls one point five million people have been purged from twenty twelve to twenty sixteen so there's a lot of different data points that show how Georgia is leading the way when it comes to restricting access to the ballot\nOkay there's other states with voting issues to talk about but first we're going to take a short break if you're just joining us my guess is Ari Berman he's author of the book give us the ballot modern struggle for voting rights in America and he's a senior reporter for

almost a\nBetter way to the antiquated law that discriminated against racial minorities\nAnd for them to pay to be able to\nI'm Audie Cornish concerns over voter suppression in the mid term on the next all things considered from NPR\nNews we dated for money nine when three K PCC\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Ari Berman we're talking about voter rights and voter suppression he is the author of the book give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America and he's a senior reporter for Mother Jones\nSo we've talked about the current election in Georgia where Brian Kemp the secretary of state is also running for office\nSo let's take a look at Kansas where the secretary of state is also running for office in this instance it's Kris Kobach who's running for governor what are some of the ways in which he's restricted voting rights in Kansas\nAnd not just any secretary of State Kerry I Would say that Kris Kobach is the most high profile secretary of state in the country and he has really been a leader\nIn the Republican Party when it comes to restricting voting rights this is the guy who was named vice chair of Donald Trump's election integrity commission which was formed in a very high profile way and then shut down before it actually did anything but it requested voter data\nFrom all fifty states which set off a huge fire storm last year Kobach was the guy who told Donald Trump that three million people voted illegally in the twenty sixteen election no legitimate evidence has been put forward by Trump or Kobach to support this than the less Kobach is really the guy who was formed intellectual case for restricting voting and what he's done\nAnd he's a senior writer for Mother Jones we've been looking at some of the states that have added the most consequential restrictions\nLet's move on to North Dakota and what's the big voting issue there right now\nThe big voting issue in North Dakota is that that state has recently passed a new voter id law that was upheld by the Supreme Court\nEarlier this month and what's alarming about that law\nIs that the Republicans in North Dakota wrote it in such a way that for your ID to count you have to have a current residential street address on your ID the problem in North Dakota is that a lot of Native Americans live on rural tribal reservations and they get their mail\nAt the post office using PO box is\n'cause they're areas are too remote for the post office to deliver mail at ... under this law\nTribal IDs that list PO box is won't be able to be used as valid voter IDs so now we're in a situation where five thousand Native American voters might not be able to vote in the twenty Eighteen elections with their tribal ID cards\nAnd this is sending off a tremendous amount of of alarm the snake is normally wouldn't be talking about North Dakota Terry but there is a competitive Senate race between Democrat Heidi Heitkamp and the Republican Kevin Cramer Heidi Heitkamp only won her first race for the U.S Senate in twenty twelve by\nTwenty nine hundred votes and she got eighty percent of the vote on the two counties in the state with the largest Native American reservations so there's a tremendous amount of fear in North Dakota\nThat many Native Americans are not going to be able to vote in this state and that's going to particularly hurt Heidi Heitkamp the Democratic incumbent and hide can't lose as Democrats won't have any chance of taking back the U.S Senate\nIs there a suspicion that this law I'm with street addresses what was particularly targeted at Native Americans\nBecause North Dakota Republicans began writing this law five months after high to cap was unexpectedly elected in twenty twelve and there's been a number of ... of this law but the district court in North Dakota struck down this\nAnd basically they said that the law was going to uniquely burden Native American voters because as it was written they couldn't use PO box as as their\nAddresses on their IDs and Republicans in North Dakota and the secretary of state who was larger behind this new this at the time they knew that a Native Americans wouldn't be able to use their tribal ideas as the law was written but they they put it in place anyway the problem was that a very conservative appeals court\nUpheld this law in September so it was already very close to the election\nAnd the Supreme Court upheld that decision in October\nSo basically a month before the election thousands of Native Americans were told the ideas that you use for everything in your life\nYou can't use for voting and now this is a very confusing situation on the ground in North Dakota\nWhat the tribes have said they'll do is they're actually going to sit outside the polls and they're going to use GPS coordinates to give Native Americans street address if they don't have one and they were going to print out forms and they're going to give them letters to then give to poll workers\nAs correct id but we have no idea if this is actually going to work the secretary of state of North Dakota has been noncommittal about whether he'll accept these IDs whether poll workers are going to be confused so if we have no other close election in North Dakota\nIt could be swayed by this voter id law I think the larger point is that this is one of the most historically disenfranchised and not the most historically disenfranchised community in this country that Native Americans have all sorts of problems right now that they're facing because of what this country did to them\nAnd now they're facing all of these burdens just to be able to vote and the twenty Eighteen election I think that's just very very disturbing from a civil rights perspective\nIt's kind of standard almost a cliche for people including you know elected officials to say get out and vote American democracy is based on exercising your franchise\nOver the weekend President Trump tweeted a warning he treated all levels of government law enforcement are watching carefully for voter fraud including early voting cheat at your own peril\nViolators will be subject to maximum penalties civil and criminal um what's the reaction to that tweet and\nIt was a very alarming tweet by the president as you mentioned Terry usually presidents and high ranking officials encourage people to vote President Obama just put out a tweet recently when he went through all the excuses for people not voting and said this is why you should vote\nBut Donald Trump was doing the opposite he basically made it seem like this was an act of voter intimidation by the president of the United states not the first time that Donald Trump has tweeted about voter fraud he repeatedly clans without any evidence that millions of people voted to legally\nIn the twenty sixteen elections in fact\nVoter fraud is a very rare problem in American elections it's not like it never happens but it's not nearly as widespread as many people including the president would have you believe just to cite one study there was a review of\nEvery ballot cast between two thousand and twenty fourteen so over a billion ballots cast during that period\nAnd there were only thirty one cases of voter impersonation so that means you're more likely to be struck by lightning than you are to commit voter fraud but I think the real reason why Trump was doing this and why he mentioned early voting in particular is that in spite of the bears that we've been talking about early voting turned on his way up\nAnd a lot of crucial swing states and its favoring Democrats who are getting out to vote in spite of the barriers they're facing and this was alarmed Republicans and so what Trump is saying is that\nHe wants to essentially intimidate people out of voting particularly out of early voting because he feels like this is hurting the Republican Party in at any time it seems like\nRepublicans are about to lose an election they invoke the specter of widespread voter fraud which they feel well hopefully have a chilling effect on voter participation\n[noise] we've been talking about voter restrictions were going to talk about the possibility of expanding voting rights during this election\nAfter we take a short break if you're just joining us my guest is Ari Berman he's the author of the book give us the

author of give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America and he's a senior reporter for Mother Jones he's been writing about voting issues\nHe said that twenty Eighteen can actually be a big year for expanding voting rights in spite of all these additional new restrictions\nThat we've been discussing and other initiatives on the ballot in seven states it would make it easier to vote and harder for states to gerrymander political districts so give us an overview of those uh initiatives on the seven states\n[noise] yeah so despite all of the focus on voter suppression carried twenty Eighteen could actually be a huge year when it comes to expanding access to the ballot because there are initiative that would make it\nEasier to register to vote in crucial swing states like Michigan Nevada through things like automatic and election day registration\nThere are initiatives in four states to make it harder to gerrymander by doing things like citizen ladder nonpartisan redistricting in places like Colorado Michigan Utah in Missouri and the biggest ... of the one that could affect the most people is in Florida where they have a ballot initiative\nThat would restore voting rights to ex felons so Florida is one of only four states that prevents ex felons from voting meaning even after you've served your time you've paid your debt to society\nYou have to wait five to seven years in Florida to appeal to have your voting rights restored it by the governor and his executive clemency board and this current governor Rick Scott in Florida has restored voting rights to almost nobody you have a situation in Florida where one point six million ex", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "23"}
