runners who seek out players as young as twelve\nThey're exploited their dealers in human athletic flesh and they are trying to get their hooks into kids get their hooks into the families and get into

without\n\nFirst news\nLive from NPR News in Washington ... investigators are searching for culprit and the motive for\nThe bomb threats targeting critics of President Trump to suspect packages intended for Joe Biden were intercepted before reaching the former vice president on Wednesday as Mike Desmond reports Biden gave his speech Thursday on American values during a campaign stop the buffalo\nThe deed is Nike and Under Armour a shooting apparel companies\nThey fund the grassroots basketball circuit that's the circuit in which these players come from the Web of youth teams are they fund all of that and then they pour a lot of money\nInto the college programs themselves you know a hundred and sixty million two hundred million dollars over a ten year period and that is in return\nFor the players on the teams wearing their gear so if it's a Nike school and this is what they're called you're either a Nike school and Under Armour school or in a de to school so let's say you're a Nike school and you're a basketball team is in the NC double a tournament\nWhere you've got the Nike swoosh on your sneakers that's on your trunks it's on your Jersey or if you're aware a wrist bands it's it's on your wrist bands if you wear a head band it's on your head band\nSo what they get in return for this money is the right to turn players who are ostensibly amateurs into human billboards\nRight and the contracts are very detailed right the players have to wear only their gear and they give the university bonuses if they do well the shoe companies do\nWell as the teams do well if you're a Nike school and and you reached the final four or if you win the national championship\nYour coach is sure to get a hundred thousand or a two hundred thousand dollar bonus on top of his multimillion dollar salary the assistant coaches are probably going to get a bonus the school may get more money the only ones who don't benefit monetarily or the players\nBut ... does that bonus come from the shoe company or no I mean they they\nComes from the shoe company yes directly from the shoe company and these are\nReally not big sums of money for the shoe companies you know Nike\nIs a multibillion dollar global company so it was a deed is Under Armour a little less so but these are huge businesses and the money that that seems to to us perhaps so big\nIt's not that big for them and it also means they don't really have to advertise like they used to I mean if you've got temp players on the court and there are running around in your insignia is why bother to advertise you know these are human action figures wearing your stuff\nFor tens of millions of Americans to watch and it makes advertising a ...\nBilly redundant at that point it's much cheaper way to do it\nBig time college basketball programs obviously want the best players so they're scouting and competition in recruiting them and I think most of us would figure this would focus on high school players you know juniors and seniors who who prove that they have the chops and visit their families they do what whatever to try and get them interested in their program\nI learn from your book this starch much much earlier how young are players when they start getting attention\nFifth or sixth grade\nPlayers are as young as\nTen or eleven years old when the basketball ... scouts start looking at them and saying are you a future college prospect are you a future NBA prospect\nAnd there are several reasons for this one of them is the size of players who make it to a big time college basketball and the NBA\nYou know there's somewhere between six foot three\nAnd seven feet and up so that really narrows the population so if you're looking at a young kid you're going to mostly look at a kid who's already begun already athletic and for that reason and some other reasons\nIt is relatively easier in basketball to look at a sixth or seventh grader and correctly say this kid's going to be at least the college player so it becomes worse it for the scouts to then prow the sidelines of fifth and sixth grade basketball tournaments\nOr their national publications or online sites that actually rate these players that have a lot of readers\nYes they are publications and scouting services that look at kids as young as fifth grade or one of them is called who scoop it's run by a man named Clark Francis though I encountered several years ago and you know there are elements of Clark\nWhen you meet him that that you may not take him seriously he's a guy you know\nSpends his life looking at little basketball players the funny thing about him is if you go back and look at his towels sheets from five or six years ago and you look at the fifth and sixth graders who review rated the highest\nLot of them are in big time college basketball now or in the pros so we certainly not write all the time but he's not bad at at picking out the best players so what Clark Francis does whether you take him seriously or not is he lays down a foundation\nFor people who then scout high school and middle school players\nAnd he sort of sets the sort of number of players who may be looked at and the recruiting services are and other business another way that young grass roots or high school players generate income for other people\nNow they're not just watching these kids in school jams right there is something called the grassroots basketball network explain who runs that how it works\nThe main recruiting grounds which I've also heard described as a hunting grounds\nIs no longer high school basketball you know a high school game\nFeatures maybe one star the kid maybe six six and he's playing against a five ten kid\nSo what's the shoe companies created was the grassroots basketball circuit and that put all the best players against each other in these pressurized situations\nThat's where the college coaches go to scout and the person who created this ... sometimes called the godfather of grass roots basketball and sunny was a brilliant salesmen and a and a brilliant\nSort of hustler in his own way so he realized two things one was to put all the best players together was going to create a better recruiting situation but he also realize that\nBig time college coaches really don't want to go to small town after small town at scout players they like to go to Las Vegas and stay in five star hotels or go to Chicago Orlando and stay in five star hotels and watch a bunch of the best players so sunny not only put the best players together\nBut he created a situation that's coaches loved\nRight so you have these tournaments that occur I'm In Chicago or Orlando or Las Vegas\nWhere the best players come in these prospects these kids their families take the more and we're talking about middle school kids and a lot of cases right\nAnd there are these people who are not agents but you might call them runners street agents who sort of specialize in building relationships you describe a tournament in Las Vegas I think in July you want to just kind of paint that picture for us\nLas Vegas hosts some of the biggest grassroots tournaments so in July you will have a couple of hundred teams all age groups and a thousand or more players a couple of hundred\nCollege coaches and they're playing in gyms all over Los Vegas some of them are staying on the strip and they are being scout it not only by coaches not only by college coaches but also by\nThese characters who exist on the fringes I think of it almost like boxing back in the day they sort of Damon Runyon ask characters\nWho are they're just sort of see what's in it for them\nAnd the one hand there can be seen as colorful but also just like boxing back in the day they're exploitive their dealers in human athletic flash and they are trying to get their hooks into kids and get their hooks into families\nAnd get into their inner circles and then to see what's in it for me can I deal this kid to a particular college can I associate him with a particular NBA agent\nAnd this is very much the scene on the grass roots circuit it's known and it's it's part of the background\nAre are there are kids who when they're you know twelve Thirteen fourteen kind of become celebrities kind of think of themselves as a business\nAbsolutely there are there are kids who you know this is their life in one of the things that really struck me when I have been around grassroots basketball\nIs the kids who refer to themselves as being in the business of basketball because that's how it feels to them they may be twelve or Thirteen Years old but they're in the business of basketball\n[noise] Michael ... book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino the story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball we'll continue our conversation after a short break this is fresh air\nEvery Monday through Thursday night at seven here on eighty nine point three K. P. C. the checkout America on the line it's a call in show about politics that engages listeners from across America and it's part of the Cape BCC voter game plan\nStrongly indicated that Nike and Under Armour are engaged in the same kind of activity so\nIn the ... three cases that will be tried there are four assistant coaches at major programs charged and there are several\nOther figures on the grass roots circuit sort of sometimes called St runners or go betweens or consultants for the shoe companies they have also been charged and the question in each of these cases is where their federal crimes committed or where they're just\nViolations of the NC double lays amateur ism rules which are not federal crimes\nRight so it seems clear from the evidence that there were relationships which seemed to violate recruiting rules and that money changed hands right\nAbsolutely there's no doubt that money changed hands by the way relatively small amounts of money in the grand scheme of what these apparel companies generate and and making profit\nThis young man named Brian Boeing junior who went by the nickname tubs a was a much sought after recruit ultimately signed\nUm with the University of Louisville which was poached by Rick Pitino says before the indictments and the events leading to his signing are among those in ... in the criminal case what kind of money went to his family\nAre in front of them\nOne hundred thousand dollars was promised to Brian by one juniors father that would be Brian's bio and senior\nOf that one hundred thousand dollars only Nineteen thousand five hundred was ever delivered the money was to have come from a deed is that Nineteen thousand five hundred dollars is one quarter of one percent\nOf the nearly eight million dollar annual salary than coach Rick Pitino was making so\nThat to me is a pretty stark reminder of the inequity of this whole youth basketball seen\n... and ... and there was evidence that that wasn't the first time that buying bonds dad had taken money based on his son's athletic ability\nIt was clearly not the first time the Brian bones senior had taken money\nHe testified in court or under immunity from prosecution that he had taken money\nRepeatedly um four in return for his son playing for particularly used teams or particular private high school in Indiana and there was a moment in court where\nThe defense attorney of Christian Dawkins one of the the runner these street agent said Brian bones senior on cross examination so you've been camping out your namesake since he was fourteen years old\nAnd Bryan Boone senior only quibble about the age she paused for a second and then he said well maybe Fifteen or sixteen years old\nRight and is there any evidence that Brian ball and the kid himself knew about this or saw any of the money\nRyan Bowen junior\nHad told the FBI and he told me when I interviewed him and he has told everyone he did not know the money was exchanged that money was received by his father there's been no evidence that he didn't know he went from\nThe University of Louisville to the University of South Carolina he transferred last year the fact that the University of South Carolina took him in\nIs an indication that they certainly believed that that he had no knowledge of this but the NC double a still said\nYou can't play basketball last year and then ruled that he could not play college basketball this year and Brian bone junior has gone off to play professionally in Australia a and is over there now in Sydney has become one of\nA thousand overseas player is trying to attract the attention of NBA scouts he missed out on what is by far the easier route which is to play in college to be on TV to be known and just take that glide path right into the NBA\nSo Rick Pitino is that the coach was on the cover of the book um the book is kind of about this system of corruption in recruitment but Pitino is a fascinating character\nUm you say it's not hard to make the case he's the best college basketball coach of his generation that tactical and motivational genius and to give us a sense an example of what he does it special\nRick Pitino one to national championships wanna Kentucky won at Louisville\nYou also coached the Boston Celtics and the New York Knicks two of the\nMore key franchises in professional basketball in college basketball particularly at Louisville he did something that's almost never done he won with out the best players\nMost final four teams most national champions are stocked with first round draft picks Hi first round draft picks of the NBA which are called the lottery picks\nRick Pitino one without those guys he coached\nGood players not great players he got them to play merciless defense they played so intense that he was a motivation on a tactical genius\nAnd you know by the way I Love watching him coach and he would stand on the sideline in in an athletic position with his knees bent\nAnd you know its head peering out over the court often one foot on the court and its hands behind him and I always got the feeling that he put his hands behind him because he was so intense that if they weren't there he would reach out and grab the balls that came by but he was just this amazing coach\nAnd in some ways you know ... ... for him to be caught up in this is\nA a predictable and and be tragic\n[noise] now he lost his job he was not charged in the criminal case but ah Louisville was tainted and he was given his walking papers after the indictment came out but you're right that this was not his first brush with scandal what were some of the others\nAre more than a decade ago Rick Pitino had a sexual ethic nation in a closed restaurant I'm with a woman who then tried to extort him\nAnd she was sent off to prison but he was the star prosecution witness who had to then recount in court\nThis incident with a woman who just met in a bank get everybody left the rest I was terribly embarrassing and I would say\nAfter that Pitino was just a basketball coach um which of course he always was but I don't think he could be seen as a necessarily a mentor to young men the second incident was in many ways more serious in Louisville it became known as stripper gate\nAnd what struck the gate was was four years of parties in the basketball dorm\nNot very far from ... office sponsored by a local escort and paid for by a member of Pitino staff and women danced and there were sexual favors for recruits and for current players and\nIn the ... in the NC double lays lexicon it's strange lexicon this was ruled to be permissible benefits to amateur players\nAnd Louisville actually lost its two thousand Thirteen national title over strip brigade so that was sort of in that was sort of strike one strike to end this recruiting scandal um and Pitino was not charged\nUm but it involved staff members and involved a recruit is involve Louisville\nMove it was a central thread in the FBI and Justice Department case\n... and in the ... case we're talking about high school recruits coming to Louisville coming to a dorm where there were sexual things going on um what did Pitino say about\n\nPitino who's written a couple of leadership books um but it's not\nReally a model of of leader that most people would recognize employees is sort of circular logic when things go wrong and in the case of stripper gate and and there was an echo of this and the recruiting scandal he says I tell everyone to follow the rules\nSometimes they don't follow the rules and when they don't follow the rules they don't tell me about it because they know how angry I Would be so\nIn stripper gate and in this recruiting scandal there were people just one layer below him his assistant coaches or in one case is director of basketball operations who were elbows deep in wrongdoing it would seem and Pitino\nDoes not take responsibility for either hiring the wrong people or for hiring people who don't listen to what he says and right now coach Geno has a pending case against\nThe University of Louisville athletic association which technically paid a salary and he's seeking be thirty five million dollars which was left on his coaching contract\nAnd then of course the studios if they are using images that they've found\nA they went down the copyrights the images and then they should be able to use them and federal law in that area federal copyright law tends to overcome state law in in that regard so there are a number of cases actually were actors in studios have come into conflict historically for example that the well known cheers case where George went and John maps and burgers sued\nOver the licensing of the norm in ... characters for use as robots an airport bars\nAnd so we may see more of those conflicts involving a digitized actors\nUm but also there's the issue in this doesn't mean that is central to my book isn't it the right of publicity the state law that we talked about it it can turn people into intellectual property which means that their rights can be transferred\nSo it's supposed to be helping actors control uses of their image but a studio could have the actors transfer over their rights to the studio itself and and they would own the actor potentially forever even after that\nSo that could be in in the initial contract with the actor when she or he is hired for a particular role\nCorrect and and that's that's very concerning to me and it's it's something\nThe Screen Actors guild is trying to promote the passage of these laws but isn't restricting their transfer ability it's actually encouraging the transfer ability which could be very dangerous for actors going forward and in fact some of these laws were initially proposed by the movie studios in the aftermath of the\nCollapse of the star system when California law invalidated long term\nSteel contracts that hold act held actors hostage to particular studios\nWe're talking with Jennifer ... Thatcher Loyola Law school all through the book the right to publicity re imagine for a public world came out just a few months ago and Darren handler with us of a digital domain where he directs the digital humans group\nA daring wanted to ask you about the ways that you attempt to transfer the subtleties of that sense of an actor to the digitized image what are the ways you try to address that challenge\nOf students it's kind of an interesting process we go through and sort of new technologies really helping us you know sort of a this process but we\nWere Germany work with the activism to do a whole series of different scans them you know scans figure out because of how their skin moves you know removing do scams figure out how the color of their skin is changing as blood froze moving around in their face and we sort of generate all this data that gives us a good idea of how the active face moves how they're performing\nAnd then we'll produce from their live action performances when they're on set with the other actors revert to shoot their faces from different angles different cameras and things and then recreate their facial performances right really down to the subtlety of their since suffering motions switches on their face and everything\nAnd this is the thing that's kind of been failing you write this technology has evolved so far I think has really enabled us to sort of better recreate the actors performances right so we no longer\nYou know using the performances a guide or following along with their performance as we're not really sort of using their performance is their fish will perform their buddy performances and then transferring it to these different characters and different ... different creatures and all sorts of\nThings can you give us an example of where you did this in a recent film with an actor and and with one of these digitized characters\nAbsolutely so we did this a recent see for Avengers Infinity war where we took Josh Burns performances and Josh Groban was on onset live with all the other actors she was creating his performances who's creamed the buddy performances of than us\nAnd so we're taking his buddy performances and his visual performances from said while he's talking interacting with the other actors\nAnd rich tracking your houses have points on his face and how his face is moving\nAnd they were looking at his face and we're looking at his face re looking at the different ... between the different characters and then transferring order the subtlety but for me out to the same time what Josh is performance which should look like unsettled says face\nAnd really trying to make it his performance almost like the deals prosthetic\nAnd as you're describing a professor ... um is it clear then if if the studio wanted to use ... and they thought it was appropriate for another digitized character that they could we use that without Berlin's permission\nWell a lot of but that would depend on the contract that Berlin signed as well as collective bargaining with the Screen Actors guild in that context that studio would own the copyright and the footage and so they copyright law says you can reuse it never righty of ways as the owner\nOne of the main limits is probably whether the reuse would interfere or destroy Berlin's career\nSo if it was a complete replacement for Berlin performances other films\nAnd then I think court should be more inclined to strike it down and the one case a right of publicity case that went to the U.S Supreme Court involves such a scenario where human cannonball performer had been filmed at a local fair and the nightly news showed his entire act albeit Fifteen seconds in length\nAnd the Supreme Court said First Amendment isn't going to protect the news here because you used the entire performance and that could ruin the cannonball performers career\n... why in this case though with Roland ... let's say that the studio decided they just wanted to keep using 'cause they could make that that capture obvious face almost infinite let's say I'm so they don't need to hire him for future you know you don't go out there doing they\nMentioned just the way this technology works is so for instance there we're going to be of actors playing than us we would do the same type of technology to have them drive the face but it's never going to be Josh has performance the way Joshua Crawford that performance\nIt's only really when he's playing this character and reusing his face that you're getting back to performance the way he did it on to us and everyone else maybe mimicking into trying to follow along but it's never really going to be that same performance ever again\nDuring winters don't have oh go ahead and finish your point is and we really don't have the technology that would ever take Josh is performances and the way he did it and be able to recreate different alternative performance was the way he did it due this moment you I understand the technology isn't there right now but isn't that at some point\nYou know in the realm of possibility\nIt could be in the realm of possibility you know redo lots of conversations about artificial intelligence and what this technology can be capable of I Would say the difficulty right now is you know recount really get artificial intelligence entity to come off as a human being never mind\nCreates this perfect Josh brought in performance again the way he did it and so while the technology may be possible in the future that's still a really really long way off\nI Want to thank you

about Lou Reed with Anthony to Curtis author of a biography of read which just came out in paperback\nCurtis is a music critic and was reads friends then he reads velvet underground songs and solo song whereabouts sexually trends Greste of characters heroin and other drugs and the stage for so and I played with his own sexual\nFluidity to sexuality was something I think as you get used to you so you want to see you know and I think was open to going over the world\nThe Curtis interviewed many people read new including two of his former wives\nNeedy there's a word that came up a lot of talking about lose relationship lovers and I'm part of that was loose hated being alone that's on fresh air\nFirst news [noise]\nLive from NPR News in Washington ... me saying the FBI has custody of a Florida Man in connection with an ongoing national investigation into suspicious packages including confirmed pipe bombs and dressed as several high profile Democrats and known critics of President Trump's\nHe did use heroin and the song does come out of his own experience which is you know I think another element of lose work you know it was grounded in his own life\nHe would make the point ... and it's a point where it making that you know he is not all the characters in the songs but you know close enough\n[noise] you know one of the things that's so fascinating about Lou Reed is that okay so this is one of the really early songs that he writes heroin\nAnd at the time he's working for a quick writing songs to order he's writing like knock off to have like surf sons and their families about Detroit and California and us on called the ostrich which was supposed to be like a novelty dance on to start a novelty craze that never got started [laughter] and ... and before that\nUm he was discovered at like a high school dance um that he was playing with like an early high school band and he was brought to ... to record producer who is also Jetta epitaph grandfather [laughter]\n... yeah yeah\nAnd ... like record a few things like writing record iffy things and one of the songs I really want to play this [laughter] unless I was called merry go round and so how old is Lou Reed when he records that\nWell you know he began recording really well he was in high school you know and he you know kind of continued to make records after that but you know you could really see the kinds of influences that he was working with at this point\nI mean a certain sense is working to help to him 'cause it was like working in a songwriting emergency room you know they would you know just kind of okay you know surf music is happening you know right ten surf songs or love do off you know right about your do off songs or read a bunch of songs about cars are songs about teenage love tragedy\nAnd so merry go round is kind of an expression of that period of his writing where it's identifiable as we read but also you can hear him working through a you know the various kinds of genres that he was a kind of task to work\nWith it's just so the guy who writes like heroin and writing for waiting for the man writes this lyric from merry go round I walking home every day from school but still you treat me like a fool [laughter]\nAbsolutely this is a very interesting thing about I mean I think\nThere were those ... those parts I mean people would ask me I knew her\nAnd you know people would have to do it so you know if you run into ... read what is the way we talk about how we talk about like ... or ... roller under you know he loved pop music and that was true at the same time as he also wasn't always doing that by any means but he was taking pop elements\nEven you don't want that first of all but underground record if you listen to attract like you know there she goes or drive nobody lifts\nYou know more engaged tried for the risk\nThere's an element of loving what pop music is and all of those teenager motions at a certain way you know this is a kind of overstatement it's a little sentimental but in many ways it's kind of true I mean lose deep\nPassionate love of doo wop in that kind of adolescent swept away on the wings of love and it was very essential emotion for him and it remain that way\nSo let's hear merry go round 'cause you really here Lou Reid's voice but he hasn't quite because\nVery very popular here and seen about ... [noise] [noise]\n\nGod [noise]\n\n\n\nGod [noise]\n[noise]\nThat was Lou Reed before the velvet underground when if he's still in high school any records that\n[noise] um I think so yeah All right I'm\nOkay and and my guess is Anthony ...

Curtis a contributing editor at Rolling Stone magazine and now the author of a new biography of Lou Reed\nI Want to ask you about a period of ... and a lot of people have spoken about\nI think he chose not to speak about it publicly\nAnd I'm Talking about the period where he had electroshock therapy electric ... therapy and this is when he was in college and I'd always heard that this was because his parents were afraid that he was gay what did you learn about the electric shock therapy and why he had\nWell I think that Lou was acting out in a variety of ways while he was in high school you know she was certainly using drugs wild mood swings you know we definitely enjoy getting under particularly his father's skin\nAnd he also was acting out like you know people would see his kind of gay life almost in formative terms you know he'd walk around and you know limp arrested and you know shaking his hips and all this stuff in front of his father is a way to\nEssentially aggravate him\nYou but there were more serious problems with him you know I think that's a you know certainly the drug use and the rebellious miss the family was very conventional and you know as a kind of\nYou know middle or upper middle class a Jewish family in the suburbs you know they went and consulted doctors about the kind of problems that they saw\nAnd the doctors are advised this you know electro convulsed with therapy which reads so it's kind of torture he wrote about it he wrote a song called kill your sons about it which is kind of an an Sexton palm center being sick\nAnd to him it was a ... you know it was a very decisive dividing line in terms of his relationship with his parents but one thing I learned from talking to his sister and other people who knew him well back then it was parents really loved him and his father\nI mean his mother felt guilty about the shock treatments for the rest of her life until she died I think his father thought that he did the best you could do was you know lose creating a lot of problems and he needed to address them somehow\nBut you also write that once when we reached came home from college\nThat he was basically like non functional and his parents were concerned that he was in a terribly deep depression the doctor said you know he might have schizophrenia am I getting this right yes and that that that that that also figure into\nThe the shock treatments and his sister told you oh our parents were were very liberal and they weren't homophobic so it wasn't about their fear of him being gay but I was thinking what like everybody was homophobic then\nWell that's right and that's the thing I don't think they were more homo phobic than that you know they were just kind of a conventional suburban ... Lewis breeding into their life everything that they were supposed to not have to deal with any more after having left the city there was a vision of the suburbs when they moved in the Nineteen fifties as this kind of\nEden of peace and you know lose various outrages under which they would certainly have filed a you know who's going to gay bars that acting out\nAs a gay person you know we're elements of that but it wasn't like we're going to make him straight you know I don't I just don't think that was part of it\nWe mentioned when you mention gay bars and and him being gay but he's also with a lot of girls at the time I\nWell yeah that's true and that and there are people I mean this was a really I mean it's a very it's an issue very much of the moment interestingly because I've got a con around the block\nSo you think he was going to have like fluid in his actual alley yeah\nI mean one of his girlfriend's a describes them as inter\nAnd [laughter] it's kind of interesting usage I think you know there was part of Lu I think that was up for anything and\nBut I had gay friends with gay male friends like write to me and say you know you describe this element of flu but he was really gay\nAnd the other day I got one of those and it was you know as a pretty stern email that you know made me think about what I had written I had lunch with one of his former girlfriends she was saying look there's no way Louis gauge\nHis sexuality was something I think you know as you gauge the adage you so you wanted to see you know and I I think Lou was kind of open to going wherever that was\nAnd I think everybody had a language for it then\n[noise] you're right about the women in the ... life including his first serious girlfriend Shelley out than his three wives Betty crime stats Sylvia morale is Larry ... and his trans girlfriend racial [noise]\nUm let's start with um his first girlfriend and his first two wives um did you interview all of them all three of them\n[noise] um yes what what were some of the themes\nThat you got from them like common themes from all three of those relationships\nAbout how they were treated by Lou Reed [noise] um\nThink one thing that ran through those relationships a loser early relationships with women was his desire to subsumed them to make them part of his world um you know needy is a word that came up a lot a and talking about lose relationship or lovers and um [noise]\nUh you know part of that was you know he I mean ... hated being alone a at any time and so you know that obviously the demands on the relationship but also he wanted\nYou know these women you know in in certain instances to come and work for him you know was lighting designer our manager or just be with him all the time or you know record companies would call them and just say look lose you know feeling this or doing that as a possible view to calm and you know calm him down\nI'm so there was that but there was also you know they also talked for about a quarter of sweetness in Chile all been his college girlfriend um there's just a delightful person I've gotten to know or above\nA talks about you know just the difficulty I mean ... hard drugs in her dorm room you actually gotten kicked out of schools could have gotten arrested you know it was you know it was not a nice thing to do to somebody that you cared about\nBut you know when she was talking about the difficulties of you know shopping affairs are boys and girls and using drugs and\nAnd that you just said you know but still like Lew is the only boyfriend I ever had\nWho on Valentine's Day you give me you know this gigantic red heart shaped box of chocolates you know and she loved it I mean there was a kind of convention analogy to him you know you would a gesture like that would you would seem really meaningful to him he marriages second wife on Valentine's Day\nAnd you know those kinds of aspects of who he was um you know what ran through this kind of double miss you know there's this kind of burying these women in himself at the same time as you know that are kind of sweetness that you wouldn't necessarily anticipate that\n... that his first wife told you that he physically abused her which is the ... which is why she finally left him right did you hear that from from any of the other women humans with\n[noise] ah no I did not uh and although you know there were other instances of other women who were less casually involved are with him\nOr you know it was you know I'm a part of who he was I mean that kind of anger and desire for control manifested itself and that you know obviously despicable lie a and\nYou know yeah Betty certainly felt it you know there was a um\nYou know I don't this is not to justify this there's a phone call Caroline says two on Berlin and or the lyrics go Caroline says she gets up off the floor you could hit me all you want to but I Love you anymore\nAnd first of all I mean in four lines that's like a little movie\nAnd it gets that the kind of desperation in hitter you know I think that there was\nA an incredible level of fear of abandonment and\nAnd terror and that's what motivated his violence you know it it was you know the no way I mean it was I mean it doesn't matter what the motivations were to a certain extent unless you're trying to understand this person um you know it's it's I have an effect\nBut it it's coming out of a kind of desperation I mean it's less about hostility than ah than it is a ... about a kind of self hatred and and fear\nAnd he's out there like me and drinking and using drugs and who knows how how that's affecting him to certainly I don't have much out of that is not that's not helpful if you have a bad temper and if you have a tendency to be out of control [laughter]\nCertainly not yeah certainly not and it was a [noise] you know that was very much part of his life um you know in those days I'm\nOne of his partners for about three years was transferred his um ... Shaffir\nYeah yep yep she was and so they were together for three years and um he dedicated his album Coney Island baby to her her name uh west Rachel I'm what can you tell us about Rachel in her relationship with me very\nWell that's a you know that kind of story\nRight it is an extremely complicated subject I'll Try to distill it you know it um\nYou know he met a Rachel in an after hours bar and just really fell in love with her and this was one of the revelations of the book\nTo me you know I knew about Rachel I mean he wrote about her so uh yeah I was aware that she existed but you know in my mind you know in a casual ... he's wild he'll do anything but in fact there was a real depth to that relationship and you know they had\nYou know they live together or they entertain together they went out together it was ... I mean if uh you know if a if a rock star of loose stature did that now it would be you know regardless of shocking and you know certainly in the seventies\nYou know it was you know just kind of unheard of\nBut um you know there was genuine infection there and also Rachel was kind of also a kind of road manager for the ... very interesting thing I was a contemporary peace where\nA a writer named Caroline Kuhn a British writer was writing about being with Lou and Rachel and they were kind of arguing like Louis saying\nWhat's going on here like you're supposed to take care of me like why am I taking care of you and it was sort of playful and it was a fight and that was also a reality to it you know like you're supposed to be arranging the cars to the venue and you're supposed to be talking about what I Need like\nYou know you know\nUh why am I looking after you know you and your problems\nBut Rachel how the secret life you know Rachel was out on the street and would um you know she pulled a knife on the girls who is looking at Lew backstage at the bottom line you know just wander off\nUm you know people recall seeing a Rachel a you know beaten up not as a result of a relationship would lose seemingly but you know just out of the other kind of\nA situation that you would get involved in and it was\nA you know in that kind of thing I think really has an appeal for Lu the idea that I think anybody who\nDidn't fully um submit to him he didn't fully become part of his world who kept something to themselves or I think that that only kind of enticed his interests and uh you know a\nRachel's life as a hustler was was something I think that had a real appeal from the\nWell let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is Anthony Curtis the author of Lou Reed uh life will be right back this is fresh air\nNext time on the New Yorker radio hour of talk with pop singer as a former Janelle Monet and we'll give Daniel Radcliffe\nCrash course in fact checking that's next time when the New Yorker radio out during the Saturday mornings at ten on eighty nine point three K.
