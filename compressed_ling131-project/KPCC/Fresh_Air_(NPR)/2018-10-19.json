Trump's comments at a rally in Missoula\nPaying either give taxes or later on um the state taxes because of this belief that you just felt that what he had made ... you know the government just didn't have a right to single that\nYour investigation really like deconstruct the Donald Trump ness of the self made man who got like a one million dollar loan from his father and use that to build this enormous\nFortune and this real estate empire the actual story what you report starts when he was like three years old and starts getting like two hundred thousand dollars a year in today's dollars\nSo what was the process by which by age three he was getting hundreds of thousands of dollars from his father\nThat started in Nineteen forty nine and it was one of the projects that um that had got that for a Trump had received government funding\nTo build it was um a complex called beach haven in what Fred Trump that it was quite ingenious as he bought the land underneath speech haven or the complex that he would go on to build and he placed the land in a trust 'em for the benefit of his five children\nAnd then he started paying them read he makes them his landlord\nAnd every year they continue to get payments so\nWhen it came out on a second I don't really understand how three year old Donald Trump can be his father's landlord can you explain that\nSure it was his land to do what he wanted was and he put it in a trust in this instance when they were very young for their benefit and began paying them run it's completely legal\nUm but that's sort of one of the ways in which he\nEarly on you know he's in this point it's in the Nineteen forties his children or young and he's looking for ways you would imagine at this point to begin to take care of his children as they get older so that they you know when they grow up they've got money and then there's a way to transfer what is now he's becoming a very rich ...\nIs one way to begin to transfer of wealth to them this is the first one that happened in Nineteen forty nine\nSo what are some of the ways that by the time Donald Trump was a teenager he was already well what are some of the ways his father gave him money [noise]\nBegan doing a number of things so she started\nBuying or building apartment complexes in Brooklyn and queens and then gradually transferring ownership of those apartment complexes to his children so for example Donald when he was Seventeen years old became co owner with this\nFamily members of a fifty two unit apartment building in Brooklyn that his father had acquired for them and so they would over time Fred\nTrump assembled a roughly eight apartment complexes over a thousand units and all that she transferred through a variety of mechanisms to his children and so those\nThousand units start churning out profits that flowed effortlessly into the pockets of the children and we actually documented in our reporting two hundred and Ninety five different revenue streams that Fred Trump ultimately created for Donald Trump\nOver fifty year period fraud Trump was so\nIngenious at finding different ways of putting money into Donald Trump's pocket so if you didn't just\nPut him on his payroll is a salary employee\nHe also paid them separately to be a consultant to him she paid him separately to be a property manager for him he paid him separately to be a purchasing agent for him on and on it would go [laughter]\nHe was getting laundry revenue from from Fred Trump and from the buildings so you know some of these revenue streams were relatively modest some of them were kind of one hit wonders but when you add it all up it was this incredible stream of money that made Donald Trump\nUm he was a millionaire actually by the time he was eight or nine years old before you ever entered set foot into Manhattan\nWhere he would make his name uh for Trump it already transferred to him over nine million dollars in wealth\nHey by the time and he was twenty nine in Nineteen Seventy five Donald Trump had collected nearly nine million\nYou probably have nine million dollars in today's dollars\nFrom his father when he was thirty in Nineteen Seventy six ... really starts to expand their Nineteen Seventy six article in your newspaper the New York times and you describe it as one of the first major Donald Trump profiles and a cornerstone of decades of myth making about his wealth\nWhat are the article say what would you when the main points of the Nineteen seventies sex article that Donald Trump\n[noise] it was really one of the first big big profiles that Rahm of Donald Trump and Donald Trump did something in this particular profile but if you would actually a repeat and use to great effect in subsequent profiles which was [noise]\nShe took the New York times reporter on a tour of what he called his jobs his empire and he starts driving around New York pointing out\nThis building in that building and talking about how wonderful they were doing and and effectively what he was doing was\nHe was appropriating\nHis father's empire as if it were his own empire so these buildings that he's pointing out as his jobs with part of his empire there were in fact completely owned by his father\nHad known ships taken in any of those buildings and so what he what he did especially when it was critical to kind of early mismanaging of Donald Trump was\nShe simply asserted that his father's empire\nWas his empire and those claims unfortunately largely went unchallenged for for many years by the reporters who were\nKind of swept up in the glamour of this\nYoung swagger lying handsome guy who was so full of confidence in so full of big plans for the city of New York so that story was the thing that I think helped give birth to the myth of Donald Trump self made billionaire\nOne of the things it's really remarkable about that story when you read it is you know he goes through job after job in and says that things that are his father or his own\nAnd he tells the reporter that he's worth in excess of two hundred million dollars\nAnd everything he pointed to in the story that would go to his his net worth at that time was his father's he had a tax return to a few years later where we see he declared a I think he may twenty five thousand dollars a couple of years last year actually I got actually got year Nineteen\nSeventies now and yet he was sitting there saying that he was worth two hundred million dollars and that was a claim that he would\nBecome part of the claim that would put him on the very first list of wealthiest Americans published by Forbes magazine in the Nineteen I Want to say what eighty to eighty eighty one so far there\nWas a spectacular calling and I guess Donald Trump I used to people taking him at his word even one his word wasn't true\n[noise] yeah I'd be things build up right they they're like these layers right and reporters come along and they\nAre assigned to do some story about Donald Trump and they go look at the clubs are they going to look at what's been written about before and it all kind of accumulates into this um sort of settlement of 'em in this case it kind of mythology of a man who had at least in his\nTelling of his story the famous line that he's always said is that you started with a million dollar loan from his father\nHad to pay it back with interest and if he parlay that million dollar loan into ten billion dollar empire that remained for the most part the dominant narrative that she sold certainly you know to make themselves a celebrity and to gain power and ultimately it's what he campaigned on very heavily\nTo win win the presidency and so this story really by sex that narrative and I think more than anything else offers\nReaders now based on the actual facts um and based on the actual documents an entirely new financial narrative the forty fifth president\nWell let me re introduce you here if you're just joining us my guess is Suzanne crack and David ... of the New York times who wrote a remarkable investigative piece on our President Trump's inherited money from his father the loans you got from his father the tax evasion schemes the family had\nAnd that was published a couple of weeks ago you can find it on line we're going to talk more about how\nDonald Trump engagements aspect tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father after we take a short break this is fresh air\nNext time on the New Yorker radio our Jeffrey too when he talks with Sally ate the acting attorney general who served in the Trump Administration for just ten days before she was fired back next time I'm In New York ... joined a Saturday mornings at ten on eighty nine point three K.

com\nIt'd debt and so he had very little data on these buildings and the documents that we found and we were sort of going through them we saw he had just mountains of cash tens of millions of dollars of cash were throwing flowing through his personal bank accounts and the bank accounts of the buildings\nAnd this created\nA huge problem for the siblings 'cause if you died he would be facing a fifty five percent\nOr state talks so they created a company in the early Nineteen nineties called all county building supply in maintenance and it was a company the shareholders were Donald Trump and his siblings and a nephew of fraud Trump\nAnd what this company did was for years for Trump's buildings would go out and they would buy supplies you'd see for everything from bridges in stove stove boilers to\nSupplies that they needed a new roof to windows all this stuff would be bought 'em by the buildings and they would go to like Long Island wholesalers or a Home Depot and they would get what they needed um and for Trump buildings would pay for that\nAnd then one day all county the company that does Donald Trump and his sibling owns they would go out\nAnd all county would pay for the material\nThe differences is if they paid five hundred dollars for fridge stove combo\nThey would send a separate invoices a potted invoice\nUp to for Trump and the building that he owned and they would mark it up to six seven hundred dollars and the shareholders of all county Donald Trump and his siblings would pocket the difference this went on for years\nOn item after item after item and they were successfully able to drain tens of millions of dollars from front Trump's buildings this way\nSo the sole purpose of SARS you can tell of this company that the Trump children created was to inflate the prices of things like boy ... refrigerators and um other like things that are um buildings need so that they buy them inflate the price\nSell it to Fred Trump for his real estate empire pocket the difference so that they make hundreds of dollars every time they sell something different from and that was a way of like transferring money from ... to the siblings\nYou know and as we started out on the reporting of some at one of the questions\nI'm immediately we knew for Trump drove a hard deal he was very careful with his money I'm an every penny was you know you could see you would account for it he was a guy who\nWould walk construction sites and if you saw a nail on the ground he would pick it up and make sure it was used somewhere so we found it hard to believe that he wasn't already driving a pretty hard to deal with the with the dealers than the than the sellers that he had to\nTo do business with every day from the buildings but we went out and and we looked for um\nPossible employees that all county had maybe they had a purchasing department that was actually getting better deals we throw our interviews and the documents um that we had we couldn't find any any even employees that all county had it was simply a mechanism where\nIt would mark up the material and then build friend who was a ... in voice padding operation where they would just overcharge Fred on these items that it serves no other purpose\nWhen the Trump sibling set up all county this this company that just that existed to siphon money from French ... give it to the children get Fred Trump know about the company by the purpose of the company was he a knowing part of its creation\n[noise] we think that he absolutely was he was an almost roads you meetings where they came up with these ideas and it appealed to him because it was um she was someone who just hated the idea of putting him in kind of gets gr state taxes and we also see the signature on checks\nUm that were written to all Kelly building supplies so he was a man who\nPaid close attention to everybody as those that there's evidence both in the reporting in in the documents that he was absolutely um this was something that he was on board with\nAnd then in a way like a collateral victims of these inflated cost were rent or isn't a lot of Trump properties because he use those inflated cost for boilers and refrigerators and spell of\nAs a way to justify raising the rent on people living in government rent controlled unit\nThat's right when you're an owner of a building and you have rent controlled apartments you have people living in them you have to apply to the city or the state to have the rent increased and you have to send over\nProof when you do that that you've made various improvements in in this case they use the potted receipts and many instances the false receipts to say that we made repairs worth you know a hundred thousand or a hundred and twenty thousand when in fact\nThose repairs may have only costs eighty thousand they use these bogus receipts that they had created to justify higher than what should have been rent increases and then the depositions that we have them we obtain journal reporting Robert Trump Donald Trump's brother talks about this and he says the higher the markup the higher the rent we could charge\nAfter friend the parents died in Nineteen Ninety nine at eight Ninety three\nYou say the vast bulk of his empire was nowhere to be found in his state and that that was a testament to the success of the tax strategies\nTo transfer money to the Trump children\nBut you're right the single largest item included infrared Trump's estate tax return was it ten point three million dollar I argue from Donald Trump money Donald Trump appeared to have borrowed the year before Fred Trump died we've heard stories about Donald Trump's debt to banks\nBut this is the first time hearing that he owed his father millions of dollars when his father died\n[noise] well he owed his father money for most of his life um and there were refuted\nStrategies through the years to do something of\nThose unpaid that's that would accumulate so for example in the late Nineteen eighties at this point Donald Trump or his father somewhere in the neighborhood of Fifteen million bucks and the problem is that if his father simply cancelled that that well in the eyes of the or else\nA chance all dollar debt is the same as a dollar of income so Fred trumpet simply cancelled the debt and said I forgive you you don't have to pay me back\nDonald Trump was owed a chunk of tax for what's called cancellation of the\nSo Donald Trump in ... came up with this other way of making that are completely disappear involved trading that that for a stake in one of Donald Trump's buildings\nSo Fifteen million dollars or so of that for a steak in a building called Trump Palace\nIn them and then a few years later Fred Trump soul that Fifteen million dollar steak back to his son\nFor ten thousand dollars\nProof there goes that huge debt\nAnd I guess or New York times reporter says and crack and David Barstow after a break we'll talk more about the reporting into how

overwhelmingly by LA county voters the city of Los Angeles measured triple age to provide for housing\nUm is that starting to make an impact\nYes of course it is and we\nNeed to ask the people of the city of Los Angeles to be a little bit patient with us because we're trying to figure out how to distribute these dollars in an appropriate way and they're very effective way\nThe county of Los Angeles Los ... is the overseer for the measure eight dollars and they're figuring out what are the are if peace looked like with a request for proposals look like from agencies like housing works to be able to distribute these moneys\nAnd you know it just doesn't happen overnight change takes time\nChange is being affected is being effective and we need to be able to have a little bit of patience with each other at the same time you do the work that Rudy is doing every single day and as part of this be able to say yes our our our case workers are doing this work at we need we need to be able to take care of them\nWe need to be able to understand the challenges that they have and we need to also understand that in Los Angeles it's about all of us\nWhere where do you go to recruit people if you get funding let's say you put out an RSP you're going to have a program to to provide a service says this part of your housing mandate how do you find the people who are best suited\nA variety of places you might think automatically of a social work program which is great and we do reach out to those folks we help them understand that their internships available\nThe other place it's really really important for us is folks who become advocates who were folks who are chronically on the street themselves we have folks in our employment who have the experience who know what it was like\nAnd who have been able to take some steps to move forward to change their lives to become stabilized to get their issues under control to a level where they can become employed and they make the greatest employees in the world\nAnd in fact running in your film you focus on people who fit that description of through it and and I'm so with it do it do you see when you follow those individuals that this is a bit emotionally different for them if they in fact if experienced what the people there working where they're going through\nThey relate to the people I mean a\n... it's unbelievable to see the friendship that they create between themselves and the people they serve a and and I've been privileged to follow it and and and to follow that relationship and the document that and actually now I have\nI consider friends in the streets also because I was privileged to share the relationship but the people who have the experience of the streets they know how to behave in the street they know how to relate to the people are and they know what to speak how to speak to them\nWhy are you at the same time I wonder if it's even more difficult for them when they come home because they're tapping into something was traumatic that they experience it's not just\nNot that any of the advocates it's a it's a job I realize you can't do it and have it just be a job but it is so much more personal is that more challenging do you think for when they come home\nWhile I think this trainings I so the whip housing walk so they trained the workers and the the employees they obsession with a full day you know to learn how to deal with the motion when they go home and I so everyone was like\nPutting a break between work and home and try to protect some privacy for themselves so they can regroup when they leave home\nRudy silliness how do you do that how do you you know keep yourself from from succumbing to the emotions of the work\nI rely on my immediate co workers I think the film demonstrates

I mean anything just you know refusing to let me borrow the car that night or something I mean you know I um\nYeah I mean I definitely spend a lotta time being really really angry with both my parents you know with everybody I mean in part of that I think was was just a you know another aspect of or another part of denial or or whatever I mean and not wanting to\nTake responsibility for my actions and things yeah\n[noise] there were times when you went to rehab willingly in times when you went against your will is that correct yes absolutely did it make a difference to the outcome whether you went there willingly or whether you went there against your will\nUm ... no not really I mean you know each rehab that I went to I feel like really helped me a lot and I learned more and more about myself and I learned more and more about you know this disease and and you know what it takes to stay sober and how to sort of learn how to take care of yourself and love yourself and everything\nI mean each time that I relapsed after going into treatment I don't think that that meant that those treatment centers bailed me or anything or that it just was that I just wasn't ready you know\nThis last treatment center I went to I was absolutely did not want to go\nThis is to to a little over two years ago and I was basically coerced into treatment and you know once I got there I didn't want to stay there\nAnd it's not fun you know what I mean you're being told what to do every second of the day and you know you have to sleep and room with three other people and so it's not like I mean if I could do if I could have done it without having to go to rehab I definitely would have preferred to do that as expensive too you know it's it's it's hard you know for sure\nYou know a lot of people say that if you're an addict ... you're not gonna\nYou're not really going to be ready\nTo stop until your bottom doubt you seem to hit bottom like a whole bunch of time he's one of which was when you're on guard so badly infected from shooting up that um when you went to the when you finally went to the emergency room the doctor thought he might need to amputate your arm wasn't\nSomebody when the surgeon wouldn't eat to advocate your arm yeah um so how how come incidents like that weren't enough to get you to think well I'd better stop I'm killing myself\nUm well I guess I'm a part of it I again is that I think that killing myself was okay with me you know I mean I I sort of knew that that was what I was doing and and\nI I was sort of resigned to that and also you know I I guess there's a point where you feel like you've gone so far\nDown that building your life back after you know having let everyone down again and having you know disappointed people and and you know I'm overdrawn your bank account and lost her cell phone lost her job and\nYou know lost your car and I mean it just feels like at certain points like just start over and to try to rebuild my whole life together is just too much and so you know I might as well just ride this out till the end and just see it through until yeah until I'd I'd die you know and\nBut um but there was I mean there was something inside of me that I guess believed that maybe things can get better somehow even against all you know rationale or whatever\nAnd that little bit of hope you know as well as what I was able to to hold onto and and um that's gotten me here thank God so\nWe're listening to an interview with Nick Schiffman his father David Sheff recorded in two thousand date\nNick ships memoir about who struggled with addiction is called tweak growing up on methamphetamines David chefs memoir about his son's addiction is called the beautiful boy which is also the name of the new movie based on both memoirs we'll hear more on this conversation after a break this is fresh air\nTides Nick Roman while you're at work we're working to covering all of a national state and local stories you need to hear on all things for NPR\nJoined us for all things considered a weekday afternoon set for maybe nine point three KP cc\nBCC supporters include coups and media group presenting the great buster the new film about Simon ... star buster Keaton from director Peter ... with interviews from Mel Brooks Quentin Tarantino and more starts today at landmarks new aren't theater and\nThis is fresh air let's get back to tear each interview with David shift and his son Nick chef they both written memoirs about coping with Nick's addiction to methamphetamines memoirs which are the basis of a new film beautiful boy starring Steve ...\n[noise] I I think one of the things that you both had trouble with\nIn the rehab programs was the quote God talk you know in the ACA hawks anonymous model\nYou look toward a higher power to give you strains and there's a saying that goes let go and let God David you describe in your memoir how ... year you were or are still are in an atheist and raised in it without religion um\nDid you learn how to I felt guilty that you asked me about what I felt guilty for I felt guilty for that too when we heard from some people that the only way to get sober and stay sober is\nTo embrace that and they try to broaden it by saying you know God can be whatever you conceive him to be it's a higher power and things like that it was an infinite would say that it was just an excuse\nTo resist but I think ultimately\nI learned and I think he learned that you could not deny some of those basic principles including the first one which is you know Nick didn't agree for a long time it's just that he that he was powerless over his addiction he thought he was in control he had to\nNearly died more than once before he finally I think except about and once you accept that I think you're in the door\nUm but I just I I think that that God thing you know in ... step programs and in recovery I think ... is a huge problem because I Try I spend a lot of time you know trying so hard to practice prayer and doing all this stuff to make myself you know come to believe\nAnd ultimately you know when I sit with myself and the quiet moments you know when I'm Alone you know I don't believe you know I think that for people who are just fundamentally you don't believe in God or any you know reason to this world or anything I think that\nFive years after that interview David Sheff returned to fresh air they talked about his book clean which focuses on medical and scientific research into addiction and recovery\nDavid Sheff welcome back to ... ... thank you as a pleasure to have you back addiction\nAs a brain disease is one of the main points of your book but what you mean by that\nWell first of all ... became a different person the only explanation I ultimately came to is that he was ill ah at first I didn't believe it I thought you know he was just a selfish crazy teenager but\nBut then the more I learned that in turn kids would go out after school smell smoke pot\nWhere the party on the friday night though I'll drink and one of those possibly two of those will become addicted so there's something different about that person they're something different about the brain and I've seen brain scans are there's so much research now that shows that people with addiction process drugs differently\nOr their neurological system is different a different part of the brain is in control you know we think about addiction as a morally reprehensible choice but a ... act crazy because in a way that they are\nSo you know you're right in the book that I'm going through detox is just the first step\nYou know after you've given up the drug and you've come out the other end you still need treatment and maybe not just you know twelve step kind of program maybe you really need psychiatric treatment and medication to help you through whatever the problem was that ... to your addiction and the first place\nThere was a really dangerous idea for so long that all someone how to do was goes off drugs that had to detox you know they had to go through cold turkey and they would wake up in the morning and there'd Be Sober\nBeing sober is just the first step getting off drugs is just the first up and then treatment really begins if someone has psychological disorders most often they haven't been diagnosed whether they have or haven't they need to be true\nAnd if someone is struggling and some other ways and their life they need help\nYou write that young people are more susceptible to addiction and an addiction is especially\nDangerous for young people and this all has to do with the development of their brain the part of the brain known as the prefrontal cortex is still developing when you're young to talk about the importance of that part of the brain in any I'm persons development and and then in addiction\nWhat kids are the most vulnerable to becoming addicted you know it's a really stressful time and their lives I mean we've you know being an adolescent is really hard but they're also is this underlying\nTeenagers' brains are developing more rapidly than at any other time in their lives\nBut all the um parts of the brain don't develop at the same time the final part of the brain which is associated with judgment in rational thinking is lagging a so it's not in control and meanwhile the first part of the brain to develop\nIf the rear portion which is associated with pleasure sinking seeking an impulsiveness so it's in control\nWe always think about teenagers being impulsive you know they want to experiment they have all kinds of crazy reckless behavior a lot of it is because of that their brain hasn't developed to the point where they can moderate these impulses\nSo it's much more likely that kids are going to use drugs and they're more likely to use them excessively\nSo the development of even slower the part of the brain that normally would regulate would help kids make better decisions isn't in control so they start using more and there's this cycle\nAnd that's where addiction comes from a Ninety percent of the people who become addicted started using when they were teenagers before they were Eighteen [noise]\nA lot of memoirs written by people who had been addict start with him hitting bottom\nYou know the the absolutely worst imaginable thing that happened to them because of their addiction and then they hit bottom and then they go into rehab and they seek treatment and then things start to turn around and in the book kind of begins\nAnd so many stories just like addict stories that are you know are told you know start again with like hitting bottom and\nI think a lot of people assume that if you love somebody who is addicted to a substance\nThat until they hit bottom and until they really realize that their life as a state that their dignity is at stake that there's there's no way they're going to give up you know the drug or alcohol\nAnd you make a point in the book that that's not necessarily true that if you love somebody who's an addict you don't need to wait till they hit bottom you can intervene and perhaps intervene effectively\nIf you love someone who's an addict and their use is life threatening you don't wait until they hit bottom because that can mean that they're going to die you have to do everything you can to get them in treatment and now we know\nThat it's too dangerous to wait for a person to hit bottom I mean people were told that they had to let their kids you know their husbands or wives whoever it was they had to stand back not to intervene let them hit bottom so they would crawl into a treatment center and say please help me\nThat idea it's so dangerous that have killed so many people\nThe other problem with it is that this is a progressive disease which means that as long as it's not being treated it gets worse addiction as a disease like anything else it's like cancer like heart disease like diabetes and we know\nYou know at the first signs of serious illness we want to seek treatment\nIf someone in our families had early warning signs of any of those diseases we would bring them to a doctor to figure out what is going on we would not wait until the disease progressed so we want to intervene in the second we get a sense of there's a problem\nBut you know with addiction and this is different from cancer a person has to be willing to change to stop using\nAnd um I mean you can lock them up in an environment where they can't get drugs you or you know whether that's prison or or you know put them in rehab where there's not going to be any drugs but when they get out you know unless there's constant surveillance they still have to make that decision to\nTo not use 'em\nLet let me give me an example of a story that you've told about your son um when he was addicted that he would call you you know from the street and say you have\nTo pick me up I think I'm dying you have to come get me and take me home and you you didn't want to do that 'cause you've been burned before you take them home and he would he'd steal from you he would do things that would be dangerous for your younger children to observe [noise]\nUm so you finally said to him no I'll pick you up and I'll take you to rehab\nAnd your son said no I don't want to go to rehab doesn't work for me you need to take me home and you said call back when you're ready to go to rehab and you hung up so if you have to do that over again would you think that that was the right way of handling it\nNo I tried though so many times to get him into treatment and I would do anything it took a drag him off the streets I search for him when I could find him you know I I\nI just did whatever it took to get him into treatment and it hadn't worked every time he\nWould go into treatment he would do fine for a while and then he would relapse so my assumption was that relapse proved that the treatment hadn't worked but I now know is that many times not always but many times relapse as a part of this disease\nSo addicts get sober a it's a chronic illness the craving doesn't go away unless it's being treated and relapses common\nThat means that even though there was resistance going back into treatment\nEvery time I had to do whatever I could to get into treatment and when they called up begging me to go back telling me that he was going to die\nSo many times I I had succumbed I mean all I wanted to do with never mind to to to get him help but I just wanted to see him to see that he was alive but\nI finally listen to the messages of these rehab programs to talk about this tough love thing and that he had to hit bottom and I hung up the phone and I whipped\nBazaars thing I'd ever done and he did call you know just a few days later and said he was ready to go into treatment but he absolutely could have died\nIn that story you basically had two options that I can think of one has to say well if I'm not driving you rehab I'm not picking up at all and the other is okay I'll take you home you chose the if I'm not driving you to rehab I'm not taking new home in a while and you think you're lucky that he didn't die as a result and then he chose to go to rehab a few days later\nSo in retrospect do you think you'd have ... you should have chosen the other option is which is what have been I'll take your home and maybe you wouldn't have gone to rehab\nI think that every situation is different in retrospect it was fine in retrospect you know it worked but\nIf I was there again I Would have gone to get him and brought him home\nAnd [noise] done everything I could to get him into treatment because every day he was out there it was so dangerous I mean that night I didn't sleep of course I was just petrified and I had a reason to because he could have gone out and scored an overdose and died", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "19"}
