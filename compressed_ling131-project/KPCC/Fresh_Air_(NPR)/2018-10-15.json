night at seven\nAnd then she'll be at the point of Mr branch library of the Burbank public library system\nThat will be on Thursday November first that event starts at seven PM\nYou don't have to write it down you can just go to Kay PCC dot org slash air talk and you'll find links to those two events that she as coming up [noise] a metric Peter in eagle rock says that a number of the library workers went back to work\nAnd a half respiratory illnesses as a result of their exposure or how serious problem was that well\nThis was a big concern because when you have fire I'm gutting building and and opening up possibly to as best as in this building was built in the Nineteen twenties it had as best as Senate as would any building of that sort [noise]\nA number of the librarians requested transferred to other branches and I should say librarians worked in the building for a short amount of time to help remove the books that were in there and then the building was shot\nThis was to see what could be saved what was lost ...\nSo they didn't go back to work in the building I'm beyond this period of time when they were removing everything and for a while there was no central branch of the Los Angeles librarian than a temporary branch\nEnded up opening on springs street but it was then seven years before\nThe building reopened and there were librarians who felt that they were exposed not only to his best us but just to the aftermath of a fire\nWhich is all of the particulate matter from a fire and the um the dirt and ... that is created when you burn four hundred thousand bucks so no matter what it was not a very appealing workplace and it was pretty tough\nFor all of them to be in there helping\nClear to the library out and an added to their anxiety and stress certainly\nYou mentioned four hundred thousand books those were how many were destroyed ride was about a million volumes that suffered some degree of damage\nYeah there were um seven hundred thousand that were either burn or had water damage and four hundred thousand that were just gone\nThey were just incinerated and magazines newspapers were all destroyed so it was a huge lawsuit was the largest library fire in the history of the United states\nAnd then a few months later there was in the music section of the library another fire\nAnd that is almost more mysterious because the building was closed there had been a security check in the room five minutes or so before this fire was reported so it was very disconcerting this feeling was that maybe it was someone on the staff\nWho had access to the room who had started the fire again was never solved never understood what happened who did it why they did it and fortunately that that was the end of it\nThat took seven years but the library came back I think you could argue even better than ever the restoration of\nThe beautiful historical features of the building they didn't abandoned the historic building a they were able to expand it as well with new features and all of that was rather innovative development project to come up with the funding for it well\nThis was the interesting thing the building itself was insured but the contents were not\nSo we're talking millions and millions and millions of dollars worth of books that had to be replaced and the money needed to um to restore the collection itself\nWas vast and that was really the people of Los Angeles who contributed and created this fund that allowed the books to be replaced\nBut the expansion of the building was funded\nIn a really interesting way which we're now very accustomed to and that is by the selling of the air rights over the library the library was zoned to be much taller than I mean that piece of land had zoning rights to be much taller than the library was\nAn air rights were a new concept in financing at the time so those air rights\nOf the undeveloped\nA airspace above the library\nWere sold for many millions of dollars to developers who developed the buildings adjacent to the library that are among the tallest buildings and you want to thank tower exactly yeah so it was a very novel way of\nBoth preserving the original\nProfile of the building but making making use of its right to be a lot taller than it was and it really kicked off in a whole era of development in in the city of Los Angeles once this air right deal was\nCompleted successfully suddenly it open the opportunity for that kind of financing to be done elsewhere in the city\nAnd we've got a an extraordinary reopened uh Los Angeles library or was it was and we've spent almost the entire time talking about the the L A library itself but your book also spent considerable time\nI'm a you know about the science and art of of the library and being a library and I want to give you a chance to close about the importance of libraries to us because a lot more than just books as important as they are\nYes and certainly the the stewardship of books is an important mission for the library but when I was really struck by what I really love about the library is it it's at created space\nTo share stories to share knowledge to share information and librarians are the the gate keepers in\nRather special environment there's nothing else like that in culture it's inclusive it welcomes every sort of person across the board\nIt allows people to explore any kind of information that they want that they're curious about that is such a marvelous thing we've created and it it\nIt fills me with real joy when I Walk into a library and think about the people who make this place possible and what's\nA beautiful Susan is how libraries are is essential today even in our Internet age as they were before we had the world at our fingertips library

... who will learn tomorrow if you won the men's Booker Prize for best novel of the year written in English and published in the u._k. that's on fresh air [noise]\nFirst news\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Lakshmi Singh James Woolsey former director of security for the Senate intelligence committee is pleading guilty to one federal count of lying to the FBI about his contacts with reporters under a plea deal with the U.S attorney's office in Washington DC\nKind of like\nYou know when your earlier like oh I got to be\nProvocative I have to be edgy I have to like if I'm going to talk about race how to do and like this crazy way that I think has never been done and make people uncomfortable or make people like really just kind of laugh out of like shock rather than laughing out of I truly like enjoying that joke thoroughly\nAnd that is a joke around my maybe you just don't need to joke about slavery like that\nI'm sure there's a great slavery joke but I haven't cracked that not yet and it's fine for me to not tell garbage ones in the meantime\nSo you're talking about your discomfort in comedy clubs performing when you started out and it took you to like last year [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] I'm like you can really do it but you and Jessica William started\nThe comedy podcast you do queens and you know you you also talked about wanting to do comedy in\nAn environment where we're where people in trans people could come and not feel like they risk being the butt of a joke\nBut that's how it is on to the queens I mean when you and Jessica Williams who's your partner on that show up put it together like what was your goal in terms of the kinds of comics she wanted a showcase because it starts with you and and her\nYou know talking in a funny way about things that recently happened to you and then you bring up several um you know stand up comics to perform it and it's done from a theater [noise]\nUm so so what was what was your goal in terms of showcasing comics and creating a type of environment for the audience and for the performers\nThe fact that it's on HBO Now is it we started working together four years ago is truly bonkers crazy banana sandwich and the best way possible and um when Justin I met\nAnd just even for her her and I ... I just will always known as like a little while she's late night shows and it usually be you know straight white guys getting these opportunities and every once in a while I see a woman or every\nOnce in a while you see like a black guy and I would just see it and I'd be like oh okay yeah all these people are fun and not take anything away from the people that did get those spots\nBut I'm like I'm surrounded by so many funny women\nSo many funny people of color so many funny we're people who might not get those same opportunities to submit their tape to a book or to get green led to talk about different things from their perspective\nAnd so when Jackson I met we were just kind of like we know so many hilarious people who don't have\nMaybe the platform that they can to express themselves in a way we're like well it would be really do hope\nNo pun intended but it'd be really up to\nNot only have a show that sort of ... showcases you know my improv injustice improv abilities both singular and together but also uses shows a platform to just bring our friends along it'd be like we're supporting everybody this is a show for everybody if you are funny\nThere's no reason why you're not going to be on the show and I think a lot of times you would just here you know\nAnd the industry oh they're just like our desert Ernie funny black women are we just don't know where to look and I'm like\nThat ... doesn't fly with me and where there are so many talented amazing people and if you're not looking them it's either out of laziness or the fact that you really don't care\n[noise] so you're pretty successful now in comedy and with your podcast and HBO specials of to do queens but for years you made next to nothing as a comment yes\nYes and and you were getting like joining calls from the student loans that you owed you were nearly evicted from your apartment but you were given a reprieve of like several weeks or a couple of months to raise the\nFive thousand dollars that you needed to stay in your apartment how did you handle the anxiety\nOf not being able to pay your student loans and then not being able to afford to have an apartment and nearly beings I said\nYeah you know there were a lot of tears\nJust like not being able to sleep at night there's a lot of feeling like a failure of feeling like maybe me trying to pursue comedy's a little nutty because I really didn't start making a really solid living doing comedy until eight and a half years and and um\nYou know I was kind of like well maybe\nIt shouldn't take this long ... there are other people around me where it's like it is not taking them eight years to sort of like you know get their career going the way they want to and you know looking back on and now I'm just kind of like you can't control when that happens I think\nYes it was kind of irritating that it took me this long but I think I was\nSo fully ready for the opportunities that arose by that point so like you know to to queens being a HBO didn't scare me having to write a book didn't scare me it's like a cabin blogging in writing for three\nFor years making what fifty bucks a blog post okay yeah I can just writing this book is going to be hard but I'm not going to run away from it\nLet me introduce you here if you're just joining us my guest is comic an actor Phoebe Robinson who hosts the podcast and HBO specials to do queens with Jessica Williams and she has a new book which\nIs called everything's trash but it's okay we're going to take a short break and then be right back this is fresh air\nHide from like Roman an NPR investigation shows across the country prison discipline comes down harder on women with severe punishment for even lower level infraction look at that on all things considered we do that for an eighty nine point three\nKey PCC KBC supporters include acuity a group informing listeners at an annual eye exam can detect chronic diseases before symptoms appear more information resources and location set acuity I group dot com acuity I ... is your vision\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guess is comedian and actor Phoebe Robbins and who hosts the podcast to dope queens with Jessica Williams they closed it together and they also have a series of four HBO specials by the same name and they have formed more set for twenty Nineteen right pd\nYes I'm so excited\nAnd now he has a new book called everything's trash but it's okay you and your brother went to a private Catholic high school and he said that you were one of two or three black students and the whole school and you were the only black person and you're graduating class what if your parents and you there\nI was the only black girl in my graduating oh okay okay yeah so there were four four ... four of us black students graduating class I was only black girl I'm you know my parents are\nHuge into education and they are just like that is the key to everything they were like if you want to have like a really full\nHalf the like fulfilled\nLife education is the way to go so they send us the Gilmore academy and it was my brother totally like excelled and you know was like an a student and like Mr popular and like ... truly just like rocked it out and I was\nA hot mess like like with such a slacker but yes I Am going to go more than I was kind of like hosting and like not really like living up to my potential which infuriated them so much but yeah I they I think they just wanted to have like all the advantages they could possibly give us in life and I think\nThough was kinda like a a crummy student there I think I did learn a lot like it did work study there so I think from like a young age like fourteen Fifteen I always like was learning you have to earn your keep you have to like work hard to be able to be in a place that you're you're in [noise] so when you\nWeigh the discomfort of being like the only black girl and you're graduating class\nWith the fact that you probably did get a really good education ... um how does the balance come out [noise]\nI think you know and I think it was worth it I Will say it would have been nice if there was another black girl and my great I think there was like one black girl in my class and there was one Indian girl and\nOne Asian girl and I'm sure will be you know and not to be like it's nice to have like a matching that but it would it be nice if we can of each like you know looked\nAcross you know during math and saw someone else who look like us [noise] whenever we talk about like representation like diversity I don't think sometimes people fully understand how\nHard it is to not see yourself especially if you're living in society or culture where you are\nSo reflected at every possible turn I think it's hard to like um imagine what it's like to not have that and so you know I I Do think that like if there was like a ... queens that would've been\nA game changer for me to just like here to black woman like young black woman\nOh well I'm thirty four but I'm like hey young black women [laughter] but you know to hear to like young black women talking about\nOh this one time I got my hair done at the salon and they did this to my hair and like totally like mess it up I couldn't talk about by black hair woes in high school with like Laura\nShe doesn't know she doesn't she just wakes up and she has to be flawless like straight here like she didn't have to go through like what I had to go through and so I think in the end it worked out okay but I did have to do a lot of work on myself I did have to kind of like be OK with being out\nNumbered in a way and not letting that make me so sad and then also I think I was very lucky to be a child in the nineties with like ... or you know Martin Family Matters and girlfriends and all these sort of shows\nWhen we left off we were talking about being single her book ends with her being in a committed relationship your boyfriend is white and\nAnd yet you say that went oh gee why 'cause he's British honey [laughter] you're right\nWhen you're in an interracial relationship you get mail or queries from black men wanting to know why you're not with a black man and then you write funny when I'm Single these same black dudes aren't asking me out I'm so elaborate on that for us\nWell you know I I just want to profit as most of my life is me not getting us out like this you know what I mean\nWe are [laughter]\nI'm not Riyad our guys are throwing themselves at me I'm Sorry I just think in general like knocking at that a lot\nAnd um I used to just be like I Will just wait for a guide asking yeah like I really was sort of in my ... my mom didn't teach me that sort of like two to behavior but I was like I'm just going away for a guy so that's like ... truly\nHow I was dating and I would just wait for someone asked me out and if no one asked me I just wouldn't date\nIs so ignorant and also leg huh what's he talking about you got a job you could ask people out so you know that's just really where I was in so\nYou know I think interracial dating is just really tricky for a lot of people because I think a lot of times people want to find a reason for why you're not dating within your tribe and\nI'm always just kind of like you just meet who you meet and if the timing is right like I met British bake off at a YouTube concert L O L truly like hilarious 'cause his band was opening for you to you at the time and\nYou know we sort of hit it off like not eat like not even right away I was like I don't care about the guns like focus on you do but I convinced you realized British bake off was kind of dope and then we just ended up dating from nearby again that\nWas not it just wasn't pre planned I like didn't even like really give them a second glance way I I met him so I mentioned\nThat you and Jessica Williams hosts too dumb queens you have your own podcast\nAnd he white guys and would you interview people as opposed to doing stand up\nAnd I interviewed you and I was really fun I really enjoy that a lot I was really glad I did that\nUm so how did so many white guys get its name\nWell because you know most podcasts\nAre hosted by white guys and then they interview other white guys and you're like cool [laughter] you're gonna have you're gonna have steak and eggs every day okay enjoy your life\nUm it's I just kind of wanted to be like I'm going to poke fun of like there's so many white guys but actually the thing is there's only one token white guy for ... and the rest of the episodes are just women where people people of color and those like the majority of the gas\n[noise] so now that you're I'm starting to be cast in roles um do you look at\nA casting calls or the equivalent and because um you write something very funny about that and and your first book but are there are kind of casting calls were you know that they are not there definitely like not entertaining idea of having a black person in that role like is there any kind of coded language\nThat you can see when a black person would even conceivably be cast in the real\nThe lead [laughter] you're like oh so the leads going to be ... cold [laughter] okay so I'm the best friend okay cool cool I got that you want me to sound like this okay\nI'm not going to do that but I think there were two big things that I have you know when I started acting like pretty recently I had to have a conversation with myself before I even like going to my agent or whatever and I was always like I\nDon't want to think was part of a wife answering a damn phone\nCall from her husband and giving him some motivation I don't want to do that I don't want to be on the other line being like you got this baby I have no ... no life\nI'm just at home holding unfolded laundry I Will never you will never see I I hate to use the word never but you will never see me on screen holding a basket of unfolded laundry I Will not do\nIt if you were living alone and doing your own laundry that would be perfectly fine\nThat's okay but if I'm like on the phone with Chaney Tatum and he's out you know freaking saving the president and I'm at home is stepping on a lego folding his you know gym shorts that's not the part for me\nUm you know I think the language in it or a casting call is like\nAll American as whites beautiful but doesn't know it is white ah and then usually obey like open to all ethnicities is when you know that that is\nOh that's a robot so that they can envision someone not white doing it but it's like all the rules should be open to ethnicity do you know what I mean like there\nThere is no reason why it took you know twenty some odd years for that it'd be crazy Rich Asians there's no there's no excuse for that\nThey could have been leads and romantic comedies this whole time and so whenever I see that stuff I always think about like ... and she's five as long as it's like not inappropriate in terms of language or sex is this a part\nThat when she gets older would I be embarrassed to show her that I did\nYou know what I mean and so that's kind of always like sort of my needle and how I operate and it's it's hard being in an industry where you know if you're not the mainstream sort of thing you're just not going to be considered but I think on the flip side what's great right now is that\nThis is an industry where creators\nShine where they can swim where you can have like an Easter ray you could have you know a Phoebe adjusted could do to to ... to have an ad in a lot of you can have all these sorts of people sort of just creating their own opportunities in our own lanes\nPhoebe Robbins and it's just been great to have you on our show thank you so much Teri and honestly this has\nBeen a delight in my life and we got to hang up I Know we're supposed to see Bruno Mars together and we couldn't do it\nNo because we're both working so [laughter] yes you don't just let me know none of the deaf leopard who do you have on that one [laughter]\nThat was going to get to the other day yellows your\nYeah yeah you got the tickets Phoebe Robinson's new collection of comic personal essays is called
