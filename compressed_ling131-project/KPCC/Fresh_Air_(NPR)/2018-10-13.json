I'm actually you know under ... documents you cannot change their views and the defense presented a different more complicated argument and this particular situation we can now for the camera over the shoulder of a district officer Van Dyke and we cannot watch it from these different perspectives 'cause only defense is such that dash cam video and they really\nTurned it on his head they said that they use laser based technology to take everything that had happened there that night and turn it so that you could see what it would have looked like from officer Van Dyke point of view\nWhat was the

arguments that did stand out\nWhy Donald what did you find any\nProsecutor stood up and essentially laid out what he saw as the scenario\nWas damaged tanks\nDire way for every state where\nLiquid

in fact one of the officers got up on the stand that officer Van Dyke trial and hold that story again described the aggressive movement and a case for self defense\nSo I think that the outcome of this trial was really important that some people have people who had thought that no police officer would ever be held accountable for a police shooting and so for those people this has gone a long way\nBut now there's a bigger question about how\nOr accountability we'll go we'll stop with a police officer who\nDoes the shooting\nOr will it go on to all the fellow officers laughter report what

in Culver City California I'm Shannon been sent hurricane Michael the category for storm that made landfall over the Florida Panhandle this week before moving nor it's dumped heavy rain on Georgia the Carolinas and Virginia\nWho was king of the gimmicks and his films of ripping off Alfred Hitchcock but in a way it was the other way around because offered Hitchcock people forget when psycho came out\nThe big ad campaign was that no one can enter the theater wants to feature has become which was unheard of at the time you forget people used to go to the movies at any time and just stay through to the next part of the film they never clear the fear\nSo there was a clock and every box office so you know and it was a big big gimmick so in a way he was king of the gimmicks also and he copied William Castle who went away did it first\nSo I've always in a way like the second rate better I mean William Castle law like more than Alfred Hitchcock Jayne Mansfield I like to more than Marilyn Monroe\nCell menial I liked him really a lot though I didn't feel he was inferior but he was maybe I like so many are even more than James Dean I always like the wrong person I always rooted for the wrong person and I always thought that the people that other people thought were ugly were better looking that's always been my wife and my career as kind of been based on that\nI Know you really like the ... pitch for a movie like the William Castle come on but where the money that you felt really cheated by because they promised that thin and sex and sleeves and and they didn't deliver\nI never feel cheated when I go to the movies even if I hate it it's an experience of the cinematic experience\nAnd and that's why I started taking these pictures there's no such thing as a bad movie if you go to a movie watching detail only if you really hate the movie just look at the lamps at it\nAnd pretend the movie is about lamps and and and and then never as it boring it's always exciting and it's always surprising you can even see continuity mistakes within the lamps\nAnd you also have a series called into 'em that are at this stills from a Swedish quote our films\nArt some art meant dirty when I was young and that's the way it should stay anger was one of about ... we've been\nYou know the Bergman movies when they first came out in Baltimore were sold effects films because they had a little bit of nudity on them\nAnd Sweden became a code word for dirty still the dirty bookshop in Baltimore is called the Sweden books [laughter] about making this up so I Love the idea I tried to put in the end but I just showed the back of somebody I showed no nudity I showed\nThe one shot and affects them you would never reproduce that would never become a still is is the sexy girl walking away from you out of focus a shop that no one would ever produce all the still in the show are ones that would never be produced I did a whole series called marks\nWhere I just took photograph off the floor when I'm ...\nMaking a movie Packer of the tape marks the crew puts down that the actors have to hit to stay in focus and that's the only thing in the shop everything that would be in the movie is called the actors the costumes props and all that's left is the one thing you can't show in a movie still\nSince a few of the shots in your book allude to you know erotic movies or or porn movies I'm Wondering how you discover pornography as a kid jihad as I discovered\nPoint as a kid Peyton place was the first dirty book I had ever rather than I had heard about it certainly meant dingo was another one and that's like kind of a great movie\nUm and playboy and he played one was the first thing that you could ever really see now gay porn was a very very different thing there was a store called Sherman's downtown that had those magazines like them and vigor and they were supposedly muscle man magazines but it was it was kind of a coded thing was the first gay magazines I ever saw\nDid your father have a pornographic books are women's magazines you in the u._k. a sneak peek that\nNo he didn't but he did have Peyton place and I did read his copy of Peyton place\nEveryone had Peyton place my grandfather had pain types Peyton place was the biggest number one bestseller for weeks and weeks and weeks\nAnd it led to Jackie Suzanne that led to Jackie Collins that led to that entire genre of work but um but she did it first and she did it best and she had such great titles another one of her books for the tight white collar about a priest at such a good size [laughter]\nBut but she didn't handle successor well I mean she divorced her husband she moved to a plaza hotel and she drank too much and died basic rights so that's not the best of success story but the book was so famous that when I went back\nTo New Hampshire where where she wrote the book they still talk about her [laughter] and the town in the library I only had one tattered copy\nBut I did go to her grave and grace has been a a a great heroine of mine\nWhen you started finding pornography and straight pornography what was like what was it like reading or seeing photos that were ... women's bodies when women's bodies weren't when it was an out for you\nWell when I looked at those pictures I always looked at it in a way to see how far could go the same way I went to\nUm heterosexual exploitation movies all the time that had no male nudity to see how far can go I was interested in how the taboos would fall how it started with a new discount movies where the first things I saw and and you would see\nBare breast some limit I'm sometimes ashes but once in a while a male asked but they had to be playing volleyball so you know that was not so erotic to me but I've never had a neighbor I'm Matt horny let's put it that way\n[laughter] you get to see the news can't movies and these were needed these were movies at 'em ups extensively we're supposed to be documentaries about healthy alternative lifestyles and yelling didn't really about the nudity where do they play where did you get to see them\nI can tell you right where one of my favorite theaters the wrecks movie theater in Baltimore which is now at church at when I was young it started out I mean I saw the wizard of Oz there but it later became a new the movie theater I not only saw Newt is Kevin movies I saw the early Russ Meyer movies I saw a\n... and it was one man alone to who fought the censorship or we have the melon censorship board and um censorship has always been something I fought\nSo um I've always dealt with censorship so direct theater was where I got a lot of my film education in Baltimore\nJohn Waters speaking to Terry Gross in two thousand four more after a break this is fresh air\nI Am Sam Sanders here this week we're looking at the history\nHave come out [noise]\n[noise] and the\nChanging meaning of coming out and you mean to tell me you like other men why\nBless coming outdoors from our listeners next time on it's been a minute and NPR Saturday Night at nine on eighty nine point three KBC the\nThis is fresh air let's get back to his two thousand four interview with filmmaker John Waters\nThe Baltimore museum of art in his hometown has just launched a three month retrospective exhibition of his visual art it's called John Waters indecent exposure and runs through January six [noise]\nDid you feel guilty for for your ... your taste about violating all the standards of decency\nNo I never felt guilty um I I always knew I I told the story before but I was young I heard my parents talking about me you know you listen to the top of the steps and my mom said well he's just an odd duck\nAnd I thought well that's it you know so I I didn't really ever care\nThat the other kids weren't interested in what I resent because as I had a very rich fantasy life\nAnd my parents I'm allowed that I had a little stage even as a kid uh I I my parents bought me a reel to reel tape recorder so I could tape songs I was the first download her ever because I was a real real tape recorder tape songs off the radio and but then so I could sing them on lip sync from basically\nSo I always I was a puppeteer as a kid I had a I had a job I had a career when I was twelve years old so puppeteer\nSo I always had an outlet for this that that was encouraged even though the work I was doing was not exactly the work that they wished I was doing but but I I guess they figured it was this or nothing maybe or prison [laughter]\nBut they were very supportive which was very I'm very very encouraging and I I always say that if if you've got a kid that doesn't fit in as rebelling in any way encouraging if your if your daughter comes home and she's just had her entire face tattooed what you can you do maybe she'll open a tattoo parlor that will do well that's all you can you got to deal with what you got\nSince you didn't feel guilty about watching things in being obsessively interesting interested in things that weren't supposed to be healthy did you go the other direction if you could well I might as well plan up to the hilt and envy you know take on the pose of of the pervert [noise]\nOh I never thought of it that way I\nI I took one I had to create a persona for myself in the beginning when we make these movies because I didn't have\nAny advertising no one knew what we had to think of a way to to publicize the movies and divine and I did that sort of as as a [laughter] I was the director and he was the same movie star and certainly I dressed weirdly but um it was always confusing I I never um\nMy audience in the beginning\nWas never gay or straight who was gay people that didn't like other gay people let's say three [laughter] it was a hippie but didn't like hippies it was it was always the outsider of another outside of group that that's that's what my audience began with and certainly I'm\n\nSmall\nJohn ... to ... make\nIt so I Want to start by asking you to read from the first chapter the role models in this chapter is about Johnny Mathis who was shockingly [laughter] one of your role model so why don't you read an excerpt at our church\nI Wish I were Johnny Mathis some mainstream so popular so on ironic perfect effortlessly boy I should over Seventy years old with a voice that still makes all of America wants to make out heavenly warm yes I'll say it out loud wonderful wonderful\nIs it because Johnny Mathis says the polar opposite of me a man whose greatest hits album was on the billboard charts for four hundred and Ninety ... consecutive weeks versus me a cult filmmaker whose core audience no matter how much I've crossed over consists of minorities who can't even fit in with their own minorities\nDo we secretly idolize or imagine opposites\n... reading from his new book role models I was shocked to see that Johnny Mathis [laughter] was the lead chapter he probably lost [laughter] well I mean he's as a singer he's such a like a romantic and you're so not in your art I Can't speak about your private life so\nWhat is the attraction\nWill because Johnny Mathis is the opposite of me because\nJohnny Mathis to me is the kind of mainstream that I Will never ever be able to have an everybody wants to have hits like that but at the same time Johnny Mathis said to me I always wanted to be a jazz singer\nSo in a way you're opposite sometimes isn't exactly what you believe him to be too so I didn't know Johnny Mathis and to get to meet him was not easy because I'm sure that Google me and I'd be nervous too\n[laughter] so um\nHe was lovely thought when I went to his house and everything\nIs assume that the reason why Johnny Mathis didn't do a lot of\nInterviews with because he was in the closet and didn't want to have to well I wrote that that\nThing that I was not coming to him with any agenda sects of moral ... racial anything and I did and I didn't\nAnd I never asking those questions I don't really think obviously if you wanted to talk about any of his personal life he did he he just said some of my fans think their mothers' Johnny Mathis you know I I Know what he meant what does she have to share his public life with I'm not always for that\nYou know I get weary of reading these people that tell every personal thing to reporters they just met that day and that's what I'm going to say don't have friends that's what friends are foreign our borders\nSo you mentioned Tennessee Williams he's a chapter in your book role models and I'm going to ask you to read an excerpt of your chapter in Tennessee Williams\nI this one is called a okay the kindness of strangers\nLet me just say this is John Waters think asked his new book is called role models in each chapter is about somebody else who in one way or another was a role model or an inspiration for him so this is Tennessee Williams\nYears later Tennessee Williams saved my life the first time I went to a gay bar I was Seventeen years old it was called the hot and it was in Washington DC some referred to it if the chicken and it was filled with early Nineteen sixties gay men and fluffy sweaters who cruise one another by calling table to table on phones provided by the bar\nI may be clear but I invest I remember thinking still reading everything Tennessee Williams wrote I knew he would understand my dilemma\nTennessee never seem to fit the gay stereotype even then and sexual ambiguity of turmoil were always made appealing and exciting and his work my type doesn't know who I Am he stated according to ... and even if the sex lives of his characters weren't always healthy they certainly seemed hearty\nTennessee Williams wasn't a gay cliche so I had the confidence to try to not be one myself gay was not enough it was a good start however [laughter]\nYou know he gave you confidence to be gay but not set a stereotype of what was going to\nGet young gave me the confidence to be a beatnik revert to beatnik or to not even to be a beat Nicolas Cage that's very different you know you went into a field of all different kinds of rebels\nAnd their sexuality was always still my friends are doesn't matter if they're gay or straight if I'm friendly with somebody that has literally no interest to me whether I like the person or not\nI'm and I'm always amazed by people that say um\nOh you should go this age and he has all gay people were going to have a dream to drive all black people that are being good or bad enough work out\nSo um I I always liked the gay people to have trouble even sitting in the gay stereotype because I don't like rules of any kind and I see people that break them with happiness and I'm not bringing pain to themselves\nSo how have you changed in terms of what you want to do with\nWith your same unless people's interest in your life because in some ways you've turned yourself into your art in it because you've you'd do shows yeah when that shows you've written were personally uh you know all over the years in ... people are dying here that you\nWell I don't know I'm I use my own personality to find out about others my personality is why probably I mean not for something in the house or why the outside a pornographer if I left in the house let me in a trusted me\nAnd I think I've only written about people that that I look up to about ... even if they've had terrible things happen in my life because they've had a more extreme life than I've ever had an and I respect people I I as a writer every day I think\nWhat would you like to be that person and if you're a journalist or a writer you get to be that person wouldn't everybody like the barge and people's house and they have some personal questions I don't get why everybody doesn't want to do that but when you're running a book you're allowed to do that that's acceptable\nAnd that's why people tell me everything on airplanes strangers confided to me the most deepest darkest secrets\nAnd I think because they think oh understand and I generally do understand I've taught in prison I've counseled people I I I actually would be a good defense lawyer I Would be a good count for I Would be a good shrink actually and I believe in all those things I've been arrested I've been to a psychiatrist\nSo I think you have to participate in whatever business didn't you were you were trying to be involved in\nSo getting back to a Tennessee Williams you've read all of his books and you've read the love lots of people [laughter] you collect books you have over a thousand four hundred bucks a catalog\nI'd like to read books I don't collect books sometimes struggles service for like looked familiar I read them yeah I like to read um people always say to me how can you read so much and it's easy you don't have a boyfriend or girlfriend and you don't watch television it's simply read all the time\nAnd I'm On airplanes all the time so um it it's I Love to read is how I relax I don't find that a compulsion cataloguing them as being\nJust being nice to my airs [laughter] do you have ... of course as much of a control freak 'cause I Am you don't think I have my death plotted I even know where I'm going to be buried we ... a lot of my friends for like people's temple graveyard\nWell I Know and you said at a ... ... is it the same salmon herring that divides in um so why why do you if you don't my asking why do you want to be buried\nBecause I Love the idea of graveyards I like people visiting I used to going great graveyards when I was young and I would still flowers for parties we'd have a couple of beers I like the atmosphere I liked the worms go in the worms go out I'm ... maybe I Believe in the resurrection the only thing I've ever talked to ... sounds like a good idea\nBut then I panic about real estate prices and what we're supposed to wear on our renewed so I go into that in the ... my paranoia about the recession\nYou're the only person I've ever assets you who wants to be very 'cause like you really like graveyards [laughter]\nOh yeah I Do like a lot of people like grave as a peaceful they're quiet and then we're all going to be birds all her friends kind of one stop shopping\nYou know if you want to come you can say Hi may tied to everybody around and um I I liked the idea of it it's um and my mother at first I thought it would be strange to tell my own family because my mother said I think it's a great idea because your sister's going to be buried were husband that you know so\nSo um I I liked the idea that you're not getting married next no and I was afraid\nTo come and they thought it was a fine idea they're totally understood I went to the graveyard where he is buried\n... my father we find it and they voted me\nPrices up I didn't know I never bought a great but it sounds like a rip off to me and they showed me like tunes like they thought Rudolph Valentino is coming out there they were going to say [laughter] and um and I thought wait a minute so I went and asked the woman were divided up because I like the graveyard shift\nTold me a press that's what I'll take a double\n[laughter] I got like a lot of room around me trigger the prices quite fair bathrooms [laughter] not too bad [laughter] to have you thought it through like what kind of like Tim soon you\nKnow if I kind of want it to be modeled after ... and I want to just say my father is is the same and I didn't realize it until I saw recently his grave or because he only died a few years ago just say John Waters junior today was one of the debt restart who wants to risk a joke that have to laugh your attorney humor changes\n[laughter] talk about an old joke on your I think it's the only time it should be quite simple on your grave stone what's on divine stone I'm\nPraying has but his parents put his real name and divine on rising and loving and\nPeople oh my God they read stuff all over it and they leave stuff it's um leave doughnuts and dresses and it's
