unlikely union\nAnd um two grown in popularity so much at the end of his life and for to get back to your question for me to have\nSat on the side of the stage you know watching my old man at five years old and all the way up to in my forties um the whole canon of his work is is living inside of me is playing in my head is triggered by conversation\nYeah so for hallelujah that you say there's there were there were eighty four ... versus I don't think he ever recorded all eighty four\nBut did it take twelve years and eighty four versus before he considered it completed because of dissatisfaction with the versus that he'd previously written or because there's still so much you wanted to say in the format of that song\nIs the popular a poem states of poem is never finished but rather abandoned\n[laughter]\nDo you think he was frustrated working on it for so long or that it was satisfying\nI think I'm frustration\nWas expected um ... the success of being able to let it go was was the unexpected you know I think as I said he was very vocational from the early stage she would wake up earlier than anybody you knew to black and pages\nAnd uh and gave up an enormous amount or what he would for referred to as compromised enormous amount\nOf go back to that song came so far for beauty left so much behind my patience and my family my master piece on signed\n[noise] you know you quote that you know some people subscribe to the to the philosophy first thought death thought and that's often attributed to a one of the beat writers but that your father believed last thought best thought [laughter]\nYeah he he edited I take it he edited his songs a lot he went through a lot of drafts it was a constant process of filtration and refined for certain\nSo why why don't we hear hallelujah your father's version short\n[laughter] this is Leonard coming to you know going to have more ... there was a moratorium on that song you know in my family so how is that right is that ... should be a refrain please refrain from playing ... because\nI think he felt like a you know who's going to cause Leonard Cohen fatigue or something or you know where you're give give some other songs a chance to get played um it was it was partly joke and partly zone exhaustion I think with with the song\n[noise] so in spite of the moratorium your family has on hallelujah I think I think we'll play in any way are you okay with that\nOh God you know I'm going to report due to the bully police [laughter] okay I hear it\n\n\nReally\nDo\n[noise]\n\nThat's Leonard Cohen singing hallelujah and my guess is Leonard Cohen son Adam cone and there's an he wrote the introduction to a new collection of passion mislead published Leonard cone um lyrics\nPoems notebook injuries and drawings and it's called\nThe flame um so you know at hallelujah I think like two hundred people have recorded hallelujah and um it but it didn't become well known until Jack Buckley recorded at like maybe ten years or more after your father recorded it\nAnd which is just so strange but um it's a sign of\nHow I think there's a period of years when your father's genius west and fully knowledge when you\nKnow he had the initial period of hits and then I think people are just a lot of people just kind of drifted away and then rediscovered him and um what was it like for you and for him during that period one when I think he'd been a little bit forgotten\nYeah [laughter]\nI feel like my father probably felt like his whole life um was characterized by that by that description that he did have been forgotten forgotten by the angels forgotten by the or the you know cupid a forgotten by um [noise]\nI I Know that he was not satisfied\nUh it was a seeker I wasn't satisfied with either the position that he had for the most part I'm In society he wasn't happy with society itself that would that ... deep in the conflict\nHe wasn't he wasn't satisfied with the people that you've chosen to be around him he wasn't satisfied with his role as a father he wasn't satisfied with his role as a lover I'm\nAnd through all this layer upon layer of dissatisfaction he somehow mustard I'm an incredible buoyancy and ability to be a\nUm more than most delightful people anyone ever came across and um it wasn't with any sense of bitterness or judgment I think he just felt like a you have this\nShabby little life and his only solve this was ... was the work itself\nAnd that's what made the end of his life that more astonishing and surprising and delicious you know this is a unexpected

question that comes out because of the division between dog people in cat people is\nWhat's the comparative intelligence do we have good research on that professor\nWe don't have great for research on it we have some um [noise] if you're on a nearly as many studies of cat called mission as there are ...\nAre better at any age very few cats and dogs are being tested on to truly comparable conditions but what I can tell you is that I don't know of any\nCoakley to toss the cat can solve all the cats regularly solve the dogs don't also sells whereas there are a number of toss that dogs are being shown to solve\nUm for example that the ... Scott is talking about earlier that nobody's ever going to cats to part of the trouble is as close as we do research we never know about the experiments that people tried that didn't work out very well\nUm and so I suspect there's a number of studies of a\nCat called mission where the cats didn't do very much a that we never hear about in the scientific literature part of this of course is down to motivation dogs all\nA strongly motivated to do things that people want them to do and this probably descend from their origins as cooperative hunters says ...\nOr ... cats and I'm a cat lover myself kind of see my experience a note strongly motivated to do what you want them to in fact to benefit in love with her this\nTo end the so how do you even study given the fact that cats typically are not going to be as cooperative they're not as the please how would you even design some sort of a a research project where you could get it that comparative issue\nWell and they're all ... ... ... too\nMany different species easy adapted to different things in common one is the strain pulling toss where you don't have a treat for an animal that's a inside an enclosed area on the animal could pull you out by putting on a string and most\nAnimals is is being tried on\nCan sort of do it if there's only one string or and they do it spontaneously bought the moment you have more than one string maybe two streams that have crossed with only one I mean one of them having a truce on there and then things go past shaped\nDogs can do that one and cats are kind of thing even was a but they will try it and you can do the experiment on both species can do a lot of species I had a student to try it only has a a black as if I remember I\nWas working in Alaska or to a a ban refuge\nAnd um it went very well for the first few trials and then the dead destroyed the outbreak is\n[laughter] that bears will do [laughter] a protest\nOr a ... you you if we think of you know the highest level of cognition among non human primates a dog um wet some sort of fear there at that level where would you put dogs compared to those highest level\nA non human mammals\nHa tricky one because there are some ... that actually dogs to solve that for example chimpanzees done and\nI'm a ... a particularly things involving cooperation a dog ... on bass a at a cooperative\nA tasks then you're sort of expect from ball they generally do um uh say your comments I owe on any toss it say a gym carbon oboe will come out best or adults in the apps\nAnd on the other hand there are some ... quite a lot of animals manage reasonably well the dogs don't for example and the team or the use of tools\nDogs are as you perhaps what you'd be surprised to hear a a really not very good at anything involving tools there and really no reports of spontaneous to using dogs\nWhere it's quite a range of all the animals including for example quite often birds are spontaneous to users and easily trains to use tools in ways that they don't do spontaneously\nSo you don't think it's ... it's physiological limitations that would describe that since birds can use tools\nYeah yeah so I mean view but dogs don't have very good news for to use but then in order but\nSomehow they manage um so\nI I have a very comfortable with trying to arrange animals in a single older of intelligence but in terms of the numbers of tasks they can solve\nA probably below apes probably the\nMost money to say no or maybe\nThey do do is probably about a level if you want somebody that does most of the things that dogs can do a pig would be a good choice [laughter]\nAll right so tanks so so picks a aren't dumb that they're they're they're a reasonably trainable animals\nPigs are definitely not dumb and one of the ... the purposes of rice humid or review we did really well to try and encourage people to look at a wider range of animals routes and just looking at dogs and saying wow I'm to look at a intelligence in the range of other animals and actually do that\nYou find quite a lot of uh based some of them quite surprising a like pigs that are um are already quite successful as a range of cognitive toss\nWhy aren't for example crows extremely intelligent\nA good many species of crow for example a red really trained on a variety of tasks and seemed to show 'em you know spontaneous intelligence soul do some of the some of those days are controversial\nBecause a lot of ways kids about the um the exciting cases but not the boring criticisms or the gas prices are a surprise he had parents who I'm probably not tell

Supreme Court is welcoming Brett Kavanaugh for his first day on the bench NPR's Carrie Johnson reports the high court heard arguments in two cases today\nAnd that contributed to the contagion of fear that swept through Mosul and lead to something like thirty thousand defenders\nRetreating and leaving much of their equipment for ISIS the claim which then fueled another propaganda victory as suddenly they could broadcast using all this stuff American equipment\nAnd you had this wonderful double effect where at the local level\nIraqi soldiers are looking down at their smartphones and they're seen of what seems like an ISIS victory plane out on the screens in their hands\nAnd then it becomes one ah causes them to decide to run away this um army that's much larger backed by the most powerful military in the world the U.S military as tanks it as helicopters and the like and yet ah what's playing out on social media\nChanges the dynamics of the battlefield but simultaneously that it changes the way the rest of us look at the world and ...\nYou get this phenomena where more Americans are afraid of terrorism at that point than they were in the weeks after nine eleven\nAnd so it shows the power of social media and how it can sort of rewriting the narrative and then turn that incident as leverage it into a plane out with impact on our own politics as part of the changes in the twenty sixteen election\nYou also cite an example from another part of the world's where a social media can lead to an can affect a events on the ground and this is in Chicago where social media taunts interacts with gang gang violence in ways that can be deadly you want to give us an example of that\nI'm sure we tell the story of a ship on Thomas who had grown up from an early age interested in music\nAnd was a very successful emerging rapper in the south side of Chicago but unfortunately he'd also been drawn into the gang scene he was a gangster disciple and they wanted everyone to know it\nSo he often a crust Instagram YouTube would broadcast his affiliation with the disciples and he was the subject of not one or two but three assassination attempts by rival gang members he survives the first two\nAnd as he survives rather than you know are thinking twice or maybe laying low for bed he posts bold new videos on YouTube\nBasically challenging these folks that come at him again what we've seen in a gang violence across this country is that much of that has migrated to social media\nBecause so much of being in a gang is about face and it's about fronting\nIt matters a great deal if someone say finds your Facebook it to counter trolls you or a leaves a disrespectful Instagram comment\nAnd something else that's happened as this gave violence moves to social media is that it also means that violence is no longer about who's feuding for a particular block but gangs are the same franchise even if there are many miles apart might start fighting each other over something that originated on line\nSo so if someone calls you out on line you're going to respond and it may not it may be on line but it may also be on the street right\nAnd that's the difference between a gang feuds in the past is if two people ... yelled words or the other in the street I'm only the people around them would hear it and the moment would be done if you posted online\nThe whole world is watching at least in their perception and it sticks up there until something is done about it and that's why it's at the origin of so many of these uh fights and not just\nA eighty percent of fights and school sparked from something on line but also of course the spate of gang killings\nAnd what's interesting and a little bit scary is that we see the same phenomena of Internet beeps at the gang level moving up to levels of drug cartels all the way to how it's changed a diplomacy how it's changed politics\nWe have this question of what happens when leaders of nations are interacting in the same way when they're having these beliefs in front of the world\nWill make it harder for them to negotiate if the whole world knows that they've been insulted and they've done nothing about it\nYou have an interesting kind of look at ... at the development of mass communications you say that the Internet is the most consequential communications development since the invention of the written word and that it really got super charged when everything could be\nDone on smartphones and\nThere are many examples where social media has have been used to fuel popular uprisings the most striking example in the Arab Arab Spring and the time a lot of people talking about social media is being this powerful democratizing force I mean now you know expression is in the hands of everyone the trouble is the authoritarian\nRegimes also had access to the tool how did they strike back\nTheir spring was probably the high point of the techno optimism about the Internet and social media you have everything from a national media sources describing it's a liberating power to people in Egypt are literally naming their kids Facebook but then\nAuthoritarians figure it out they figure out how to fight back um we use this idea of like war to express that there's two sides to it and so there's always a back and forth\nAnd so we've seen is that authoritarian to figure it out also how to use social media and a couple of key ways one is that it gives them a new way of monitoring their population and what they're thinking of what they're saying ah for example there's the question on line or does reach we equal endorsement\nWell now we finally have the answer or the example we use is a journalist and turkey who reach wheat something or just for a couple of minutes before he takes it down and yet it lands of Turkish prison so governments can use the power of the law to monitor\nThen you have this new model that China is presenting which um is this almost a perverse incentive system it's called the social credit system where essentially all your different online activities everything from what you say to what you buy\nCan all be monitored and it's brought together and to a single score of your social trustworthiness so for example or if you buy diapers your score goes up because you're a good parent\nIf you play video games too long your score goes down because you're screwing around\nThat score than is used to uh give you rewards and society everything from a\nFree charges of your smartphone at coffee shops to a negative side you can't take planes it's used in job evaluations it's even used in dating profiles so it affects uh how attractive the person you're gonna be able to go on dates or even Mary\nAnd I what's notable about this what goes in a way that or will never could have imagined\nIs the network side of it your score reflects not only what you do but what everyone else in your network does so if for example your brother is not being positive enough about the regime online your score will go down so then you'll go to your brother and say hey you know get it together\nAnd this is this a strange way of using technology in essence to steer us to a behavior that at least in China the government wants\nSo people who who have phones and do a lot of social media will have a social credit score the aim is so that eventually everyone will get one\n\nThe goal of it is to achieve a what's known as mass control to steer an entire population towards a certain direction\nIt's not just the idea that um you will have your online activity but the the government will force you to have this kind of Internet presence of for example there are certain um places in China where there are police checkpoints physical checkpoints where they will check your smartphone to ensure that you have the apps that allows monitoring of you\nWrite and just just to get a sense of the region does I mean do we know how many people now have social credit scores in China is it hundreds of thousands tens of millions\nI Believe it's tens of millions this is a gradually escalating process with a couple of different companies that are doing this piecemeal but it's the stated intent of the Chinese Communist party that this will be a unitary score in place for every Chinese internet user of which there about eight hundred million by the year twenty twenty\nWell the other fascinating story you tell about China is they realize how commentary on social media can affect opinion and so they have ... and a large army of people whose job it is to comment favorably on the government policies right\nThat's right and it is a very large army started out in the tens of thousands moved to the hundreds of thousands and now one estimate has it as high as three million of these are folks who are known as part of the the fifty cent army\nAnd their job uh and it it has its own training programs in a credit station systems their job is to monitor and infiltrate political conversations on we chat another Chinese platforms and basically cede positive things about the Chinese government\nEmerson broken writes about conflict in social media he was recently a research fellow at the council on Foreign Relations VW singer is a strategist at New America at a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\nWill continue our conversation in just a moment this is fresh air\nI make Rome and New York city and state passed\nStrict workplace sexual Harris gun laws all business is apt to comply with the small ones it might not know amount of all things considered weekday afternoon said for an eighty nine point three\nThis is fresh air and Terry Gross let's get back to the interview fresh air is Dave Davies recorded with the W. singer and Emerson bragging about their new book like war the weaponization of social media it's about how social media has been weaponized for political campaigns uprisings and wars\nLet's talk about social media in political campaigns there's been a lot of attention paid to the Russian efforts to interfere with the twenty sixteen elections and you describe the appearance and twenty Seventeen of somebody on social media named Angie Dixon she establishes a Twitter account was her agenda what do we know about\nSo anti Dixon a presents herself to the world as a I'm\nA Christian American uh who's mad about the direction that our country has taken and and she wants her country back make America great again and she's pushing out messaging ah to that effect and particularly I'm Around the period of Charlottesville\nShe is so angry that right wing or or being blamed for this and she says this Internet conspiracy and the like\nAnd of course and she is a fake and how do we know that ... is a fake Angie is presenting herself with imagery that is actually Leonardo DiCaprio Z German girlfriend\nAnd what's interesting is that when reports than circulate online that Angie as a fake\nCheese in attacks the people going after her basically to say that they're part of this a conspiracy theory and you get this strange outcome where her fake messages get greater traction than the messages debunking her Vegas\nSo Andrew Jackson was a fake but she attracted a lot of ... quite a following on social media was that because she was so compelling or was it because there were many many other fake accounts or robotic accounts that were retreating her stuff\nSo and she was a ... she was a machine voice masquerading as a human on line\nAnd each of those is powerful ended up themselves but where they gain their true power is creating what are known as ... nuts so for example ah Angie was only one of at least sixty thousand Russian accounts in a single ... that infects Twitter almost like a cancer and its war being and twists\nIn the American political dialogue but what's\nFascinating is that it's not just about persuading the targets it's about hijacking the network's own algorithms so these botnets Dr viral\nDifferent points of view that didn't push that up into the news feed it makes them trends to people even outside those networks begin to see them\nAnd the impact of this can be seen in examples that range from a brags that\nAbout one third of the online conversation related to brag that were these artificial voices to or even just a couple of months ago the Mexican election same percentage one third were these artificial voices and of course they played a huge impact in the American twenty sixteen election many people think it's going to do the same in the upcoming vote\n... just to be sure we understand us and we all know that you can establish a fake account or make up a name and get on the social media platform like Twitter and there are a lot of those but you're saying this this sixty thousand ... actually robotically generated accounts generating their messages is that right\nYes one of the challenges the space is that\nUh we don't have a good handle on the lingo so you'll hear a lot of discussion of Russian trolls will trolls are basically you know people on line or trying to provoke some kind of emotional response usually to make you angry\nBut when we're talking about the Russian operations they broke into two parts there were sock puppets those are real humans behind the account who are posing as something that they are not so at some a Russian hipster in St Petersburg\nWho's acting like they are an American veteran grandmother from Texas but then you have also bought these are machines these are algorithms that are basically pushing out messages automatically\nThe combination of the two can be incredibly powerful because the sock puppets can say one thing and then the box can drive that message viral by having thousands\nTens of thousands of voices echo at out further\nYou know repeatedly these social media platforms like Twitter get rid of these accounts but they have ways to automatically regenerate\nAnd what's worrying as we look ahead is that these pots don't necessarily need to be active now something that these Russian operatives but anyone who wants to manipulate social media conversation something they're increasingly doing is creating accounts and having them lie dormant\nAnd have a history of messages that seem authentic and benign and not related to hot political event so when they activate them months or years down the road it'll be much harder to detect that as something other than a real person\nYou said an amazing number here you said when Donald Trump announced for president in twenty Fifteen fifty eight percent of his Facebook followers were from outside the United states right how how do we know this\nSo you're able to detect the origin of accounts or one of the new rules of the game when everything is on line is that out in the open\nSo you can follow it you can see the patterns of behavior maybe one of the more notable aspects of a Donald Trump's a follower account is that\nAh at that point in time about four percent supposedly lived in Mexico now of course these were not real Mexican citizens behind these accounts these were in essence fake followers\nCreated to give the semblance of a massive online following that can then be turned into a real online following by driving your messages viral\nRight but the fifty eight percent of the followers from outside the u._s. can we infer that a lot of them are fake\nYes a vast majority of them were they were basically uh bought accounts generated out of what are known as click farms are these are almost think of like a\nSweatshop factory it's the same thing for people that are essentially being paid to click on accounts in places like the Philippines or Bangladesh and then you combine these physical people with pots and you can give you a much greater power in politics\nYou know that's been written about the Russian efforts to interfere in the American twenty sixteen election we've seen indictments give us your sense of the scale and impact of this effort\nThe challenge with this is that the information about it came out and little dribs and drabs and the result is that the scale of it is not appreciated by most people just how big in number but an extent that campaign was so for example if you're looking at Facebook\nI it now ... says you know roughly over a hundred and forty million Americans about half the population solve some aspect of a Russian um information misinformation pushed on line\nTo you move over to other platforms like for example Twitter where it's literally a hundreds of millions of messages being retreated back and forth\nA great illustration of this would be one single account um Tennessee GOP that was a posing as if it was the hub for Tennessee Republicans we now know that it was one of these Russian sitting in St Petersburg\nIt was the seventh most red account on election day not the seventh most read of the thousands of Russian accounts but the seventh most red overall to you solve similar campaigns plane out on Instagram to a there is actually one that was just detected a couple of weeks ago on Reddit\nAnd the impact of this was not just what the Russians were pushing but the echo effect and to the broader population including the media itself one of the uh accounts that was posing as a young American Woman\nShe was actually quoted in everything from a Washington Post to New York times to USA Today and the like\nAs if she was a real young American Woman and actually again it was one of these Russians behind it and so you know it's up for the historians to uh you know argue about whether it's swung the election or not and such a close election what we can say is the scale of it wasn't meant\nAnd that the Russians believe it worked because they're coming back for more they're doing it in the election right now\nEmmerson broken writes about conflict
