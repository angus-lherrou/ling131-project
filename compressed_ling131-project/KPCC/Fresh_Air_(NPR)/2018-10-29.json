{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "And but my understanding was that hill I thought now maybe this\nWas someone else who said it but when Roberts comes out that's usually the make a change so he'll just assumed he was being taken out handed him the ball just to show you know you supportive of his manager not because he felt the need to come back a what was your under\nSo that's how it always works when the manager comes out that's when you know that you're getting the hook the pitching coach comes out to say hey how you feel in a world let's work on the strategy for the next guy but when the manager comes out the hoax come in with them\nYeah I Am and uh you know to be safe for the Dodgers to do now from now on is send out the pitching\n[laughter] yeah absolutely well all Roberts had to do when he was handed the ball say you're you're done you know just confirmed you you're you're not able to continue\nYeah and and so you know if there was some sort of mistaken in uh in communication there that's on both of them they got to fix that kind of thing\nAll right David appreciate it who's ... who are the five members of the starting rotation next year\nA okay I'll I'll and I'll take a shot at this a Walker viewer I think ... under contract so he's there\nThey have to make a decision about engine Rio so I'm not sure 'cause I was ... I Would I Would probably bring it back at you know ah and certainly we will know in about three days what Clinton gr saw decide if he comes back then he's in the rotation\nFor sure but you were saying earlier you thought he was not going to opt out well\nI didn't I don't think he's going to opt out but until he actually says it I mean he's got the option there so I Would assume that he's coming\nBack they're talking about it because you want some kind of extension where it is so he's sixty five million dollars but the next two years if he does nothing but he's hoping to create a deal where he has maybe two more years tacked on so a total of four years I Would not do that you know a million years for a thirty year old thirty one year old with a bad back\nActually I I Would do it um because I think that you have options and my craziest option is well he's a pretty good relief pitcher\nI mean would you have I mean Kennedy Johnson has been awfully shaky I don't know so I needed his back couldn't hold up to six Seventy five six seven innings maybe it can hold up for twelve or flood clean break kind of guy\nThat's you know I I I think that you have to bring back the question is uh then the last question is uh is Ross tripling OK and can he can he returned to being the starting pitcher\nHow close as a kid named Dustin may who is coming up to the minute or two forgot about I Can't ... who is still around 'cause I think the Dodgers are going to really have to look at and you know they like to have ten guys available just for what has happened\nAnd uh you know I'll I'll just sort of do a you know sort of a hashtags look at the angels what happened they thought they had an entire staff that last at all and then the last guy and I really hope that they get this guy is a is a player out of Japan named you say ... ...\nWho was very very good pitcher and he got an okay to come to the U.S\nHe is really good and I think that and they've been scouting him for many years before you know he he started his career in Japan so they know who he is he's not too old no he's not and and I think ah her size there actually was back in Japan and took a look at him so I think they're going to make a run at him as well\nAll right ah in Ferguson do you think he makes the starting rotation\nSure liked him as a relief pitcher certain look good as a relief pitcher and I I you know ... um you sort of wished that he had been on that World Series roster I understand why they didn't put him on I actually don't\nIran's might be in the rotation through he grew out came up early starter\nYeah yeah ... yeah he really I thought it looked he was terrific in the playoffs and I was surprised that they put them on and and he looked pretty good [noise]\nAll right ah do the Dodgers go after big name hitters in free agency\nNow if I hit or they're getting back to last and that's ... that's that's who they are big hydro after our\nWell because the Phillies also are thinking about offering Machado and Harper gigantic ... they have that kind of money to spend this off season and they probably they will handle anybody else are they everyone else's young yeah cost control so they have that money to spend or they're they're like ... sitting on solid gold\nSo you'd you'd resigned review it does is what John what's happened to Alex would use looks like he has no confident he might be better off somewhere else change of scenery and I think the Dodgers probably would wouldn't mind to see him go either\nOr at a break in Pasadena your thoughts on the Dodgers end of the year\nJust a a lot of credit here is that given to Alex Cora Cora managed and amazing team this year a former Dodger I gave him all the respect for in the world for what he did with that Boston Red Sox game\nWhile he was one of the guys when he was with the Dodgers I remember everybody boy ... smart he's such a great pitcher he's smart guy\nThe ... the one thing when he brought in his clothes are correct Kimberlin that Saturday game and it didn't seem like kimbrell had much I thought that's of course first mistake it worked out now that you know when you're making all these decisions that turned out to be gold and nothing you you do is wrong\nBut she was also given a really really good team to work with and and the interesting thing to me is that two teams in particular that the Yankees and the red Sox both went to former ESPN commentators is there a you know is there a manager's although core I did spend a year on the bench with Houston\nYeah Alex scores great guy and he's a really good manager\nA Frank you also want to say something about a breakdown between management and players\nLarry that seemed to be a disconnect about halfway through the air between the front and back office I Know bringing in many Machado was something that every sports commentator want it to say and\nYou know the Dodgers finally pulled the trigger but with Cory secret coming back and\nA ... inch shield rotation it'll be interesting to see what happens with him and quite honestly I really felt as though things weren't clicking all the way through the playoffs with much out of there I Know people want to say that he brought a lot of stability to some of the positions but reality\nHim in the lineup was just so consistent that you couldn't tell which would shadow was going to be playing for us that day\nPrank I appreciate your call don't have to worry about that next year our ... thanks very much in Julie rights on the page can the Dodgers hire mystery of all the ... hat and we had we adamant traded in ... yeah so um and that's that's a satellite because man he look\nHe said to Tommy John surgery at Yale throwing a hundred sad that you have a metal arming Iraq gentlemen thanks very much sure been fund the season will come back and do it in February and then I have a long ride sounds good will reconvene the triple play when pitchers and catchers report will get that springs\nWe're going emerging as Nick Roman ... say June fresh air with Terry Gross coming up next from all of us have a great afternoon [noise]\nFollowing fresh air is BBC News hour with Latin America entering an abrasive new era with Brazil's new authoritarian president plus Germany ponders whether it'll mean one uncle America leaves office at two on the world a conversation with artistic

learned more Pasadena that you do\nFrom WHYY in Philadelphia I'm Terry Gross with fresh air today has statements made by Robert Bowers who shot and killed at least eleven people in Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday echo the views of the white nationalist movement without ... whose book rising out of hatred\nIs about white nationalist leader done black\nAnd his son Derrick who was an Arab parents to the movement Derek with central in creating in popular rising the phrase white genocide and other militant messaging that the shooter picked up on\n... white nationalist views in his twenties but ... says\nI think every time something like this happen she feels small ways off all the wonder how much three messaging that he did in terms of white nationalism pleasing to incidents like that\nAfter we talked ... about the shooting we'll hear my September interview with fast slow and there are black\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Laurie London under extremely tight security Robert Bauer is the man accused in the weekends synagogue massacre has appeared in a federal courthouse in a wheelchair to face charges and the killing of eleven people\nYeah I mean in the horrific sort of hierarchy of white nationalist beliefs and they they really consider\nJews their primary enemy and white nationalist believe although it's ridiculous an awful and scientifically accurate to say is that people of color and immigrants are by and large inferior to whites and left on their own they would not be able to challenge the white race and the white nationalist believe the Jews\nAre while not whites and very smart and sort of scheming and also are trying to propagate a scheme of multiculturalism which will weaken the white race so they believe that Jews have\nUsed immigrants people of color and\nPush for greater immigration pushed for things like now this caravan to change the demographics of America so that ultimately white people will become a minority and then white nationalist believe\nJews will have even more power than they do now in the country and that's that's why they identify Jews as their number one enemy minutes why throughout the history of the white nationalist movement we've seen more attacks\nOn on synagogues more bombing threats on on Jewish schools than we have almost any other demographic group\nSo balanced notion media to talk about how immigrants are going to slaughter white people and President Trump has been tweeting and speaking about the dangers of the migrant caravan that is walking on foot\nFrom Honduras to the U.S Mexico border\nAnd here's an example of something he said the assault on our country at our southern border including the criminal elements in drugs pouring in is far more important to me as president than trade or the U.S MCA that's the replacement for NAFTA that he negotiated\nHopefully Mexico will stop this onslaught at their northern border all Democrats fault for week laws but anyway she called this the U.S saw on our country and it sounds like people are being killed if you use the word assault\nUm how is the president's language his language that's very you know describing and very frightening words this group of migrants walking toward the water how is that language resonating among white nationalist\nLanguages hugely popular among white nationalists and I think also hugely damaging because when you're when you're talking to people as if they are at war which when you use words like onslaught and\nThat's exactly what you're doing then I think it's natural to expect that a few people within this movement are going to begin behaving as if they are at war and they're going to take drastic action and\nSort of fear mongering that happens I think particularly around immigration and the country is\nA huge fuel behind white nationalist ideas and it's it's something that comes from mainstream corners of our of our country and politics and on the Internet and I think one of the scary things about it the the last posted Bowers wrote on gap is if you take out the lessons the I'm going in\nThat reads essentially like many means on Facebook or do every day it reads like hundreds of posts on storm front do every day these are widely held ideas at white nationalist recently have gone from referring to immigrants\nFirst is illegals which is insulting enough then as infiltrators and now as invaders and they speak about this as if they are wartime commanders which begins to justify drastic and violent action\nA President Trump has been calling himself a nationalist and some people are saying that's a really long as we're for white nationalist\nAnd that's ... ... is like one step away from calling yourself a white nationalist and so I'm I'm Wondering how your hearing the president's self description as a nationalist and also how that is being heard in the white nationalist world\nYeah I think that a white nationalist feel like\nDonald Trump in some ways has been sort of winking at them and has been for ... years now and in ways where he can use some of their language but also managed to explain that he was not saying it exactly that way so\nYou know during the presidential campaign that sometimes meant that Donald Trump would retweet a white genocide message from from the white genocide user and that exact phrase white genocide would be spread all Donald Trump followers I think similarly when Donald Trump sort of\nSaid that he was on a nationalist and give it to the fence for nationalism a lot of white nationalist thought hey this is ... ... us that our ideas have real mainstream power and that he identifies with some of what we're doing even\nThough of course he can't fully say that he's a white nationalist\nSo the synagogue shooter rubber ... criticized Trump for calling himself a nationalist now are saying he's not a nationalist\nGlobal is is global as the buzz word for Jewish\nYes the globe with is a is definitely a buzz word for Jewish um and I was worried that the president himself and and many people close to him have used often the final campaign ad\nOf of Donald Trump's presidential campaign was it was a criticism against global west with a picture of George Soros and five others all Jewish um you know with the with the the star of David also on this campaign ad and global is is is absolutely a code word for talking about about Jews particularly in the white nationalist world\nWhy because they believe the Jews have worked their way into huge global power and\nYou know and and it's interesting to read these white nationalist sites because they they speak of Jews almost as if I'm Jews either this sort of evil superhero with huge amounts of power they say that Jews have worm to their way\nIn their words into control over the u._s. government over Hollywood over over huge international banks and and they believe that it's through this globalism the Jews are required enough power to begin to weaken the white race\n[noise] getting back to ... hours in the shooting he criticized President Trump or being too accommodating of Jewish influence and\nI'm Wondering here if it's confusing to white nationalists to feeling the one hand that as you put it\nTrump is kind of winking at them with language like calling himself a national has been on the other hand his son in law Jared is Jewish uh ... daughter of bunker converted to Judaism Trump now has two Jewish grandchildren so you know you get a sense of white nationalist or a little confused\nAbout how to read the president\nI think that they are a little bit confused but if the confusion that they're happy to live with because until this recent administration am white nationalist were widely condemned over the last fifty years by every politician or with any power in the country and and and now they feel like they have a politician who sort of is doing this dance of\nEmpowering some of their ideas speaking about some of their ideas but doing it with with enough room to provide himself distance from the real racism and history of bloodshed that's at the heart of the movement and\nSo I think white nationalist they do not believe that Donald Trump is a white nationalist at they don't think that he exactly identifies with their ideology but they think that he agrees with a lot of their ideas and that he's breathing real power into a lot of his ideas in a mainstream political space\nAnd in that context they're happy to be confused\nThe social media platform that Bowers used is called gab and it sounds like it's the alternative social media platform for people who are basically thrown off of Twitter or Facebook because of their racist anti Semitic\nStatements so what can you tell us about gap\nThat gap is pretty fall and and the social media space in it I think it's about a half million users um but uh it really embraces this sort of radical idea of free speech above all else I'm so somebody like Alex Jones that conspiracy theorists who does not have a platform on Twitter and because Twitter doesn't\nDoesn't allow for it uh he's he's one of the most popular people on gap Richard Spencer the white nationalist spends a lot of time there and\nThere's a very high representation of white nationalist racist ideas on gab\nYou know and I think the danger of a place like gab and and also the danger of of other social media network is that\nIt allows for people who already have these ideas to sort of cultivate their own reality and that was when he went on gab he saw the message is only the people that he followed which is essentially one long news feed of confirmation bias and\nThat those are the messages that he was getting he was reading again and again about the care caravan about the invaders about the threat to America and so then suddenly saying something like I Can't sit by anymore and watch my people get slaughtered and that's because that's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front to the shooting at the synagogue I'm In storefront is\nThe site that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the founders son\nSo so what are you reading on storm front now there\nAre some really vile I'm sort of celebration of what happened uh there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero and racial warrior uh and and hold him up in those ways I Would say that the largest reaction on storm France and\nIs is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh you know several mass shootings connected back to people who have spent time on storefronts over over the last decade and and the reaction is mostly that\nThe interviewer listening to you is with Derrick black who was a young leader of the movement before we now seeing his views when he was twenty to his father Don black is a former KKK grand wizard and founded the largest white supremacist website storm front\nAlso featured in this interview as Washington Post reporter ... the author of a book about Derek Black and white nationalism called rising out of hatred\nThis next question was directed to Derrick\nSo the white nationalist movement has an end goal which is to separate the races for the good of everybody\nAnd your father actually try to enact that goal by trying to plan an overthrow of the government and of the people of a small Caribbean island Dominican to\nUm to create like a white utopia there he and some of you know white nationalism buddies were armed there were ... they were in their car like with ammunition driving to the ship when they were stopped by\nLaw enforcement agents and your father spent three years in prison so he I mean he really deeply bought the idea that you could create that's like white nationalist utopia\nYeah yeah he from the time he was a teenager um he was raised in ... Alabama and everybody around him that sort of\nNormal casual southern racist ideas about segregation and what distinguished him was a feeling that it was not just an unfortunate thing that the schools are being integrated but that it was a cataclysmic moment that that was going to lead to a minority white America and it was going to\nIn western civilization and that he had to do something it dedicated his life to making people aware of that and the distinguishing factor for him was how extreme heat solve the problem was and how far forward he was thinking about it\nWhat was your vision for white nationalism what what did you foresee you weren't going to try to overthrow a Caribbean island a great white utopia there that failed for your father\nDid you have an alternate plan for like a white space for white people to be in the independent of anybody of any race and not have to suffer interactions with them\nYeah\nI was convinced um that there was a lot of late and support for the tenants of white nationalism\nRace was super important than the immigration from non European countries was making things worse than that people believe that in large numbers and wouldn't vote for that and I I was born\nJust as a David Duke was winning his first campaign in Louisiana in Nineteen eighty nine and my dad was on the road are coming back because my mother was in labor and so I with you knew I had yeah for a labor with me and so I knew from the time as a child that\nWhite nationalism as long as it was not necessarily calling itself white nationalism could win campaigns so I did things like\nRun little Republican county elections or demonstrate that I could win with the majority of the vote for white nationalist talking points that are very normal\nUh South Florida neighborhood and I ran a training sessions on how people could holding their message to try to get that audience not freak people out and just tap into things like don't you think all these Spanish signs on the highway or making everything worse than don't you think political correctness is just\nNot letting you talk about things that are real and getting people to agree on that would be the way forward\nAnd you won a local election as a member of the west Palm Beach county Republican committee but they wouldn't let you take your seat because of your views so I did not do you feel like that for ... your plans for like I take over the Republican Party\nIt for my plans for um being on the administration of the Republican Party and its decision making in Palm Beach county but\nWinning the election was always the real goal it was just trying to prove that I could walk around and organize a campaign and go door to door\nAnd say everything that white nationalist bullied or at least Ninety percent of it without saying what the organization my dad ran was and that I could win on that the point was always the show that that could still work in the in the same year the ... was running his campaign\nWas going to win the presidency that that was a good time to start advocating white nationalist talking points that broke Obama winning was a sign that why people would start voting more strongly on a racist idea is not less\nYou know I put that into context for us whether there's Derek like the only person then who ... who is thinking that thought that with Obama running for president and then becoming a president this was like an opportunity for white nationalist\nI think a lot of white nationalist sub President Obama's election is a huge opportunity for their movements and because what white nationalist have done a with with dangerous effect is\nPlayed to this ah factually incorrect sense of grievance that exists unfortunately in large parts of white America polls consistently show that thirty to forty percent of white Americans believe that they experience more discrimination and more prejudice than people of color or than juice which is factually incorrect by every measure that we have\nBut by feeding that sense of grievance and by plane to these ideas of your country is being taken away or\nThings are changing this is turning into a place that you don't recognize we don't need this kind of immigration we don't want these signs in Spanish that has a huge effect ah with with a lot of voters and and it's got Derek elected and it is it's what has gotten other politicians elected in our country as well\nWithout identifying as white nationalist without outright saying hey I'm a white nationalist the race issue collaborated uh-huh\nRight I think I think most most white people do not want to be called racist and but many white people do have racist views and by\nHaving these conversations when they're not explicitly about race and and they don't involve slurs white nationalist can connect with a certain number of voters Derek and his father did some things to the fact that I I thought were really interesting and reporting the book\nOne of which is they storm front invested a lot of money into recording some country CDs there were slightly more explicitly white pride then or\nWhat you'd see in mainstream country music and they would go to a big country concerts that were attended by majority white crowds in the south or in Allen Jackson concert somewhere in the deep south and they were going to the parking lot and they would hand out the CDs sort of suddenly spreading these messages a more white pride songs to an audience that they thought it was going to be more receptive to that message\nSo we were talking about how white supremacy kind of a ... was re branded into white nationalism and the goal of white nationalism is to separate the races there are other ways that white\nWhite nationalist racism has been re branded and Derek I mean among the things that I think you try to do was take some of the violence out of the rhetoric so can you talk about that a little that\nI think one of the most effective things that I and some people I was working with a pretty small little group of people who I met while doing Internet radio we would organize little teams that are apparently on line it's wads\nThat would go to any article that anything to do with race and posts them carefully done talking points are we developed things like the phrase white white genocide\nSaying that all all non white immigration into white countries as white genocide and\nWould talk about white pride talk as things like saying anti racism is a code word for anti white and try to keep people on pretty tight talking points\nAnd send them out to try to change the conversation anywhere on the Internet where it was happening because we were focused really intently on changing the language and I'm trying to make it comfortable for people who did not want to be called racist to say everything else that white nationalist said\nI find really interesting that you and your father tries to cleanse the violence and violent language in rhetoric out of a white nationalism or white supremacy\nAnd yet there you are describing that you were trying to emphasize that immigration would lead to white genocide\nThat white people like these other guys coming and they're going to kill all of us that's really violent language it's not about you committing violence but it's about all the other people who aren't white committing violence committing murder committing genocide against you\nSo it's still the language of vines you just change to the actors\nAre and who the victims and ... and the and this was a long\nProcess but um immigration was just going to out number white people in all their countries and that that was a threat to all the normal white people who are listening to the radio show or posting in the comments section and that quite unlike what they were being told they were the aggressors that they were the people were making society worse\nGetting back to being attacked it it's not like all the immigrants who are going to take our jobs are they going to speak a foreign language we're not going to understand at an American culture you know when the quote unquote cure you're talking about like genocide like they are going to kill all of us we will no longer exists\nI'm Talking point about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme let it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kids in the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had\nBecause society was trying to undermine their opportunities and to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against that every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "29"}
