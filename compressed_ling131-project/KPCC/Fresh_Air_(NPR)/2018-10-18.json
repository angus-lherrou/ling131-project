Blacksburg\nIt's an adult animated series satirizing Hollywood with a cast of characters that includes people and talking animals bow jak as a horse who starred in the nineties sitcom person around by Blacksburg says when he created the theories he's out of the sixties sitcom about a talking horse named Mr Ed\nParty original pitch was what Mr Ed my behind the scenes right when [laughter] when Mr Ed goes home after ...\nSeasons five of Bo Jack is on Netflix Comedy Central is rerunning season one and marine card and reviews the new book of Eleanor Roosevelt advice column that's on fresh air [noise]\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Jim hog the Washington Post has published a final Columbine Jamal ... the prominent Saudi journalist who disappeared and turkey Saudi consulate earlier this month NPR's Emily Sullivan has more\nAnd I felt so disconnected from everything and that idea feeling simultaneously on top of the world and also never more alone and isolated was the beginning of of of this character for me and I wanted to make a show about a character who had\nEvery opportunity for success and still couldn't find a way to be happy and then mixing that with leases animal drawings was the patch\nSo low jak as a horse who is raising three human children in the sitcom horsing around\nIs that inspired by like different strokes about white wealthy businessmen his wife is deceased he's living on Park Avenue and he ... his late housekeepers to children who are African American ... and so it's just like unusual blended family that all the comedy is built around\nIt's actually based on a lot of things in different strokes are certainly an inspiration full house the Brady Bunch step by step I mean I think in the seventies and eighties and nineties there are a lot of sitcoms about\nDifferent family units blended family is an odd configurations of families and different ideas of\nOf what makes the family so it felt very appropriate that in our world we have animals and people coexist thing that there would be a show about a horse bachelor raising three human kids and and learning how to make a family together\nSo did you grow up on the TV shows\nI did yeah I'm a big fan of those shows the TGIF ABC wind up was a big part of my childhood I grew up Jewish and you know we we can never go out on Friday nights so we would stay in and watch family television together\nAnd those shows I mean a lot to me and you know one thing that I really enjoy exploring on Bo jak horsemen is\nOur culture is relationship with these you know some might say cheesy sitcoms of the eighties and nineties um and also bow jak known relationship with being a part of it that even in ... ambivalence about being on this show that he knows it's not the height of art and sophistication but there are real people who come to him and say this show meant a lot to me\nAnd it means something and I like that\nWhile we're on the subject of cheesy horsing around the show that ... start in\nHad a theme song and not many TV shows have theme songs anymore that explained the premise of the show yeah and so I Love that that horse in Iran actually has a theme song explaining what the shows about so I thought we could listen to the theme song\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[laughter]\nSo that's the theme song for the show within a show on Bo jak horsemen I'm so why did you want a theme song for horsing around\nWell you know like you said you don't hear theme songs are certainly not ... theme song so much in this day and age but it does feel like a staple of those shows like the Brady Bunch of the perfect example of oh you're just joining and here's the premise of the show business through these characters are\nThis is how it works um\nAnd it felt like a really fun way in like I I thought if you heard the song you would immediately know what kind of show this is\nScience bow jak as a horse did you ever watch Mr Ed\nYou're too young to have grown up with it but I'm was that an influence at all and he too like the bow jak horsemen series within a serious horsing around he too had a theme song that kind of explained the premise of the show that he was talking horse\nI you know I have seen a little Mr Ed it as a slightly before my time but I think the the nature of being my age is that when I stayed home sick from school\nI didn't have cable so I Would just watch whatever was on TV which was often older rerun so I Do have a bit of pop culture knowledge outside of my own experience\nUm and certainly part of the original pitch was what's Mr Ed like behind the scenes right when [laughter] when Mr Ed goes home after\nA few in my early and that was a helpful way to figure out that there is\nThat's really funny if you're just joining us my guess is Rafi ... Blacksburg and he's the creator and show runner of Bo jak horsemen an animated comedy tragedy [laughter] that's both really funny and sometimes really really sad so we're going to take a short break and we'll be right back this fresh air\nEvery Monday through Thursday night at seven Iran eighty nine point three K PCC checkout America on the line it's a call in show about politics that engages listeners from across America and it's part of the Cape BCC voter game plan\nWhat is news or any way something important just happened maybe nearby [noise] something that affects your life every weekday morning nine you bring your news that helps you keep a handle on what it means to live in LA that's to tonight I Am on a nine point three key PCC\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is ... Blacksburg he's the creator and show runner of the Netflix animated comedy drama series bow jak horsemen and um it's now in season five all a season five was recently released on Netflix\nWhen I first started watching bow jak I thought oh this is such a funny show about the tropes of popular culture and then like the deeper I got into it I thought like wow there's some really lay emotionally upsetting things that happen in this\nYou know ... is an alcoholic he's mean he ... he has this ongoing monologue self destructive monologue in his head about how much she hates himself and how ... how much he knows he's always doing the wrong thing and so what he does is is drink more\nUm and then things sometimes get like really dark and at the risk of I'm giving something away from an earlier season I'll say that Sarah Palin who\nIs the actress who plays ... daughter adopted daughter on Bo jak sitcom horsing around um after she gets out of rehab years later and he invited her\nTo get high which he should never have done she just got out of rehab she ended up oh dean at you know toward the end of the episode and it's it's kind of shocking I mean you know it's a comedy it's animated but you really emotionally unprepared for that\nYeah I think the the the pitch for the show you know what I went into Netflix was always that's going to start like your typical animated comedy and it's going to feel like as you're watching it like oh I get this I get what it is and over the course of the first season it was going to reveal itself to the audience as being something more\nAnd and darker and more interesting and kind of a goal was by the time you get to the end of the first season you're thinking oh my God I care about these characters went went\nUp and they they tricked me um and so that\nTransition was really exciting to me and the idea that people aren't necessarily going to know what this is going in\nAnd one thing we really found is that\nIt is a very silly cartoon universe but it can also I think maybe because of that go to some very sincere dark a melancholy and even tragic places and that may be in a live action show some of these story beats would feel modeling or saccharin or you know a misery corny\nBut because it's animated and it's like a horse and bright and colorful it just takes on a different feel and you can kind of sneak attack in the sadness and some fun surprising ways\nI liked it sneak attack into sadness instead and some fun ways [laughter] if I was like as a kind of fat in it I like the final version [laughter] and and oh jak\nIsn't such despair afterwards and feel responsible he's driving\nAny closes his eyes and nearly drives off the road but then opens his eyes just in time to save himself and I think that's a suicide attempt as opposed to him falling asleep at the wheel\nWhere I Would say it's a little lazy suicide attempt right it's a suicide attempt to possible deniability like he's not\nKilling himself but he's\nAllowing the universe to take its course you know what I mean I always felt like in a port ... maybe minor distinction to us that he was so disappointed in despairing but he was willing to do this but not so much that he was going to actively do it himself\nOne of the episodes that you have in the current season season five which you wrote is um an unusual episode because it's one lung monologue bow jacks mother has died she was never a nice mother she was always mean to him\nAnd during the last period of her life she had really bad dementia and low jak does not feel warmly toward her so this episode is all his eulogy for her so he's at a podium at a Mike her coffins at the side\nAnd he's not trying to paper over what their relationship with like he's talking about all these horrible things that happened in his family and how he was mistreated by his parents and how his father was mean to his mother and they were both mean to bow jak [noise]\nI think in the in the context of the show we were making in the context of\nAnimated shows in general are at the time when the show came out\nAnd also just TV shows about let's say bad dudes or you know dirt bags I think there is a a kind of joke where it feels like you're like holding someone to task but really you're playing it is like kind of cute are funny\nAnd I don't know if we always landed on the right line of that but I think there are moments in season one where maybe it feels like we're not just letting them off the hook but kind of taking his perspective on things right so if he says a sexist thing or if he dismisses somebody\nThe obvious joke is not oh he's a bore and he shouldn't be saying that it almost feels like we're saying oh isn't it it's kind of cool and funny that he's saying this even though we know we shouldn't be saying it like don't you kind of wish that you could say these things to you know what I mean and and that wasn't that wasn't intentional\nBut I think it's slippery and I think that happens sometimes without us meaning to and I think there are a lot of comedy writers and I I Would include myself on those who sometimes think we have a better handle on what we're saying then we actually do\nAnd there's a kind of comedy that I think you could call ironic sexism or post racism\nOr yes our character is saying this thing but we you know the voice of the show don't agree with that\nAnd I think that distinction as maybe more slippery then people will allow themselves to believe I don't know if you have the control over that that you think you do about how that goes out into the world and how people internalize that humor um you know I I grew up uh in the era of South Park\nAnd I think South Park is a brilliant show and I think there's so much that they do well and I there they've made me think about a lot of things in New ways\nUm but I they also have a lot of jokes about Jews and I remember being in middle school and high school and people like making jokes about me that they got from South park\nAnd obviously if you ask Matt and try it they would say well Carmen is not a role model you're not supposed to think he's like cool or funny or charming but I think middle school or high school me who is the one of those jokes would say well what's the difference you know what what does that\nMean to me and I think I Am also guilty of of of making jokes like that in the mouth of Bo jak or some of our other characters and not always thinking about what are the longer ramifications of this on our culture\nIs there an example you can give of that of a joke that you may be regret or wish you had placed differently in it can actually\nSure I can give a couple of examples you know I think a big one which I feel very comfortable talking about is a lot of the Jewish jokes we have had throughout the show and it's something that I myself as a Jew feel some ownership of and feel comfortable with and there's a lot of Holocaust jokes\nAnd I think maybe I believed in season one and two that we were passed anti Semitism and I think now I look around the world and I think that was naive on my part and I think we are not\nAs past that as I convinced myself that we were and thought that we were and now some of those jokes in the early seasons hit me a little differently um another joke about somebody that I'm not as we have a joke in season to 'em and bow jak is a very Boris character and we had a a gag\nWhere he's going on this press tour and everyone's worried that he's going to say something offensive\nAnd uh they're going to Alaska and he has a line or about what we're going to Alaska what am I going to say that it's going to send a bunch of inbred Eskimo barber marchers is the line\nAnd you know on paper I can defend that joke and I can say no the joke of that is not on the Alaskans it's about how stupid bow jak as and now he doesn't realize including the way it's set up is oh he is saying this offensive thing\nAnd not even knowing that it's offensive so I feel like technically we are in the right on this joke\nUm but someone tweeted at me a couple of years ago and said you know I Am a native Alaskan myself\nAnd I was watching your show and there is not a lot of representation for my people on television and to watch this show make this joke about my people and knowing that this was the only reference in the show of my people and knowing that nobody who works on the show is of my people it it hurts\nAnd I cannot then say no but you are wrong because I did it correctly I you you misinterpreted it so you are wrong to be offended I have to hear that note and go oh you're right maybe weren't as careful about that as we should have been\n[noise] I Know I Know some kind of ... become actually very difficult to do comedy because there's always somebody calling you out for saying something politically incorrect so I'm Wondering how you've changed the writing on the show with this kind of sensitivity\nThat you feel you didn't have enough for a season and that you're trying to have no\nWell I mean first of all who says comedy should be easy like why why do you get free like oh this is my make is making my job harder yeah boo hoo that's what happens in life\nSometimes there are challenges in your job or your career and you have to learn how to take them and I think it's a good thing and I think this means that more people are being hurt because I don't think\nAll of a sudden just because I saw that tweet\nI I don't think that means that people were not offended or hurt by my humor before it just means now I can see it and now I Am aware of it and I think that is a good thing and I think it is a challenge to to to challenge your own preconceived notions of what is okay or what is funny or who are you making your comedy for\nAnd I think if you're a comedian who doesn't care about that\nThen fine and make the comedy for the people that will not be offended and that will be your audience you know I Want to make comedy that that people who are perhaps disenfranchise or marginalized can't enjoy I don't want my comedy to exclude them so it's a challenge but I take on\nAnd it's sometimes hard to get that feedback and people say hey this really hurt me because my ego\nWants to say no it didn't you know because I Want\nTo say like no I I Am I Am smart I Am good I'm a good guy you don't understand I have good intentions but I I think hearing that really helps me and I I don't want to get to a place where I'm not hearing those notes or I feel like I don't have to hear those notes because I think it makes me a better more sensitive and more interesting writer\nIf you're just joining us my guess is ...

EMTs an ambulance drivers are not considered public safety even though they're doing exactly the same job if because they're from the private sector that creates a challenge\nWell in it and I'm curious why the legislature there there wouldn't be sympathetic members of the legislature who would carry it on behalf of the private ambulances industry it's interesting that that didn't go anywhere\nWell you might have I mean labor groups might be opposed to that you know if they're carving out a way for re slow right and they are hardening out a part of the labor law at you know it might not get fired that\nThat's a ... yeah it's a logical argument that they'd be concerned well if they do with the ambulance drivers than than who might be next that proposition eleven and is there are labor unions do you do you know melody if they come out against this or not I I don't think I've seen ah\nFor some odd reason I Know that the California Teachers Association is against us ... I don't know I just read that somewhere [laughter]\nTeachers are always on call [laughter] so\nUh that's proposition eleven the final measure on your California ballot proposition twelve\nSupporters of twelve say it is a natural extension of proposition to which was passed a decade ago and put new space requirements on egg laying hens on a pork as well as on cabs\nThat are being raised revealed and they say the proponents of it that this uh guarantees even more space\nFor those animals than I was in proposition to the opponents of proposition to say this is largely the work of a major um egg a supplier in California's Central valley and that they actually want to have smaller uh cages in which to ah to have a the\nThe egg laying hens a melted you want to start us on prop twelve\nYeah absolutely I this is a ballot measure that you would normally think that animal welfare groups would all jump on board and they're not um and the argument is that I\nThe amount of space currently under law for um says that a chicken or a a hen an egg laying hens has to be able to stand up turn around and lay down now what does that constitute like what is the exact spat stacks of that\nA Cajun which and it hadn't can do that um or a a a breeding pig or\nI'm a calf I'm and so this ballot measure essentially is creating those facts but I'll animal welfare groups like peta say well you know we don't agree with that space and that was never the intention of voters to give them that little of space and so\nHumane society says is as good a pita and some other groups also say that are are saying that this is going to get them actually less room and that you'd be doing more for animals by not\nVoting for so in in you have major environmental groups your clubs in favor of this and I believe the natural Resources Defense council but as you say\nAnimal welfare organizations there is a split the humane society to us when big sponsors of this as they were a proposition to which was passed by California voters Katie anything to add on this\nWell I think it is it's one of those examples when it is a tricky measure you know I mean you see this and you think\nWell you know I I feel like animals should have space but then you get into the intricacies and I think\nThat's a lot of times the problem we have with governing by proposition\nRight you don't you don't know all the details that you really need to know\nSell your thoughts on prop twelve yeah so so we're we're in a situation here with prop twelve where the animal welfare groups can't decide\nIf is actually enhance his animal welfare you have some let's say yes you have others if they say you have like Peter to very strongly against it\nUm I Would I Would suggest just humbly recommend that if there there's a measure on the ballot that you can't wrap your head around that even animal welfare groups they can't decide if there's actually an has his animal welfare um ... perhaps uh this can be resolved in another way I'm perhaps we can have a more deliberative process rather than have something as convoluted as a\nWhile and I have to say I'm for all of us on the panel like that you know all of us get asked a lot my friends and family members what about this ballot proposition what about\nThat one and so often I just speaking for myself I don't know about the rest of your essay and read about it I've hosted the base on it I've I've immerse myself on it and I'm Still\nTrying to wrap my head around all the different moving pieces to\nIt ... usually don't either I just tell every other person yes or\nNo balance on sex sex a decade thank you so much for being with us we appreciate all this a state wide broadcast or we appreciate your joining us brought two thousand Eighteen voter cram session our panelists\n\nPolitics with border [noise] Southern California newsgroup Mandarin opinion\nEditor Salvador Rodrigo is San Francisco chronicle political reporter melodies Gutierrez and Cal Tech professor of political science Michael Alvarez the two thousand Eighteen voter Graham session is part of the California Dream project a state wide media collaboration of K PBS\nTake the heat PCC Capital Public radio and the non profit news organization Cal matters the project get support from the corporation for public broadcasting and the James Irvine foundation keep the discussion going on Twitter\nUsing the hash tag ... see a dream for California Dream for the two thousand Eighteen voter cramped session I'm Larry maps over the BCC was Angela [noise] up\nNext fresh air ...

business and political career has been built on his image as a self made man but this month a New York times investigation based on thousands of confidential financial documents revealed had Trump's father Fred\nStarted transferring money to Donald using various schemes to avoid paying taxes starting when Donald was three\nWhen ya it at all or was this incredible stream of money that move though

last piece at a deeper level a difficult shift for colleagues who suspect but I don't know for sure that ... that\nThat's exactly right he felt he was vehemently opposed to the idea that as he has this\nFortune on his family but he should pay\nAnytime attacks whatsoever on the transfer of wealth to his children and he took all kinds of measures that we describe in the story to avoid paying either gift taxes or later on um the state taxes because of this\nBelief that she just felt that what he had maybe she you know the government just didn't have a right to a single penny of it\nYour investigation really like deconstruct the Donald Trump ness of the self made man who got like a one million dollar loan from his father and use that to build this enormous\nFortune and this real estate empire the actual story what you report starts when he was like three years old and starts getting like two hundred thousand dollars a year in today's dollars so what was the process by which by age three he was getting hundreds of thousands of dollars from his father\nThat started in Nineteen forty nine and it was one of the projects that um that had got that from Trump had received government funding\nTo build it was um a complex called beach haven and what Fred Trump that it was quite ingenious as he bought the land underneath speech haven or the complex that he would go on to build and he plays the land in a trust 'em for the benefit of his five children\nAnd then he started paying them round he makes them his landlord and every year they continue to get payments so\nWe kind of a second I don't really understand how three year old Donald Trump can be his father's landlord can you explain that\nSure it was his land to do what he wanted with and he put it in a trust in this instance when they were very young for their benefit and began pain them round it's completely legal\nUm but that's sort of one of the ways in which he early on you know he's in this point it's in the Nineteen forties his children or young and he's looking for ways you would imagine at this point to begin to take care of his children as they get older\nThat they you know when they grow up they've got money and there's a way to transfer what is now he's becoming a very rich man is a one way to begin to transfer of wealth to them this is the first one that happened in Nineteen forty nine so what are some of the\nWays that by the time Donald Trump was a teenager he was already well what are some other ways his father gave him money [noise] he\nBegan doing a number of things so she started buying\nOr building apartment complexes in Brooklyn and queens\nAnd then gradually transferring ownership of those apartment complexes to his children so for example Donald\nWhen he was Seventeen years old became co owner with his family members of a fifty two unit apartment building in Brooklyn that his father had acquired for them and so they would overtime for\nTrump assembled a roughly eight apartment complexes over a thousand units and all that she transferred through a variety of mechanisms to his children and so those\nThousand units start churning out profits that flowed effortlessly into the\nPockets of his children we actually documented in our reporting two hundred and Ninety five different revenue streams that Fred Trump ultimately created for Donald Trump over fifty year period for Trump was so\nIngenious at finding different ways of putting money into the old Trump's pockets or if you didn't just\nPut him on his payroll is a salary employee he also paid him separately to be a consultant to him\nShe paid him separately to be a property manager for him he paid him separately\nTo be a purchasing agent for him on an omelet with God\nHe was getting laundry revenue from from Fred Trump and from the buildings so you know some of these revenue streams were relatively modest some of them were kind of one hit wonders but when you add it all up it was this incredible stream of money that made Donald Trump\nUm he was a millionaire actually by the time he was eight or nine years old before you ever entered set foot into ...\nAnd where he would make his name uh for Trump had already transferred to him over nine million dollars in wealth\nYou say by the time he was twenty nine in Nineteen Seventy five Donald Trump had collected nearly nine million\nYou probably have nine million dollars in today's dollars\nFrom his father when he was thirty and I tend to have any sex ... really starts to expand their Nineteen Seventy six article in your newspaper the New York times and you describe it as one of the first major Donald Trump profiles and a cornerstone of decades of myth making about his wealth\nWhat are the article saying what were you when the main points of this Nineteen Seventy six article about Donald Trump\n[noise] it was really one of the first big big profiles that ran a Donald Trump and Donald Trump did something in this particular profile but if you would actually read the news to great effect in subsequent profiles which was [noise]\nShe took the New York times reporter on a tour of what he called his job is empire and he starts driving around New York pointing out\nThis building in that building in talking about how wonderful they were doing and and effectively what he was doing was\nHe was appropriating\nHis father's empire as if it were his own empire so these buildings that he's pointing out as his jobs as part of his empire there were in fact completely owned by his father\nHad known ships taken in any of those buildings and so what he what he did especially when it was critical to kind of early mismanaging of Donald Trump was\nShe simply asserted that his father's empire\nWas his empire and those claims unfortunately largely went unchallenged for for many years by the reporters who were kind of swept up in the glamour of this\nYoung swagger wearing handsome guy who was so full of confidence in so full of big plans for the city of New York and so that story was the thing that I think helped give birth to the myth of Donald Trump self made billionaire\nOne of the things it's really remarkable vote that story when you read it is you know he goes through job after jogging and says that things that are his father or his own\nAnd he tells the reporter that he's worth in excess of two hundred million dollars\nAnd everything he pointed to in the story that would go to his his net worth at that time was his father's he had a tax return to a few years later where we see he declared a I think he may twenty five thousand dollars a couple of years last year actually I got out actually that year Nineteen\nSeventies now and yet he was sitting there saying that he was worth two hundred million dollars and it was a claim that he would\n... part of the claim that would put him on the very first list of wealthiest Americans published by Forbes magazine in the Nineteen you know we'll see what it it maybe once or there was a spectacular\nCalling and I guess Donald Trump got used to people taking him at his word even one his word wasn't true\n[noise] yeah I'd be things build up right they they're like these layers right and reporters come along and they\nAre assigned to do some story about Donald Trump and they go look at the clubs are they going to look at what's been written about before it all kind of accumulates into this um sort of settlement of 'em in this case it kind of mythology of a man who had at least in his\nTelling his story the famous line that he has always said is that you started with a million dollar loan from his father\nHad to pay back with interest and then he parlay that million dollar loan into ten billion dollar empire that remained for the most part the dominant narrative that she sold certainly you know to make himself a celebrity and to gain a power and ultimately it's what he campaigned on very heavily\nTo win win the presidency and so this story really by sex that narrative and I think more than anything else offers\nReaders now based on the actual facts um and based on the actual documents an entirely new financial narrative of the forces president\nWell let me reintroduce you here if you're just joining us my guess is Suzanne crack and David ... of the New York times who wrote a remarkable investigative piece on our President Trump's inherited money from his father the loans he got from his father the tax evasion schemes the family had\nAnd that was published a couple of weeks ago you can find it on line we're going to talk more about how\nDonald Trump engagements aspect tax schemes as he reached origins from his father after we take a short break this is fresh air\nTides make Roman while you're at work where work to covering all of a national state and local stories you need to hear on all things for NPR\nThe reporters say one of the family's tax games involve fraud\nThis story offers a completely different narrative than the one Donald Trump has always presented himself as a self made billionaire\nOne of the Trump family concerns when Fred Trump was was old was that he might die owning\nAn empire and having lots of money meaning that he'd have to pay taxes on all of that and I think the taxes would have been fifty five percent\nAnd so Donald Trump and his siblings came up with a plan that involved and this is something that you discovered they come up with a plan that involves starting a company they called all county building supply and maintenance this was in Nineteen Ninety two then would you describe how this company functioned\nSure this was an interesting moment because when you think of ... you think of all the buildings that he only owned numerous buildings in Queens and Brooklyn worth hundreds of millions of dollars for a Trump was also somebody who hated debt\nAnd so he had very little data on these buildings and the documents that we found and we were sort of going through them we saw he had just mountains of cash tens of millions of dollars of cash were throwing flowing through his personal bank accounts and the bank accounts the buildings\nAnd this created\nA huge problem for the siblings 'cause if you died he would be fixing up fifty five percent\nOr state talks so they created a company in the early Nineteen nineties called all county building supply in maintenance and it was a company the shareholders were Donald Trump and his siblings and the nephew of fraud Trump\nAnd what this company did was for years for Trump's buildings would go out and they would buy supplies you'd see for everything from bridges in stove stove boilers to\nSupplies that they needed a new roof to windows all this stuff would be bought 'em by the buildings and they would go to like Long Island wholesalers or a Home Depot and they would get what they needed um and for a Trump buildings would pay for that\nAnd then one day all counting the company that Donald Trump and his sibling owns they would go out and all ...\nYou would pay for the material the differences is if they paid five hundred dollars for fridge stove combo\nThey were done son to separate invoices potted invoice opt for Trump\nAnd the building that he owned and they would mark it up to six seven hundred dollars and the shareholders of all county Donald Trump and his siblings would pocket the difference this went on for years on item after item after item and they were successfully able to drain tens of millions of dollars from Trump's buildings this way\nSo the sole purpose of SARS you can tell of this company that the Trump children created was to inflate the prices of things like boy ... refrigerators and um other like things that I'm buildings need so that they buy them inflate the price\nSell it to Fred Trump for his real estate empire pocket the difference so that they make hundreds of dollars every time they sell something different from and that\nWas a way of like transferring money from ... to the siblings\nYou know and as we started out on the reporting assignment one of the questions\nI'm immediately we knew for Trump drove a hard deal he was very careful with his money I'm an every penny was you know you could see you would account for he was a guy who would walk construction sites and if you saw a nail on the ground he would pick it up and make sure it was used somewhere\nSo we found it hard to believe that he wasn't already driving a pretty hard to deal with the with the dealers in the the the sellers that he had to\nTo do business with every day from the buildings but we went out and when we looked for um\nPossible employees that all county had maybe they had a purchasing department that was actually getting better deals are we throw our interviews and the documents um that we had we couldn't find any any even employees that all county had it was simply a mechanism where\nIt would mark up the material and then bill ... invoice pouting operation where they would just overcharge Fred on these items that it served no other purpose\nWhen the Trump siblings set up\nAll county this this company that just that existed to siphon money from French ... give it to the children did Fred Trump know about the company about the purpose of the company was he a knowing part of its creation [noise]\nWe think that he absolutely was he was an enormous roads you meetings where they came up with these ideas and it appealed to him because it was um\nShe was someone who just hated the idea of putting any kind of gets gr state taxes and we also see the signature on trucks um that were written to all Kelly building supplies so he was a man who\nPaid close attention to a recovery as those there's evidence both in the reporting in in the documents that she was absolutely um this is something that was on board with\nAnd then in a way like the collateral victims of these inflated cost where rent or isn't a lot of Trump properties because he use those inflated cost for boilers and refrigerators and spell of\nAs a way to justify raising the rent on people living in government rent controlled unit\nThat's right when you're an owner of a building and you have rent controlled apartments you have people living in them you have to apply to the city or the state to have the rent increased and you have to send over\nProof when you do that that you've made various improvements in this case they use the potted receipts in many instances the false receipts to say that we made repairs worth you know a hundred thousand or a hundred and twenty thousand when in fact\nThose repairs may have only costs eighty thousand they use these bogus receipts that they had created to justify higher than what should've been rent increases and then the depositions that we have them we obtain journal reporting Robert Trump Donald Trump's brother talks about this and he says the higher the markup the higher the rent we could charge\nAfter Fred the parents died in June Nineteen Ninety nine at age Ninety three\nYou say the vast bulk of his empire was nowhere to be found in his state and that that was a testament to the success of the tax strategies\nTo transfer money to the Trump children\nBut you're right the single largest item included infrared Trump's estate tax return was it ten point three million dollar I argue from Donald Trump money Donald Trump appeared to have borrowed the year before Fred Trump died we've heard stories about Donald Trump's debt to banks\nAnd this is the first time hearing that he owned his father millions of dollars when his father died\n[noise] well he owed his father or mother for most of his life um and there were repeated\nStrategies through the years to do something about\nThose unpaid Dutch that would accumulate so for example in the late Nineteen eighties at this point Donald Trump or his father somewhere in the neighborhood of Fifteen million bucks and the problem is that if his father simply canceled it that well in the eyes of the or else\nA chance all dollar debt is the same as a dollar of income so Fred Trump it's simply chancellor ... said I forgive you even have to pay me back\nDonald Trump was owed a chunk of tax for what's called cancellation of that\nSo Donald Trump and for Trump came up with this other way of making that are completely disappear involved trading that debt for stage and one of Donald Trump's buildings\nSo Fifteen million dollars or so of that for a steak in a building called Trump Palace\nIn them and then a few years later Fred Trump soul that Fifteen million dollar steak back to his son\nFor ten thousand dollars\nProof there goes that huge debt\nMy guess or New York times reporter says and crack and
