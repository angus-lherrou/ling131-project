{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Down a street that's a good question Norma and one of the things I brought up in our our morning I'm a staff meeting her editorial meeting was uh when I'm Out walking my dog is not your average after dark\nAnd I see a a woman who's out walking by yourself or walking her dog\nI and we're on the same side of the street I Walk into the street\nTo give her a clear sign that there's no potential threat to our men by myself but\nJustice as a gesture a of the sort of you know a ... and so funny because what is the typical response is the woman will look over and smile and nod there's some sort of just you're say good evening or something like that [noise]\nUm so in some cases there are things that we as men do obviously nowhere near as common or the to the degree\nThat women will do um to try and deal with the potential safety concern or abusive behavior I'd like to hear from you what did the ways in which you limit yourself war did you invest time a new maybe it's taking pepper spray weed you were or whatever it is eight six six\nEight nine three key PCC or the year talked page key PCC dot org from courts deputy news editor Jackie bishop is with us to talk about this Jackie I'm struck by the range of this for some women they might be just you know very minor a few simple things we use the example of\nYou know cases where a woman will actually leave town because she doesn't feel safe staying so for some women this totally up in their lives\nYeah it's it can be ready ready devastating for someone to have to deal with these incidences that I I Do think equally\nProblematic Italian ... this behavior is and at least\nThat women are expected to um participate in it and take responsibility for their personal safety and I think a lot of women right now are pushing back on that narrative and saying that perhaps we should instead be talking about the ways in which a woman shouldn't be hit as opposed to be at the ways in which women should be protecting themselves from being hit\nA so water water what is what would that mean if the emphasis shifted\nI think that in particular and not saying that women should make more if it's to protect if they feel when things happen\nIn which for example at the recent case that I mentioned in my story was the editor of the young woman and now than when the police officer at the met a issued a warning saying that people should take more responsibility for their safety and that women had actually in fact taken several measures to\nProtect ourselves and you know pretty immediately after that it's not helpful to say that women should be doing more when Randy what the issue is is that she was in a violent situation and she was hit by taking this and it makes it so I think that's the way that women want the conversation to start changing a little bit\nLet's talk with Nicole in Santa Monica you're on TALK uh what sorts of precautions do do you take\nThank you Larry I Do not take the trash out at night I Do not do the laundry at night\nI Do not go out at night I mean I don't do things unless I absolutely have to when it's dark out and then in the day like I'm just extremely aware before I get out of my car I look around all the time it's very limited\nDo you do you feel as though your concern matches the degree of risk for yourself were ... or do you feel at all like you're overly cautious\nHonestly my my my way of approaching it only takes one time so I probably am very cautious but I don't think it's overly coach\nYeah so so it gets even though these events are are rare the stakes are so\nHigh if something happens I yeah\nI Know who's on the other side of it because it only takes one\nNicole I appreciate it thank you for sharing your experience eight six six eight nine three key PCC or the year talk page K.

Dana who played a boy preacher and there will be blood a moody teenager and Little Miss sunshine and portrayed Brian Wilson in love and mercy dino co wrote and directed the new film adaptation of Richard forwards novel wildlife\nAbout a teenager who's unmoored watching his parents' marriage fall apart and doesn't know who to side with Jake Gyllenhaal and Carey Mulligan play the parents the story reminded they know about what he experienced when his parents' marriage started to unravel\nI think somebody else might have wanted to make a film about a kid rebels for me I remember sort of standing in the middle\nFeeling the ground shake and not wanting things to tip\nAnd Kevin White had reviews a reissue of music by new no Rhoda [noise]\nFirst news\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Lakshmi Singh federal investigators are on the lookout for more suspicious packages after a possible bomb was sent to CNN offices in New York City and a growing number of Democratic Party leaders were confirmed to be targets NPR's Brakkton Booker says one of them was former president bronco bomb\nAnd at that point my heart sort of left and I was like wow this is as great writing can do or a great song or whatever it is it felt like it for you in some way and that\nI just remember I moved to a new town when I was fourteen your home is sort of the edge of the world when you moved somewhere new ... because you don't know what's outside of it you don't have friends yet you know school is not yet a release um it's sort of scary to go there for the first time and so we grew up in a one bedroom apartment in Manhattan\nI'm really close with my family maybe too close and I remember when my parents started having you know struggles in that relationship sort of what a profound and gets difficult moment that was for me so this book\nSort of reflected back to me how family is one of the greatest loves in our life\nAnd because of that it's also sometimes one of the greatest sources struggle in our life and he was able to capture that with compassion\nIn the clip that we just heard the parents are fighting and one of them says to the teenage boy what do you think Joe like how awkward is that asking a teenage boy to weigh in on the battle between his parents were you in that position [noise]\nWell I think so and I think that's something I related to in this character I think somebody else might have wanted to make a film about I'm a kid who rebels writer or something from their youth but for me\nI remember sort of standing in the middle feeling the ground shake and not wanting things to tip so Joe and I have something in common and and Richard Ford and I have something in common in that regard I was somebody who wanted to keep things together so if something like that had been posed to me\nUm you know I wouldn't have said\nYou know I'm ... you know out of here and like what you know I Would have tried to actually understand what was going on and and then it can help\nDid your parents separate well my parents have an interesting situation which is they separated they like the end of this book strangely which is on the on the film have resumed living together a few years ago\nThey never got officially divorced but we did not always lived together [laughter]\nYou were fourteen when your parents separated the character and wildlife is sixteen and the novel yeah but he's fourteen in the movie did you make them fourteen in a movie 'cause that was your age when your parents have\nRead I met him fourteen because that's when I moved to a new town as the Brunson family does in the film and that\nFelt like where I was emotionally connected to a time in my life I wouldn't say that's officially when my parents separated I think there was actually previous to that there was some ins and outs in the relationship I'm so for me that was like spiritually the right age to sort of put myself into the story\nAnother a kind of see him in the book is that this fourteen or sixteen year old boy is getting different narratives from his mother and his father as\nGoing through this turbulent period of their marriage and he has to decide who's right who to believe and um that's really tricky when you love both your parents and they're telling a different stories about what your future is going to be like is that something that you relate to also\nAbsolutely and that actually you've now reminded me of probably my the most exciting first hit I got on the book\nWas this feeling of the mystery of who are parents are ... do you know when you suddenly realize like they are past life without the problems are that they're real people you know and and sort of seeing them as\nA whole people which means they're flawed people that was exciting to me I I sort of had to get to know Jerry Anne Janette better probably as a means of understanding my own experience maybe being put in the middle as you say but especially Jeannette I was like this woman is so complicated the mysterious and\nAnd sexual yeah which is I think also really difficult for the teenager to deal with especially because she kind of includes him in a suction that she's doing\nYes and and I how I feel about that as this woman has probably been a good mother for fourteen years and the good wife and I think the dad has tried in in in his way and I think they've done their best in many ways but suddenly like one day the rug pulled out from under you the charade is up\nAnd it's just like this kid is would it be kicked out into the wild right you know it's like okay\nTime's up you this is welcome to the real\nWorld [noise] so you directly asked Richard Ford for rights to adapt his novel wildlife into a movie and he wrote back to you in a letter he wrote back is included\nLeast excerpted in the press kits for your movie I'd like you to read that letter it's a great letter\nI'm grateful to you for your interest in my book but I should also say this in hopes of actually encouraging you my book is my book your picture were you to make it as your picture you we're moviemakers fidelity to my novel is of no great concern to many\nEstablished your own values means go read the book behind so it doesn't get in the way\nThanks for reading that show was that liberating to read that like the writer of the book is saying do your thing I'm okay\nI could not have written something better myself but you wouldn't want somebody like that to say to you I I was shocked and moved it is an incredible but of wisdom and permission so considering how much I Meyer his writing in general and especially how much this book movement and how much meant to me\nTo have that sense of permission was incredibly important\n[noise] we're there are lines from the book that you wanted to make sure we're in the movie and there's no voice over so we all the lines are dial up\nThat's right so the book is first person and actually looking back on the event\nVery tempting to his voice or especially 'cause the language is so beautiful\nWe sort of set a challenge for ourselves immediately like let's try not to use what let's see if we can do it without voiceover let's try to make this present tense and let's put it on the experience of witnessing this through the boys are starting to even the childhood you know what sort of be opening image and so we go back the layers with his portrait so that was the goal\nAnd their lines that I felt like had to be in the film that probably are not now do do you know because it just keeps growing and that's one of the most beautiful things experience of making a first film is the growth meaning\nWriting the script and putting so much working at the script honestly for for a few years because you just as an actor\nBelieving that the foundation is is kind of what we all stand from you know and and jump off of 'em and then suddenly bringing actors into it we're asking you questions were bringing subjects that you might not have even thought of\nAn emotion passes through them and it fills out something and suddenly you don't need that line that you thought was the essence of the film or something um you know in fact there is a line that's cut\nFrom the film that I think is really important which is warn the character named Moran Miller play by bill camp says to the kid Joe sometimes you have to do the wrong thing to prove that you're alive for me that line just\nBowls me over when I read it um and\nI couldn't wait to put it in the film and then the other room we didn't need it ...\nInteresting because it made it kind of says that way I probably shouldn't even during the day now [laughter]\nDo you have a lot more anxiety as a director than you do as an actor\n... it's such a different kind of anxiety tell me about the difference [noise] well\nThere's one a migraine and want us to them again [laughter]\nI don't I think that for me acting is just a bit more lonely because you do so much of the work on your own and then you arrive\nKind of hopefully full so to speak and and then you're what you're seeing partners in your director and but directing is I'm\nSo collaborative it's more like you know playing in an orchestra or something and maybe you're you're one of them but you know you're the leader maybe I don't mean arrogant as me and that's the that's the job you're dumb\nAnd honestly one of the hard things for me was that I didn't have any alone time 'cause I'm quite used about somebody's always asking a question somebody that you have to make millions decision today but I loved that feeling of collaboration with every little bit of the crew\nAnd sort of just helping to create like a space where we could all kind of go to work together and you're almost like parenting like you're just trying to get the best out of every body and I found that really gratifying\nIf you're just joining us my guess is fall day no we've probably know as an actor from films like there will be blood Little Miss sunshine and love and mercy now he directed his first film it an adaptation of the Richard Ford novel wildlife the movie's called wildlife too\nWill be back after a short break this is fresh air\nHides make roaming the caravan of Central Americans is proceeding north through Mexico we'll talk with the un high commissioner for refugees about what's driving them forward\nAll things considered weekday afternoon that for an eighty nine point three key PCC\nKatie cc supporters include acuity I group with a reminder that Ninety five percent of blindness from diabetes is preventable when caught early at an annual eye exam more at acuity I group dot com acuity I group our vision is your vision\nHe's best known for his roles as a teenager has decided to stop talking in Little Miss sunshine as a cruel overseer and twelve years a slave\nAnd as a teenage creature a false prophet and there will be blood which was directed by Paul Thomas Anderson and also started Daniel Day Lewis as a speculator looking for oil who comes into conflict with Dana's character\nThere were two scenes in there will be blood were Daniel Day Lewis his character beats you up one of them is kind of like a baptism in oil we beat you up and he pushes your head into like a oil mud\nAnd um he beat you up pretty badly and then of course\nSpoiler at the end of the film he kind of beat you to death of the bowling pin um [laughter]\nDid you take a lot of abuse there's actually you've probably seen this on YouTube there's a whole like real of you getting beaten up in different films including twelve years a slave there will be blood forgetting what else is was in there but anyway as you've gotten beaten up a lot\nIn your movies and in some of those you scream as you're being beaten up and you have different kinds of talk about different kinds of screens for different circumstance is did you have like really high pitch screams like deeper screams and Notre and softer screams\nAnd that's very funny it's fun to build a character and I think that you do ask yourself where the energy in this person's body for example right or their shoulders you know a little bit more back than mine\nAnd then I think the same with the voice you know you asked yourself for this person living from through the back or ... of the throat yeah or the mouse or the um and I mean it's really small so you know stuff but at least ask the questions and maybe try to you know\nThe questions you asked is this character stay strong or did they become a week when they're being being ensure\nIn are the injuries there are they enjoying this are they you know terrified what what's the and how does that affect the scream [noise]\nUm well usually at that point you've tried to lay the groundwork so that when the moment comes it comes the way it's meant to about ... you know so I don't know that I Would intellectual lives like but but certainly something I'm may think about is um\nLike for example one of the country during those prisoners on the phone call prisoners\nAnd you know that person was somebody who was traumatized and abuse are very young age and I felt like his body was sort of frozen um you know the way that you react when you're scared your shoulders go up a little bit you know your neck gets a little tight and so then you know carrying\nThe history and just the body holes that information your body does you know it's a holding some of your history you're emotional life and and it does for all of us and and that is a part of the voice\nYou weren't directed at eight at age twenty two by one of the greatest directors of our time about him as Andersen where there's things you learned from him about directing about how to work with actors um that you try to um carry through and the rest of your acting career and now in your first time directorial effort\n[noise] yeah Paul I think has a lot of love I think he loves his actors and his crew\nHe has a an incredible eye for detail I think it's definitely been important for me um I've been wanting to have been a filmmaker for a long time to seeing directors like this go to work meaning to see them wait for the oil drip to be right even though time and money is you know burning\nI remember one time or in a costume fitting you know him noticing something in the stitching of the tie that nobody else would have noticed you know I'm just sort of\nThe focus to care and the integrity and it's also important when you see somebody like him I'm able to enjoy their working and have a moment to fund probably too but I absolutely loved working with him and and frankly many of the directors I've worked with him to the common theme is really um\nHard work that talk about your fan love and mercy and this is a story of Brian Wilson\nMost famous for for the beach boys and of course for his solo albums and I'm In this film there's two versions of Brian Wilson is the version you provide when he's younger getting the beach boys era and then the version later in life when he's having serious mental health issues\nAnd a friend was in that part of the play by donkey sat\nSo I Want to buy scene from love and mercy you've been in this scene writing I got only knows great song and you play it for your father and your if your father who's played by bill camp in the movie is an abusive control freak he's very authoritarian with his sons\nAnd I'm very hypercritical nothing's ever good enough for him and so you're playing the song for him while he's sitting and looking very tense and smoking has pipe to here's Paul day now and bill camp in a scene from love and mercy\nIn the\n\nLast verse will be one more time in the chorus will harmonize over and over there\nSo rough I Know but it's getting there is right for cause was she's I mean it'll get better that the vocal counterpoint to back it was for real soulful [noise]\nSo you don't want my advice for my lovely\nTell me what you think it's usually\nUm I'm living on the wrong\n[laughter] we're still family Amazon Fire their own father don't want to start walking again argue I say something that you argue but don't say anything\n[noise] forget what forget what you don't like to solve I never said tell\n\nJust say something I Would change the title the country's a tuna called God only knows fifty five fifty nine that did you close your eyes like I asked you to tell me and I think [noise] if you close your eyes\nPlace something's happening\nIt's like being blind but because you're blind you can see more don't you think it's a spiritual kind of thing\nI don't know what you're talking\nI close my eyes didn't see a thing\n[noise]\nI don't know maybe it could be something with the right arrangement will yeah I've French horn on it and flutes tambourine sleigh bells piano base real complex key shifts\n\nFrankly if you really want to know I don't care for it to\nWishy washy if you leave me why leave me life will go on why go on living\nIt's not like the beach boys on your brothers are going to hate it ... it's a suicide note didn't you just say it could be something with the writer arrangement well I gave it another thought okay\nIf you can't keep your voice down in my house\nSo that's my ... in a scene from love and mercy that's all they know is Brenda Wilson and bill camp as his father Murray Wilson isn't really upsetting seen I mean\nThat only knows it's such a beautiful song and the fact that his father either can't here that are doesn't want to hear that\nAnd that he's being so mean to such a musical genius it's very upsetting but in any way you had to seeing in a way that approximate it [laughter] you know brain loss and you're at the piano are you actually I Know you're doing the singing and I'd seen you actually playing records\nYeah and that's ... that's just live you know I'm playing and singing on camera that's not done after the fact you know that was just in the same\nYou used to be in a band called moved a new guitarist and um did you know how to play piano\nI could probably formed a few chords but not really and you know frankly learning this music for this film of mercy\nListening to it or is probably one of the greatest joys I've ever had in my life professionally personally I loved this music so much you know a particularly pet sounds and smile\nI don't know Brian for somebody who struggled so much you get so much light in him and he met him\nYes yeah and when he when we talked about music he still felt like a school boy about it you know um you could be quite uncomfortable about most things but if you were with him and got into music you know he he really but but by lightning side of him I mean\nYou know he's he's really he's giving a piece of himself\nTo us and I think he wanted to help people heal which is such a considering the struggles that he had and you just heard in this scene you know to want to\nGive give that I'm through your music to somebody else who's experiencing you know um it's just such a beautiful generosity and and gift and you're listening to that scene now it's um you know not it's not just upsetting because he's in musical genius you mean he's offering himself to his dad you know\nAnd we can get totally I acted yeah unseen their core change as in love and mercy are so beautiful and so unpredictable and um so what did you have to learn those words like you know how to play those scores let alone the sequencing of them", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air
