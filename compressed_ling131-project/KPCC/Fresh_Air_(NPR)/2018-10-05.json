{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "As all the Senator Chuck Grassley is demanding answers the stunning new allegations that contradict Christine Blasey Ford's testimony\nChuck Grassley of Iowa sent a letter to her lawyers on Tuesday night raising this letter sent to them by her ex boyfriend\nAn ex boyfriend claims for to help the friend prep for a polygraph test\nShe had been asked about that at the hearing does she ever give advice any by taking a polygraph you said never\nKnow Ford's friend is denying being held for law detector test\nBut\nThis letter was cited by Republicans say if you can't trust but she says about this polygraph or ... you can't trust her about anything\nWrong to Senator Lindsey Graham in defending comments made by President Trump seemed to be mocking a blogger for\nEverything he said was fashionable\nHe's frustrated his nominees been\nTreated so it was a personal the reading of how I Am one well you know as soon as you know here's was personally integrating ah this is what you get when you go through a\n\nTo is it fair to the theater that Republicans have moved from Dr wildly Ford is credible and wish if you're out and perhaps that's happened to her but someone else other than Kevin I\nDid it too she lie\nWell they're not openly using the L Word quite yet but they are saying in effect to her testimony has not been fully truthful not very candid with Republicans seem to be doing here is trying to match\nThe Democrats in saying your witness is full of inconsistencies and factual gaps and therefore you know you can't trust her account over his but it does feel Peter and you are White House report you cover the president so\nClosely it does feel the President Trump thinks he's tapping into something in this moment as he has often done in the back\nSo very scary time for young men in America when you can be a filthy of something that you may not be guilty or [noise]\nYeah no I think that's true I think that nobody has been more successful on the national stage that channeling populist anger out there than President Trump\nYou could be somebody that was perfect yours higher life somebody accused you of stuff that\nYou know in this culture war in this big societal moment to meet you moment President Trump has decided to weigh in on one side in effect and that's with men he says are being unfairly swept up in this moment\nThe glut does impact my opinion you know why because I've had a lot of false charges made against me I'm a very famous person unfortunately I've been a famous person for a long time but I've had a lot of false charges made against me really false charges\nHe says he himself has been accused unfairly by the dozen or more women who said that he sexually harassed them so he understand whatever\nSo when I see it I I view it differently than somebody sitting home watching TV where they say oh judge Kavanaugh this or that it's happened to me many times I've had many false charges\nIs definitely taking a size is very scary time he says for young men because the presumption of innocence has been thrown away\n\nIt strikes me that somewhere along the way Republicans seem to have concluded that their efforts to tiptoe around in the meat you moment was maybe not necessary that they're based actually\nThough differently than they imagine and there was a sense that men fell under attack by what was going on by Kevin\nAnd you saw that in response to the president's comments by the audience at that rally in Mississippi that they had I simply discovered that they didn't need to be so diplomatic about all I Know that you know I mean that may be their calculation that may be wrong what sounds good on a rally in Mississippi on a weeknight may not look as good\nIn the light of day on the Senate floor when you're about to take a cloture vote and we don't know yet so you know different context different environment [noise]\nThey've been trying to judge Kavanaugh um\nIt was a rallying cry raise the porters at this rally it was something that gender cheers\nAnd a five [noise]\nBut are you comfortable the president's attacks on Christians ... the president's comments were a jet plane\nRon right now there are three Republican senators on the fence Jeff Flake Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski\nWhere I live there's there's no time no place for barks like that but it's got something of\nAll three of them pretty harshly condemn the president\nThis just in now from number three Lisa Murkowski Republican center of Alaska quote I thought the president's comments yesterday mocking doctor for were wholly inappropriate and in my view unacceptable that's from Sarah Lisa Murkowski she was asked whether it would affect her vote she said quote I Am taking everything into account [noise]\n\n[noise]\nIs it possible that the way the president is now talking about doctor buddy for that strategy that it's changed so radically in such a short period of time that that could actually cause this confirmation [noise]\nWell that's the worry about people around him exactly his advisors and the Republican senators who've been talking to him had advised him not to do exactly what he's done that they would inflame situation and make things worse even Lindsey Graham even the folks on Fox and friends of his favorite and strongest supporters said today\nThis is a mistake you shouldn't have done it because he risks losing the big prize he's after the first place which is putting another conservative on Supreme

Stevens retired U.S Supreme court Justice John Paul Stevens says he's changed his mind about Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the high court NPR's Nina Totenberg reports that Stevens made his comments and an event hosted by retirees in Boca Raton Florida\nWhich is that in order to punch through that wall they have to come up with a whole range of new ways of accessing\nNew populations people who wouldn't otherwise have been on Facebook the first thing they did was they discovered they simply had to translate the site into other languages make it available to other countries around the world and allow people to be able to post in Spanish and so on\nAnd by doing that they crossed this barrier that smoked which had prevented other social media sites from growing but it did something even more important which was that it established\nThe sacred important really sacred is the word of gross internally they created a a team called the growth team which became as of this former Facebook executives said to me it was really the coup crowd this was\nThe team everyone wanted to be on was growth was about really sanctify the idea of growth as an end in itself that if Facebook stopped growing than its whole reason for being would cease to exist and that idea\nEnded up becoming the dominant fact of the next decade from two thousand seven until today when\nFacebook became a extraordinarily focused on whatever it could do to continue growing year after year\nAnd one of the things they did was that they made it a platform for outside developer so that may be able to explain what this means so that other software developers could hitch into Facebook and use\nIt they made a big choice which was that instead of saying we're just going to be our own sight were actually gonna try to become a platform like almost like an operating system the way that windows used to be the\nYou know the way that everybody went on on to their personal computer and then you would build applications on top of that and that decision to open themselves up as a platform\nMeant that they were then sharing data to a much larger group of uh of developers of programmers than they otherwise would and this turned out to be a fateful decision because if you fast forward many years later to\nAnd what we all now know is the Cambridge Analytica scandal that was\nIt was directly a result of this decision to open themselves up as a platform because what they've done was they'd allowed an academic researcher to use some of the data\nOn the platform to build a personality quiz but then he sold that data to the political consultancy known as Cambridge Analytica and that sort of back door the way in which that data went out the door\nOr has created much of the crisis that now engulfing the company\nToday and you're right that the executive within Facebook Sandy para kill us was put in charge of looking into what these outside you know at the developers were doing with that the data that they got from the Facebook users who you know plugged into their games what did you find\nWhat he found unnerved him a semi park illicit joined Facebook in twenty eleven and was one of the people responsible for going out and figuring out whether the data that they were given to developers was being misused in any way we're\nNow where people are violating privacy where they um taking more data than they were supposed to and what he found was that they were in some cases programmers for instance were siphoning off people's pictures and they're private messages\nAre in other cases he found a developer that was building essentially shadow profiles profiles for people who've never given their consent\nUm including for children and it was you know this was a case in which there was just this feeling of it being the wild west this data was out there and nobody was paying attention and and he raised alarms internally as he tells the story what he did was he said look we need to do a a major audit\nTo go out and figure out where is our data who has an how are they using it and as he says he was told a that's not going to happen because if you do it you may not want to know what you're going to find meaning that they may have already lost control of so much of that\nData that they didn't really want to discover the full reach a and and Sandy ... left\nBut in in many ways his warnings turned out to be prophetic because exactly the kind of undisciplined user data which he had warned about and and and try to raise greater alarms about internally\nOr turned out to be the origins of the Cambridge Analytica scandal which became so I'm so consuming for the company this year\nSo a lot of resources within the company devoted to pushing growth not so much into doing a response of\nYes exactly as he said you know I needed people I needed engineers to help me try to police where this data was going with all of the resources we're going to grow he said at some point\nAnd he told me that the growth team had engineers coming out of their years they had everything they wanted everything was devoted to growing and it was not devoted to making sure that what they were doing at the time was say\nWhat are some of the of the things the company did to keep growing that kind of pushed the boundaries of privacy\nWell they began to build in lots of ingenious details into the design of the site things like a auto play video this is something as simple as\nChanging the nature of Facebook so that when you scroll down your page that the videos would begin to play without you having to click on them what that was was essentially taking advantage of\nSome of our own psychological wiring that means that just eliminating that small obstacle makes much more likely to stay on the site to watch that at and ultimately to consume whatever advertising is around it\nAnd they did other things they for instance you know you remember the very beginning Facebook used to have pages single pages you'd have to click onto the next page they got rid of that so it's just a continuous scroll\nAnd all of these little tiny details um\nWe're in a way making Facebook into a new generation of behavioral experts they figured out how to you tweak people's vanities and their passions and their susceptibility and their desires in order to keep them on the site the most important thing Facebook could do\nAnd this is how they measured it was made sure that people were\n... were signing on and staying on whenever you joined the company in your orientation you were taught about something very important metric known as el six of seven\nWhich means the number of people who've logged in six of the last seven days and whatever you could do to try to raise that el six or seven that was the priority [noise]\nUm but as you know somebody put it to me\nThe problem with that is that eventually you exhaust the positive ways of boosting that engagement and eventually you start to look at what this person described as the dark patterns\nThe ways that you can use anxiety or vanity or to try to get people to sign up one of the things they discovered for instance was if you send somebody an email that says\nThat if Facebook friend has uploaded a picture of them to Facebook that people are almost incapable of resisting the temptation to look um and that sort of tweak that just minor behavioral nudge turned out to be um really hugely important to the growth of Facebook\nEvan ... is a staff writer for the New Yorker we'll talk some more after a short break

Yorker staff writer at an awesome as he has a piece in the magazine called ghost in the machine about Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook and its current controversies it's in a recent issue\nNow Facebook isn't a lot of trouble these days because of data breaches it its role in elections but you're right that some form or Facebook executives are voicing doubts about the company's role for other things are exacerbating isolation outrage addictive behaviors they'll give us an example [noise]\nThis is a big change for Facebook traditionally it's former executives have been silent they leave the company and and very often don't say much about it starting last year\nSean Parker who is Facebook's first president he's sort of well known Silicon Valley figure um gave an interview in which he said that as he put it he's become a conscientious objector to social media you said God Knows what it's doing to our children's\nBrains and and then a few days later there was another very prominent former Facebook executive named ... who had been the head of growth and vice president of user growth which was an absolutely central position at the company for a number of years and he came out and said\nYou know in the back of our minds we all had a sense that something might be going wrong that our product the thing that we were building I'm paraphrasing here was as he put it contributing to the breakdown of social discourse the breakdown of society and he said he would never let his children use this kind of\nProduct I think because the public face of the company has been so on message about how they contribute in their minds to doing good in the world to have some very senior former executive come out and talk about what the public has come to believe which is that there are these very serious side effects\nTo the company's growth was a real wakeup call externally and I think somewhat internally\nYes side effects in terms of increasing you know social tensions and in some cases violent political activity what about isolation addictive behaviors\nRivalries I'm In ... for instance when Facebook arrived it really became an effect the Internet that there was only about one percent of the population that was on line before Facebook was there and then over the course of the next few years it grew rapidly\nAnd um and people who were interested in fomenting this kind of ethnic hatred between Buddhists and Muslims\nFigured out how to use Facebook to great effect and they would spread hoaxes or rumors and\nIn there were cases where a rumor hoax that was spread on Facebook directly contributed to the outbreak of a riot and and what you heard over that period was the people in Myanmar\nBegan to talk to the company warn the company that this was a problem as early as twenty Thirteen people began visiting Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park giving sly presentations talking about\nThe problem of ah ethnic violence being trafficked on Facebook in the end the company would listen and in some cases they would give a hearing to that\nView and it would be over the years they continue to visit activists and technology entrepreneurs for me and more but they didn't see any fundamental change and and and they were started every time they went they would they would hear very often the same message which was we're going to hire\nDozens of Burmese language speakers to be able to police this kind of thing more effectively but still fundamentally it didn't change and [noise] and eventually it became so pronounced\nThe role of Facebook as a catalyst in this violence became so serious that ah earlier this year the un investigator in charge of I'm\nProbing the persecution of the hang of Muslim minority in Myanmar described the role of Facebook as in her words a beast she said it has become something that it was never intended it that is actively contributing to this what's the un now considers a genocide\n... did you talk to Mark Zuckerberg about this\nI did and I asked him about it and and and at first he was he was a frankly a little quibble about it he said look this is a problem that is similar in a lot of places and it's one that we're\nThat we're dealing with I'm paraphrasing there and I I pushed him out and I said well I talked to people in me and more just a yesterday in fact um\nThey're baffled about why a company as big as a as rich and as innovative as Facebook has been unable to deal with this problem\nAnd what he said was we take this seriously we we really do understand this is a problem but it's not something in which you can just snap your fingers and solve it\nOvernight it takes a process you have to build out these systems in order to allow artificial intelligence to detect hate speech and then hire the kinds of people who can\nWho can solve the problem is you know he said that they are going to have over a hundred people a Burmese speakers who are going to be policing um the ah Facebook in ... but I think it speaks to a broader\nA broader dynamic at work here was which is that for a long time as one of march afterwards friends said to me when there were complaints about the company\nHe either thought that these were just LED lights these were people who are slow to embrace technology or in other cases they were exaggerating are overstating the role that Facebook was plane he looked at a place like me and Martin said well they were probably going to be fighting anyway I'm I'm putting words in his mouth or does or not words he said to me\nBut I think over time he has come to this realization and by his own description of belated realization\nThat Facebook is not just a tool on the table it is not just an of a new implement it is in fact a fundamental and very ... ... ... the by its nature it has to be responsible for the forces that it on leashes\nUm but then building the systems to try to get control of this\nIs is hard and they have moved much more slowly than they should have a in some cases by their own admission\nLet's talk about the twenty sixteen elections did Facebook is when the election was approaching see this as a big revenue opportunity\nThey did they saw this as a an important moment they Sheryl Sandberg and call with investors and analysts\nCompared it to the world cup or the super bowl was chief operating officer of you know she is yeah she's sort of arguably the second most powerful person at Facebook and\nAnd and what she said was this was going to be a major opportunity for them to sell ads a political ads projections at the time were that\nAs candidates and political organizations became more aware of the importance of the Internet that they were going to shift a lot of their spending from television into the Internet and that that you were going to see a a nine or ten fold increase in how much spending was going to be available and Facebook want it to be a big recipient of that\nRight and and it had gotten the special exemption 'em to print ads which didn't disclose who paid for them right so so that was kind of a wide open opportunity\nYeah Facebook had used its lobbying power it had\nUm it had argued to the federal election commission that it should be exempted from rules that require television advertising to be identified by the source of the funding you know that point at the end where they say who who paid for the ... they said we shouldn't have to follow those rules because we're in New technology and in their filings they said you don't want to stifle the growth of new\nInnovation but as a result that meant that it was in a sense a very dark terrain that things that were being posted on Facebook that were ads are around politics\nWhere in many cases of mysterious origin it was very hard to know who was posting them and why\nAnd Facebook offered to embed a Facebook employee with both the Clinton and Trump campaigns to help the campaigns use the platform effectively how did they respond with\nThe Clinton campaign or rejected the offer um [noise]\nThey thought they had more or less enough of their own technical capability to do it but the Trump campaign embrace it eagerly they were much smaller almost sort of shoestring operation they had very little uh of the season political expertise that was rallying around other presidential candidates\nAnd so Facebook moved employees into the Trump campaign headquarters and they helped some craft their messages to help them figure out how to reach the largest possible audience how to\nTest different messages many many messages a day um to figure out just what small differences changing the background color or changing the tax or the font how that would impact the number of people that would click on it and ultimately might give money and support the candidate\nSo later in the end when after Donald Trump won the election the senior campaign strategist were very clear as one of them Teresa ... said to an interviewer without Facebook we would not have won they played an absolutely essential role in the process\nHow did the Trump campaign itself you use the platform to affect things like turn up\nBut one of the things they did was the Trump campaign bought an ad campaign on Facebook that was designed to suppress turnout among constituencies that they expected to be important to the Democrats including African Americans and young liberals and and white women and\nBite bite targeting that population using these incredibly powerful tools or persuasion that Facebook has which are really we have been engineered to to optimize to to get people to respond I'm\nIn the view of the Trump campaign that was an important piece of their success and they've talked about it ever since\n... is a staff writer

is\n[noise] why from NPR News in Washington I'm Louis ... and a closely watched trial a jury has convicted a white Chicago police officer of second degree murder and the shooting a black teenager look Kwan McDonalds\nOf the expression that I had and changing the level\nUm I knew it so well\nYou know it's just like having a voice for having a talented writing and then losing a part of that losing um vocal quarter losing access to your you know hand to write it down it just it was\nTerrifying to lose that mode of expression that I was so in touch with that I so love die so cultivated for my whole entire life\nAnd it was your entire life I mean that that was dancing was and still is your your your life\nYeah I started when I was three ... and I retired ballet at forty seven but I'm fifty now and I just took a class and I did yoga this morning and I moved to my body and [noise] and I felt good so I was happy\nAnd it's nice to hear so once you realized after your hip surgery and after the rehabilitation and physical therapy when you realized you could dance again\nBut it was time to leave the extreme dance in the New York city ballet did it change your identity to leave the New York city ballet you'd been with a ballet for Thirty years that I mean that was your your principles that was really like your identity and if one of the most famous ballet companies in the world\nYeah I I I moved to New York from Louisville, Kentucky when I was Fifteen\nMy ultimate focus was was the New York city ballet getting in hopefully and thriving in that company and um and I did I was there as a an apprentice when I was Seventeen I'm joined when I was Nineteen and\nGrew up there I you know everything I experienced as an adult happened as a member of New York city ballet sort all connects to that place so to leave it as an adult I'm going into it as\nBasically a child was\nScary really scary yeah I mean like who are you if you're not the principle of the New York city ballet\nYeah and I you know they give us our our um schedule a day or two days before so I Know every day what I'm supposed to do mhm leaving your city ballet the world doesn't do that for me to do that myself [laughter]\nSo that was huge you know to sort of let myself no oh well if you want to sleep and you can sleep in you know that was like what\nYou know just letting go in and releasing and relaxing a little bit was huge was letting go\nHard I mean it was that um something you don't really know how to do\nI've been strapped in you know physically strapped in the points you strapped into a leotard and tights ... my hair's been strapped up [noise]\nFor my whole entire life\nAnd two on tie the shoes [noise] um I don't wear leotard anymore I wear T shirt and I wear pants I don't wear tights\nAre generally where my hair looser and or or even in a braid now um I wear socks on my feet I don't like to be constricted now but that was safe than I was terrified to be on constricted and now\nI don't know another way I'd rather be so yeah it was from one extreme finding the safety and the other\nWhen you were describing how you address are you talking about on stage or off\nBoth on stage enough I I wake up I go to class at ten ten thirty in the morning on ... on and shoes and my hair's up and I spend that day ... ... well like that until you know a ...\nDay then I go and do a performance and everything was becomes a little bit tighter [laughter] including the nervous system so everything's on a on a high ladder\nOf like [noise] you know I've got a I've got to succeed I I Can't fault her I have to you know make that step happen I have to feel in that zone\nI'm In front of three thousand people tonight and then coming off of that from a performance as it takes a while your adrenaline has pumped and\nYou calm down and maybe you go to sleep at midnight or one or if you can't sleep 'cause you're nervous later than that and then you get up and you do it all again the next day I did that for\nDecades um and I don't consider myself a ballerina now I'm I'm a former ballerina now so there are some of it's still in there but I don't like um [noise] try to attain what I was in the same way\nAnymore I've given up I've let it go and it's life and we all have to do that\nAnd it's hard sometimes to do it in our culture because I think people are ashamed of getting older it's in a shame definitely people don't hide their age the way they used to because it's point last saw anybody needs to do is go on Google so what\n[laughter] bother to hide it but\nBut still I think people are very often very self conscious about their age especially in professions where you're judged by your age and that covers a lot of professions but when you're judged visually by your age I mean I'm sure that's one of the reasons why so many people get cosmetic surgery you know ...\nYeah [noise] I've always been I mean I've always been proud of always been while I'm this old never lied about my age you know you know so but but but and a ballet it must\nHave been like wow I don't know she's like she's forty five now when she's when is she gonna retire how much more does she have left did you feel that from people\n[noise] I you know I heard later in my career my boss say we're going to outlast some of your your colleagues just physically I can tell 'em until I was revved up about that I felt confident and yeah\nYou know I sure am and I and I did but then at the same time he's the one that's okay now\nMaybe you should rethink doing this particular roller this particular thing and you know and so you know he's kind of the master of of time ... Mr time [laughter] [noise]\nWhat was your mix between anger and gratitude [laughter] neat about oh maybe it's no longer time for you to be doing this wrong and I think the role he was talking about was in the nutcracker which you'd done every year\nYeah I was surprised I went into the meeting thinking it was about something else I had no idea that this was going to come up um\nThis was hiding ballet mastered Peter Martin\nYeah and because I hadn't had any real pain in my body I mean I knew I wasn't twenty eight anymore but at the same time I didn't I wasn't feeling\nPain and or boredom I still feel inspired and I'm so when it happened I was what you are you serious I shocked me and then it hurt really really bad and I cried a lot for a while um\nAnd I think the shock was was what hurt the most is because I didn't expect it how long after that meeting did you get injured\n[noise] um that happened in I think October two thousand eleven and buy 'em January two thousand twelve I had pain mhm [noise] so two months and the pain never stopped in different areas of my body\nFor four years wow that's a long time to be in the yeah yeah\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll

York city ballet for Thirty years\nIn twenty Thirteen hip injury led to reconstructive surgery and months of rehabilitation and physical therapy she returned to the New York city ballet for the spring twenty fourteen season and retired from the company that October after a triumphant performance she noticed contemporary dance\nThe new film wrestlers creature documents that period of her life from her surgery to her comeback that period during which you worried about whether she would dance again and how leaving the New York city ballet would alter her identity\n[noise]\nHow did you get the hip injury that led to your pain into your surgery\n[noise] came out of nowhere literally came out of nowhere I um [noise]\nI slipped on ironically September eleventh two thousand twelve [noise] and um I knew something had happened I it was the smallest slip\nOne of the un I actually I forget which now this is a forgive me but um you do is I Am with your partner so like your apartment it was kind of\nLifting you as you do a kind of court we'll a slow cart wheel in the air making a full circle with your legs almost a complete split as you're doing right and that looks like and in credibly physically challenging thing to do yet you make it seem\nSo effort less and it looks like you're just kind of floating\nBut you're not I mean gravity this when you're on stage it doesn't stop for you [laughter] know can you talk about what you're physically doing in that particular move\nIs that deli you're ... you're talking of is called ...\nAnd um that's the very last moment of the peace um and I always felt like I was um [noise] a switch blade in that moment\nMy partner ... he's he's a magician and luckily for me I got to partner with him for about Fifteen Years\nAnd uh she's holding me in a certain way any lifts me up like a Jack knife from under my hips under my my my bottom [laughter] sort of taking my my ... my hips high up into the air and my legs are in a Jack knife position\nAnd he dropped me back down any meals at the same time\nAnd I'm just\nSort of bring them back dive holding on to my front foot\nBack bending with his support\nRotating cart willing backwards catching myself on the floor with my hands letting my legs follow me and sliding under his leg and two and Neal and he kneels behind me and me both look at the audience and the lights fade let's just really like cool\nAnd how does it physically feel to feel like well this is hard I'm really exerting myself or does it feel as fluid as it looks feels\nHeavenly feels like magic mhm feels like it was like there is no other place I'd rather be than making that movement right there then mhm yeah\nWhat's the importance of valley shoes when you're a ballerina like having like the exact right shoo oh you mean like the points you\nYeah I'm the one where you go up on your toes one where you go to yeah it needs to fit like a glove\n[noise] so it really needs to\n... ... we practice pointing our feet working exercising our feet so that we can articulate um the joints in the feet and the and create um shapes um sculpting defeat um because that's a huge part of our expression\nUm footwork so when you get on a point you ... a ... you want to be able to follow through with that articulation and not have it break the line or break the movement or break your ability to express to the most\nWith that foot I think most dancers now start point work at twelve or so and all the way through your childhood and your and your young years you're trying to get that ... to ... you just write and to make your foot shape just right so it's honest [noise] true strong powerful\nGorgeous [noise] see you started dancing at the age of three yes him by twelve you were diagnosed with ... says how severe was it\nUm severe enough that the doctors wanted to treat me for it with um traction buddy casting\nAnd ultimately a Milwaukee brace so they wanted to halt the curve because if they didn't hold the curve when they found it the curve probably would've um accelerated to a place where I Would have needed surgery which ultimately would not have allowed me to have a ballet career\nSo we caught it really right at the crux of it either getting worse without treatment or halting and\nAnd uh respond to treatment and being a dancer a was a great thing the doctor told me back then he said the best things for ... this was in Nineteen Seventy nine\nOr Nineteen eighty um our swimming and ballet is a great and therefore my body was flexible enough that it ... really responded to the treatment quickly I grew in inch and a half\nAfter a week of traction in the hospital and the doctors were thrilled and that really kind of\nPulled me away from the surgery side of things were as one of my my hospital room mate didn't get so lucky and she ended up having to get a a rod in her spine [noise]\nSo when you had to wear a body cast mhm how did how did you keep up with dancing\n[laughter] well I was in a Fifteen pound body cast I'm so imagine one of those down vest that you can get at north face or one of the [noise]\nBasically that made out of plaster was what I Lived in for it ended up being a month at a time over five months one summer\nAnd in between each casting I Would go back into the hospital and spend a week interaction with a head Halter on and leather straps holding my hips down towards the base of the bed and twelve pounds pulling on my head on this had Halter [noise]\nSo um as an ... uncomfortable as that was it really helped me straighten out my back and then I Would go into this body cast for a month the time and my teacher said to me at the time living in Louisville, Kentucky she said you know you've done so well\nAnd I don't want you to lose your focus during the treatment right now so I Want you to come into the studio in your body cast and I want you to try to do whatever you can do we don't expect you to do this we don't expect to do that but just\nFeeling out move
