vowing to hit back hard if the U.S slaps it with economic sanctions as NPR's colon Dwyer reports the threat marks a new chapter in a diplomatic crisis over the disappearance and suspected murder of a Saudi journalist\nAnd now fifty years later seeing a reproductions of the technology that was used and it looks so relatively low tax\nI mean card dashboard look more high tech today and some of the control panels in the space capsule um they're they're they're like knobs and I'm ... and a lot meters [laughter] yeah it just makes you wonder like how did they\nDo this how do they do this without the kind of computer and digital technology that we have today\nIt was a it makes it even more astonishing I think you know it's it is astonishing enough the human beings have ever walked in the moon but that they did it over fifty years ago um with the technology that they had\nYou know these capsules we're not really a I Would say we're not kind of reassuring to look at when you're about to get into them or they're tiny they're rickety are\nAs you say are totally kind of analog and feel I mean I often\nThey feel more like extensions of the machine age the MySpace age they feel like things that you would expect out of a World War two submarine or tank movie very much the opposite I think of how at least my generation grew up thinking about space travel which was high tech which was you know it was a everything having to do with space travel in the movies was sleek and grand and\nClean and just the epitome of technology um and really this was a this was a time where you know we were being thrust into the future before the future it arrived and I've just find that fascinating and you have a group of people literally making it up as they go on\n[noise] you know an example of all the things that could possibly go wrong in um the Gemini eight flight the this is like the first there's going to be the test of the first space craft to dock with another spacecraft to see if that's possible [laughter]\nAnd so you know a Neil Armstrong's on that mission and as he's getting strapped in to the space capsule before takeoff\nOn this really daring and dangerous mission they realized his seatbelt isn't working like the mechanism stock and well one of the members of the tech who says does anybody have a Swiss army knife and it just makes you think about if the\nSeatbelt isn't working just think about all the things that could\nPossibly go wrong um and I kind of constant theme of the movie like all the things that could possibly go wrong and how amazing it is that any of this happened\nIt was one of the big things I wanted to try to get across because I think uh we almost take the moon landing for granted today and and maybe it's because the sort of image of NASA at that time and and that we've lived with sense was the sort of high tech image you described in this kind of image of\nOf a sort of hit me of technology and the epitome of individuals' this idea of superheroes basically walking among us who did these deeds that were almost easy for them because they were just so super heroic um\nI think it's much more interesting to think of these people as ordinary human beings are working with the limited technology that they had you know scrounging things together figuring stuff out fixing things with Swiss army knives doing calculations with pencils and\nPaper a and also you know the families I think there's a whole untold story of kind of what this actually mental family level and so to me it was really important to you know at every juncture be looking at Neal\nIn conjunction with with Janet with Janet Armstrong who I was lucky to spend time with 'em before she passed away and and and and talk to about disappeared in their life and just you know what that means to a marriage what it means to\nA family where you're trying to raise kids you know ... to\nYou know literally perform you know for example this Gemini mission which came disclosed resulting in his death\nOr something I didn't know about it was a total New York it asked her the in space that almost cost the lives of two astronauts an end to the program right then in the mid sixties or any comes home and has to you know take out the trash and clean the pool and help make his kids breakfast in the morning how do you how do you balance those two things I think I just I found that fascinating\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from the film is right before the moon flight\nNASA puts together a press they meant about the deaths of the men on a flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe\nMhm um and so you know they basically sending these astronauts off into space hoping that land on the moon but if they don't just in case they don't masses preparing you know basically a eulogy a press release eulogy um did did that actually happened\nYeah I mean you can find the uh ... you know you can search it online in a van of moon disaster was sort of the you know the the sort of had it on the copy a and so the sheet of paper you see a a gear and Heinz who plays ... movie holding his is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual sort of format and paper\nUm that you can find a line and and the wording as is word for word and it's a really I mean it's it's a\n... actually really love that that speech because uh you know thank God it was never given\nBut in a way to calculate in such a poetic beautiful way the willingness to sacrifice and and this kind of reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the speech that says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the at the moon will know that there's some part of another world that is forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragedy and in reading that knowing what the intend to that speech was\nBut yet also at the same time this incredible kind of hope and this sort of a unifying kind of outlook on what space travel could do you know and what these sort of a risky costly brave ventures could maybe do for for the country and for humanity\nI was wondering if the astronaut Neil is Neil Armstrong knew that NASA was riding his obituary just in case\nYou know I don't know that for sure I think you know one fascinating thing about Neal and and his colleagues is just how close to death they\nAre live their lives and seemed willing to live their lives and it's also not a conversation that's unique to test pilots are astronauts you know it's something that families are all over the country and all over the world\nConversations that they sometimes have to have a any sort of service for country often involves you know at least that risk and it's it's something I think it's helpful to remind people with\nMy guest is dean inches out\nHe directed the new movie first man and wrote and directed la la land and whiplash we'll talk more after a break and

nine I'm strong became the first human to walk on the moon\nAnd you mentioned you had the chance to talk with I'm Janet Armstrong who was Neil Armstrong's life they were married I think for thirty six years and then I'm divorced what\nWere some things you learn from her that help you understand what she and she's portrayed by Claire foie and when Armstrong we're going shrewd during this period in the sixties when he was an astronaut\nOr well one thing I think that Neal engine and had in common was this ability to put on a face and in moments of incredible upheaval\nYou know it was something in their character sort of mid western I'm kind of ... that they had that ultimately you know it was very much a product of of of their time and their culture that was just able to do the impossible without complaint\nAnd you know I really got a vivid sense of that when talking to Janet you know I I Would ask or things like you know ... well you know how did you\nHow did you do this how did you
