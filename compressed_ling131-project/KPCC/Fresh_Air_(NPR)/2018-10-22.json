C.\nDot org Jordan in Huntington Beach I saw how close would would this have to be in your family background for you to feel you can claim that\nAll my family backgrounds of the unique my my mother's grandfather was a Native American um I won't name the tried but he was you know listed within the tribal registry I'm even today our family surname as is accessible on there and so we grew up with the knowledge that we had some some Native American background\nHaving said that my my mother's mother was born with bright red hair\nYou know she was born into a rocky marriage and we always assumed that even though you know part of the birth certificate she was half Native American that that just wasn't adding up so we took a DNA test uh not too long ago and it just proved or ah\nOr I guess it just proves the the the birth certificate and it proved our families theory that we were not um significantly Native American you know there were ... percentage there but it was as a result of\nMy great grandfather yeah so we no longer self identify as Native American despite my mother growing up with a full Native American grandfather\nKnowing a lot about the tribe he was pretty involved in their tried shooting she no longer self identifies as that and so I guess for me yeah we did have some trace a Native American or trace sub Saharan African which is pretty common for Americans it's your genealogy forms\nAnd it brings up the Jordan the the issue that our earlier caller made that um who who's been very active in a Native American causes you know his point is that the you know the percentage ... in one's um makeup isn't anywhere near as important\nAs the cultural affiliation and choices in individual makes and what do you think about that given the assumption of uh of your your ah your grandmother\nOr it so it was my uh my mother's grandfather and mothers ... is accurate um my mother still donates to trouble causes but I don't think it she can still be an ally of of tribal writes in a in a movement without self identifying as Native American and I mean the science kind of just proved that that she was ...\nI think she wasn't a huge surprised her let's put it that way I mean her mother had but red hair and\nI don't think we were shocked um so it was probably different for her than somebody like\nReally believed her family history you know look if the if if it wasn't but one's DNA test came back and it said that that's fine I think what she could say I don't think she did it with a tent was look my family history with this it appears that may have been embellish yeah accurate I didn't do it maliciously and I think people would get on board with\nThat yeah I and I and I and that would have felt I think a little straighter to say you know well it it is technically accurate but\nUm you know not not to the degree that I was led to believe I appreciated Jordan good to have you with us Pasadena ad rights on the page if if I was greater than twenty five percent native I Would claim I'm part native but I'd never claimed to be Native American\nIs less than twenty five percent I wouldn't even mentioned that\nUnless we were doing a deep dive into our respective genealogy he's a let's take another a call um\nThis from Elaine in Studio city Elaine a real briefly please I'm at how close what a particular race or ethnicity you have to be in your background for you to claim it\nI think it depends on how you live your life is still a little bit what you were just discussing it the other caller\nI'm half Asian and half Hispanic but I look more Asian have an Asian last name and I don't feel at all Hispanic so it would feel falls to me even though I'm just one generation yeah it would feel falls to meet you ... to say on Hispanic or to try to take advantage of that in some way\nUm because of the way that I live my life so for me I Love Elizabeth Warren I'm a progressive [laughter] um\nBut have a hard time because I at least from the outside it seemed like she lived her life as a white woman and that uh I don't know maybe maybe she celebrates Native American history in her household and we don't know about that it feels a little\nWhile and it's interesting that you did you are half Latino but don't really identify 'em just just because that is not really the culture that you grew up with again speaks to that issue

[laughter] what do you think listening back to ... I it's strange\nTo hear back I forgot I'm just kind of how truly absurd it it was and yet kind of true to form so I don't know rattling\nI always wanted to know whose idea was it for you to play Spicer did they call you is that just having a lot of folks call you and ask you to do it or did you suggest the idea to them\nNo ... no I did not suggested I Would never\nOr have thought of that than a million years um my friend can sublet that's I'm One of the head writers at us and now that I Know you know going back to the ground links theater in Los Angeles uh\nHe called and said would you ever come in and do Spicer I wrote something that I I think you can play and I was like what the the what I Can't play him I don't\nI don't do in person nations I'm not a man I don't know I have I have no interest it's not in my wheelhouse and he just kept saying you know I think you could do it I think you know just come and can I can I send you to read\nAnd I I think I said I don't think it's quite my thing and and then I Believe the next day I saw\nAnother rather you know insane press conference where I thought well this is weirder than anything I could actually do like we can't even we can't even match it on us and now it's so absurd and I just thought\nOkay I'm going to come in and read it and talk to you guys about it and\nYou know I think and then the the real humbling blow as I thought well how how long is he going to take like can can we even get me to look like him and the really lovely a special effects guy there just said oh yeah that's not gonna be hard at all that'll take like a half an hour\nWhich I thought oh I thought it might be harder to switch over to a man that really was it and they got it down to like you know at one point we were doing it and like you know Fifteen minutes but\nLet's just thought ah I think I got to feel I started to think may maybe it's time to kind of hold hold a mirror up and to see if anyone realizes how kind of ridiculous they're being so one of the\nThings that you became famous for within that sketches the moving podium which you kind of Dr aggressively [laughter] reporters and then there was like one a one sketch we actually drove it down was the Fifth Avenue in Manhattan\nWe were all over Manhattan in that podium which was very surreal shooting it I I think I pitched it at one point of you know do we go\nWe kind of ceiling to the to the sunset and I think I just actually thought it would be fun to drive kind of a Segway podium around Manhattan I didn't think they would ever let me do it all is said why is that what it was on\nWell it was kind of based on that some you know these incredible people built this whole rigs so it was kind of a podium sitting on a a Segway type of contraption but they've built they built this whole thing and and rigged it but\nAnd it was weird there were just\nYou know all up and down the streets there were all these people watching and then you can I'd look up into the building and just see you know hundreds of people kind of ... against the glass and they thought this is the most surreal moment I'll probably ever have\nIf you're just joining us my guess is Melissa McCarthy and she's now starring in the new movie can you ever forgive me so we'll be right back after a break this is fresh air\nFired Vic Roman while you're at work were work to covering all of a national state and local stories you need to hear on NPR and\nJoined us all things considered a weekday afternoon set for later on when three K PCC QVC supporters\nInclude the corporation for public broadcasting for supportive if you're on the phone your dreams through the state wide nonprofit media collaboration focused on issues of economic opportunity quality of life future California Dream\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Melissa McCarthy she's starting in the new movie can you ever forgive me which is based on a memoir by Lee Israel\nWho when she started being unable to sell new book ideas decided to forge letters by literary greats and make money selling those four letters as if they were originals\nSo something else you've very famous for as your role and bridesmaids and\nThe most famous or maybe I should say infamous scene when\nThe bride and the bridesmaids get food poisoning as they're trying to like really expensive fancy bridal dressing yet um\nYou know bridesmaids dresses and they get like super sick and of course there aren't enough bathrooms so you end up sitting on the bathroom sink and your expensive gallon that you're trying on and the whole scene is very intentionally gross and I'm Wondering how you felt about\nThat scene because part of a of the scene part of a point of the movie is that you know women can do gross had comedy just as men\nCan and it really wasn't the point of it OK none of\nNone of us felt that way about it and that that scene was actually kind of in jak get into the film\nKind of late into the process and I think at first everyone bristled data and thought we don't want to do this grossing for the sake of gross it really isn't any of our humor we didn't find it funny\nBecause it did feel like for lack of a better way to determine ... more like a guy move and do you remember us talking about it and they said what are the only thing that appeals to me does seem funny and kind of\nFarm [noise] it was in Plainfield, Illinois it was about three miles out of town and it was a corn and soybean farm I'm at any given time we would have between you know twenty and thirty cats are just on the outside\nWe wait what was it was that because you are cat people or is that because of my [noise]\nWell probably probably both but really the main reason was that you know anytime someone had a litter of cats or couldn't get a cat adopted are illiterate adopted\nAnd they had nowhere else to go we would you know my mom and would take the mitten and she felt well what's the difference we're in a big farm it does help to keep my from ever getting into the house\nAnd she's a you know a soft and we all like to cats so they would stay outside they weren't you know it wasn't it wasn't like a\nA horror movie with us and our living room [laughter] but uh you know and people would put boxes of cats I cannot drive away I always thought it was kind of sad and and terrible but we we take them in and as kids we'd love it I think I think it did definitely frightened parents\nOf my friends the first time in the first time I got taken home\nThere was always a bit of a catch in my chest of like\nWhen they finally get down to a gravel road and they pulled into the driveway there are going to be twenty five cats that rush out to the car in a very friendly way but\nIt does seem like oh and this is this is how will all be killed and I just remember\nThe first time parents were always like oh my God oh my God I'm like it's fine I'll get out here I'll just get out here and they're like well why do you have so many cats and\nYou know it's like an eighty eight year old kid you're like well I'm you know we just take them in and it's not as weird as it looks meanwhile you know they were just like get out get out of a car\nWhat did you see them you must have had a lot of cat food there's a lot of cat food we'd make like big pictures of food I remember using different I've not thought about this\nWe believe these carnation powdered milk and we'd like rip up bread and lots of cat food and make this kind of stoop concoction and then go out on the back porch and you know in ... the cats and\nThat's a lot of have to come running at one point you know especially if some of the cats were newer and a little more slightly feral my mom was very um\nOf making sure all the cats got pets so they got used to people and used to being around and she's really sweet so Sandy would always pet each cat while they were eating and make sure that they got used to like people touching them and at one point she was out there doing that and when she stood up she realized that one of the cats was a skunk\n[laughter] she she had been chatting and heading this cannot be like oh you like\nThat is that a good dinner and then she stood up and the light that she had been blocking with her body the light hit the skunk\nSo yeah that was a all all were welcome I guess is the take away their hope she didn't get sprayed by this gunk she didn't it just kept eating she got you know it's probably the only time for sure that got hit by a human\nMost McCarthy at what point did you start thinking about either acting or comedy which came first like acting or comedy that combination standup\nStandup came first I'm In kind of\nSuddenly and I moved to New York when I was twenty kind of out of the blue or had been living in Boulder, Colorado I'm not sure exactly what I was doing or why it was even there I'd moved there with my sister and then just it was still kind of lingering and ah\nHad a friend come and see me and say why are you in Boulder and I said I don't know I only want to be in New York so three days later I moved to New York city\nThat night he found a place to do stand up the next an open Mike night the next day 'cause\nNot necessarily talked about stand up but I think\nI kind of did a lot of telling stories and like to you know I found\nIt fun to make people laugh and our first night he said you should do your you're going to do an open Mike night tomorrow night and I said All right and I think because I was twenty and\nYou just kind of think everything's not a big deal I figure you know now I Would be terrified but at twenty I just went okay that seems fine we're not doing anything else and I went up on stage the second night I was in New York and I kind of thought\nOh I think this is what I'm going to do and I remember calling my parents saying I'm not going to go back to school\nI had planned on finishing up at FIT I hadn't finished school is the fashion I wanted to yes and I wanted to do women's clothing it's kind of all I kind of ever thought about from you know my grandmother was a seamstress maybe that was embedded in me but\nIt was really my it's what I did on you know I really loved it I Love making clothes I loved\nWatching other designers studying what they did I Love the whole process I was always sketching\nAnd then they did stand up one night and I just thought I think I'm going to go this direction\n[laughter] do you remember any of the material you did that first night\n[laughter] I Do strange I'm sure it was terrible uh I was a stand up in New York I'm for an open Mike and I remember I first of all I hadn't written anything I just kind of got up on state I didn't know that you were supposed to write I mean just oblivious oblivious to any any preparation or [noise]\nAnd they went up on stage and you know I had a big wig on and kind of a very eccentric you know I think it was like a silver\nKind of trench coat dress and\nAnd I remember just starting to talk about being in New York and being so\nTall and and wealthy and having everyone love you so much and I think at first it really through people as um you know it would seem so you get hysterical and narcissistic and I thought oh they're not liking this\nAnd they were harder and I kept complimenting myself more and more but in ways that these were not factual compliments I was saying everything I wasn't\nI had you know Thirteen cents I was not tall I was not fabulous and I'm sought after in New York so I Do remember that feeling of them realizing that I'm making fun of myself I'm not complimenting myself\nAnd then when they started to laugh I just thought oh this is really fun this is really strange and fun and such a tight rope backed of where they didn't like me a minute ago and now I think it's okay and then then I could say anything because they knew it was in\nSerious and I think I pulled somebody up on stage and talked about us being engaged\nAnd he was clearly there with a date [laughter] and I didn't really know how to do jokes are just kind of\nAgain it went on as a character I went on his missed why I never would have gone on his myself but through a character I could\nBe more ridiculous and more bold and brazen and I would not go and just plop down in someone's lap and talk about how much they love me but as this character I could and I just felt a great freedom in that ... would you always dress the way you describe a\n... yeah I was always recognize lately completely ... in a different I was always in a huge wig some very elaborate\nCostume 'em but oh almost club kiddy but not as alternative at that point I was living with a one of my still best friends Brian out what who now is a shoe designer but at the time he was at FIT so he was making all these different clothes so I Would wear you know I Would\nGrab things that he was making for class and we would go out and\nGo do stand up that night and they would throw in one of his like you know we we're living in a swing taper some kind of scuba suit thing and it just seemed so fun it was also much more ridiculous and and fun and I just thought well why not what else do you get to wear like a scuba dress out\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll talk more if you're just joining us my guess is Melissa McCarthy and she stars in a new movie
