{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "[noise] leisure to have you with us on TALK I'm Maria mantel this you're caught my attention when I saw the analysis by university\nOf Maryland sociologist Philip Cohen finding an Eighteen percent drop in the divorce rate nationally from that was neat to two thousand sixteen I think we all knew was going down a that's pretty big drop nationally so the question is what are the factors behind it\nAh Ali in Long Beach says I'm Middle Eastern and divorces ground upon in our culture so I Do think diversity and culture are significant troop contributing factors to the decline in divorce eight six six eight nine three K PCC or the air talk page KP C. C. dot org\nComing up on fresh air with Terry and just a few minutes she talks with Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter Greg Miller about the challenges in investigating Russian efforts to influence the U.S election and twenty sixteen\nThat's coming up fresh air with Terry Gross and Washington Post reporter Greg Miller right here on eighty nine point three KP see see what can I ask you as an air talk listener\nOr looking at the uh rapidly declining divorce rate what do you think are the most important factors are factor behind the drop eight six six\nEight nine three K PCC or the year talk page K. P. C. C. dot org I'm making Sweeney of UCLA\n... what do we know about ah people living together and how much statistically that's risen over the past say decade\nYeah they'll go habitation has been increasing I'm remarkably\nQuickly over the past decade and it's certainly now in normative experience that people will have to have it had\n'em before they married on one thing that's really interesting about that trend though is for a long time in the United states demographers have noted that cohabiting before you marry is associated with an increased risk of divorce itself so cohabitation and potentially\nCould have been causing the increase in divorce rates that we had been seeing in the past um but demographers also recognize that there's great selectivity in who chooses to have it so that perhaps people who um\nWe're kind of felt that they wanted you to try out their relationship for a while they weren't sure it was going to last which is more likely to co habits so there was a little bit of uncertainty about why we saw this association\nBetween go out and go for marriage and an increased divorce rate what's really interesting though is in the more recent data we're seeing that association weakening overtime\nTheir number of reasons studies suggesting that people who for marriage um don't display as large an increased risk of divorce\nDo you have a theory on why that might be\nYou know I think there there are a couple of ideas about it I'm One of the ideas out there has to do with the fact\nThat as cohabitation becomes\nA more common experience it's less selective of care of people who are more likely to divorce or is it becomes the normative experience uh-huh\nLess likely to be a sign that a couple of maybe was either felt like they didn't have the economic resources they needed in place in order to\nMarry an or felt like they weren't sure about their individual relationship that seems to help in a stronger signal potentially or those kinds of things in the past and it is now as it becomes much more common experience where the majority of people will experience cycle habitation before\nAnd I wonder I Wonder how a sexual attitudes effected two I Wonder if in the past\nThat you had people living together\nUm ... because you know for them part of what was driving that a significant factor is is the sexual relationship maybe people don't feel so driven ... as sex being such a large part of that because of norms about sexual activity generally I don't know if that factors in\nThat's a really interesting point you're suggesting that perhaps people would end up living together so that they could have kind of more socially acceptable\nYes ... access to sex that maybe would have been tougher to get\n'em outside of a relationship but now we you know we tender and everything else not difficult to have sex outside of a relationship although realistically that an minard for a long time let's take a left her call auntie in Santa Monica good to have you with us\nAll right thanks very so what's your take on this\nWell I don't know if it takes I just wanted to add to sort of anecdotal um\nThat is that just got done 'em and now I'm Wondering is um the increased cost of living also has a factor because I Know that of two\nDifferent um couples who do they were going through rocky I Want it to divorce and ultimately decided not to divorce because\nThe cost of living they they both um both families have children and they're realizing that\nUm they are now going to have to shoulder the costs of two households and they simply can't afford to do it\nYeah that's such a good point um having I'm really glad that you raised that Steven Martin demographer at the Urban Institute what what are your thoughts on that\nUm I can first of all say\nThat sounds like a good thing to explore although we do not know yet however there is some amount of information that would be supportive of the idea that California is becoming a very difficult place to be a divorced California\nJust 'cause the the cost of rent would be one of the biggest factors making Sweeney quick thought on that\nYeah you know I think it's certainly I mean divorce is expensive there's no question it costs more money to maintain two separate households than one together plus all the immediate costs associated with the divorce so that is certainly a possibility and I know actually Philip Cohen and another study\nHad looked at what happened to divorce trends during the recession and he didn't find the direct evidence um for kind of things like unemployment rates shifting\nUm the divorce rate in the way we might expect but he ... he did have some suggestive evidence that the recession might have delayed divorce\nThe other thing the rising cost of living in general on the rising cost of housing that we all see in California that may also be contributing to this pattern of selectivity in who marries and the first place that we were talking about a minute [noise]\nUh let me share another comment John or role and I said my friends decided not to get married because their girlfriends are able to get more public assistance when they're single with a child\nA so that there's a financial benefit from that you can avoid marriage John ... you're sharing that thought and I want to thank our demographers Megan

investigating Russian interference in the election and connections between the Trump campaign and Russia which out with Washington Post reporter Greg Miller who broke several related stories and shared a Pulitzer this year we'll talk about the stories he broke including one about what she says\nThat was a sort of one of the more fascinating and interesting episodes I've ever lived through as a reporter\nAnd we'll talk about reading in a ... a memo that in an Oval Office meeting between Colombian President Trump from complained about leaks and about a reporter and Miller realize he was that reporter\nThey're talking about heads on ... reporters in jail chasing down sources was unnerving\nOther TV critic David be included considers how Saturday Night live and sixty minutes responded to the Kavanaugh hearings that's on fresh air burst news\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Laurie London President Trump has announced the completion of a new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico\nWe get more now from NPR's Mara Liasson\nRaised a lot of eyebrows in national security circles in Washington even before he became affiliated with Trump he showed up in pictures seated alongside Vladimir putting an at a gala event in Moscow for our T Russian propaganda network\nOr so he already had troubling connections to the Kremlin and and when it was revealed that he had had conversations with the Russian ambassador\nCommensurate right around the same time that the Obama administration was announcing sanctions against Russia I mean it just raised obvious questions what was Flynn telling these people\nSo how did you find out what he was telling them how do you do that\n[laughter] [noise] we were digging it that for quite a long time not getting I'm not making a whole lot of progress\nUm I had gone to a an event or Kislyak was speaking even\nAnd he was speaking he's a physicist by training of all things and he was speaking at a conference in Washington and I showed up and sat down next to sit down next to him and started covering him with questions and\nHe started answering a and sort of caught me off guard he wouldn't tell me what he talked about ... but he uh admitted that he had longstanding relationships with women had many conversations with him\nThe thing that I think one thing to change the dynamic was a column um that David Ignatius a columnist for the Washington Post wrote\nThat just posed these questions we know that Mike Flynn had conversations with the Russian ambassador we know what when those occurred we deserve answers from this new administration about what was said\nAnd that put the white that put the White House under some pressure and it was their answers and they're misleading and dishonest answers that then unleashed the sourcing that we needed to get to the bottom of it did this come to you\nWill see what happens is\nAfter after that Ignatius column you have incoming White House officials including Sean Spicer and vice president Pence going on television and saying we've talked Mike Flynn sanctions were not discussed in those conversations absolutely not nothing to it\nThat's when I'm longstanding sources for reporters at the post started here started to tell us\nNot true not true you guys need to look into this that's not true and it was you know I'm through reporting of my colleagues adamant is Ellen knock ashamed of myself and trying to get out that\nThat we ultimately got nine sources are telling us consistently that Flynn had in fact discuss sanctions with\nChris Rock and in fact it signaled that they could expect some relief from those sanctions when Trump was an office so you know there's a scene in the book that I write about which one of my colleagues at him and says I'm a terrific national security reporter\nIs meeting with the source and he has this certain method about that when he has conversations with sources he'll often bring a piece of paper that will have a list of facts that he wants to check would that source and he's going through that list of the facts and in this case it's about Flynn and Kislyak\nAnd uh at that moment that he gets the first sort of indication from a highly reliable source that the White House position on this\nIs false that Flynn's claims that Pence as claims that Sean Spicer claims need to be scrutinized further that they're not honest and that's what sets in motion is sort of really\nA fervent push on our end to get to the bottom of it\n[noise] see your your team contacts Flynn to say we're publishing this story basically saying that you lied and that you did have phone conversations with the Russian ambassador about lifting sanctions after Trump takes office and then of course denied it and denied it and denied it\nAnd then you had to decide you didn't publish anyways you and your editors had to decide how was that decision made\nWas a sort of one of the more fascinating and interesting episodes I've ever lived through as a reporter\nI'm so when we write stories like this you know basically accusing a very senior government official of not being honest with the public I mean there's a very high bar there uh before you before you can publish something like that you want to have\nEverything locked down and in fact in this case we had a colleague Karen DeYoung who had previously scheduled interview with Flynn in his office in the west wing of the White House and so we huddled with her before she went over she was going to talk to him about foreign policy objectives of the new administration and so forth\nAnd asked her to at the very end of her interview with him raise this question with him on last time to tell him look post is close to publishing stories\nSaying that you did discuss sanctions would Kislyak how to respond\nIn that in that moment he doubles down and tells her no no and he repeats that several times no no no basically did not happen so caring comes out of that meeting and called us and tells us this and we actually hit pause on the storyline that night we were ready to publish that story that night but the\nSort of the the strenuous denial the nature of the denial from him made us think okay we [laughter]\nWe need to double check we need to theirs and we need to hold off and just make shouldn't make double sure that we're right on this that night I'm we talked about it in the post newsroom the next morning I went into a meeting with Marty Baron Cameron bar other senior editors at the Washington Post and laid out our sourcing\nThat's the first time I I ever use the word number nine I laid I said we have nine different sources telling us this is true and and described that sourcing to those editors and came out of that meeting with a green light I mean when when we laid out those details laid out our sourcing and the efforts we had gone to to try to\nTo nail this down I'm Marty Baron and others were were didn't hesitate you know we're going forward with this story we need to tell Mike Flynn what we're doing\nSo that's that's an option another interaction with when that was amazing so we call the White House we say we have the denial we're going to use that on the record we're going forward with the story anyway we're confident our sources and then the White House ...\nComes back to us calls me get through a spokesman calls me and says for the first time\nI'm Mr Flynn is no longer certain that those sanctions were not discussed and that call you can't be sure that the subject didn't come up\nAnd that was just so different from the categorical denial we had gotten I don't know sixteen hours earlier that we knew that we were we knew we were right and that's when we published\n[noise] so when Flynn was forced out of the Trump Administration\n... how did that feel if I Do feel like proud that you'd broken such a consequential story [noise]\nUm do you feel like good like truth has been out and like I really like to know what it feels like that is that wasn't really sure if they're really big thing very very early in the Trump Administration\nAll the all of the above Terry so sure absolutely proud of our of our work proud that we would have been able to accomplish something of such consequences proud that we were um\nYou know especially in this climate where the process is under constant siege an attack that we were able to do work that still mad that that mattered in your head immediate impact all of that\nI mean not that part of it felt great um I mean for me I had I had actually known Flynn for\nFor a long time probably a decade or so had interviewed him many times I'm overseas and at the Pentagon and other positions\nAnd always liked him I took no pleasure in his ouster I'm In his his resignation um and what came next for him I mean that didn't that didn't make me happy but at the same time it just the I yeah I mean I was\nAs a reporter there's there is nothing better than to be able to get to the bottom of a complex story that there are so many people who are trying to prevent you from getting it\nDid you face consequences did you get troll a lot as a result of having an mask this lie\nI mean the ... ... ... ... absolutely so troll the law attacked\nA lot um and that has not really a beta [laughter]\nI mean that that continues now not just for me but for a lot of reporters covering the ... that this really highly politically charged time where we're living through I'm On the other hand we're things happened that had never happened to me as a reporter um several of us started getting\nCards ... actual letters in the in the mail or thanks for readers from far away places um notes on on our even on my doorstep at home I Would walk through the neighborhood and suddenly people would stop me and thank me and\nI mean that was that was felt great too and it was odd it was something I had never experienced\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guess is Washington Post reporter Brad Miller he covers intelligence and national security he's part of the team that shared a Pulitzer this year for national coverage his new book is called The Apprentice Trump Russia and assume version of American democracy\nMiller has broken several stories about Russian interference in the election and connections between the Trump campaign and Russia\nThis year he shared a Pulitzer Prize for national reporting when we left off he told us that when you ask Republican congressman Devin Nunes as chair of the house intelligence committee about connections between Russia and the Trump campaign Nunez responded that it was a dead trail no connection\nYou've talked about how Devin Nunes has the chair of the house intelligence committee through sand in your face by basically\nDenying maybe lying about any connections between the Trump Administration and Russia and Russian interference in the election the question comes up why didn't we know more\nAbout Russian interference before the election because the Obama administration knew about it the intelligence agencies they weren't on the what was happening and the intelligence agencies\nStrongly felt that Russia intended not just a mess with that but to discredit Hillary Clinton [noise]\nThere was a lot of Republican opposition to making any of this public and a lot of that opposition came from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell can you describe the wage he tried to prevent anything from going public about Russian interference\nThere is a long gap between when the U.S government through its intelligence services learns what Russia's doing and when the public finally learn about it a and there's a lot of second guessing even now about why the Obama administration didn't tell the public more or earlier\nThere are scenes in the book I write about in late August or the early August timeframe late July timeframe John Brennan who was CIA director at the time becoming increasingly concerned about what was happening the WikiLeaks dump it already occurred\nHe sort of holes himself up inside his office at CIA headquarters on the seventh floor for two straight days deep into the night each day poring over all of the agencies Russian intelligence at the end of this exercise\nHe's just convinced that Russia and he has any sitting on a new intelligence in fact that tells him that the Kremlin is playing a bigger game here than anybody has to that point realized that they're not just in it to try to disrupt the\nBut they are trying to help elect Trump and damage Hillary Clinton and he calls the White House that week calls them in early August I Need to get in to see the president\nAfter his meeting with Obama\nThe game plan involves brand and then trying to reach out to congressional leadership this is sort of an all hands on deck moment for the U.S government they want to make sure the leadership in Congress is aware of what's happening in the election to Brennan starts calling\nYou know the Senate and house leadership that committed the leadership of the committee to relevant committees and so forth and setting up one\nOn one briefings with these people\nAnd uh that's really unusual for CIA director to do and he finds you know that the Democrats are lining up at his door that to to me and learn about what's happening Republicans are putting them off\nIn fact he doesn't even get to talk to some of the senior Republicans and tell almost a month later this sort of the August recess timeframe but nevertheless as I you know an alarming development that some Republicans are showing very little interest in\n'em he finally gets into a conversation a private meeting with Mitch McConnell and we write about this and the book and burning feels like he's coming to these leaders would\nFrightening information overwhelming information solid intelligence that shows that Russia has this objective they're trying to screw in our screw up the election and try to install Donald Trump\nAnd then he ends up in a shouting match with McConnell because McConnell's reaction is something he just Brennan fails to anticipate is deeply troubled by McConnell is saying well if you basically tells him\nIf you come forward this administration comes forward and accuses rush of trying to help and help elect Donald Trump\nI Will consider that interference in the election and I will I Will call the administration out on that I Will accused the administration of trying to interfere in the election I mean it's astonishing here's the Senate majority leader\nBeing told that Russia's interfering in the election and he's saying I'm not willing to issue any kind of statement or take any action that would let the public know that but I Will accuse you of interfering election\n[noise] you you right who had weaponized intelligence McConnell and the GOP weaponized denial\nYeah because they the because of their refusal to sign on to even any kind of a public statement that would\nUh explicitly say Russia's interfering in this election Russia is trying to tilt the outcome of this election the Obama team felt sort of\nHandcuffed I'm now ... you could argue that they that they really weren't in that they had lots of ways they could have come forward and talk publicly about it\nBut the Obama administration is hoping to do this in a bipartisan way and so determined to do it in a bipartisan way that when newness and McConnell and others refused to go along they're sort of stuck\nThey can't see a way past that it takes them months to figure out a way to get a statement out did even then only glancing Lee gets at the idea that Russia's interfering in the election with a certain purpose\n[noise] you know when Mitch McConnell finally agreed to releasing a joint statement of Democrats and Republicans about Russian interference and this was in late September\nI'm with a letter to state election officials from off for leaders of Congress warning of unnamed ... Malik factors that are seeking to use cyberattacks to disrupt the administration of our elections\nAnd an urge states to quote ensure that their network infrastructure is secure it made no mention of Russia\nSo even when McConnell given Einstein's statement there's not only no mention of hurting Hillary Clinton and helping Donald Trump there's no even mentioned of of Russia it's so they are just\nStarting to look packets astonishing look back on that now I'm because given what McConnell and others in government knew at that time that statement is so watered down is to be virtually meaningless [noise] um\nSo so meanwhile John Brennan who's trying to convince McConnell look Russia's interfering in the election and McConnell are saying oh yeah if you say that public again going to say you're interfering in the election so Brennan recently lost his security clearance\nAnd McConnell is still the Senate majority leader I'm I'm Wondering and I don't know um\nI don't know if you can imagine this at all\nBut if it can be proven that McConnell knew that Russia was trying to interfere in our election and influence the outcome of it\nAnd then tried to cover it up to deny that it was happening is that treason is that like legally treason\nI don't want to use words like treason [noise] um but I write about many cases that are really distressing um that tell us that we're in a different political earlier than anything we've that we've seen in this country for a long time\nUm where political imperatives where loyalty to party or party considerations\nSeemed to overwhelm everything else including\nThe ... concern for the country and its in its core institutions I mean what's more Coors than\nAn election and the ... election for president of the United states\nWhat is more deserving of protection um and putting above all party considerations than that and yet we see numerous cases through this period in which um when senior officials learn about this and I think Mitch McConnell is one of them\nTheir impulse is to protect the party interests to try to protect the prospect of the Trump victory over the sanctity of the election itself I mean it's it's um it's a troubling thing and it didn't always it wasn't always this way\n[noise] let me re introduce you here if you're just joining us my guest is Greg Miller he covers national security and intelligence for the Washington Post now he has a new book called The Apprentice Trump Russia and some version of American democracy and they take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air\nAnd one year ago a gunman opened fire on a music festival in Las Vegas and you'll see the eight people and wounded hundreds more we'll hear from one survivor who helped others confront the aftermath today on all things considered an eighty nine point three K.
