know their main focus is to make sure it's a great game yeah but when we talk about me recording studio whatever I'm the executive producer regarding\nThe music the music itself yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah who who all Timothy decides this is the music\nWe're going to use well the one of the producers is my main contact that's the same procedure for every game and as soon as we establish some sort of\nHappiness if if I could you know if they're concerned with the material they're getting from me I always want to have the final say always want to feel free so I say you're going to get something like this right but it's going to be better\nSo you basically they they all old Ki ay direction and then you're free to yeah to go with it I mean that's very that's the law freedom\nIt is and I'm not sure that's like normal procedure but that's how I've done it and I haven't asked questions\nMusic such a difficult thing to talk about it or if you're not a musician a year or juice or or a director and you meet somebody that you can create a language that you can both understand about music yeah than your rocket\nReally that's what that's like really really tough yes some producers game producers know some about music some have a big interest and are very interested in no you know they might even play guitar or something and you know the vocabulary\nBut some have no clue whatsoever
