{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "It's one of the reasons that I Try to speak up more for some of it because uh I think everyone should have influenced including the president of the United states\nI think his tone has changed some I think some of his policies some of the things that have been enacted had been very good for the country but I think that's something that he specifically has to work on himself and I'm not afraid to say that\nI see what about you does that how does that sit with you what chat just said yeah [noise]\nWell [noise] um chat and I definitely have differences [laughter] I\nAnd he um we talk about that quite a\nBit I Do not obviously support President Trump because\nAs I told you I'm I'm blue and progressive he's a I don't support his policies and I don't support what I see as his moral shortcomings um I don't know the cat would go so far as to say that his incivility is a more shortcoming but I that's what how I feel about it so\nChat and I have many very civil discussions and we are very different when we come down on on very different sides on on a lot of\nWhat makes what helps you to do that is it because you both live here and you're going to see each other at the grocery store or is it now has you just like each other now or I've\nI've never run into him at the gross [laughter] how to do that\nBecause we both have a commitment to listening and when we sit down at the table with each other we come with an open mind really wanting to know what the other person thinks about\nAn issue and not trying to win the argument\nWe know that we're not going to change each other's opinions on anything and that's not our goal\nOur goal is really curiosity and open heart what\nAdvice does each of you have for people as we head into the home stretch of this election year\nMy first advise people would be vote I think we need to come to realize that we have started thinking of politics as\nWin lose or life in general as when lose that I have to beat you to to do well and actually where we have had the most progressive in civilization is when we learn to work together to everyone's benefit\nI Wonder if this work that you're doing here has special residents in part because you are in Gettysburg which was the scene of so much carnage\nEarlier in our history and does that in a way provided a counterpoint when you when you think about how many lost their lives here in this country was pulled apart and you're thinking well okay what what what do you think\nIt could be I grew up in the south and three of my great uncles fault and the war two of them died\nAnd I wonder when they came from not knowing whether the house was still the one came home not knowing the house was still stand it I Wonder if they looked at all that had happened\nAnd I remember that Lincoln had tried to offer an out to free the slaves buying them back once stayed at a time as was done in many Latin American countries and I thought good grief where we nuts too which\nI think that when when we think about the fact that we're meeting at\nThe church called the prince of peace which was billed as a memorial of reconciliation between the north and south after the civil war I think that that says a lot about what our community stands for and work that we're trying to do\nChad does it have some special meaning for you that this work is taking place in Gettysburg on the way you were born and raised but does it provided a bit of residence for the work you're trying to accomplish\nI often refer to myself as a rebel in Yankee territory and I say that you know tongue and cheek but uh it it certainly does make a difference and I've said you know enough in talking was car endorsed you know said if we can't talk about civility in Gettysburg and work and\nAnd so um I happen to carry around often times the civil war ... with me because that reminds me\nThat it wasn't just about political strategies it was about the bullets that tore through the the the blood bone and flash of fellow Americans and\nI'm also also\nAfraid to say and have confirmed this for many people that if we don't focus more on civility in this day in time we're moving closer and closer toward another civil war if we're not careful\nSome of the headlines that we see across the country I'm In a lot of it depends on whether you focus on the positives or focus on the negatives but there are a lot of\nReally bad stories across the country and that's why it's been encouraging to be a part of this group and to kind of resonates the message of civility because it is very very important especially in this day\nWe have a chance to make a huge difference and if we don't take that opportunity than we really miss though\n... when I was ... colleague Darcy Myers and car Thompson they are members of the group politics bats and civility we met up with them at prince of peace of fiscal church in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania\nMm

celebrate\n\nYou haven't\nGot to be having a chance to warm up here to the jump right in there I mean we never been on a panel together really well yeah I don't know if either of you know I don't\nThe thing that they call inoculation which is basically exposing in a controlled does this opposition message which they know it's really likely that that this voter could encounter you know on Facebook or when they're watching the news\nAnd what they want to do is administer this opposition message in a controlled environment where the voter\nIsn't alone where they're not seeing a bunch of other comments on Facebook they can encounter this with somebody there to walk them through it and help pulled them back\nFrom the brink it's a lot like getting a flu vaccine or where your body gets a tiny

did you think about that is raising concerns for you [noise]\nThing [noise]\n... [noise] I haven't heard\nYoung people are [noise] our name on everything and then you just cannot check [laughter]\nI hear what you're saying you're sort of saying that um\nPeople should have their own place to go just so they they can kind of be spared from\nPeople who might have a problem with it [noise]\nYeah I think she's right now the you know they don't have oh right\nI think things like that [noise]\nThen gets upset\nWhatever\nUm that's that's really interesting um perspective I mean I don't think I've heard it said that way before that it makes a lot of sense and a lot of ways [noise] doing this complicated at it\nI think is that there are a lot of transgender people who you wouldn't know or transgender walking down the street you know what I mean I think it's a little dicey where you draw the line you know what I mean ... started\nThis conversation you know was really she was confused at first about the wording that question\nBut that was like oh yeah I'd vote yes I support equal rights for everybody it's sort of a thing everybody kind of agree on and then you suddenly introduce this idea that this could allow sex offenders and criminals to take advantage of this week law\nAnd put her grandkids at risk and then she suddenly starts to weigh a bunch of things on one hand she says she used to be a nurse and she would have never turned away a transgender person at the same time she's like\nEver since I was a little kid I went to Catholic school and like there were boys' rooms and girls and women and that's just like how the world has worked\nAll along when the campus or D left Beatrice his house what was the net net\nOf the conversation so at the end he has asked the same question she asked at the beginning how are you\nGonna vote on this when our ah our ... on the ballot will you vote yes to keep these protections or vote no to repeal [noise]\nSo yeah I mean do you say definitely yes are probably a [noise]\nBrand I think you [noise]\nWhen she was saying about having um different restaurants are transgender people like the words like separate but equal ferocity\nOf my head and that's not necessarily the right argument to bring to her because it's\nYou know we don't want to be too confrontational over doing this work um\n'cause we can't we can't bring somebody all the way but she was somebody she she was she was a nice lady definitely a good conversation\nKnow I left feeling a little more skeptical some conversations I definitely felt certain I was like you have to sort of binoculars an idea has happened but I think a lot of\nTimes it can be messy and you leave people\nWith like a storm of ideas that maybe aren't completely resolved and some of it like you're not going to resolve and a ten or Fifteen minute conversation with a stranger out your door and maybe it planted a seed and now is Beatrice Jesus in the news these in the newspapers he's a commercial like this show understand the context which it exists but it's also possible that she'll never really think of this again\nNo this is all interesting bit of a political science and campaign strategy speculation at the moment but it's also something particularly of the moment\nThe Trump Administration\nApparently is working on a worked around so that transgender as a category of citizen effectively will cease to be and then therefore any particular protections rendered moved\nDoes that added urgency to the question three campaign\nMy theory going into this and what I heard from people on the ground there is that basically if this loses Massachusetts anti trends activists all over the country can go around and they can say if liberal Massachusetts doesn't want these protections why should we have them in Wyoming or West Virginia or anywhere that they've come up for debate\nSo far as the mainstream even for the People's Republic of Massachusetts exactly\nI think the other thing is that it took a long time for the gay rights movement to get to a point where they had majority support it can be really hard to get a majority of people to vote for minority especially if they don't know them or if they don't understand them\nThe trends community is so much smaller than the gay and lesbian community I think it can be even harder to move the needle so if a strategy like this inoculation thing works or at least shows us a new angle that that might be able to be taking it\nAnd the ... movement it's promising I don't know that it might work as well on an issue like abortion that a lot of people have fought a lot about and made up their minds I think that's where the research wants to see where you can continue this right now I think it works on something that people haven't actually given a lot during the
