Mason the Nineteen Seventy six version paired Barbra Streisand and Chris christopherson\nFilm critic David Edelstein has a review of the new star is born\nThe first thing you'll notice in Bradley Cooper his crowd pleasing remake of a star is born is that lady Gaga the artist who rose to fame with off on guard stunts and from refusal to do anything natural anything that didn't smack of artifice

at least to join him on stage which he does reluctantly it's one of those scenes in which the musicians don't know the song but as they play along they get it\nHey this is good well alley melts the hearts of everyone on her\nYes the performance goes viral\nEven if you normally roll your eyes at stuff like this it's hard to resist the camera is handheld and mostly at I live with the characters breathless ... than intimate than worship ...\nThere's a reason that a star is born has been made four times it's a Cinderella story in which the prince\nValidates everything good about an impoverished young woman he makes or a princess and then garish Lee self destruct before her horrified eyes a rescue fantasy Adam masochistic wallow in one neat package\nI Can't imagine how the first half of this a star is born could be much better it's so good it will carry people through the second test which has great scenes but the usual mushy arc\nCooper and it's co screenwriters haven't we thought the material for twenty two in age in which celebrity apparatus involves making stars in their personal lives seem closer to us via Twitter and Instagram\nWonder rip Kilian brick becomes

Oscars or Grammys in this case the Grammys this one tops them all in the humiliation department it's excruciating\nTowards the end of the movie I heard sniffles and knows is being blown all over the theater man this material is shameless and man does it work whatever its lapses a star is born will be a monster hit audiences will love Cooper for his tender suffering on screen\nAnd for showing us the soul that was always there beneath Lady Gaga is outrageous costumes they'll want to see ... at the Oscars as much as fans in the movie wanna see alley at the Grammys\nDavid Edelstein is film
