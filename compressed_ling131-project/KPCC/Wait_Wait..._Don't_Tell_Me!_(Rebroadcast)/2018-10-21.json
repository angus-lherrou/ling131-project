{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "I found it very little echo out there are very difficult time getting people interested in those ah who didn't have anything directly to do with it it was very much reminded me very much of the early days of the AIDS epidemic everyone wanted to hide it didn't want to confront it you know and and and I I think what's happened is that this is\nA been left to fester and quickly all across this country now and I were critical mass was reached a at a certain point so now it's become come out of the shadows but\nBut it's definitely a a a problem that has not been recognized to the extent that it ought to consider how widespread how deadly um uh it's been ... and\n... I I Know that you feel that there's a conversation about race that needs to happen when it comes to the way we view\nBoth the epidemic itself and the way drug abuse drug use the drug crisis is treated 'em both in the the I guess what the news media and also an entertainment we talk about what you think about that\nYeah you know it's fascinating to me that this is a quote unquote sound epidemic that this is something which could have touched one of four people and uh and yet nevertheless not be blaring across the headlines with kind of urgency that we have historically associated with\nA drug drug issues in say the inner city right the the crack epidemic of\nAh the eighties and so on so forth and I I think it actually it it informs the tonality of how popular culture\nLooks at drugs I think even in this episode we see a very strong empathy with Roseanne the apps and Roseanne and her family this is really about talking about victims about people who suffered an illness or in in vanished because of that or or been harmed because of that but when we seen\nOr other kinds of depictions of of addiction and of of drug use and abuse and dealership\nOr among black communities and Hispanic comedians invariably about the predatory influence of the drug trade it's about the empowerment of drug dealers and how it you know that sort of invasive force harms not just black and Hispanic communities but of course that Jason White ones as well\nAnd that I think that's a little bit of a problem and how this is talk about the site but say you know I wanted\nTo ask you I Know you feel that this is the the quiet crisis as the as you have\nDescribed it as part of me wonders whether it's because it's in part it started out as a rural crisis and the rural communities particularly the rural media for example it's been has been hollowed out in the way that say local newspapers have been hollowed out and it just that is that part is that uh\nI Would say that's probably part of it I Would say to that that the people involved you know I'm a member of the medium or working reporter for many years and and ah and if you and if if the people who are most affected actively don't want to talk about it if the obituaries that they write our purposely\nI'm a obfuscating or actual fabrications if you can't find those people are willing to talk\nIt is very difficult to to bring it to\nTo light and that is really what is happening all across the district you start seeing starts in Appalachia the rust belt areas spreads now of course I think really is the biggest place you find it really is in the suburbs uh\nUm mostly among white people I'd say Ninety five Ninety plus percent um bobbing white people but I Would say that there's a lot of those folks\nAre just as some horror that they never imagined happening to their families on so\nAre they are very very willing to have been I Would say until until the last three years or ... I'm a unwilling to talk about it when you don't have\nPeople who are most affected I Know it was a media number of the media if you don't have those people most able to tell the poignant story you ... it's very hard to get traction on it and also if you don't have\nThe kind of a I covered the crack epidemic that was my first job as a reporter uh and journalism many years ago when the child Stockton, California I could tell you the the you could not avoid the crack epidemic not because so much with the drug\nUh but but because of the ... the gang involvement to the drive by shootings bullets so a crippling young young children\nUm I mean that was it was impossible to avoid the crack epidemic in this one you've seen overdoses sky rocket really as crime rates all across the country have really dropped precipitously and that's that's also a new thing about this up\nAnd down there but you point about obituaries it's one of the other interesting stories this week it was just a an obituary about a young woman\nA you know such a cliche went viral but it did in part because her family was so explicit about what happened to her and it was very much\nA cry of heart you know to people saying you know educate yourself about this just before he got like you know we have about a minute left I'd like to ask you as our culture got what would you like to see what would you like to see\nA as a ... in in terms of how we address this issue for from a standpoint of our art because anytime you know the Hollywood or the artistic any take something on people always accuse them of\nI Am a rising it or not really telling it on the other hand you know so what would you like to see in the minute we have a\nI mean I I think it's really interesting that uh the two shows that we perhaps most associate with depictions of the drug trade a over our our our generation a Breaking Bad is one and and the wire is the other right and they're they're both shows that are incredible shows you know really great storytelling\nBut the Breaking Bad almost has a sort of\nBlack it has black comic strips ... to it ah that\nBrings a different energy to the thought about you know what that crisis represent about human beings within it and not about an infrastructure system a phenomenon or something right\nI I feel like a lot of times we don't see that that more human individual prospect of when you talk about you know drug issues in in communities and I guess I'd like to see more of that more capture more humanity\nThat shift Yankees uh CNN contributor and Wall Street journal online columnist joining us from NPR West in Los Angeles in Culver City Simpson units is the author of dreamland the true tale of America's opiate epidemic and he's joined us he joined us by a sky thank you both so much for talking to Becky ...

that statue\nUm did did they remove his hat did not remove his hat or the added something they\nEach other and laughing at each other's jokes [noise]\nThe book I show that to my students every semester and I love it and to me that video captures the evolution of the twin bond and the so called twin language those kids are hysterical and they know what's funny and yet we don't\nBut I Will tell you that I spoke to him other ones who had an older child and twins and she said that the older child can often act as a translator telling her what the twins are up to and I thought isn't that interesting maybe a linguist could use those older siblings as research assistants to find out what's going on [noise]\nSo what about the depiction of twins culturally identically dressed twin toddlers means ally does some twins like the ones in the shining terrify us\nThere are lots of twins and mythology twins is God's evil twins and so on why does the idea of twins so consistently captain made us\nIn the arts in mythology in movies and literature twins are very convenient devices for exploring duality good and evil happy and sad now why is the public so when chatted with twins I think it's because we all\nGrew up believing and rightfully so that we're all individuals that we looked different we behave differently I think that when we encounter to people who look and act so much alike it challenges the way we think that the world works and\nMany of us admire and even envy the intimacy that identical twins convey their so accepting of one another so nonjudgmental and who among us would want to enjoy your relations with that kind\nSo for some people seeing identical twins my almost seem claustrophobic too much togetherness but on the other hand there are still intrigued by it so I think that's why we are so captivated\nWhich brings us back to that documentary three identical strangers for a minute there is one doctor who had some involvement with the study but the triplets were unwittingly engaged in and she said this [noise]\nWe would prefer that we have some influence over our lives\nIn Toronto known not to have some control and so finding on I'm On line [noise]\nHaving to be [noise] to see how they how little control now we don't like the Wi Fi genes don't\nTell us what to do they may predispose us in certain ways but ultimately we make the choice to do something we know that divorce has a genetic component to it but we can choose to stay with a partner or divorce we have a lot of control over our lives is just the genes may guide us in certain sorts of directions\nI think a great example of that is a pair of twins we studied in Minnesota named Jack an Oscar they're born in Nineteen thirty three jak was raised Jewish by his father in Trinidad and Oscar was raised Catholic and Nazi Germany with his mother Oscar within the Hitler Youth but he was only twelve in the war ended\nThese too of course had very different political and historical understandings but they both cope with the situations in similar ways jak by becoming very pro British in Trinidad because he didn't want people to know of his German background and Oscar becoming very pro German because he didn't want people to know if his Jewish background\nAnd when they met they spoke to one another and realize that had their positions been reversed they both would have embraced a point of view that they currently disliked so the context in which we find ourselves certainly can make a difference\nBut we can choose or not choose a certain perspective or a certain way of looking at things\nYou hurt me refer couple of times to nature versus nurture oh yeah I Do things to things separate and in ... yeah that is really reductive right\nYes in fact I should have probably caused you on that we never really say nature versus nurture that's a false dichotomy that was put to rest years ago what we talked about is nature and nurture nature via nurture\nNature and nurture is a nice conceptualization of that because if you think about how you put your house together or the occupations you have or how your environment is constructed UC genetic influence on your environment you know you choose to put certain paintings on the wall you choose certain outfits you choose a certain design of your home\nWhy do you do that because they are pleasing to you in some way in an individual nature and nurture are completely intertwined cannot be separated\nWe separate them only statistically in in the population and that can give us a good handle on what somebody's chance of having Alzheimer's or diabetes or something like that might be but it's not totally determine mystic we know for example that autism has a high genetic component we know that from twin studies on the order about Seventy percent\nBut given twin pair if you've won affect the child the other one maybe never ever affected by autism so you can't generalize from the population to the individual you can only do this as a very rough guide\n[noise] so you have a fraternal twins do you ever wish you had an identical [laughter]\nYou know I thought about that sometimes I never want to give up my fraternal twin but I think\nMore that I Wish we were triplets and there was a fraternal as an identical I think it'd be kind of fun I Am fascinated by identical twins and they had them to see that they share and the similarities that they display so I've often wondered what it would be like but I'm very happy with my situation as it is\nSometimes I Wish I had an evil twin [laughter]
