[noise]\nWhat's missing from mainstream conversations about adoption\nWhat's missing is the voices of adult adoptees like myself and birth mothers that's Rebecca ... is the stories about adopted parents who have had to go through various ordeal to adopt their children are raped them\nThat centered on the conversation on one perspective when they're really three parties involved in every adoption is limiting the public understanding of perception of adoption\nThree parties birth families adoptive families and adoptees\nAdopt these though they grew up mhm their feelings about being adopted\nEveryone expects you to feel grateful but it's more complicated than that everyone expects you to appreciate a good life that you have but you still feel complicated times you know not everything is gone drops leaned those\nThat's Caitlin how she reached out to us for this episode so I called her up to interview her she lives in Eugene Oregon where she works for Holt International children's services which was founded in Nineteen fifty six and it's the same agency that our parents used to adopt her almost Thirty years ago\nI Am a Korean adoptee and I work in the post adoption services department of the agency a it's a brand new position it's really kind of a new innovative direction that we're moving to include adoptees in programming for adoptees what\nHave you done specifically to you know address these issues that you're talking about these issues that adoptees and brought up to us that feeling isolated feeling like they never had a real chance to get in touch with their birth culture or what have you been doing in your job to make\nThese adoptees feel like they're not isolated and they do have a connection to where they are from\nI think what I've actually seen sharing is that it's not\nI think that there is this assumption that the longing is four verse culture but a lot of the times it's a longing for like deep connection to people that are like you\nSo I think that that happens in a couple of ways do the work that um I've done one is that we have adopted camp they started out as heritage camps that focused on Korean culture [noise] um but the realization happen that their adoptees from all over the world now in the U.S\nAnd so uh we do something called cabin talk so there's a topic of the day and I remember the first year that I was a cowboy for we're sitting around and there is domestic adoptees in their ways adoptees from China Korea Ethiopia\nAnd we're all sitting around and everyone was just sharing their birth story and for us for stories are pretty traumatic stories you know for one girl it's like all I Know about my birthday as I was abandoned in front of a government building in China like that's\nExtremely traumatic if that's your first known existence but what was amazing about sending circle is we went around the circle and everyone shared something pretty similar to that and so in hearing the stories that adopt he knows that she's not alone in that grief\nThese adoptees who I'm assuming they're all youth right that are going to just yep okay yeah nine to Seventeen they are just so hungry for a place where there are other kids were the exact situation that they're in and that all almost in in of itself and that is their identity which I feel like we don't talk about yeah I\nAgree I was actually at a conference it was like the Korean adoptees of Chicago to this\nYou will conference that that was the first time in twenty nine years that I've ever sat in a room of entirely create an adult adoptees and it was extremely emotional and I just remember um\nDuring the closing ceremony when as an adult adoptees was on the stage and they made their ... you know you guys are my homeland\nAnd I think that that really hits in the deep inside of me because it is just like we kind of feel or we can have that feeling like\nWe're not really creating for all intents and purposes and we're always recognized as a foreigner in the state so whereas\nWhereas our homeland as adoptees and for a lot of adult adoptees I think they might not any cat very much that's\nCaitlin how she's the adoptee
