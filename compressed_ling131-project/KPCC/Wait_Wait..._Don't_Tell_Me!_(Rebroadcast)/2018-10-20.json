Maria it's all on science friday from WNYC studio\nTonight at midnight here on eighty nine point three KP see see\nThis is fresh air our film critic Justin Chang has a review of the new movie can you ever forgive me\nIt's adapted from a memoir by Lee Israel in New York writer who in the early Nineteen nineties began forging litters attributed to literary luminaries including Dorothy Parker in Norfolk Howard and selling them to unsuspecting collectors\nMelissa McCarthy plays Israel and the movie which co stars Richard II grant and it's directed by Mary Elle Heller here's Justin's review\nCan you ever forgive me it's a rare Jim a sweet movie about a mean person in which the sweetness and the meanness don't cancel each other out it reminds us that in the right hands a missing throat can make positively joyous company especially if you have the good fortune to be played by Melissa McCarthy\nAs Lee Israel a struggling biographer turned literary con artist McCarthy gets more expressive nuances out\nOf an angry scale than I'd ever thought any actor could manage\nWhen we first meet Lee in Nineteen Ninety One she's being fired from an office job for cursing and drinking leaving her unable to pay the rent on her cluttered Manhattan apartment or her cats medical bills\nHer writing career has stalled and her agent played by a snappy Jane Curtain tells her that no one is interested in her or the new family Bryce biography she's working on\nDesperate for money leaf sells off a framed thank you letter she wants to receive from Catherine Hepburn and learns that there is a real market for celebrity correspondence but this year the better\nAnd so begins her criminal career she uses her old school typewriter to forge letters by the likes of Dorothy Parker and William Helmand then sells them to a used book stores for a few hundred bucks a pop\nThe movie's attention to process is fascinating we see her practicing Norfolk Howard signature and baking her letters in the oven so the paper will look yellow with age\nBut the real work using the writing and lead takes genuine pride in it channeling her flair for words into inspired feats of mimicry she becomes a fraud and an artist at the same time\nEvery risk their needs an accomplice and leaves as a man named Jack hawk played by ed role and delicious Lee funny Richard II grabbed\nJak as a drifter with little money and no permanent address just some street smarts and plenty of hustle and he quickly latches onto Lee after running into her at a bar one evening\nLast time I saw you know we were both presently pissed some horrible the cost of our eyes [noise] slowly flooding back to me [noise] friends with them\n... yeah [noise] ... any more she died she did she said she I'm maybe she didn't die maybe she just moved back to the suburbs\nWho's confused as to that that's why she called my eyes and I had twins that is you have died in the [noise]\nI just come from my teeth breached\nHis teeth are dead giveaway [noise]\nTo buy you drink you know you are the pusher I think you\nCan you ever forgive me becomes among other things in a survey Valentine to nineties New York a world of bars and bookstores crammed with people who deploy the English language with ... wit and style\nThe facts that Leon jak are both gay quietly underlines their status as outsiders\nAt one point lead has caught off guard by the gently romantic overtures of a bookseller nicely played by Dolly Wells and we see just how ill accustomed she is to receiving human kindness much less responding unkind\nDespite the turning to bleaker more downbeat territory can you ever forgive me feels like the movie Melissa McCarthy has been working toward her entire career\nAs we've seen from her performances and spy and bridesmaids she has always been a splendid comedian and the genius of mad cap improvisation but the lows that have doubted her uneven body of work have made it clear that even a dynamite actress needs a sharp script and a good director to soar\nShe gets both those things here the director is Mary Elle Heller who tackles this character portrait with the same clear I touch that distinguished her twenty Fifteen filmmaking debut the\nDiary of a teenage girl the screenplay as buying the whole whole center in excellent director herself and Jeff witty they've written a terrific script about the rewards an ad in the east of being a writer\nYou might think that we Israel a professional crank who prefers cats to people is a character only of critics could love believe cranking is is genuinely captivating in part because it's so uncompromising\nHer talent as a writer goes hand in hand with the harsh jaundiced way she sees the world\nThe title can you ever forgive me which comes from one of those fake Dorothy Parker letters is clearly meant to be read sarcastically we Israel didn't need redemption she needed a chance to let her talent speak for itself even if it meant speaking through an other writers mouth\nBut Israel got her due in two thousand eight six years before her death she wrote about her criminal misadventures in a book that the New York times hailed as pretty damn fabulous the same can be said of this movie\nJustin ... is a film critic at the LA Times on Monday showed Melissa McCarthy who stars in can you ever forgive me we'll talk about growing up on a farm her early
