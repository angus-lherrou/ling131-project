that they have safe for better policing and we feel that they're they're smart ways we can negotiate that and I think\nYou know because reform is so big in in in my mind and heart\nWe were advised in our candidates to run exclusively on\nA reform only message and what we found is that really resonates deeply with about thirty percent of the people who turn out and those dirty they may be the loudest most vocal people who come out but you can't you can't win with reform only\nIn Washington there seems to actually be believing are hot consensus around the issue of sentencing reform if you can do reform\nAt the federal level which is incredibly polarized can't we have a conversation about district attorneys at the local level that can bring the sides together and bridge the divide is that is that possible\nAll conversations about criminal justice reform by necessity should be bipartisan or or you know there's a way to do it even in a non partisan way which is difficult you can try it but it has to function somehow above partisanship first and foremost\nDemocrats and Republicans built this horrible system together it is one of the most bipartisan efforts in modern American history where Democrats and Republicans came together saw eye to eye on the local state and national level\nAnd they built this monster of mass incarceration together and so it's\nA misunderstanding of the problem it it can be easy or convenient if you are a Democrat to blame the state of mass incarceration on Donald Trump and he is he is often he has been horrible on issues of criminal justice reform\nThe loan swath of his life but he didn't build this system the system was built before he ever took office and Republicans alone didn't build that in fact in many cities and counties and states and on on the federal level Democrats often were the primary voices\nCampaigning for and building this horrible system and so\nIf Democrats and Republicans built it together it's going to take Democrats and Republicans to dismantle it and fix it together\nNow here's where partisanship gets in the way and it's and it's really complex\nRight now because we are at each other's throat on really essential issues where we deeply deeply disagree and because like in some ways right now it is hard for Democrats and Republicans\nTo even be in the same room with each other because we're so angry over very legitimate disagreements that we have this issue that typically Democrats and Republicans agree on that we need reform with\nEvery poll will show you that Seventy five to as high as Ninety percent of Americans want criminal justice reform and that crosses both parties it crosses all aisles all age groups all demographics\nYet because we are in a hyper partisan environment\nThere is this real temptation for people to say\nThere is no way in hell I'm going to work with Donald Trump or I'm going to work with Republicans on this issue I don't trust them I don't believe them they're not sincere and because of that\nA lot of really good people are saying listen I I I'm not participating in this process but here's the thing criminal justice reform\nCan't be put off in four or eight year increments while we hope and wait for a Democrat or someone else to be elected because right now people are suffering in the system and so city by city state by state\nThere are opportunities I'm In Georgia today and in Georgia there are so many opportunities for Republicans and Democrats to come together and in fact Stacey Abrams has worked well with the current incumbent governor who's a lifelong Republican on criminal justice reform\nAnd so there are opportunities for for people to come together but in this environment\nWhere all of our nerves are afraid and our relationships are\nRaul and kind of like open wounds it's hard to work together even when we need to\nSean King thank you so much for spending the time with us today yeah thank you John King is cofounder of real

nominee Brett Kavanaugh colon says Christine Blasey Ford's testimony that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers was compelling but should not keep the judge off the bench there are some who\nVivian I what we've mentioned this on the program before ... it's almost feels like it was meant to be seen like some of this was meant to be noticed it if it feels very godfather to me like when when there's a hit you don't clean up the blood you want people to see that something happened and no we did this and we can do worse\nWell and and this is the tactic that the Russians have the time and time again where they like to leave by comes hum when they do these kinds of attacks and especially in the cyber realm where it might be a little bit harder to to\nTo detect exactly the source of an attack you really could be completely anonymous and ... and a lot of these cases if you wanted to be but the Russians like to kind of mark their territory and say you know it's kind of send a message to the world and say we have the ability to do this and\nEssentially put everyone on notice and on guard and so that's exactly exactly what they've done not just to the U.S but around the world\nAnd just to clarify that title sorry Scott Brady the U.S attorney for the western district to Pennsylvania sorry about that David you wanted to jump back yeah just a interesting observation I think on on a ... point here which is\nDoing these indictments against people who will never see in us courtrooms publishing their photographs as ah the British and the Dutch did is based on an assumption that there is a deterrent effect in embarrassing the Russians by revealing what they've been doing\n... exactly right and some of this is meant to show your power\nIt's not clear to me that Vladimir Putin is embarrass ... here in fact he made a like the additional publicity that comes from this considering that there are no real penalties to him a vein for their guys got thrown out of of\nUh you know Amsterdam after being caught thirty minutes into their operation um\nWhat does that tell you it tells you that we still have not figured out the core issues of how to deter cyber attacks and the old assumptions that doing it in secret is the goal is wrong and you know there was a moment when after President Trump\nMet Vladimir prudent in um ... a year ago and I I work count this and the perfect weapon he came out of that meeting and he called me from air force one to make the point that flattering prudent had told him the Russians are so good at cyber\nThat if they had done the DNC hack they never would have been caught\nIn the ... ... ... and argue old Donald Trump that that that were so good at what we do that if we had done the DNC hack you never want to know you never would have seen us and the president called\nYou to tell you that to tell me this end to end the he's since made this argument in public uh many times and he called me to say so that sounds about right and I said well you know Mr President I don't think that was the intent of this hack they published the emails of the dmc they published John Podesta as emails they meant to be seen\nOr did not already and you're actually how mountain and push back on the notion that the Russians were behind that he kinda cats that well maybe it was a patriotic Russian he's dead and wasn't actually and government officials that he was sort of jump around and keep you guessing\nI wouldn't have including I'm Talking about that and of course is that is the source of the attack and all\nAnd that the the motivation behind and the president\n... complied with that and when a vice president Pence went out and gave a speech yesterday about Chinese influence you didn't hear Russia mentioned other than to say the Chinese are worse\nI Do want to get into what the vice president said in just a little bit but with great contrast that well we just heard about the president was what we heard from Britain's foreign minister Jeremy hot basically saying you know hey Russia who are you trying to kid\n... evidence of the Russian ministry tried to conduct a cyber attack on the very international organization whose job it was to look into those ... attacks and why would you do that if you are guilty policy\nThat was Britain's foreign minister Jeremy ... spokeswoman for Russia's foreign ministry Mario ... dismissed the allegations as a quote delusional and diabolical perfume bland unquote uh I'm not sure I find that but I Love the image\nIt there yet Kelly we don't get that a lot it's Florida what we're seeing is it in ... a release of of remarkable detail the intelligence agencies of western countries the Dutch the British the Americans\nAre releasing details that we would never before see a passport numbers middle names of the people doing this all you know putting this out so it's interesting the level of detail which the public ...\nReally has not seen in the past but I think we're still sort of seeing western countries stumped on exactly how do you respond they're showing how much material they have they're naming and shaming but how do you respond beyond that and that's still the question we're wrestling\nWell maybe we can't like maybe that's what this means is that they're they're just is no effective international deterrent for these kind of attacks at least not yet\nThat's a huge issue legally or the international ... who owns the Internet I mean that's kind of that what it boils down to is that nobody really has diction over the Internet and cannot therefore like impose any law legal restrictions as far as what people do and this is something that's argued in the legal community ...\nAlthough I Wonder maybe if there are certain parts of the world that might have a little tighter handle on dealing with just another well we'll talk like censorship yeah maybe aren't well\nWe'll get a little bit more into this as we continue the friday

Michael\nAsks with the loss and result in widespread dissemination of the CIA tool kit which allows one to spoof packing from another country how can cyber bread crumbs lead to certainty that another country is actually guilty David what do you think well\nCyber attribution is something that people are getting a lot better at I'm certainly there are lots of ways to make it appear that a cyber attack came from other places when the New York times was attacked by the Chinese and its computer systems uh years ago it looked like the attack was coming from a University in the southern part of the U.S\nWell I I think it's that is to pick up on David point it's it's pointing to military issues is pointing to political issues is pointing to economic issues it's this full spectrum of a ... of discussion we had an an interesting development this week the Chinese ambassador sway T anti came to NPR and\nOh it was very generous with his time to questions from reporters and gave a lengthy interview\nAnd it was very diplomatic and talking about the difficulty of of reading this president saying that China wants to come to an agreement but but the the president that this administration keeps changing its policy\nIt's always interesting to to get the the Chinese or read on this through the ambassador um and he was very diplomatic most of the way and then there were a few questions where he talked to was asked about ah well why can't a journalist go to bed and he said well\nThen ... and he sort of lost and he sort of said uh well the altitude is too high it would be risky to their health to go there\nSo we're we're seeing a lot more of that this sort of top level discussion and I'm a veteran altitude altitude apparently is a is the problem in Tibet have of keeping journals that it\nMay be and what is your sense of what's behind this I mean you know President Trump and China's president Xi Jinping of had kind of an interesting relationship where you have China this nation that is definitely kind of feeling itself on the world stage and being kind of aggressive in its own\nAnd these two kind of frenemies in President Trump and president Xi that seemed to want to have an amicable relationship but then there's all these these tariffs what do you think might be China's motivation here there is something I think\nTo this idea of dueling tariffs and this idea that two navy vessels can't come within forty five yards of one another unless they mean it that's not a close call like what's\nThat well I mean there's a number of issues and this whole thing we've seen growing since the campaign frankly aware and the president at then\nCandidate Trump you step kids China's currency manipulation and all kinds of other unfair trade practices um he he hadn't really delved into the foreign policy sphere until really gotten into office\nBut obviously North Korea being one of the major\nEfforts for his foreign policy agenda now ah and making progress with Kim Jong un and having you know trying to achieve denuclearization\nThat Korea he really wanted the Chinese on board with him as throughout this process and it really took a long time for him even to be able to achieve um any kind of understanding with the north Koreans um and he was growing very impatient last year asking China repeatedly to try to help in\nBringing North Korea to the table obviously he kept on saying he'd do it on his own he is frequently expresses frustration with President Xi and China and general on a date it's lack of a effort to really uh rain and\nKim jung in in the process instead of you had that element of it but then you also have the economic element of it which is a very legitimate concern for the president especially as we head into the midterms this is\nHe's he's out there campaigning right now this is the biggest kind of when that he brings\nA to these rallies where he says look at this I'm I'm fighting for you I America is winning again and I yeah I'm I'm I'm bringing jobs back and I'm bringing companies back to America and a big issue with for him has always been unfair trade practices with China\nUm and this is something that his administration right now is heavily focused on as a way to try to come to terms with you have these the two largest economies in the world how do we sort of colleagues is no way that we can mutually benefit but in President Trump's mind\nAlso have the Americans come out on top and so this is these are the issues\nSo do the quick little Google Search looks like the highest points [laughter] she's
