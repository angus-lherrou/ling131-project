{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "So many other members of the community this is also going back to your previous segment Jonathan you know in North Carolina when they got rid of\nA early voting right is specific institutional traction in the state of North Carolina because souls to the polls on Sunday was such a successful endeavor for African American men so they were going ... to vote because we do know that because voting is not a national holiday in this country makes it very difficult for people to participate\nAnd President Johnson I've as Pacino was speaking I was thinking about particularly\nI'm African American women in the role they played in helping get Doug Jones basically electing Doug Jones senator ... from from Alabama the role they played in Virginia and helping Ralph Northam be elected\nGovernor and also doing the same thing for Terry McAuliffe for years and four years earlier\nBut it it it especially in the last um with the special elections that we've had over the last uh Eighteen months or so that enthusiasm that knowing that the African American vote was so pivotal in so many key races over the last year is that meeting is that\nBeating enthusiasm among African Americans as you you get your new effort underway\nWhat you do have you we just recently completed upholds this summer\nAnd what we found among African American voters particularly women are filling the being disrespected and as a result of that they're taking those emotions to the polls to demonstrate the power\nOf then double ACP we've invested over the last year heavily in our database system we brought on a data scientist team to really drill down to understand how do we move the needle and sustain the needle\nOr we have ebb and flow of emotional lives um in terms of our community when we react to negative things or we we fight to get the first black elected but in a democracy you know ones that are are voters our currency we need a more systematic approach is built into our everyday activity so the project will watch it as a data driven project\nBe feeding of of the energy of African American women's but understanding that this one election cycle is not enough it was a five year trajectory that we're on to\nMake sure we sustained movement but more importantly mid term election is the low water mark for voting presidential election was a high watermark\nAnd that as a result of a heavy concentration of ad by campaigns I use it now that you that presidential elections like a Coca Cola size\nOr add budget by a mid term elections like RC Cola advise you reminded constantly doing president's election so more people go to vote but to a mid term elections you don't hear about it as often\nAs you would therefore you have a lower voter turnout and so our goal is to do supplement that lack of information understanding unimportant by talking to infrequent voters those individuals who voted on presidential elections\nBut don't folks do a midterm election and using people in the community to go and courage and hold their hands and continue to remind them of the important of the vote\nI also I'm reminded of say the work of higher heights because not only are they trying to get women to come out to vote there are so inspiring and supporting financially or in other ways black\nWomen to actually run for office and so in doing this multi step process you have black women\nAs voters you have black women as donors and you also have black women as candidates so that three pronged approach actually has been increasing black female participation on a host of levels because now you have people who were invested\nEmotionally mentally and also financially in the wellbeing of particular black women from across the country and so as they build this fifty state network\nFrom not just women like Stacey Abrams running for governor of Georgia\nBut we're talking about ... underwent in Illinois running for Congress but also people who are running in lower levels um that are part of this larger network\nIn higher heights I think that's also a sustaining approach to make sure that black women are involved in a year round political process you know they're supposed to just every two to four years\nSo when Valerie Jarrett was here the former senior advisor to President Obama and she's on the board\nOf I'm I'm Michelle Obama's group when we all when we all vote the whole purpose is to get people to vote not just in the big elections but in the little like a little elections ... how do you know that's where this not to both of you how do you convince\nPeople who don't have a tradition of voting that voting for literally dog catcher school board judges um ... is is important\nI Do this with my students all the time and also this really briefly when people were watching the Brett Kavanaugh hearing and they were so outraged by certain senators and their behavior and also the age dynamic where we saw many of our elected leaders\nAre were well above Seventy years old I reminded them that so many of them got their start in state houses which then turned into than being members of the house which then turned into than being senators and so these individuals have been in the political process\nSort of in these competitive or sometimes not even not even competitive primary but definitely the vast majority are not even in competitive general election races so there is centrally walking into a D.C\nEvery two four six years depending on on what officer holding and so it is important for them to invest early\nIn elected officials on the state house level keep in mind Shirley Chisholm from New York state's got her start in Albany before she became the first black woman\nTo represent New York state in Congress and so it local politics matters and so for a our previous caller is very important to not just vote in mid term and presidential year elections but if you are in place like New York city you have to vote in municipal elections as well\nAnd so I was on the go ahead you know the the question was how do we get low propensity or infrequent voters to vote the simple answer is talk to them\nTo communicate with them the magic of his Stacey Abrams in Georgia\nIs not the result of her win a primary this year the magic is she started four years five years ago matter of fact and she started talking to people getting the ... vote\nBuilding a report communicate with them build a lot of infrastructure and talking to them the magic of Andrew Gillum is not the fact that he was married just before he ran for governor it was the fact that he and share lemon built an infrastructure talk to people\nDay in and day out and and uh it in a way in which Fox felt empowered to say okay I don't know about the voting thing but I Know her because she listened to me she talked to me the most important if we look at the history of African American voting\nWe hit a low point in terms of growth in twenty six team right because we want to twenty two thousand eight we didn't know how we want cars was based on emotion ...\nAnd we don't have the President Johnson I'm going to have to cut you off because in Fifteen\nSeconds we're going to be off the air Christina Greer president Derrick Johnson of the N. double ACP thank you very much for being on the show this is America on the line I Am out next week Brian Lehrer and Charlie Sykes will be filling in\nSupport for America on the line is ...\nYeah bye Emerson Collective additional support has provided by the end he Casey foundation and New York Public Radio's trustee Dr Mary White\nWere alive for local where only NPR leader eighty nine point three K. P. C. C. one a as next the frame comes up at nine o'clock and at nine thirty it's the daily from the New York times eighty nine point three K PCC all night long eight o'clock\n... a lot of listeners tell us key PCC isn't a waste is of sanity when it comes to election coverage and but there are people like you across America\nWants to engage constructively about politics and they're doing it on a colon called America on the line with a new show from WNYC it's America on the line Monday through Thursday\nNights at seven here on an eighty nine point three key PCC it's part of the key PCC voter game plan\nThis is eighty nine point three tape you see the Pasadena Los Angeles community service Pasadena City College number one in associate degrees for transfer in Southern California learned more Pasadena dot edu\nThe black lives matter movement has no central leadership but it does have some big names like the ...\nHow does he see his place in the fight for justice from W. A. M. U. and NPR in Washington this is one [noise]\nHey there I'm Joshua Johnson today on one age to Raymond caisson is advocacy goes beyond issues of police brutality and his work goes further than organizing grassroots protests there is no lack of issues to keep him busy but now he's reflecting on his time and activism\nWhen people tell me that social welfare programs are bad and like why are we just given people things I think I have some\nWhich is a four year old has to do that earns in\nWhich is a seven year old has to do to be worthy of shelter like you tell me how they earn dinner that's just ahead on one egg [noise]\n[laughter]\nLie from NPR News in Washington I'm Jim hawk\nTropical storm Michael has been off for the Atlantic but there will be nothing quick about Florida's recovery from hurricane many homes and commercial buildings in the coastal town of Mexico beach were heavily damaged by the initial high winds and storm surge\nThe protests has come up a lot in the last few years as a result of the courage administration the president has opined on the campaign trail and as president\nOr some of his views on how protesters should be treated early last month the president told reporters in his words quote I think it's embarrassing for the country to allow protesters in the old days we used to just throw them out today they just keep screaming unquote that was in response to dissenters at the Senate hearings\nFor Supreme Court nominee now justice Brett Kavanaugh now protest is protected by the first amendment so we can't just throw protestors out but\nWhat do you make of kind of the public conversation around protest today here we\nSee that when people of color in the street that everybody thinks protesting is the worst thing in the world a Trump didn't have the same comments when there was the the white supremacists in Charlottesville right that in Charlottesville were so wild about Charlottesville besides the torches and besides the the guidance\nWith how I don't know if you saw the footage of the the white supremacist literally pushing the police like as a group pushing the police it's like that I couldn't even imagine you know I've been in many places and many streets in in none of them can I imagine black protesters physically pushing them policing groups and then not ending and bloodshed like I just don't even know what that looks like so\nTo what we see here is like the the not so deadly coded language about like what happens when people of color push back and say that\nThis isn't working um you know that sort of the thing about the rate is it the right it's just re packaging old messages with new language and we've seen you know laws for a long time there were like people can assemble people can't be in any group said that he just like repack any that are for this time that like when it's white people doing it he hasn't said the same thing\nSo that I guess gets to some of the critique about what folks on the weeks of demonstrations Ferguson where some described it as unrest or even riots that did you feel like there's a more of a racial component there than some of the critics made themselves ...\nOh you know people are always asked me if I'm over exaggerating the the impact of Twitter and it's like Twitter literally saved our lives that like you have to remember that in twenty four teen parents go up there is no Facebook lied Instagram live like none of that the only live streaming with like you stream and that was like people to pay to use it so\nIt sounds like Twitter was like the mechanism if you remember that the the first city that you saw ... do you remember the first city that you cite aerial footage of the protests at the first city um that you thought aerial footage\nI I don't remember the first city you know I remember seeing it and being stunned by it but I don't remember the first city\nIn Baltimore you didn't see any you you've never seen any era footage of the protest in St Louis because they declared a no fly zone immediately so I can make a killing the night and they declare enough eyes on the on the twelve so like there was no way for you to see what's happening if it wasn't people who are on the ground\nAnd I think one of the things and like work to identify the media came in and you're right the language is like the riders like you know black people were being dramatic industry and like that\nAnd then the police are like indiscriminately wild like I remember went down on them and got tear gas and it was one of those moments where like he was one of those people on the news sort of a quid vacating about the police and he's got to be I think he's like no they the protests are right where like yes we knew we were right right or like\nYou brought up the five second rule is that people don't people don't remember the name of the legal to stay in film August September October twenty four team that if we sit still for more than five seconds and we were arrested like that's why we marched all day not because we're not marching with like the most effective tactic like we had to march and like people forget those things\nAnd I never want to lose sight of how fragile freedom is and that was one of the big takeaway from being in the street for the initial wave of the protests in St Louis\nWe're speaking to dream of tests in his new book is called on the other side of freedom the case for hope we got a number of voice mails from some of our listeners about you and your work Andrew in Atlanta left this in our inbox\nEd or a huge fan I'm just wanted to say how do you respond to criticism from your opponents when they say just outlandish ridiculous things like black lives matter is a terrorist organization\nI'm it's just as bad as the Ku Klux Klan and it's just as bad as neo Nazis and if you guys this fall for what happened at the Charlottesville protests like how do you guys respond to that\nAndrew thanks very much for contacting us through our app won a vox pop rate what would you say the\nAndrew ... so we know that that is an attempt to distract of so when we when we think about like why do we focus on black people the first thing is that we can focus on the issue around police found has the violence and that doesn't mean that we don't care about the other issue so I can go to a breast cancer rally and that doesn't mean that I don't care about colon cancer just means that I'm focusing on this specific issue\nIn this way why focus on black people live at a we know that the disparities in the outcomes are just so bad for people of color that if we fix it for black people who actually automatically fix it for everybody else that like that makes sense\nI think that the other points to like you know where the cause of the violence and things like that it's like you know when I was in the street the only about ... hours of onto that\nAnd if the police and killed anybody and remember that like the problem is a problem all across the country you think about California one and eleven gun homicides and California's actually committed by police officer that's like\nThat's wild you know like this is a big issue\nAnd there are structural reasons that the police never get held accountable if you think about places like California where there's a law that says that literally any investigation of an opposite last more than a year can never resolve the discipline regardless of the outcome in Cleveland they destroy a police officer disciplinary records every two years in Maryland my home town at a law that says that\nAh you can find anonymous complaint gets an officer for everything except brutality so when we hear these sort of deflecting like you know why are you guys doing this you guys are bringing the pain I the way I respond to he's always like ... back to what the facts aren't the second thing I think very quickly if\nI had no longer even really preachy about this stuff I Want to have other people explained to me so you know when people tell me that social welfare programs are bad and like why are we just given people things it's like I had some like what does a four year old has to do to earn dinner\nWhich is a seven year old have to do to be worthy of shelter like you tell me how they earn dinner great like I Want to hear them explain that to me like people say Mike Brown didn't have his hands up it's like ... ... dead today for supposedly Jay walking like you is that a consequence or with the police you know I'm going to a lot of panels that the police now say to me\nThere's a lot of crime crimes you know crimes bad or\nAre you saying the police you never kill somebody\nAnd I said and I'm like tell me when the police to kill your child like your kids going to make a mistake your kids going to do something then negatively affect somebody else like what's the mistake that you be okay with the officer putting a bullet through your child said she was like I don't know I'm like well if you don't know I don't know right so a part of my work is to share the cognitive burden\nMuch more to discuss as we continue our conversation was during the cats than I Do want to talk to you more of course about the black lives matter movement particularly your role which in it I'm Joshua Johnson and you're listening to one a firm W. A. M. U. and NPR\nNews things\nThe gate BCC voter game plan\nIs our commitment to help you stay engaged in informed on the elections\nSo through election time we've made room and the scheduled for June new

people and the author of the new book on the other side of freedom the case for hope\nOne by graphical thing I did want to ask you briefly you right in the book that teaching was the most important thing you ever did how did teaching helped lay the groundwork for activism\nOh you know it's funny how they don't take him myself as very old but I taught a decade ago my my students the students are like twenty Twenty one now which is so wild\nUh you know teaching was incredible not only because it was urging everyday like every single day to show up as I taught sixth grade math every single there to show up and I was math to my students I had to be as prepared and I taught sixteen Ninety a hundred and twenty minute classes which is a whole lot of math for anybody who's ever there and eleven year old\nUnderstand why black lives matter when you were ... how does that help public safety\nHolly thanks for getting in touch with ... what do you make of that to raise this kind of\nHash tag not all police arguments the question becomes what you want the police to do well actually I'm Sorry I I mean I hate to cut you short read first of all I just want to fact check Holly's ... of ... voice mail does black lives matter actually want fewer police officers\nOr remember that the movement expansive so there's some people in the momentum certainly um\nWho sort of think that that level of policing that we have is okay a lot of people push for less\nI think the question is like you know what what do you didn't police officers do and if if you think that police officers like solving the most heinous crimes and think that actually isn't happening if you think that like they should be responding to cats and trees and like traffic incidents like that is actually happening more often than not\nTo the question becomes like where do we put our energy if we want community is actually be safe and again like most of the crimes that we see in the neighborhood that we see it in his crimes of addiction and crimes of poverty and like we should actually attack\nPoverty an addiction really aggressively so that we actually don't need a response to conflict because we can actually make sure that there's less conflict to when you hear people talk about like just more police have like a blanket it's like sort of what do you want the police to do is that these are the same people who are like police officers aren't counselor and guidance counselors that social workers it's like\nWhat you think that the solution requires that guidance councilors and social workers we should probably invest in those that actually makes sense to me is that if anything I Want more police on Wall street right I got one more police like with white collar crimes like that's what I Want and if we have to invest your money and policing like I'm\nTrying to figure out the people that like broke the stock market in ... and all the people out of their homes with mortgages like those are things that I don't understand but like we can do something about addiction in poverty\nWhere we are coming up on ten years since Bernie Madoff got arrested for his gigantic positive seem so there may be something to that in the late the only person or what\nWe think about all the people that didn't get arrested you know didn't get arrested or got arrested and then got out and have kind of just gone on with their lives in in one way or another in the book you write\nThat quote like all institutions policing wants to convince you that it as permanent the only way forward and is in its best form now unquote clearly you don't believe\nThat that's true there are some parts of the country that are you know definitely grappling with the future of policing there was the liquid McDonald's case in Chicago where a white Chicago\nOfficer Jason Van Dyke was convicted of second degree murder for shooting and killing him a case we spoke about on the show recently is ... ... what would you say to people who are generally supporters of law enforcement who feel that all officers shouldn't be painted with a broad brush\nBut who might be open to some kind of reform is there something some\nHanging fruit some common ground that people across the spectrum on this issue might be able to agree on tackling first\nYeah do you think about when you think\nAbout in Austin we work with the often organizes the Austin city council unanimously voted against the last version of the police union contract him one of the ways that they got that to happen is that like in Austin the contract said that an officer who suspended for one two or three days and this has mentioned automatically get three coded as a written repugnant reprimand\nAnd like that just doesn't make sense right that you can love the police and still be like that's just not fair rate and Cleveland and Chicago where that clauses I say that we destroyed police officer discipline the records you can love the police and that's just not fair right like to some of this is like some people's insurance is like it's just not fair that you would lose your mind if like\nIf I told you that at the school system we just delete it every bad thing that the teacher did the teachers could slap kids and like there's just no consequence you would be like that is wild\nBut when the police do if people are like oh do you like ... that sort of crazy and again like this is an I ... you know part of it too is pushing back on the premise that it's like all police officers are bad people it's like I don't know our police officers people this is a statement about the institution so well you think about\nSchool public schools it's like when you look at a school where like nobody's learning it's not that you think that like every teacher in America is a bad teacher you're like what's going on like what is going on in the school districts or schools were like nobody even a lack of investment it'd just like a lack of outcomes but like\nNobody is saying that the questions that are worthy question it's weird that leg or it's odd that like with policing the moment that you say like it's not working people like oh my God you must hate everybody it's like no I'm just saying it it just isn't working like that sort of just a true thing\nUm so it's interesting where the people who sort of defend them ... immediately defensive when you're literally just asking for a modicum of accountability Ninety seven percent of the\nOfficers who are involved in any killings like aren't even charge Ninety nine are convicted and like USADA you heard about that ... gene being killed and where the ... just walked into a house like that I don't that just doesn't seem right to your house and I think very controversial\nYeah and it just doesn't seem controversial that says if he re you've seen the videos like I've seen the videos and and like I won't accept it that's just collateral damage of what it means to be safe\nWhile I Know we we have to pause and just a moment but we're might step one be in terms of reform that people across the spectrum on this might be able to agree on before we have to ...\nI think it's like with the police you encounter them with the laws that like it is it is basic about fairness and we started to sing a check to police that works that you can see in your city that clauses that they just aren't fair\nSo just being more active in terms of what the basic rules are the governed policing\nYeah like it's actually really hard to find out the ... the rules that allow police officers to shoot and kill people in the city is it's like so there's some places where like officers don't have to use any escalation did or the escalation like to kill people they literally the first interaction they can shoot you that's why if that doesn't make sense you know you can love the police and stuff like that since\nWe have been spending a fair amount of time talking about the political
