not she supported single payer or whether or not she supported a public option and she said no to both ideas and basically dismissed them as not realistic at the time\nLet's go to Zachary in Belleville, Illinois Zachary thank you for calling into America on the line\nBy how you doing good so health care is important to you as an issue yes I\nI I'm a recent college graduate and fortunately I had to come home and take care of my mom she came down with a disability\nOr she's currently on Medicare and um it's it's it's an expanded program here in Illinois and we go to Missouri a lot for um for a medical needs and if you're not doing enough because I'm work down she has um a disease that\nOur our Medicare will cover and we've been reduced for using home remedies to trying to help help her out and it's just not doing enough that what we eat 'em so for me personally I'm expansion\nOn at least Medicare and Medicaid programs if not more on Obamacare because\nRight now it's just not doing enough for us and that's why health care become\n... thank you very much for calling into America on the line and I'm good luck to you in taking care of your of your mom Kevin\n... as I was listening to to Zachary I was thinking about the the lawsuit that challenge or to the Affordable CARE Act the lawsuit that's hoping to\nActually ... ... ... the law and do away with the law that's coming out of Texas ... what are Republicans saying about what what comes next what happens if they are successful if this lawsuit is successful what\nPlans do Republicans have to help people like\nDonna in Washington or Zachary ... in Illinois or the millions of people who are on tender hooks wondering if they're going to have\nHealth care or if they can get healthcare\nMhm so in the in the Republican I'm Obamacare repeal plan that passed the house there were what Republicans claimed work protections for people with preexisting conditions\nOr industry groups advocacy groups Democrats lots of people basically looked at these productions and said\nThese don't go nearly as far as Obamacare does if people lost insurance for a period of time those protections might go away in other cases you might be able to get health insurance for that health insurance wouldn't actually cover your pre existing condition\nWhich would you know sort of eliminate the points\nSo really there's no one clear plan that's emerged Republicans do clearly wants to make the case that you can have these ... conditions\nProtections without having a ... that's a line that you'll hear a lot um Missouri senator or excuse me Missouri attorney general Josh Hawley who is one of the attorney generals who is suing the federal government over Obamacare and his running against McCaskill in Missouri\nHas said this quite a bit you don't need to have Obama Care to have the preexisting production could conditions but there is no consensus Republican plan on this Holly has floated a few ideas that different people have said\nFall short in different ways uh but that conservatives\nHave supported inside yeah this this will get the job done it really there is no consensus Republican plan there's been no attempt to develop one in either the Senate or the house or in any real way so really the answer is that they don't necessarily have an answer but they do want to be able to say\nLook we can protect free existing conditions without Obamacare without necessarily saying how that would actually get on\nWhile okay we've got time I think for one more call and that is from Maggie in St Louis make thank you for calling into America on the line\nThanks you for taking my call so health care is an issue for you in this election [noise]\nAh yeah an extreme line I like type ... diabetic and uh I live in Missouri and\nYeah cash Charlie's kind of a terrifying for me I'm more of the reasons I live back from Virginia Beach because I couldn't get health care not through an employer in the state of Virginia Larry had a high risk pool that was put in\nFor several years ago so even though is that five hundred bucks a month premium I could actually get coverage um and\nYeah yeah I mean pretty much in terms of care came in every job I can now when I retire all that was determined by\nThe health care that they provide fan and the amount of coverage that gets ... and I I don't want to go back to that [laughter]\nI I I hear your bag and you are not alone in in that sentiment make thank you very much for calling in to America on the line I and that sort of brings into high relieve Kevin what you were talking about\nIt when I asked the question what are the plans that Republicans have for the replace part um if they're successful in in getting rid of a\nOverturning repealing the Affordable CARE Act and from ... from what you said that there are a lot of there are a lot of ideas but no consensus\nYeah there there is no consensus I mean the Republican plans to replace Obamacare have always been focused on lowering costs they haven't necessarily been ads focused on protecting access\nAnd those sort of two goals have always been in conflict throughout healthcare policy how do we ensure access and cover everyone including the very second including the very poor\nWith outs also driving up costs for everyone else and that sort of the the problem no one's been able to fix 'em Obamacare had a few provisions that were designed to curb costs\nSome of those version seemed to be working some of them don't seem to have been working as well and that's really the central tension here and Republicans overtime clearly have emphasize more alluring overall health care costs\nBut yet that might mean that they're more vulnerable and the questions of access and on this particular question of protecting people with preexisting\nKevin let me as a ... let me ask you a a a left field let them build question since we're talking about Arizona we were talking about or a race to succeed Jeff Flake in the Senate real quickly are you hearing any rumblings on the ground among people in Arizona\nAre about wanting Jeff Flake two primary President Trump\n[noise] uh I haven't particularly heard any year I'll be honest I haven't quite been asking that is definitely a sentiment that you'll see\nIn DC when I'm there there's a clearly a group of Republicans want someone to make a what they fully admit probably fruitless challenge for Trump in the primary well or whether that person is Jeff Flake or Ohio governor John Case like\nThat sentiments definitely out there right I haven't had certainly hurt anyone in\nOur interview and if you haven't heard and Kevin is not being said seven Robert Hi thank you very much for being on America on the line again tonight remember

A. M. U. and NPR refuse one [noise]\nHey there I'm Joshua Johnson visiting ... Chicago today on one aide reading writing and racial equity\nMany schools are working to close their achievement gaps among whites and non white students but there's still a ways to go a new documentary called America for me charts how high school in Chicago suburbs is pushing for equity and finding out just how challenging that can be\nWe'll meet the director and one of the students and will consider how ... can be more equitable everyone here what you know about how your school is facing this challenge or avoiding it comments on our Facebook page or tweet us at one [noise]\n\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm ...

who are in our I've just always around it when that label and ... thousand a\nTense and thanks for sharing your story with us Steve where does ... park river forest high school to school at the center of the documentary kind of fall on that scale\nWell park is a really interesting community and the school system because it is a it is a community as Charles was saying that goes from you know much more working class living in apartments to extremely wealthy people so there's quite an economic ranch and it's very diverse\nAnd the school system is extremely well funded\nUm and the community is extremely liberal across you know I think we went Ninety ten for Hillary in the last election didn't work but we did it and and so I was always fascinated have being long term resident there is is in a place like that where all these resources are there\nAnd there are there would appear to be a political will there why is Oak Park not succeeding to a degree it should be succeeding\nWith the education of all its children and so it's really it's really an incredibly unique place or you know in a lot of ways in terms of school because it is not a poor Chicago public school but it's not a lily white rich suburban school either\nIt's interesting your definition your description of Oak Park and your description Charles also kind of raise reminiscent of what fun girl wrote us she writes Oak Park is the Birkenstock capital of Illinois [noise]\nCool progressive minded white people make up about sixty five percent of the population Twenty one percentage black if that school can't satisfy people know school in Illinois can see what exactly is the documentary about give us the basic story\nWell we went into the school for a school year two thousand Fifteen to thousands sixteen school year and we followed principally a number of kids black bi racial and also some white kids\nUh across that school year their families and their academic experience the extra curricular experience and the idea was to was just to try to take you inside the experiences of these kids both educationally socially or within the school system and within the community\nThe beginning of the first episode\nKind of dovetails with the rise of the black lives matter movement where you're asking students to attend this particular rally related to black lives matter that was directed at black students ... so it it seems like you kind of came into this at a moment where the students themselves were beginning to think\nAmong themselves about how race affects their lives and and how they wanted to politically engaged\nYeah that assembly was organized the year prior to our filming but it was happening around the time that we were trying to get permission to film and it just really underscored I think the urgency of why we wanted to do this that simply happened because kids went to the principal\nBy kids went to the principal said we need to do something about what's going on at burgers and we need something or where your response and that was the result of that\nUm but you know one of the things I feel like we really found in the course of making the series is is that\nThis generation of young people particularly I think black kids and biracial kids in in our ... experience are really thinking about these things in extraordinary ways and deep ways I I mean compared to my generation I'm an old guy\nThere's no comparison and and that was something I think that was really a wonderful aspect of of making the centers\nCharles how'd you get involved with the documentary what made you decide to take part\nSo I'm at the end of my sophomore year which was the black lives matter rally it was a um\nMy spoken word teaches like my coach and I think other sponsor of the club came up to me and they just asked me if I Want to do it because I think Steven is the kind you win around and asking all teachers\nWhich students they thought would be the best documentary and because I Do spoken word that means like the entire English division knows me on the first name basis [laughter] so they I guess they most of them want to have many of them say my name\nAnd then a Mr Khan asked me to do it [laughter] I mean if he asked me to do that I was like no\n[laughter] no haven't why bad because\nI mean I've seen Jersey Shore [noise]\nI [laughter]\nAm must have known if you will be that\nYou saw but who knows you know you never know some of our students starting my day\nYeah I mean I definitely like [laughter] well I'll I'll grant you know we have to pause in the grand jury I think sometimes particularly after the black lives matter movement popped up a lot of media organization\nIn ... and reporters documentarians kinda parachuted in ... I started telling people stories in the way that felt just exploitative or\nWrong or or or or thoughtless was that a concern um I think mine's higher concern was just like\nI didn't want to be bothered you know um other than to have to come on mom and my mom's like so I got like I got into it I think by the first day of film and I was like come on let's go and already has like ideas that I was like I'm about to mess with these kids so\nMuch and you you you did have a little while you're on camera continue our conversation with our resident prankster Charles Donaldson and documentarian Steve James of whose documentary is called a miracle to me Jamy we did I live in St Louis\nAnd the education system is funded by housing property taxes it's innately creates inequality because of the richer areas get more money than the poor areas\nArchie writes education is a state issue ... can only influence when they provide funds no funds equals no influence we'll talk a little bit more about the funding the influence in the efforts to improve racial equity in schools when we continue we'll add a few more voices to the conversation and we'll add your voice as well\nI'm Joshua Johnson glad to be with you from Chicago you're listening to one a firm W.

one a I'm Joshua Johnson in Chicago we're discussing the documentary series America to me and racial equity in public education\nWith Steve James the director of the documentary and Charles Donaldson one of the documentary subjects we ask you to tell us about some of the things you witnessed during school with regards to racial equity here's what one listener left in our inbox\nHi my name is Noah I'm calling from Little Rock Arkansas I graduated from Little Rock Central High school degree right\nAnd I noticed right on that control during my tenure we kind of example it or not and that by all at once a it was kind of aggregated minorities African American panic\nId is I went up because I um it was like I think at the end of the day was around like five to him and just like whatever like nobody like no one was really like hey I can be doing this and the people that were like yeah I Can't be doing is they're like you out on the show Dr phil cannot explain\nThis to someone who lives in the part of the country that's never encountered this because I hear you I I was just reminds me some somebody that's on our school and I'm a bit older than you but\nThere are people in parts of the country who hear this real like I Can't relate whatsoever\nI I think some folks would hear it and say oh there's just being silly it's just boys being boys they don't know any better next they're wrong for it but you're there to get an education just keep your head down do well in class and don't worry about other people being stupid what would you say to them\nYeah I mean I understand like you know everybody makes mistakes and I would be stupid to parents perfect but at the end of the day is not about like necessarily punishing those boys were looking at them in like a different type of light is just\nReminding them and as society as a hold of my coaches and the train like is not a phase of anyone's life and I and I think that's something that a lot of\n'em are at least I don't know I listen to him and um so I think like the parents he's talking to I like the parents who think this is just a fad for that show just like who think they could listen it's wrapping dressing however they do is just a fad for them when that's not like\nThat's not a fast for me that's my entire life like that's what I grew up with that is where Iraq way now and that's what I'm going to be when I'm going to do and\nSo like so the data and we'll be black like no one can just like take that away from you I Can't give that\nUp you know the I mean this also extends to some of the adults in the building there's a story that's told in the series by teacher just oval who's biracial where she tried to stop the students from calling another student a faggot\nAnd this white student on his way down the hall turn and called her the N word on the way out the up or down the stairs and she reported him and tried to get some kind of um appropriate punishment for that and the administration came back and said well we're not sure that he was really calling you\nThat word as an almost like well who cares who his color right [laughter] I mean he was but it doesn't you know and so nothing came of it and that you know I was in a lot of meetings with administration throughout the making of this series and one of the things that came through sort of ... to ...\nUp on a man's point is it is a district that lives in fear of its wealthy residents and there's a lot of lawyers in Oak Park and and so there there was a a palpable fear of doing anything that might ruffled feathers or people who have authority and power\nWe're speaking with Steve James the director of America to me which is airing on stars you two professors from the University of Illinois at Chicago African American studies professor David Stovall and demanded Lewis the director of the Institute for research on race and public policy and former Oak Park river forest high school students Charles Donaldson let me get to a few\nOf your comments including some of you\nFrom the Chicago area we want to hear from you wherever you are in the country but thanks to those of you were listening to us on WB easy Allison writes I Am a white woman who moved to Oak Park in Nineteen Seventy five after graduate school Seventy five\nI loved living there but I Will never forget the racist words of the white mover who was unloading my furniture from the moving truck he said quote I Hope you like and words because there are a lot of them in Oak Park\nEthan tweeted I graduated from Evanston township high school in a town similar to a park\nETA just pass itself on the back for its diversity when reality classrooms are racially segregated with mostly white students in honors and A. P. classes pointing out diversity doesn't lead to equity\nI Wonder professor still well if you could respond even particularly this difference between diversity and equity\nRight and I think this becomes important when\nWe talk about diversity a lot of times is just the showing a good friend of mine don't often refers to it as the brochure ring of people right just the ... the girl showing of people right so this idea of just putting faces together now saying that you're having something diverse when we're talking about equity in terms of this a pie\nSituation now what we're looking at is who's even given the recommendation or referral to a because it's not what they test scores are because this is what we've seen a different than Amanda and her colleagues have done this work\nWhen students even qualify for a pe courses they aren't given the opportunity to take them right accounts will say this is too hard well how does a cow so no that unless they put in a suction on that black or brown body so what your I'm kind of\nCommentator was saying is exactly right in terms of looking at a peak courses and the problems with in them and real quick this idea of equity says do we even need to question the idea of\nHaving a pe courses right and thinking about the tracking of school in terms of honors a P ...\nProfessor Lewis I Know we have to pause and just a moment but there's a concept called oppositional identity which not factor into this did you touch on that before we Brits\n[noise] uh yes I was about an article called the nine lives is oppositional culture hype and basically the idea was we have found over and over and over again and research that the idea of oppositional culture the idea that black students are doing as well because they are somehow\nOppositional towards school is does not exist it exists in spots it's it's occasionally here and there you sometimes get kids that are passed or discouraged by school but all kids come to school wanting to learn motivated committed to college with commitment to social mobility and what you often see is there something on anti white in terms of\nA dress or music but they're not rejecting school as a white thing in any kind of Broadway but we have this false narrative that is a myth that that lots of people buy into that the reason like its aren't doing well because they're somehow oppositional school and it's it's pervasive but we have found almost no evidence for it\nIn light of that you might be interested to hear a tweet from Matthew who writes knowledge is power white kids do better in school simply because they have a desire for self empowerment\nBlack kids would rather joined a gang and let someone else do the thinking for them like power black lives matter et cetera is not self empowerment you racism is appreciate will take part in justice seconds they close\n[noise]\n\n[noise] if you're hanging onto an old car that you just don't use let us take it off
