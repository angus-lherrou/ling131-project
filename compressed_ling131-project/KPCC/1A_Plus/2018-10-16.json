North Carolina Hi Barbara Hi how're you doing good eggs are taking my call Sherman thanks for making it you want to talk about this hunting and fishing\nRights into the state constitution question\nRips up she hung up or we lost a barber went away um is this simply\nA fire wall against gun control I mean I find a curious that fishing is in it as well as hunting is it also to stave off animal rights groups\nIt's very interesting because both people who would like to see some sort\nOf restrictions on these amendments and those who were kind of die hard advocates for these amendments try to separate them from the gun control gun rights debates and\nLike you said there is a fishing included in wildlife harvest ... and those provisions but hunting has really seemed to be the most contentious aspect of this\nWe have Tar Heel Barbara back on the line I think ... Hi Barbara signed that I thought sorry about that so go ahead what do you think of us\nSo I just wanted to say that this is one of six constitutional amendments that are a Republican super majority have put on the\nOn the ballot because they're very concerned um that the majority might also actually be broken and I mean it has a nice ... like yes we should keep the kind of national puppies statewide popular past science\nI'm protected but what people are concerned about it and keep\nThe state from being able to for example keep people come in gauging and a\nPoisoning different kinds of animals that it's going to allow for constitutional challenges to really reasonable environmental protection and also that it might end up being just kind of a ... for for like big commercial interests so for if we tried to do something to stop\nOverfishing that it was not going to actually help kind of a hobby is a really big business in travel and I really agree with your speaker\nSaid that it's it's it's clear that they that Republicans are worried about it and does he have them go at the polls and said that says this is just designed to to drive up I'm conservative turnout so far\nBut thanks for for all of that on the left observation and you brought it up to Canada is a ballot measure that's designed really to gin up turn out on behalf of candidates or I mentioned earlier in the show how that was used to great effect and the two thousand four presidential election year\nIn Ohio where conservatives put an anti gay marriage referendum on the ballot that drove conservative turnout\nAnd George W. Bush won reelection by a hair that year because we won the ultimate swing state of Ohio by a hair that year with all that extra\nRepublican turnout that people believe the dollar question generated are you seeing that anywhere else in particular\nYou mean in in terms of kind of using one issue to to get at the other yeah I personally have not seen that so much in in any of the ones that I've covered but\nAnd of course a advocates of this right to hunt measure say that that's not the case and even if that is the case\nWhat's the harm in having more voters at the polls [laughter] you know\nLet me get a couple of more um callers in here from around the country coffee in the Bronx was about measure you're following\nWell actually I'm calling regarding the ballot initiatives in Massachusetts it's a\nBit where saying yes on one which the ballot initiative in Massachusetts driven by put on the ballot by um an effort from the Massachusetts nurses association and the nurses in Massachusetts trying to have legal um standards for staffing\nHospital so it's a minimum nursed a patient ratio for hospitals for the sake of quality ... right\nYeah California's the only state that has this at the Massachusetts would not be the second\nNurses' union most likely to\nWhile the nurses' union is the is the prime driver behind this yes because staffing is just an an a legally you can have um\nLimits only in ICU patients so nurse has maybe one to two critical patients when a patient goes to the floor the nurse now is taken care of six to eight sometimes can\nAnd I know I'd rather stay stats that say patients do better when there are at least the minimum number of nurses a for a floor\nAnd suing the NATO Springs Florida ... going to get to do the last one so we got Fifteen seconds for your height\nYes yes I Am in favor of voting yes on proposition Thirteen advance greyhound racing and the state of Florida because of the abuse of the animals that guy there except for injuries so I'm ... yes on proposition Thirteen\nThank you very much too in the neatest Springs Florida and I'll throw in one last one I see the Californians will choose whether to stop changing the clocks twice a year\nI don't know whether they want to end standard time or daylight savings time or but even if they pass it Congress would have to go along and so far I don't think they're ready Candace Norwood reporter governing magazine thank you so much for going over so many ballot initiative\nThanks for having me and thanks to everyone for listening to this edition of America on the line I'm Brian Lehrer and I'll be filling in for Jonathan Capehart again tomorrow night talk to you that [noise]\n\n\nLeadership\nSupport for America on the line is\nA hundred by cameras and collective additional support it provided by the end he Casey foundation and New York public radio tragedy Dr Mary White [noise]\nWe're live where local where bellies NPR leader eighty nine point three key PCC won a with Joshua Johnson who's next at nine o'clock it's the frame with the daily at nine thirty he PCC all night long ...\n... supporters include ...

A. M. U. and NPR in Washington this is one [noise]\nEither I'm Joshua Johnson today on what an eight part three of our special series the state where\nHealth care is top of mind for many lawmakers especially in states that are fighting epidemic levels of opioid deaths other states are rethinking medicate and whether low income people who could work should have to as a condition of their coverage and then there's the cost of prescription how do you know you're paying a fair price\nI Am really presented it Ryan Patrick Kennedy I Am from the state of Rhode Island when I went to my local pharmacist you told me I I Can't tell you that there might be another option for you that's just ahead on one [noise]\n\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm nor rom President Trump today suffer himself the devastation caused by hurricane Michael in the Florida Panhandle last week after viewing the record you by air he visited in a distribution center in Lynn have an outside Panama City and described what he saw\nA expanded Medicaid or through a program called a hip a Hoosier insurance program\nUm two point oh they got some waivers but essentially it's the same thing as Medicaid expansion\nSo in the states where Republican governors or legislators did not want to expand on it in where ballot initiatives are an option we started seeing more and more examples of er of Medicaid expansion going on the ballot and so that's what we see now in Idaho Nebraska and Utah\nJulie let me back after you for just one second he would just be clear on why Medicaid expansion was opposed was this purely you know rock Obama's Democrat or Republican I don't like your face and so to held Obamacare was there a policy argument behind why Medicaid expansion was a bad idea and certain things\nThere are conservatives who are going around the country to these red states saying don't expand Medicaid don't do anything to make Obamacare succeed so that was part of it a lot of it was political um some of it was and we're seeing this now the idea that\nWell these are able bodied people because remember they're not disabled they're not age they're not children and not pregnant women the traditional Medicare populations\nAnd the idea is well why should we be giving these people health insurance if they could go out and work and dust we're starting to see these work requirements um be added and these are being fought mostly in court I don't think there's any on the ballot\nBut the idea of course you know if you look at the statistics the vast majority of people already work that's why they earn a hundred and Fifteen Percent of poverty they just work it really low wage jobs where they don't get health insurance we're hearing\nFrom some of you in states that have decided not to expand Medicaid Joni in Florida left this note in our inbox\nFor almost three decades we've had a Republican led legislature and governor and end of the last one has been in place Rick Scott\nHe has refused to accept ... money's we've already sent to Washington DC that Medicaid can be paid about eight hundred thousand needy people in Florida so I Would say we need it yet\nAnd Democrats in place it maybe make it happen because there's a lot of people that need care in Florida and it's ridiculous that China tax dollars away\nJourney thanks very much for calling in ... of course not running for Senate in the state of Florida read Wilson what's your response to join his comment\nWell that's why we are seeing Democrats across the country talking about health care a ... there is as a matter of fact ah there's a lawsuit right now that challenges a part of the uh the Affordable CARE Act\nThat was filed by Texas attorney general Ken Paxton\nAnd um the attorney general of Wisconsin as well as joined by a number of Republican attorneys general across the country and there are a number of cases in which the Democratic candidates running against those attorneys general are running for US Senate seats are running for for governor in ... a bunch of key states including\nPlaces like Michigan or are using that\nA a lawsuit as an example of how Republicans would you know that as they say take away your health care take away protections for those with preexisting conditions\nAnd things like that as we look at at public opinion polls were three weeks out from the mid term elections or health care is the top issue in most states where this is being fought and I think that's a sign that a democratic voters especially are king in on the Affordable CARE Act which was an albatross or Democrats in previous elections\nScott Greenberg let me bring you in Julie referenced the work requirements with Medicaid some states including Arkansas Indiana Virginia agreed to expand Medicaid in exchange for work apartments can you detail that a little bit more first what these work requirements actually are\nWell they vary from state to state but ah the ideas Julie noted most people on Medicaid already work but a these are attempts to expand the work requirement to more people are and again it varies\nBy state but I think um what's interesting about this a couple of things first or in some states notably Virginia this was a way to kind of ... to get Medicaid expansion over the finish line the legislature there which is\nClosely divided between Republicans and Democrats this was a way to get Republicans on board announced a with a democratic governor there to finally approved Medicaid expansion and even some\nDemocrats are sort of centrist Democrats were saying well if this is the price that we have to pay\nTo get Medicaid expansion um than it's worth it or\nHowever they're all at Arkansas which was one of the first states to approve a work requirements they only date where it's actually operate that's right and there are early reports um\nThat uh many many people ... almost five thousand people ended up losing their Medicaid coverage as a result of these requirements and that is focused attention again on on whether uh on on what the requirements should be and whether it's a fair a right to require people um [noise]\nUh to to work if they have uh other are facing other challenges\nJulie and I want to say something about Arkansas what's interesting what we've seen again it's the sort of the first test it's not that these people aren't working they're not losing their Medicaid because they're not working they're losing their medicate because they've been unable to navigate\nReporting system which you're all on line and there's a lot of people in Arkansas who don't have access to computers um\nYou mean reporting system for declaring that they are working yeah when you like actually a good time she\nExactly they basically not been able to submit their time to eat a lot of them I've seen a lot of reporting where people have gone around and and some of the people make it don't even have any idea yet that they're supposed to be doing this um you know they did was we we all ... the medical director and the people who did this\nYou know why are you doing this on line when so many people don't have Internet access and the response was well you should be able to be to find a place with Internet access and use it that will be part of helping you get a job um that was sort of the their argument was they wanted it to be all on line but because it is on line a lot of people have not been able to basically prove that they're working\nOr do you want to talk about the political prospects for passing Medicaid expansion through the ballot box as we continue our conversation with Julie Rovner of Kaiser Health news Scott Greenberg of state line and read Wilson of the hill before we break we spent some time today with one of the many many Democrats who may be likely to put their names forward\nFor the twenty twenty presidential race who Leon Castro has been the mayor of San Antonio he also served in President Obama's cabinet\nThis summer the forty four year old spent time speaking in Iowa and he just published a memoir now Leon Castro is a twin his brother Joaquin is a congressman who Leon writes about his brother in the book and says that they are the most competitive brothers who ever lived and we asked him how having a twin affects his view on politics\nWhat's interesting about being a twin is that everybody sees you the same way right like you're part of the package your your group deal a package deal\nAnd I guess it's helped me to understand issues of identity and help people think about themselves and politics because I grew up and everybody saw me as part of somebody else\nYou'll find more of our conversation with Julio Castro in today's one a podcast you'll find

conversation we would love your help with tomorrow's program on climate change today President Trump is surveying the destruction from hurricane Michael ... says he's still skeptical on whether climate change is manmade\nAnd he's not alone maybe you agree with him at least in part if you are not one hundred percent convinced that human activity is changing the climate in dangerous weighs a hundred percent what are you convinced stuff and how did you reach that conclusion\nLeave us a voicemail eight five five to three six one a one a now on the other hand maybe you are part of the vast majority of people who are one hundred percent convinced\nUm and you can't get all the drugs and the question is do you want to be able to get on every drug that anyone might possibly need but you are going to pay more or do you want to be able to potentially pay less but exclude some drugs that people will me\nAnd I just want make sure we're clear because we are a lot of terminology around fast the formula Larry he's the list of prescription Fisher insurance will cover that is correct what about this plan out of California Julie I mean Jerry Brown is progressive but he's also highly pragmatic\nAnd so I'm guessing he wouldn't have signed this unless you believe that would actually have an impact of lowering drug prices but what do we know in terms of whether these laws actually work in cutting the high costs prescriptions\nWell nothing beyond the actual price controls is going to cut the cost of prescription to there was a lot of sort of discussion last week when the president signed these two laws that would basically eliminate gag closet so that you can find out if paying retail would be cheaper than using your insurance\nUm that doesn't bring down the price of drugs one of the things that's driving up the price of drugs is the advent of these new very fancy biologic drugs that cost billions of dollars to develop and\nAre you know and and they come out with you know these eye popping price tags you know like a half a million dollars a month and there are a couple\nI mean just really expensive drugs but if I have three million dollars a month yes it was for I think that one was the muscular dystrophy drug there there have been some of these very specialized drugs but their cancer drugs that that costs you know tens of thousands of dollars\nPer month I mean that and they may stand life that you might you know some of this is a societal problem we have to\nYou know think about how much do we want to pay how much is it worth to pay for these drugs on the other hand you know if um\nIf you don't you know people people want them that I've been set it in this very see you're talking about right to try that getting to some of these experimental drugs so if you're dying you clearly wanna try anything you can but who's going to pay for them\nAnd I just want to be clear when we talk about a half million dollars a month that's the sticker price before your insurance pays whatever piece of paper that's correct Scott let me shift to what we believe by far it has generated the most health related legislation which has to do with addressing the opioid crisis there have been more than twenty bills passed\nThis year involving prescription drug monitoring programs talk about what some of those bills too\nSo the idea of the laws are different from state to the ... from state to state some of the law's mandates um report\nI ... a use these a prescription or databases which have existed in most states for a long time to make sure that people are aren't\nI'm a doctor shopping as the term is called which means go into different doctors in search of a opioid prescriptions also ah these ah databases are designed to prevent people from a\nA mixing certain drugs that might be harmful to them I'm so these are efforts or to to\nTo do something about this opioid crisis which is is killing 'em many many people it's the worst drug crisis that uh\nThe country's ever faced I'm the federal government um uh we should say did recently passed its own a bill to to uh\nTake on the opioid crisis and uh this bill um\nYeah it's interesting I'm not just for what's in it but for what is not in it's one thing that's not in it is a what money states have done another step they've taken a curb opioid abuse which is a limit a on the supply of opioids that can be prescribed especially for a first time user um\nWe have to supply like the number of days the days after like a number of\nDays um it did not include that uh which disappointed some people but uh the the argument on the other side or the argument against a including that\nIs that a first of all a doctor's many doctors say this is a complicated or a question that should be between a doctor and patient you shouldn't have a blanket rule on how how how what the supply\nUm should be also there's a concern that if you cut people off they you might be pushing them toward a more dangerous so dangerous opioids heroin or fentanyl um and also there are people who are in chronic pain who really do need these drugs and um [noise] ah they also have been increased\nOut a these are what they consider to be draconian limits on prescribing so it's a very complicated issue the federal bill instead of going that direction emphasized expansion of of treatments so now allow Medicaid to pay for residential treatment in large facilities and also will allow Medicare to pay for methadone um frequent\nThere's also a another set of laws that some states passed this year that would expand access to lock sewn which is a drug to reverse an overdose some states including Arizona and Rhode Island passed laws that allow for a coke prescription of ... when opioids are also prescribe\nIs that right Ah yes ... is a drug that can be administered that will a reverse in overdose Senate ... in addition to the uh\nThe measures you mentioned some states have taken steps to to get in the locks them in the hands of first responders and and also to uh uh to pass so called good Samaritan laws so that for example of\nA two people are using drugs or perhaps heroin in a legal drug and uh someone overdoses that uh if if the other person the friend uses no locks them that they won't be in trouble with law enforcement just or if they're called and called in\nJust a quick point on this the states you mentioned Arizona in Rhode Island are are pretty much the most\nA polar opposites polar opposites that you can get politically and I think that underscores a broader point\nThat the ... the measures that are responding to the opioid overdose are coming from very conservative states and very liberal states are and everybody in between when when I go out to the state legislative conferences and ask the state legislators what the biggest issue is facing their states\nEvery single one of them says the opioid crisis it crosses all\nKinds of party line this is there's there's no partisanship in any part of this\nJulie and I should point out that the bill that just passed\nThat Congress a couple of weeks ago was also extremely bipartisan um you know while they were busy in the middle of that he\nKnow fight about you know a justice cabin or they were busy putting together that\n... that came from Republicans Democrats and conservatives and liberals that something that basically everybody agrees on\nDixie tweeted we live in Arkansas and my husband a laborer now has health insurance for the first time in ten years although we do live thirty minutes from the closest public Internet access\nWe just provide checked stuff's as proof of work to meet the work requirement months thing last week a question about Medicaid expansion of rights is a part of
