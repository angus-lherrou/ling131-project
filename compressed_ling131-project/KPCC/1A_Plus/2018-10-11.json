{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Ah recently it was an extraordinary speech I'd read the speech is that\nThe president's made in the so called isolationist period of the Nineteen twenties and thirties and no one ever said anything like what Trump said which was that America is going to look after itself with everybody else should look after themselves um that's an extraordinary statement that is the opposite of the world\nThat we've created after World War two that is a return to the world that we knew in the first half of the twentieth century it's a world of all against all\nSo given that that the the the liberal world order 'em as basically maintain broadly speaking the piece was Seventy years with the United states being the foundation of that uh that stability with the United states walking away under under President Trump\nIs it realistic to expect um our European allies are allies in I'm In a sense of just Japan\nUm is it realistic to think that they could maintain the order without the United states\nI mean that's certainly I think what people would like to hope and I think even they would like to hope that they could but they know better than we do that they can't do it and this is the thing that history is taught us and you can ignore you know hundreds of years of history Europe was caught in a in a\nContinuous cycle of conflict until the United states came in and effectively balanced the region and brought a fundamental piece of the regional same was true or in Asia and were Japan and China were engaged in an endless cycle of conflict from the late Nineteen century on\nUm the United states put an end to that cycle of conflict United States occupies a unique position in the world some of it's not by the way because Americans it's a wonderful and we're the most\nYou know there were the most generous people in the world where we're not where people were selfish like everybody else but the United states occupies a unique position geographically a we happened to be an enormously powerful wealthy country\nThat has not surrounded by other dangerous powers like every other power in the world is in a very dangerous neighborhood that allows us to deploy our horses and keep peace\nThousands of miles from home without risking our own security that's a unique position no one else could take the United states plays even if they were of a mind to do so um I think what we're more likely to see in the ... the United states is a complete breakdown order of the kind that we saw in the Nineteen thirties\nSo can you talk more about just sort of ... D stabilizing um nature of President Trump's\nField team um or seeming affinity too strong men or two Russian President Vladimir Putin or to a Kim Jong un of North Korea\n[noise] well I think in that case um\nFor one thing in a system built around alliances uh the way the American system is it actually is a lot easier to push around your allies than your adversaries because your allies are dependent on you know the fact that the United states and Trump have been able to squeeze\nMarginally better deals out of Canada and Mexico and\nCould probably squeeze a bed marginally better deals out of Europe too is partly because those countries are entirely dependent on the United states and so we can use that leverage against them\nIn the case of adversaries they're not dependent on the United states and they actually can do was damaged and I think that\nTrump in a way a is a classic kind of you know the phrase I Would use is a kind of bully tower he's talked with the people he can push around with and he's very deferential to the people who can hurt him and so he looks at a guy like ... well setting aside whatever\nComplicated relationship ... may have with Russia in a general sense but who was a strong guy who can do damage to us a Kim Jong alone is a strong guy who can fire missiles at us and to those people\nHe's rather um see quiz ah to our allies use the bully and so you know I think a certain sense there's there's a logic to it but it's it's not a very sort of I think a very attractive logic\nMhm you know the the um I I'm I'm thinking of uh of three things here I'm under normal circumstances or the president of the United states um the United states would be forcefully out there on this um the stories about the um um the head of Interpol\nUm and what the Chinese have done um our colleague a Washington Post a global opinions columnist or mouth ...\nAnd his disappearance a Russia poisoning um people in Great Britain with these things be happening if there was a forceful voice coming out of the White House\nNot only that only expressing condemnation from the United states but also standing on those principles that made the United states a shining example to other nations\n[noise] well I mean I don't want to pretend that nothing bad ever happened when the United states was playing his role in the world obviously bad things always happen but I think that you were identifying saw a a real trend here\nAnd the trend is that all kinds of bugs around the world are increasingly are believing that they can get away with doing things like this I think in the case of the the the Saudis\nI'm as it appears assassinating\nOf orange or a Saudi journalist in a foreign\nCountry and sending out a hit seem to get him that would not happen unless they were pretty sure that the United states wasn't going to do anything about it after all Saudi Arabia is entirely dependent on the United states for its defense and survival so they had to believe\nUh that they should that the Americans would do nothing a similarly for the things that we see Russia doing in terms of poisoning spies so there's this general sense a that it that everybody is sort of free to do what they want and there is no\nThere's no one enforcing any kind of a fundamental decency in the international system I think there's no question\nThat the increasing absence of the United states for that role is not only encouraging these actions but his courage more and more and in fact more serious kinds of actions in the in the years to come\nBy a one word answer you the name of your book as the jungle grows back if the United states um gets in a new president Democrat or Republican who um decides to stand up for the liberal um the liberal world order will it be too late to beat back the jungle\n[laughter] I think it depends when it happens that can have a point where it's too late I Want to say the first point is you've got to re educate the American people why it matters\nAll right Bob Kagan thank you very much for being on the show that's it for us tonight thank you to all of my guests join us tomorrow night trying again tomorrow and I remember you can tweet us at ...

A. M. U. and NPR in Washington this is one egg [noise]\nHey there I'm Joshua Johnson today the one a movie club reviews for stars for\nThis film had a lot going on Bradley Cooper is first time directing a feature Lady Gaga is first leading dramatic role and the remake of one of Hollywood's most revered story it also comments on the very music industry that made Lady Gaga star with lots to say about the price of fame\nWill review a star is born spoilers end all and we love to hear from you how many stars out of five would you give the film and why\n... eight five five to three six one a one eight for tweet us at one and\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Jim hawk\nHurricane Michael hit the Florida Panhandle Wednesday before barreling into Georgia and heading for the Carolinas\nTo coastal towns in for the Mexico beach in Panama City beach bore the brunt of the storm surge and category for wins maximum sustained winds of drop to eighty miles an hour still more than enough to bring down trees and power lines Florida governor Rick Scott says his state will bounce back\nHe is a in the depths of active alcoholism he has a lot of problem he is really wearing his body out\nAnd he meets a young woman played by lady di di his name's alley and she's working a as a server for up looks like maybe a catering company or in a hotel and she uh is singing evenings at a drag bar where she's sort of aghast\nAmong the drag queens he comes in sees her sing levy on roads falls in love with her they have a passionate relationship during which her fame begins to explode his fame begins to\nFade um eventually they marry and like in every version of a star is born it ultimately comes to the very tragic and um and then I Would say any a version of this story there's a push and pull between whether he feels worse about the fact that he's holding her back\nOr whether he feels more resentful of the fact that she's a clip of him that sort of where some of the tension in the story comes from\nJohn this was also somewhat I think ten some Hollywood circles because this was Bradley Cooper his first turn as a director what's the general take on how well he did\nI think he's getting a lot of credit for not only directing the film well but dredging himself well I think it's very difficult for any actor to direct him or herself in a feature film and I think Bradley does a very good job directing himself he gives a good performance out of themselves\nAnd listen it's a very ambitious first feature a lot of directors when they're making their first film do something a little small there maybe a little indie not an iconic film like star is born so the degree of difficulty I think was very high and I think if you look at the craft you look at the way it's designed the way that shot with its edited\nThe sound of the film the music in the film on those levels I think everybody feels it's incredibly accomplished\nLet me get to some of your comments as we continue our conversation with John horn to host of K PC sees the frame\nNPR Music critic and correspondent and powers and the host of NPR's pop culture happy hour Linda Holmes indeed case sharp in in the indie kj sharp in Indianapolis three to five stars for Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga is a star is born Mary Lou on Facebook also treated five stars it was fabulous\nSuzanne wrote on Facebook for stars having seen all the other versions many times over the years I found myself making constant comparisons of pace dialogue and performances I couldn't just enjoy it for what it was\nAnd Mary wrote on our Facebook page five out of five it is a soul moving piece of art the music is outstanding the acting is superb the creative storytelling choices are brilliant seen it twice and ready for a third\nLet's see if we can squeeze in a call before we have to pause in Michigan Michael is standing by hey Michael what did you think of a star is born\nWell I have to I wanted to tell your judgment because I've been hearing your promo for weeks now the there actually are more than four stars sports the first one was in Nineteen thirty two and it was titled what price Hollywood star Constance Bennett\nAnd low sermons and by the way the best version hands down certainly Judy girl no two ways\nMichael I appreciate your calling in and powers can you give us some comparison between this first in the previous ones I left out what price Hollywood because it's not\nA star is born what price Hollywood is about an actor who discovers an actress and she makes her way up and he makes his way down stars born is about musicians but I I Do take Michael's point\nWell actually the first the the other for the Hollywood versions of SARS for it or not really music movies exactly they're about Hollywood I'm Jana gain a version\nAnd also the Judy Garland version um we shifted to rock and roll as the mill you with Barbara and Chris and\nThere are so many Easter eggs in this new version\nA Bradley Cooper did do an amazing thing in terms of of uh revitalizing and reviving so many elements from the Nineteen Seventy six version\nWhich by the way had a screenplay by Joan Diddy then John Gregory done uh of course to amazing writers married couple and which many people regarded as a train wreck because I'm Barbara Streisand and herds than\nA partner Jon Peters were running rampant over\nBuddy everybody else's desires allegedly in terms of making that movie and it's seen as very excessive however I mean\nI almost experienced this new star is born as like a cover version of that movie there are so many references airlines directly taken from it there are visual cues from the seventies revenue member looks the way he uses his mouth it's like he's studied Christopher since\nPerformance to the tiniest detail even the southwest decor in there to uh in their house right when they were living together after they're married\nIt's it's exactly like almost the Ira and Chris version so that could be one reason why\nI had some mixed feelings because I Love the camp excessive mid seventies version of so\nWe'll continue our conversation in just a moment was in power as John horn and Linda Holmes before we pause we wanted

are just joining us\nI Will remind you one more time\nSpoiler alert we will be discussing all the details of his movies so if you haven't seen the star is born yet but you want to you might want to listen to this conversation later on line at the one a dot org\nMany people from from the top notch of Nashville again that lead him be Hillary Lindsey these are these are Grammy Award winning songwriter who worked on these songs um\nAnd yet through at all I think the important thing is that you hear a guard outright\nUh it there is a ... of authenticity that's another theme in the film as well which we can discuss a which some people have had problems with including myself like the idea that Jackson Maine's music is more authentic more important\nThan what Gaga alley ended up doing when she turns to pop\n'em pretty old fashioned idea but uh\nFor the soundtrack they found this amazing balance in you know one moment I Love in the film is the first song when when a Bradley Cooper Jackson, Maine is on stage in front of thousands of people in the arena he plays the song\nAnd it sounds like the way they go outside [laughter] it sounds like a Lady Gaga song in his voice and the voice of like a\nHairy America is at a veteran dude I'm that's editor from Pearl Jam whom apparently Bradley Cooper actually shadows to gain some rock star mannerisms\n[laughter] show that I Know but but this sort of the melodies the sound constructions that we've heard in previous Lady Gaga hits they're everywhere running the soundtrack and I really really love that\nBack to the phones now in Tucson, Arizona Stephanie is on the line hey Stephanie what did you think of a star is born\nI thought last night with my girlfriends I absolutely loved it but I did have a criticism about San ... character I generally an addict than Eliot fan but I didn't really appreciate that comment he makes when that God's crying and he has altered by saying that um that Jackson\nAnd suicide wasn't her fault that it was only his fault and um I work with with substance abuse um\nPeople and substance abuse counseling and I'm getting my masters and counseling right now the University of Arizona\nAnd I think that's a really dangerous message to kind of portray about suicide and depression and substance abuse that how can be someone's fault when really the treatment for it you know outlines that pretty clearly as a disease it their treatment options for although they are not always successful so I was a little bit concerned about that message there at\nThe end yes definitely I hear you on that I I remember\nWhen when Ali was visiting jak in rehab and she's like you have a disease like it's it's okay it's okay that to me felt\nTremendously empathetic and right on the nose in terms of what you should say someone who's struggling with addiction and then at the end when Bobby said it wasn't your photo was my father was his fault\nAs an audience member had to kind of think OK they're just kind of portraying maybe Bobby's anger maybe shoes Hughes disgusted that this has happened that I'm not supposed to view this moment is a noble statement from him but that kind of I don't know if you kind of went up my spine the wrong way to\nMake a comment about that at least there's a really interesting subplot in this version that's about recovery and the recovery movement um the fact that we see Jackson, Maine a in rehab in a circle that resembles an AA\nMeeting um and also about mental health issues there is that as a scene spoiler alerts ... where he's talking about um\nA previous suicide attempt all that is\nStuff that would not have been considered I think for earlier versions of the film because that really reflects new dialogues uh about mental health about addiction about recovery and while I absolutely agree with the caller\nI also ah felt weird about that line about that it was his fault\nI like the fact that film engaged with the present day discussion of these issues which the other ones don't really\nYes definitely appreciate your calling into thanks very much for sharing that with us we also got some comments\nAbout that part of the storyline from actually from several of you Karen wrote on our Facebook page I Would give it five stars but I had to set aside my professional orientation ... I don't think says what her profession is I had to set aside my professional orientation\nAs to how his addiction an obvious depression was enabled indoor ignored by those around him and just listen to the music the demise of the male character was not handled so graphically in the previous versions of the movie and this was painful to watch I wanted to scream\nDon't leave him alone at one point and look at the screen the performances were incredible and who knew Andrew dice clay could have such a great second coming as a character actor I Want to talk about Andrew dice clay a little bit more all to come back to John horn I Do take this point from Karen and Stephanie about the portrayal of of substance abuse\nYeah I'm not saying that we can't help people who have addiction and I think part of the story in dealing with addiction and how crippling it can be is incredibly off at it\nAnd I think that's a good take away that you know you can be incredibly talented you can appear to outsiders to have it all and if you're fighting the disease as pernicious as alcoholism it doesn't matter\nWhat you look like you were doing because it is destroying you from the inside and I think that's where the movie is most authentic about how horrible alcoholism can be he looks like yes everything and he doesn't because he can't\nConquer this [noise] want to get to some more of your questions and comments when we continue in just a moment we're speaking to John horn of frame NPR's empowers and Linda Holmes wanting it to a little bit more of the craft of the film John spoke to the cinematographer of this will be massively but you've got to comments about math you will get to that in a moment\nAnd even more fundamentally since we're talking about Bradley Cooper being the first time director\nKathleen asked on our Facebook page basic question\nHow can you tell if the film is well direct\nQuestion Kathleen we're going to ask for just a moment because [noise]\nJust don't know\nBut anyway like the night [noise]\n\nBig news LA staff to laugh\nIs coming to the ace hotel Saturday November seventeenth story telling the story telling me you've never heard before the world's top story tell us from one thing is that\nBy the most dangerous band Saturday to ... get sick you dance info faces dot org slash in person [noise] nah [noise]\n\nAmount of wealth you might leave behind you don't want to leave it to a probate\nCourt's Brian's got milk a member of KP cc's legacy society\nYou want to know that it's going to the people in the causes that you care about most passionately and having estate planning is very satisfying for peace of mind to know that whether it's soon or fifty years from now my wishes are going to be carried out\nStart your planning now at K.
