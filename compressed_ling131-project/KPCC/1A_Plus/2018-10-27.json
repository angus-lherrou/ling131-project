{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Need to how do we determine what is an appropriate tool that the secretary of state's office can use to make sure that the voter rolls are clean that they don't have you know multiple problems with voters at different addresses\nThat we don't have any type of fraud going on that dead people aren't all those things that you hear about election\nHow do you decide which of those things is actually what the secretary of state's office is supposed to be doing to protect the integrity of the election versus one that we determine is suppressive in its intent\nYeah look sexy states have been running elections for a long time and long before the Supreme Court sanctioned use it or lose it mechanism that they sanctioned in Ohio's voter purging\nSecretaries of state we're maintaining their roles and making sure that that people are no longer on the rules and the like and of course secretaries of state needs to be able to make sure that their voter walls are up today\nBut voting in America has never\nHad never been to use it or lose that right and it is not a privilege handed to some it is a right that is for on us citizens and there are measures written into the national voter registration act that was enacted really primarily in the nineties to ensure a greater registration opportunities for more vulnerable communities\nAnd that's what's happening in the state of been relying on for years through election cycle after election cycle to make sure that the voter rolls were clean there has been a lot of studies\nBipartisan studies done to try to detect massive voter fraud and not a single one has ever revealed massive voter fraud it was part of the reason why you saw secretary of state from states as wide ranging as Mississippi to California\nProtesting when the president established us Pence Kovacs voter suppression commission as I call it headed by the vice president and Kris Kobach the Kansas secretary of state who's had a longstanding agenda to restrict voting rights ultimately\nThe commission got brought down through litigation but there was zero evidence whatsoever to back up the president's claim that three to five million people had voted illegally in the twenty sixteen election\nAnd so this is what's dangerous about where we're at which is this myth of voter fraud is perpetuating a series of policies that result in the suppression of the vote in certain communities but\nI think we just have to admit that this has long been a very racialized agenda the seeds of this has been rooted in Jim Crow and slavery and that we are today contending with a whole slew of different mechanisms\nBy which people have been seeking to restrict the right to vote among communities that are perceived to be heavily democratic and those increasingly in our polarized country our communities of color\nA number of conservatives Republicans will say look there's no evidence that we are suppressing the vote and the fact is anybody can show up and vote they can fill out a provisional ballot were not denying anyone access to the polls this is not the Nineteen sixties\nAnd the fact that Democrats are blaming this on voter suppression really what they should be looking at is the reason why their message isn't resonating with voters that they want to get to the polls I that that has\nBeen fleeting um voter turnout with the actual uh ability to have people who show up at the polls have their votes counted and there has been ample evidence in federal court after federal court after federal court has found states that have engaging intentional racial discrimination in enacting\nRestrictive measures to prevent people from voting as recently as just this past year\nThere is a long history of voter suppression in this country it is taking a whole range of foreigners from literacy test them pull taxes and grandfather clause as to the kind of\nUnlawful purging I'm overly restrictive id requirements that we see today we have to be really vigilant to fight back on voter suppression but I also think that the the other message has to be that people need to show up and exercise that's right it has been a right that people have died for\nA that was secured by the blood sweat and tears of advocates and activists that came before us and I think in this election in particular which may be the most important election in our lifetimes\nEverything is at stake a fundamental American values are at stake and that's why there is such a groundswell of\nUm activism and get out the vote efforts that people feel really you know engage in making sure that there's much higher turnout\nThe need to go to is the president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on civil rights [noise]\n\nAll right one more thought for my brain this hour\nFlashbacks to twenty sixteen back then as now we were watching a split screen election\nOne shows crowds waiting to get into Donald Trump rallies the other shows long lines at early polling centers filled with voters of color and just like two years ago were trying to interpret which will tell us more about who will win an election day\nThose lines at early voting places didn't predict victory for Hillary Clinton in key states like Florida or North Carolina and voters who've never even attended a mad rally did get to the polls for Donald Trump\nBut mid term elections are more sensitive to fluctuations in turnout fewer people overall vote in non presidential years which means even minor changes in the composition of the electorate can have massive\nConsequences in other words even just a few hundred voters showing up to vote don't normally vote to determine the outcome of a bunch of racist no one knows what will happen if as professor macdonald suggested we have higher voter participation that any mid term elections since Nineteen fourteen\nBut what we do know is this the Trump era has engaged and rage voters like none in modern times\nAnd even as we may hit record levels of turnout and twenty Eighteen I suspect we're going to be flirting with a record voter engagement for the foreseeable future [noise]\nYou can always find us on Facebook and leave a comment there also if you missed anything or you want to listen back again check out our podcast on iTunes or wherever you get your

prominent Democrat and critics of President Trump as NPR's Miles parks reports the suspect was arrested after that the discovery of three more packages earlier today\nThat was Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin ... you were listening to an interpreter by the way but those were his comments his first public comments about this case during that massive investment conference that's come to be known as Davos in the desert Robert how likely is it that the crown prince himself knew about this attack\nWell all signs seem to point that something that was this big that would be an operation conducted by several operatives inside\nOf the Saudi confident whether they actually were people who were flown in as has been claimed by the Turks are whether they were rogue operatives as is how these once appeared to claim that now seem to backtrack a little bit on 'em either way a all signs point to the fact that uh the crown prince would have had\nAn inkling of it and if ... was ordered it but if not any of those things he still comes out looking really bad because if this happened on his watch without him knowing anything that's just as bad and what's surprising about those comments he made\nA at the conference two things really one is that he seemed to be dealing with this and speaking of it almost as if it was at arm's length as if\nYou know he's angry but not that angry\nAnd as if he wants to investigate but really not that much because it has been three weeks already\nAnd as we've been discussing they've kept changing their position but the other thing that was surprising off to those comments is that he received a round of applause uh and and and that is a sign of the people who were there the investors that the conference and they include in\nThe light so as we know many companies had pulled out of many or a government officials from around the world had pulled out but the ones who were there were all ones who needed a Saudi cooperation and investment you had that I've been on saw the really a prime minister who was briefly kidnapped by the Saudis\nAh you had a Jordan's King Sen\nWho really needs investment from the Saudis as well and you had an Ron con of Pakistan the new prime minister there who before he went to this conference was asked why he was going and he said quote we're desperate and he came away with six billion dollars\nWell it's kind of what I'm Wondering Michael Goldfarb in terms of the outcome of this and whether this is as some have positive a disaster for Saudi Arabia Michael emailed when\nConsidering what punishment if any to administer to Saudi Arabia is important to remember that Saudi Arabia is more than just a supplier of oil we need the military bases in the region far more than we need their oil Michael what sense do you have of whether or not this is as some have put it a disaster for Saudi Arabia\nBut I think that's getting way out in the center on skis if you if you don't mind my saying so um and I think unless I'm room wasn't treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin there\nUm I Believe so yeah yeah he was with me ... and then I Would have been saying that Robert ... had listed some some foreign visitors and it seems to me that that's the key one for American listeners I'm looking\nTo go actually I hate to cut you short the treasury secretary was going to attend but then announced last Thursday that he would not attend the\nOkay so we ended up and did not go right good will knock him you know because what's happening I mean\n... what's happening is a tie a third one and Turkey's drifts feeding bits and pieces and every time he drapes a new piece of of the horror that happened in the subject consulate\nUm the ... the Saudis have to change their stories\nAnd it's it's no surprise that after CIA director Gina Haspel visited a few days ago um you know and and is reported to have heard the tape of the execution\n'em yet again the Saudis are changing their story but there have been around a long time when it comes to Saudi Arabia imported from Saudi Arabia in fact my visa was arranged for me by Jamal ...\nWho was working at the press attach in in the Saudi embassy in two thousand and three when I was trying to get in and nobody gets into to report on their own in Saudi Arabia is closed place\nPeople need something from Saudi Arabia it can be bases it can be oil\nAnd when you deal with Saudi Arabia we ... we often see in in good reporting you know it's kind of a futile kingdom and there's a medieval aspect of it the one thing I remember vividly from Fifteen Years ago is that it defined for me what futile is with in the ruling family\nNothing gets him because they are truly absolute monarchs within Saudi Arabia so it's you know you have to take all this into account in in the late eighties Britain\nSold a whole bunch of arms and it was like a decades long deal and it and it was called the all your mom of deal and it was clear from the start that there were\nPay off to this member of the royal family and pale stood that member you know and then and this was in I guess the first tranche of weapons was sold in eighty five eighty six eighty seven and in two thousand four and five they the serious fraught office finally started to investigate what was happening\nAnd then it was killed by the government because you know this is the way businesses done when you deal with Saudi Arabia you're dealing with a government unlike any other that we do a lot of business with\nSo I I my guess is that you know they will try and wait this out for as long as they can they will hope that um the Turks Turkish government does not\nRelease the sound of ... being tortured to death and dismembered and you know we'll we'll ... and and they can wait it out and then six months from now it will be I wouldn't say business as usual but it will be business resume\nWill say we're speaking to Michael Goldfarb the host and creator of the podcast first rough draft of history\nRavi ...
