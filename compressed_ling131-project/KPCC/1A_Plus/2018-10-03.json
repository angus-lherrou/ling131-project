also is located in the headquarters building just a few floors directly below the CIA directors office and as it happens just a few floors directly above where President Trump gives his first speech\nAt the CIA on his second day in office they're literally just a few floors above him working this problem even has he's speaking at the agency and that visit to the CIA\nDid not go over well at all\nNo it was a catastrophe I mean it was it's hard to overstate the the dismay hum that his visit caused and the damage that it did to the relationship I mean he um\nPeople thought hoped perhaps that he was coming to the CIA to try to mend fences because he had a lot of angry or words toward the agency during the campaign\nPeople thought that perhaps this was trying to sort of\nFixed that and it ended up being the opposite problem largely was because of where they put him right he comes out to give a speech they ended up setting them up on stage in front of\nThe wall of honor or the memorial wall I should say and it is a wall where there are a hundred or more hand ... stars for agency officials who have been killed in the line of duty is like a a a Arlington Cemetery and miniature for the CIA and so he gets up there gives this speech\nAnd immediately just becomes this self aggrandizing\nRent or he's talking about his crowd size up the odds are all about the than the media being the worst liars because they refused to acknowledge the enormity of his victory it's all about him and that you just can't do that in that spot\nThe the book takes the reader and a narrative tour it starts at the hack of the DNC we just talked about the prologue but it starts at the hack of the DNC goes right through to Helsinki ... the the summit between President Trump and president Vladimir Putin of Russia\nAnd you've reported on it there's been lots of reporting on it but one thing I've been curious about is ... how did the national\nSecurity um community the people that you cover and have been covering for years how did they react to that July press conference\nAnd how what was the reaction of the national security apparatus globally\nTo hearing what the president of the United states with saying next to the president of Russia\nThat's a that's a great question and it's great the way you frame that we just talked about his visit to the CIA and how\nProblematic that was I mean it's almost like a a book and it shows that even deep into his second year in office um he had he was not behaving any differently he was still saying things\nThat were just as infuriating to the CIA as he had been at the outset there had been no growth rate in his understanding of how U.S intelligence agencies work\nNo I'm no increased appreciation for what they do or or they're or let alone belief in their in their findings um so the reaction of Helsinki was um I think by and large people thought I saw that as I'm\nAs one of the most troubling episodes they had ever witnessed in terms of an American president standing beside another leader for an adversary of the United states and doing everything to side with that person over the United states government\nOr in the little time that we have left tried to do something of a of a rapid fire a series of questions have you seen evidence that not only the Russians interfered in the twenty sixteen election but they also succeeded in changing vote totals\nI think that that's an almost impossible to prove but almost impossible to deny at this point uh it just do the numbers are overwhelming we know that Facebook put more than a hundred million Facebook users so Russian propaganda tearing down Hillary Clinton helping Donald Trump this was an election decided by fewer fewer than eighty thousand voters you do the math\nPresident Trump it focuses on the steel Ducey a like a laser beam um says it's fake but from your reporting\nIs the dot CA fake\nI mean I dont see a is raw kind of it's a it's a sort of a private companies version of raw intelligence and a lot of it you know a lot of it remains I'm substantiated for instance we still don't know whether it's true that there that the Kremlin has some videotape or some other evidence of Trump with prostitutes in a room at the risk Carlton we don't know\nUm but a lot of the broad sweep of it has turned out to be accurate right the ... from the very first men on the Steele dossier it was describing a concerted campaign by Russia to throw the election of Trump\nAnd for those who are listening who side with the president and believe the president when he says that this whole Russia thing is a witch hunt is a hoax what would you say to them\nIt's absolutely not I mean I think that\nWe know so much more now I mean there there were certain T a year ago there is infinitely greater certainty now the mall or indictments have have been so compelling\nThat even CIA officials I talked to her astonished at the level of detail that Mueller has assembled that shows the involvement of Russian intelligence officials right down to the keyboards that they were using right to send this\n... this disinformation into the United states have the Russians stopped\nNo no I mean I think that\nThis was a perfect storm and twenty sixteen it's hard to know whether Russia could ever have\nThat kind of success again it was a confluence of a bunch of different things including their ideal candidate it's hard to know how they would fair you know trying to influence in mid term election in the United states or whether they could get away with it a second time around in the presidential contests\nI mean we know that they've tried it leads Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri has announced that the Russians I'm tempted to hack her Senate computer network or have you heard of or been made aware of other efforts in other states in this mid term elections\nOh yeah I think that there's there's a consensus that it's still under ... and ... and it just makes so much sense Jonathan ... what would why wouldn't Russia I mean what is it is experience are coming out of twenty sixteen this was an enormously successful operation with very little cost for Russia\nGreg Miller national security reporter for the Washington Post two time Pulitzer Prize winner and author of The Apprentice Trump Russia and the ... version

in the news it was once every three months and now it's multiple stories the day and I just feel like people have more space and\nThere's a lot more they know that they're not alone so it's so they're taking that risk\nProfessor Conan before we talk about some of your work researching the long term impact of sexual assault or I I Want to get into a bit of what this conversation is meant\nFor you as I understand it in the last few days your sister and her friends kind of re framed some of their memories from the past you get into that a bit if you would\nSure I'm so one of the things that struck me as the doctor for its testimony has led a lot of us to\nRevisit our own experiences in high school and college and my sister told me about attacks along tech she had with her college friends where and the text they were talking about how when they were in college in winter frat parties\nUm they knew not to go to the bathroom during the party because if you went to the bathroom during the party you'd be assaulted\nAnd she gave examples of friends who had gone to the bathroom during the party and when that's where this had happened\nAnd what was so striking to her now um I started in her forties is that\nThey accepted that she and her friends just accepted that in college as the norm and that's a sort of scared her made her side\nAnd also all of us have children today and thought you know that's not the norm we would want for our own our own kids um and that's the reframing that's going on is I'm not just remembering but also reexamining old experience as and questioning\nThe fact that we as women we accepted feeling unsafe that that was okay it wasn't something that anyone reported anyone um and that's really struck me as well\nLet me get to a clip from professor forwards testimony before the Senate Judiciary committee on Thursday where she describes some of the long term effects of her alleged assault listen\nWell I think that the sec ally of sexual assault varies by person so for me personally or anxiety Soviet and P TST like symptoms are the types of things that I've been coping with so I'm more specifically claustrophobia panic and that type of thing\nAnd just to clarify cycle lie or conditions that are the consequences of a previous disease a previous century aftereffects basically now those feelings that professor for described we're familiar to many of you many many many of you who called us with your own stories we've just been inundated here is some of what you left in our inbox\nWatching Mrs Blasey Ford testify was extremely powerful for me is that survivor of sexual assault\nMy heart goes out to her and I am so grateful for her bravery however I did not stop to think before viewing that it would cause me to have flashbacks of the one memory that stands out the most in my mind my assault the flashbacks and the PATS the are the hardest to deal with\nEven though I have suffered because of this for many years um I've never wanted to come forward and um this week has been a lot of reflecting for me I'm and I'm angry\nWhen a society going to stop putting the reputation of future of male attackers over the dignity and future of the women and they attacked because Fifteen Years later I still felt like I was drowning listening to those here this is brought up a lot of\nAnxiety and fear anger frustration\nOn hyper vigilant again like I was over that\nAnd [noise]\nAnd I just can only imagine how it's affecting other women in the country you are survivors\nThanks very much to all of you shared your stories with us we'll get some more of your stories in a moment but Lawrence Taylor many folks who wrote to us were contacted us said that professor forwards testimony was triggering give me some thoughts on what folks who have felt triggered by all of this might do\nTo take care of themselves yeah to take care of themselves to deal with that sense of being triggered\nSo ah hopefully most survivors and know what works for them\nThere's a range of things in the moment the the most important thing to do is no that you are here now and not back when it happened so that can take the form of feeling your feet on the floor\nFeeling the water as you drink it or just ... looking at the rumor around you and noticing oh this is blue oh this is textured um and and putting yourself in the current moment and then people\nOf tons of other strategies whether it's you know yelling into a pillow or petting the dog or gardening so that you feel the earth I'm most survivors in my experience no what helps them and and it can be very individual and that's the best thing to go to\nInteresting strategy kind of grounding yourself in the present to actively that I Know we have to pause and just devoted professor Conan at what point is it accurate or or helpful to refer to these symptoms as pie TST\n[noise] ... um first well the reacting to this testimony as normal it's normal to have to be upset and have a response but if there's um I think these women describing anxiety insomnia\nI'm being really hyper vigilant if it's lasting for weeks and it starts interfering with your life like you can't go to work\nUm you're having trouble you know losing it at your kids um you start to avoiding things that normally that you like to do and what that process than I Would say it's more into that Pete GST and more diagnostic um you know situation where that I Would say you need to get paid perhaps get help um\nTherapy arrogance do you have one um can be you know really helpful and Pete Jessie can be treated effectively and you can recover from it I have my self I treated people for it for 'em but that's really something of a if it's starting to protest that your your functioning as lasting forever you know in two weeks and months\nWe'll continue this conversation with professor ... toning and Lawrence Taylor in just a moment I'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one a firm W.

see any other in ten years this guy who was also you yes yes and so I was in shock and awe after they left you know he and his his brother left and and when I did\nI turned to my friend and I said you know that's that's the boy who raped me and my friend you know ran out the door I offensively and um and he was very angry going to confront them and I was able to stop him and you know my friends response um\nWas really jarring because it really made me rethink um about my own um\n[noise] you know my own response are non response and why wasn't either angry and this happened to me you know I'm I think as women we\nTend to ah want to be people pleaser and make everyone else around us feel comfortable and and not make I've seen 'em even on our own behalf even when we are entitled to\nA a real amount of of rage and um you can't help but feel that way watching Dr Ford testify or so composed about what had happened to her you know and you contrast that with the anger of her alleged assailant and I just think\nThe experience of of just the daily indignities that we go through um you know having to you know be polite she's someone who is your family and\nI mean I think I I think I had a breaking point watching her do that and others do that and and I just don't want to do that anymore\nI Do want to give out a hotline number by the way if this news cycle or this conversation is kind of triggering for you it's bringing up some traumatic memories and you need someone to talk to or if you need some help here is the number for the national sexual assault hotline here it is eight hundred\nSix five six for six seven three again eight hundred six five six for six seven three let's get to another\nOf your stories before we keep going geo emailed I'm uh forty seven year old survivor of sex trafficking\nI was brought into this country when I was fourteen years old from South America by US tourist I was too young to realize back then that my life was going to turn into physical and sexual exploitation two years ago the thoughts I buried so deep resurface so vividly the thoughts of killing myself were constant\nI recently got help with therapy and medication but what happened last week during the court hearings hurts so much as we survivors have been put down his crazy and irrational\nLorna you nodding I Would love to get your thoughts on what's the Kavanaugh hearings will mean for survivors leads to a few more comments about that because we've gotten several to that effect\nCat treated as a survivor of the hardest part of the debate over the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh has been mocking attacking and dismissive remarks made by friends and family even as I have shared my story I have been dismissed as being emotional\nAnd another listener texted I'm a psychologist seeing clients for therapy between Wednesday and Thursday I heard two people sexual assault stories for the first time along with their beliefs but no one would believe them if they told\nYou I also had a client return to something we talked about a year ago a domestic violence incident which are a strange abusive husband was able to convince a court was her fault\nI'm convinced that if Kavanaugh is confirmed now it will have a chilling effect on women's tried to charge men with sexual and physical assaults Lauren this is\nA really important part of the conversation so I'm as a survivor myself I\nHad a really hard time when Clarence Thomas was a approved whatever the word it would come from ... from ... um because I felt like it ... it was it was all the people in power\nSaying to all the survivors we don't believe you and you don't matter\nUm\nBecause of that and the memories of that which I Do feel in my body that moment when when the yes vote went through I did not watch\nI'm Christine Blasey Ford's and jet Brett Kavanaugh's testimony it I just felt too unbearable to me I Do think that uh assuming that he gets confirmed a\nIt will be different not that it isn't the people in power are saying we don't believe you and you don't merit matter there is still that and it will still feel that powerful to many many survivors\nAt the same time now we're hearing\nHundreds of people saying me too I share your story this happened to me mine was slightly different and\nI'm with you and and people saying I have your back I Believe you so I think the cultural context while we have a long way to go has really shifted um and\nThat progress won't be taken away\nProfessor Conan I Know we have to pause momentarily but what do you think about the possible effects on survivors of the capital confirmation process before we have to break\nI'm hoping that the effects are you know in the long term positive that the public conversation\nOn the other guests have said um [noise]\nHelps people to feel that they're not alone um and that at least some people have their back as even as again having even if he gets confirmed I'm I've also seen there's been a lot of public evidence of men coming out in support and powerful men and women um and shows like this one so\nI'm hoping that and the longer term it will be positive for sexual assault survivors generally and they'll be a sea change 'em that we'll see they'll have ripple effects on the line\nI Would love to get your sense of the roles that men play in this me too movement particularly men who have been the offenders Jaime tweeted a male perspective is needed to move the needle other men need to hear from men who have been the perpetrator and why they did it\nI think some and can't get why a guy would do this to begin with me to understand that part in order to believe the women more\nWhat role should men be playing in this meat you moment will try to get some
