R. A. in Nineteen eighty two to finally\nRadical become ratified is a kind of open sore right I mean we see that at the moment I mean we thinking about the need to continue to press for a proper uh reporting and prosecution of sexual assault and sexual harassment cries crimes\nThat is just ... a piece\nOf the failure of the equal rights amendment like what it means as a as a kind of a another contributor to political these ... does equilibrium so I think a lot of that ... between Democrats and Republicans\nThat went on in the Nineteen seventies in Nineteen eighties over E R a\nI think a lot of this is kind of the tail end of end of that it's obviously it's got a lot to do with Obama's election as well and racial politics of the country I don't mean to diminish that I just read is that I don't really think we've quite sorted out what it really was about just yet well\nI ... since you brought up um ... the conversation that we're having about a sexual assault and I mean ... the country is going through the hearings of judge Brett Kavanaugh his Supreme Court nomination\nThe testimony of Dr Christine Blasey Ford um who\nUm alleges that he he sexually assaulted her when they were in in high school and um when you're the historian I Know it's I Know it's it's like the current ... but how does this fit\nWhere would you place this moment that we're in the conversation that we're having as a country where do you place it in the arc of American history\nSo I guess there's two arcs where I Would situated one has to do with sexual equality and sexual violence and that's the one that everyone is talking about 'cause it's just I mean the [noise]\nIt's just a viscerally in confronting us write the whatever your views are about it or your personal experiences\nIs an incredibly painful story right I mean I think everybody agrees the whole thing is quite painful and that because it's a visceral and so I think the media and personal from so many people\nAre men and women that it's hard to see it as anything but another chapter in kind of a culture war about sex and for a long tailed sexual revolution\nBut the other lands that as a historian seems to me maybe structurally more important is\nThe dramatic change in the process of Supreme Court confirmation so recall that the in the constitutional convention the president chose the\nSupreme Court nominee and at the last minute sort of Senate approval was added but the public isn't doesn't have a role in choosing of the Supreme Court or the nominee now or the confirmation Supreme\nCourt and in fact for most of the nineteenth century Supreme Court nominees never went to the committee is just to the Senate just voted like you know the president made in set a name and said I said yes\nIt is a ... and it's not until Nineteen twenty five ... any nominee even appears before the committee like we think this is just an unnecessary part of the process for some kind of constitutional requirement\nAnd the guy prison I was just because he's actually suspected of crime [laughter] next guy to appear in Nineteen thirty nine there are rumors that he's a communist and so he comes before the committee says no I'm not a communist I've never been a communist\nAnd the only reason they call in because the last guy from Nineteen thirty seven it turned out he had been a member of the KKK and after he was affirmed people like to bring before the committee and asked me was remember to get get get so\nWhat we what are the sort of limits like\nGuilty of a crime of member of the KKK a communist what would have enough sense accused of is our version of that right but it's still a weird thing that we all sit and watch the proceedings that\nDoesn't start until Nineteen eighty seven was Robert Bork which I think is really better understood as the last of the Watergate hearings because Bork had been involved in that Nixon solicitor general [noise]\nBut where we are now is\nRemember when uh Mitch McConnell said when he when a convened a hearing over the Merrick Garland nomination that he wouldn't do that because the American people had a right to choose the next Supreme Court justice because he was going to wait for the election right that's just not\nTrue like that actually constitutionally is not how we choose our Supreme Court justices the American people do not choose the next Supreme Court justice but it's totally reckless thing for him to have said it's just for the short term political gain he just didn't want to have you know he wanted to have a different I Want to have a conservative on on the court\nAnd he was willing to throw away anything any reasonable sense of fairness art\nProcedure to do that and but you think about that creep of that and here with the cabinet\nProceeding and the kind of everybody watching it in the middle of the work day and tweeting about it\nIt does is somehow in a de facto sense people believe that like by Twitter we should just decide who the Supreme Court cases\nAnd I mean I suppose someone could say that's how we should do it but that was actually not what the the provision the separation of powers that uh the constitution dictates so we make a different decision but I I just think structurally terms of you to get your course like in the long arc of American history what is this about\nIt is actually about a very we sense that the Supreme Court\nIs answerable sprinklers be insulated from public opinion that's why they're lifetime appointments and they're not elected\nFinal question what would you say to people what would you tell people who are are dismayed by the current Tanner and tone of politics or where they might feel history is going what would you would you tell them\nWhere I share that concern unreal alarm or in a number of places but one is\nBecause our partisanship has become automated so the deep polarized positions of the parties\nWere created manually by hand by political consultants and campaigns in the Nineteen seventies in Nineteen eighties\nBut starting in the Nineteen nineties with the opening of the Internet to commercial traffic and certainly in the first decade of the twenty first century with social media does that part of an inch of became fully automated so I think a lot of people would like a less polarized political conversation\nBut until we demand more

S. abandoning human rights advocacy and building authoritarian regimes I pray Mr ... is against all odds alive\nRob I Wonder how you would respond to that I don't think the u._s. has really been particularly heavy on Saudi Arabia on its human rights record for an array of reasons that may have to do with oil and with our military\nYeah absolutely I mean you know a Saudi Arabia is a strategic ally of the United states and many Western European countries it also happens to by tens of billions of dollars of defense equipment and I'm from the U.S\nAnd is able to act as a bulwark against Iran and the region as far as the U.S is concerned so it's had especially under the current administration a pass on human rights in fact President Trump if you remember that picture of him holding a Golden Globe act at an exhibition last year in a\nIn Saudi Arabia with the king and with the a president of Egypt\nWhere the Saudi Arabia is portraying itself as a Martin and reforming nation\nUh this year the crown prince has allowed people to go to the cinema\nAnd allowed women to drive but all the women that campaigned\nFor the right to drive a car have being silenced or have been jailed in other words\nThe king the crown prince does not want it to be seen that he changed his mind and relax some of the controls because of pressure from groups of activists women know he wants to be that he gave it to the ... to the country as a gift\nSo there is there is no room for meaningful political dissent or meaningful independent and critical voices whether journalists or human rights defenders in Saudi Arabia under the new crown prince\nSo what happens now what's the next step in this saga that we should be keeping an eye out for\nWell we need a countries like the United states the u._k. and other countries that have influence with ties with Saudi Arabia to demand answers and this particular case full of journalists ...\nWhere is the what has happened to him you say he's not in the conflict well he was last seen in your constantly wherever they say we need a secular state from pale and others start asking those questions even if they're uncomfortable for our allies in the Gulf\nI just want to get to the rest of that list I Know some of you may be curious what the other seven countries are on C. D. J. lifted the ten most sense of countries ... first the north Korea then Saudi Arabia force is Ethiopia then Azerbaijan Vietnam Iran eight is China ninth is Myanmar intense\nIs Cuba and one of the things that you know in this list is that imprisonment is the most effective form of intimidation harassment that's used this would seem to be an escalation if Mr ... has been killed as opposed to jailed\nYes it would be a very very disturbing ... escalation because you now have extra territorial extrajudicial killing if that is in fact the case um murder of journalists is quite common in many countries even here on our own border in Mexico we have\nNumerous assassinations of journalists that have crossed organized crime for example but we've not seen it uh as as a weapon of repression in many of the middle east countries for a long time jailing has been the ah\nThe weapon of choice to silence critical journalist so that if it is true that he was killed in that a consulate that this would be a very very disturbing escalation\nI Wonder if by way of wrapping up the conversation if you give us a sense of kind of where press freedom stands around the globe\nIn two days ago this female journalist Victoria Marin over who was killed in Bulgaria journalist just don't die for their work in the U.S last time I can remember a journalist being killed here\nWas shot see Bailey in two thousand seven in Oakland and there was such outrage the journalist from every other news organization got together and finished his corruption report for him and got the people involved in his murder thrown in jail\nThis just isn't something we feel in a country where we revere the first amendment I mean that is what one a our program is named after the first amendment\nBefore we let you go do do you have a ... can you give us just a better sense as Americans have what we should be thinking right now in terms of press freedom around the globe especially because I often we take it for granted here\nYeah we need to have we need to defend the values that are on bodies in the first amendment\nAnd the rule of law and one of the ways that you do that is by making sure your own houses in order so it's extremely disturbing to me when I see the press being undermined\nBy the kind of corrosive rhetoric that we now get in the political debate here where journalists mocked\nThe work is belittled and their role as the guardians of democracy is total is is totally dismissed so let's get our own house in order to make sure that we are defending press freedom and the rights of the media here and then we can work to try to improve things overseas\nAnd indeed we didn't have that shooting this summer in Maryland at the offices of the capital Gazette as well rod Mahoney the deputy director of the committee to protect journalists Rob thanks for talking to us thank you it was a pleasure coming up we'll talk about what's happening at the state level with redistricting across the country I'm Joshua Johnson and you're listening to one a\nFirm W.

Democrats depending who had been doing the most recent gerrymandering 'em and none of them had ever even been adopted up into a vote so heats up pretty quickly that that was not a good rap to go um so then I think a lot of us really felt like we're tired of compromise um\nPoliticians don't have a large incentive to give themselves less power so if we're going to make this systemic change then it really does have to come for and by the people of our state because otherwise it's going to be a solution that just continues on putting power and\nI'm with politicians are special interest instead of the actual people so it's really been amazing though I mean we had thousands of people did these town halls thirty three and thirty three days where we went\nAnd talked to people about what is gerrymandering what does it look like in Michigan what does it look like in other states and then we had a big long survey asking people their preferences and who do you think should draw these lines and how how should we be drawing these districts what kind of data should be years and then how do you want the process to luck\nAnd it really has been um a statewide effort and all eighty three counties and Michigan which has been a really inspiring a thing to be a part of\nRepulsed and can you walk us through the ballot measures in four states they would be changing or they will charge independent commissions with redistricting instead of legislators can you just quickly kind of run through what those for initiatives are\nSo the force days you talked to Katie in Michigan Missouri has something on the ballot to Colorado and Utah are the two other states and by and large the um the contours of these ballot measures are larger the fame they would create independent commissions you know their their differences on on the margins in terms of\nThe number of people on the commission's or how they're appointed or things like that\nBut those conditions would include\nSome Democrats some Republicans and crucially or independent or unaffiliated voters and in most cases those unaffiliated voters have to vote or with the the a super majority\nWhich would probably include at least some members from the minority party to a show that everybody has a stake in the final maps and and the point is to\nAh pass maps that at least pass muster with some members of both parties are in order to come up with some kind of\nA comprehensive an unfair process that's what's happened in Ohio earlier this year the\nAnd that's the really the the template that Arizona and California the two real pioneers in this independent commission did in the after the two thousands when when the first real effort to reform this came up and we're seeing that in\nOur efforts to do this in most states where there are aware ballot measures are uh are are allowed where citizens are allowed to put measures on the ballot or they're at least some rumblings about other initiatives of this type or coming up in future years\nDavid it seems like one of the challenges with making these commissions is what the composition of them would be I Wonder what you see in terms of the the the nitty gritty of how these commissions come together and what the party compositions of them are and what impact that has\nI think that's exactly right these commissions really are only as good as the people who serve on them the way that they're chosen and then the criteria that they are given to do their work\nAnd what you see in many states where the commissions are essentially um appointed by the political process so so say a bipartisan commission that works in\nIn Washington state or in New Jersey and these are essentially incumbent\nProtection gerrymander is these are both parties that coming together in a dividing up the seats\nSo David how did we were ... I Know we're coming up to a break I hate to cut you short and we're having a little bit of a glitch in his own your ally not your fault but we'll learn that out during the break but it sounds like what you're saying is that\nYou have these nonpartisan commissions were they basically appoint bureaucrats to go to draw the lines than these bipartisan commission's where existing partisans try to work their differences out and then you have a place like California where the goal is to kind of in power citizens to draw the districts themselves\nI think that's exactly right California and these other initiatives this year as well you know Colorado and Michigan are trying to find actual citizens to do this and California certainly proved that actual citizens can do this and do it really well\nWe'll continue our conversation in just a moment with David daily senior fellow at fair vote read Wilson national correspondent for the field and Katie Fay he's the founder and executive
