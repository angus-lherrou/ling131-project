{"month": "11", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Oh thank you happy to be with you or you know in the second congressional district of Maine is the [laughter] the only congressional district that said\nThey are they give you gave in electoral votes or to Donald Trump in this past election so we're a little bit unique here in New England and ah I Am voting my hopes this uh this time around a high my hope is that the uh\nThe the potential for a blue wave turns into a little tiny little trickle which I think it kind of as I'm In my big issue is that\nYou know the Democratic party of today has gone so far to the left that it is absolutely not the Democratic party of your parents of your grandparents it is a leftist\nParty that has really just not operated in the best interest of the American citizens degree and I think we can we can see that by\nBy their actions towards illegal immigration or where they take the side of the illegals over the or the citizens of this country and time\nAgain and I think you know even up here in Maine um immigration is a big deal to us not so much because ah we're on the border but it's the law and order type of thing and you know if you think the average American\nI'm most average Americans have never been committed over ... I've never committed a crime they've never been to jail\nOr they're the only uh engagement along with law enforcement is likely a speeding ticket right I think people regularly resent people illegally sneaking across our border and thumbing their nose at the law that is a big issue with me and my family\nLike a bomb and let me ask you a question just as devil's advocate because as you you you say that the Democratic party has gone so far left what you say to those who say the Republican Party has gone so far to the right that it has lost touch\nWith the vast middle of the country\nI say ... put a definition at exactly what are you talking about\nI I don't see the the the the Republican Party in my opinion in some cases going for her right enough you know it seemed to me that almost ten years ago the difference between the Republicans and Democrats was was negligible now the Democrats are the ones who really made a big shift\nAnd went way to the left and have left the middle of the country are you know far behind\nI think you know that that's what we saw in the election of Donald Trump is you know these people that nobody accounted for\nThese people that you know that that no one thought you know in flyover country would make a difference it made a huge difference and and I think that the Democrats who have made the big move to the to the extremes now Republican\nAll right Bob I appreciate your calling in Bob is calling in from a ... main I think he said the second congressional district the only um district in Maine to give electoral vote to President Trump video\nWell Bob did say something that I I I wanted to take issue with but I'm just just so for everybody who's listening and and this has nothing to do with with the politics of it it's a term um you saw me cringe when he said the beagles he actually bought actually said that Bob from Maine said the illegals\nAnd um you know illegal is not an down\nThere is no such thing as any legal human beings so when when Bob says that it's like wait a second\nYou mean you're talking about human beings who um who don't have a legal right to be in this country who may have overstayed their visa but that does not make them any legal person so Bob with all due respect I'm a human there is no such thing as an illegal human dean and\nIllegals is not a noun\nOr let's go to\nToby in Montgomery County Pennsylvania Toby thank you for calling into America on the line\nThey ah I really appreciate you are giving me the chance to speak and also for her than we shall\nServe thank you\nAre you heard in Europe one or two star get now are you voting your hopes of your fears\nYeah uh I have to be honest you know I don't think I could vote for\n... for a number two I Would say I'm more hopeful I don't believe there's a point to be ... I Would be in that spot right when I'm standing guard but a ... of course I'm voting a little bit in my career\nAnd to expand on that one of my reasons I'm more hopeful than fearful is because as I can sing these past few months\nComment Pennsylvania in Montgomery County um which is a pretty ... say where I are are are pretty blue and red state where I live in fact we weren't for Donald Trump um some of my friends are a big Trump fans\n... myself went for Hillary Clinton because I thought she valued conservative um\nPolicies even though I don't agree with everything ready to Don especially when it comes to things like ... door where she had a crew um which is why people are coming from they're\nEven Ronald Reagan how are you know over throw that whole banana republic and people aren't really understanding that these people are legally\nSeeking asylum writer America it's actually illegal Donald Trump to stop them right and against the party comment ... act that my right pronouncing that right or\nRight Toby I ... I'm Sorry to cut you off I'm Toby calling from Montgomery County Pennsylvania thank you very much for calling into America on the line in the Ninety seconds that I have left I Do want to get to a Christian in Brooklyn um who's called in and she says she's voting her\nAnger what are you angry about Christian real quickly [noise]\nSure I'm I'm a number of a Jewish congregation\nAnd my values teach me to honor the dignity of every person immigrant women transgender people in the attacks\nOn our communities and has been a a an attack on our our values and our say this is a country that claims to believe in God and claims to ... and claims to be a godly country we have to ask ourselves\nWhat does it mean to what is godly look\nLike when we're treating our fellow human beings the way that we're treating them right now\nYou know what what we're picking up on here is the rage of women\nUm which is something that we cannot dismiss in these midterms we don't exactly know I'm not like we're doing specific polling on how women's anger and rage is pushing them but I think this caller actually points to something that we cannot forget the anger and rage that many women are feeling\nDepressed and I really appreciate your calling into America on the line Kevin rubble art in Phoenix thank you very much for hanging on a throughout the hour of the show there in Phoenix and thanks to all of our guests tonight\nAnd thanks to you for listening joined us again tomorrow and I remember as always you can tweet us at A.

Stevens the man accused of killing eleven people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh is now facing forty four federal counts as W E essays only herring reports today's indictment include some new charges\nVery very late at night in trucks roll around the neighborhood with the lights out for several hours\nThe trucks would slow down to a crawl and we were trying like a silently open the doors just are just now from the truck without slamming anything or making any noise\nWalk through the neighborhood as ... as you can\nWe reached like the target house\n[noise] basically from there you just just break\nIn [noise] and then a set of hide and just pull over watch over the sector and just wait basically for someone to do something a grimy like digging a hole to bury an ID\nAnd then a weed respond accordingly\nAnyways yeah we would have probably at least six hours notice that we were going to be a stepping off\nEarly before heading out on whether I think I think that you would fear like do you remember anything about those moments\nWhen I can remember one time and it ended up becoming a pre mission ritual 'cause ... had a really great sound system and he'd be like dude we're about to get pumped up for this mission press play [noise]\nThe any in the ... decibels just cranking met out there and the jets became more an film [noise]\n... like you're in a hundred and twenty pounds worth of kids and scrambled to the top of the truck get your weapon mounted [noise] I was a gun I had my head about the top just scanning scanning like a maniac when you're moving across open ground\nWall scanning\nSweating profusely\nFeminine like I I Know this public radio says analogy would probably never make it on air but it really is like just doing a fat rail [noise]\nTo have eight guys moving in a in a file of through a neighborhood it's the it's the point of the mission where you're most expose where you're most vulnerable\nYou have to maintain almost complete silence because aside from the sound of the wind maybe some dogs barking there is no sound\nLike so for Seventy two hours straight it's like basically like I'm being in church because any sounds could like compromise you and potentially get every body that you love killed\nAt the moment that story takes place\nHow long had you been in country or how many of the nation to have you been\nSo this was probably the seventh or eighth mission that I'd been on the mission started out typically it felt completely the same as any other mission\nSo it's probably like a around midnight or one or one or two o'clock in the morning\nApproached the building and before I even got in like a chance to drop my rock like my best friend comes up to me and uh he just looks really shook him up\n\nAnd he's like do there's something wrong here there's just something bizarre so immediately walking in this place the first thing that I noticed was this Sam [noise]\n\nThere's been no way it sounded almost like a like a broken radio interview down the hall [noise]\nJust [noise]\nCompletely [noise] a tone I'm entirely disquieting on hold some sad [noise]\nAlmost sounded like a of congregation of whispers [noise]\nLike thousands of voices trying to communicate something but in a completely non going\nReally won the the point where I felt like something was really different this time [noise]\nI decided that you know it was going to look around some of the upper floors so as I was walking around like that the second story I came into this one room that it was\nCompletely stripped bare simple cement\n... [noise] I don't know what ... some some too but I turned to face teary or wrong\nAnd I just saw that the goal was pockmarked with bullet home with round so I was standing there looking at these pockmarked wall it just seemed like something wasn't right that these they weren't typical\nLeader and showed me this like pencil trick you can insert like a pencil and into like small arms fire against a wall hotel you like the direction that the fired come from\nSo this being the second story I put the pimps them into the world and it's a very little to the ground just sticking in like\nIt meant that those\nShots had been fired straight across\nSoon as I step that pencil and everything fell into place this\nHad been killed room but they had to wind people up\nIn here and just executed them and I just felt a little keys in my stomach standing in a kill house [noise]\nInstantly just felt like the walls just collapsed in on themselves don't really claustrophobic and I just needed to get into the room\nIt seemed like there was a maligned presence there [noise]\nThat was trying to get\nSomebody killed and it was totally inexplicable\nYou have to imagine that all of this is under the backdrop under the soundtrack of this just this before [noise]\nJust this ever present oral presents\nThis feeling that you were feeling well the only thing I really didn't know what that like the ball and like anxiety and\nThere's like a there's an under current attention\nIt wasn't like a we all huddled together in a circle enter trading back and forth there was people would pair off with their best friend and be like do you would not believe what just happened nobody's going to talk about that because you're showing weakness I think that if one\nPerson were to stand up and be like goes kind of scary we would have written them apart\nSo we're left with all of this downtime and so you have now like half a dozen twenty year old children and one of the number one pastimes on these as Katie's is looting someone is like hey there's a storage unit down first floor\nAnd that immediately became something that all of us jumped onto\nBecause it it gives you a chance I guess like a to prove that you're not afraid to know goes to prove that that you're not scared as soon\nAs that call goes out like yeah you know what yeah yeah yeah man all\nAll route to these people that I Know business and it's almost like a an affront to whatever was there\nIt was just like a a gated off a unit on the first floor and I walked over there and you're not really yeah basically like a storage space I mean exactly like a storage space and there's just a very simple\nSymmetrical wrought iron gate on front [laughter]\nDoes wrought iron gates are so loud that three of us walked up and got really low to the ground and just grab the gay on the bottom and just lived a quarter inch\nAnd then quietly walk backwards so that the gates not rubbing against the ground so that it wouldn't be allowed at all\nWe left the gate like prop all the way home and [noise]\nSo I think about half a dozen of us go into this a storage unit\nOf turn the tables chairs closing decorations silverware\nAll kinds of things it smells like dust\nBowl\nAnd it's pitch black\nAnd the only light\nIn the storage area is coming from or a little a little red tack like [noise] it's already like three layers of spooky like we couldn't even use our ... and the space are night vision goggles because it's so dark there's so little\nAmbient light and not really for looting anyways because uh you know you really want to yeah needed there's there's an art to this horrible practice\nSaw it I don't like my best friend just unload on him [noise]\nAnd I get to and I was like in a whisper in in which promotes like what the hell is wrong with you do why would you do that but she had no idea what\nI was talking about force he was concerned we went and checked it out everybody came out only together\nAnd that was it\nAt this point I'd been in the building for maybe eight hours I'm ready to go home now this is a very not been a pleasant experience for me I imagine that\nFor some people that would be really easy to dismiss this like as nerves or you know what the stress like a\nBattle yeah trauma things like that but the thing to keep in mind to doubt that is this was one of maybe fifty missions that I went out on but nothing\nEver like there's nothing ever that came so close that was so blatant\nLike a a force\n[noise] or as the sun comes up the gun trucks full of and we exit the building [noise]\nThis is how just stupid\nYou are at Twenty years old those paintings they stayed in my rock I brought those things back\nSo I'm back in my room\nIn the barracks and uh take these things out and I'm like hey check out the coup paintings that I got in a ... our platoon medic is in their news like I I Would very much like to have that and I'm like no way to know this is my decoration I went through the haunted house for this this is my prize I'm keeping it thank you sir\nSir cagey leaves and Sam comes in one of our Turks one of our interpreters Sam and I was like what the hell is up with that place dude like it's really really weird and he's like oh yeah like that pleases unclean [noise]\n\nIt was like well what do you mean it's an ... like there are many people died in that building so it's an clean and no one goes there\n[noise]\nWhen he said that [noise]\nYou really are brought home to me what had happened [noise]\n\nAnd it's such a thing to admit it flies which which I think but I figured that painting\nAnd that was like hey get do you guys know where to go and he went where I Want to you know what I found cagey and it was like ... really special to you\nI'd really like for you to have this in a cave it away\nPart of a crowd of ... or ...\n... for um just fighting back in a way that that had no military um\nThat wouldn't come into way way later now looking back all of these years later I have a lot of respect for whatever that thing was it was able to scare me\nI felt like any ways like I I got my comeuppance five months after this whole episode in may is when I got hit by a ... or car bomb [noise]\nEven the fear was not as scary as that experience for the simple fact that I felt like if I call it around in the noodle I'd be dead if I got ripped apart by an explosion I'd be dead but whatever was inside of that structure\nIt felt like if you were to die in its present that it would have like a completely different set of consequences than if you were to die just a out insect or somewhere like a you could become like a trapped [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] the\nBank you Dallas says just for sharing your story with us [noise] Dallas also wants to take his
