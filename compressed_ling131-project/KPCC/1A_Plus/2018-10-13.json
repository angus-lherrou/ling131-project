Jay Z and works along the border I asked him how Trump is doing on this biggest promising\nRight now give it a breakdown so Mexico in the U.S Sheera two thousand model boundary about six hundred and fifty miles of that have some sort of sense and that's that's two types uh there's either the bothered style walls which are ah\nBars of steel set about four inches apart going up Fifteen or so feet high and an underground along parts of the U.S Mexico border than the other half of those six hundred and fifty miles is is ah we we call Norman defense um desert X shaped\nA cross bars or railroad rail that's been welded this is intended to stop cars not people um ten twelve years ago we had a big problem with people just driving into the U.S let alone walking\nSo the vehicle barriers were designed to stop that sort of movement does is primarily drug traffickers are they worked but this leaves Thirteen hundred and fifty miles\nWide open that's canyons that's a river banks and that's a flat wide open areas that are have no real physical barrier there separating them from Mexico\nBecause you can't a lot of that is constantly moving you know you you can't build a fence on a river when the river banks keep moving on you\nThe other piece of this promise was that don't worry Mexico will pay for this there been any movement at all in any real negotiations for Mexico actually funding in some way construction of this well no\nNo I'm the closest that anyone has gotten to talking about Mexico paying for the wall\nIs some have suggested a putting a penalty on undocumented immigrants others have suggested going after she know low in drug cartel owners in Mexico who've been arrested or hear any of us who've been extradited\nBut as far as Mexico formally cutting a check for making any sort of payment now it just has not been a sober conversation that's taking place in those fortresses of diplomacy\nSo where are we on the on the funding for this and how did we get here\nYou got to go back to two thousand five is border fences and wall started being erected along primarily the Arizona border and by two thousand eight when president ... Obama took office it sped up and\nThat's when they finish those six hundred and fifty miles\nNow we're we're getting these seem styles yeah we're we're not talking about the president's big beautiful wall we're talking to see him prototypes that were put up ten years ago are going up in fact this week the homeland security department started building new gates at the border and the sudden most part of Texas\nTo same style the ball it's just now being talked about as if it's a new project but it's not\nYeah this money was your what you're saying is it was already allocated and would have been going up whether Donald Trump was president or not we\nHave Congress Congress approved one point six billion dollars for border security and enhancement for this year's budget right out of that that what we're talking about and they very specifically word of it that they wanted existing infrastructure projects no new laws no nothing of these new a border wall prototypes\nCurrently sitting in San Diego area but rather tried untested drew bothered style walls and Norman defense to be added along along parts of the border\nSo any new fencing or barrier an any threat that has gone up since Donald Trump is president can he adequately defined that as a success for his pledge to put a wall all across the southern border\nNo and and I'm going back to specifically to his executive order as executive order from January twenty Seventeen mandated a very specific types of walls that what's going up now does not fit the definition of\nNow if you ask the politicians and people in charge of for example homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen uh this is what she said last spring when she was talking about this being Trump's new all\nTo us is on the wall if\nThere is a while before that needs to be replaced it seeing or if I knew all this is the Trump border off what\nThey're saying there is a yes it's Trump's border wall so it's the border wall however it is not because when you look at the when you look at what the executive order signed off on like what they what they contracted people to build\nWere prototypes in San Diego that are supposed to we're supposed to be very specific types of walls that are anti breaching anti scaling you're not supposed to be able to dig under them\nFor supposed to be made of concrete for of steel and other materials and those prototypes are sitting there there were there were breached during a test last month\nSo they're continuing to work on those but that's not what's going up in Texas today and that's not going up in Arizona\nWe tell them or east coast senior editor of the front parents asked for K. Jay Z [noise]\n\nOn the campaign trail candidates make a lot of promises and they should be held to account for them as president President Trump has checked a lot of boxes he's gotten too conservative judges on the Supreme Court he's renegotiated or dropped out of trade deals he's cracked down on immigration on top of all of that the economy's coming along\nFailed to follow through on some big ones too from repealing and replacing Obamacare the building that great big beautiful wall\nWhat do you think Trump has lived up to his promises depends a lot on how you identify politically\nEverything people found that just twenty percent of Democrats like eighty five percent of Republicans\nBelieve the president keeps the promises but we also know that voters evaluate presidents on more than policy they have to take a measure of the man and his leadership and morality to sounds to explain why fight a good economy and lots of promises either made her in the work\nThe president's job approval rating average is an anemic forty two percent\nThis November voters will weigh in on whether they like the way the president and his party are leading the country\nAnd they can all come down to Trump's biggest promise of all do you believe he's making America great\nThat evaluation will have consequences for the next two years\nThanks so much for listening I'm Amy Walter and this is the take away [noise]\n\n... ... there are four weeks until the mid term elections and voter enthusiasm is high but most people don't vote in the mid term be one of the main\nReasons why I don't know about it and they did they say that I'm always made the I don't know what I Need to bring\nI thought I was being disenfranchised forever I don't believe that it actually is a factor of who is in voting and what what\nChange if they did next time on the politics show from NPR\nSaturday to one eighty nine point three K PCC\nFriday nights check out the newest part of the Cape BCC voter game\nPlan I'm Amy Walter and today on the take away what's a moderate to do it's still\nNot normal to have a whole bunch of women running for Congress politics with Amy Walter the takeaway Friday nights at seven\nTwenty Eighteen American leadership no longer looks as break my first guest is a man who finds himself boxed out of a party he once ran\nPart of the Cape PCC voter game plan so basically just another crazy Newsweek in Washington\n... supporters include the James Irvine foundation expanding economic and political opportunity for Californians were working but struggling with poverty [noise] more at Irvine dot org [noise]\n[noise]\nThis is eighty nine point three K BCC Pasadena Los Angeles community service of Pasadena City College number one and associate degrees but transfer in Southern California learned more at Pasadena dot edu\nOften we talked about the latest firestorm in Washington but this week a real storm hurricane Michael cause catastrophic damage and death what's next with the recovery\nFrom W.

California is asking where the heck is that the home of the resistance against that Donald Trump\nAnd certainly on this issue that's been the case here chair question governor Jerry Brown has made the fight against climate change a signature issue\nHe'll joke about how he's going to be long gone by the time of the worst case scenario is kind of get past but he's really trying to make and California be seen as a leader at a time when the feds are pushing back\nAgainst the science and and you heard Donald Trump that the tone that he's taken on that in that soundbite you just played\nIn in terms of being able to deal with the challenge this big it's also worth noting that the Nobel Prize in economics went out at the start of this week to poll Romer and William Nord house the two of them had been studying the economics of climate change Nord house has endorsed a universal carbon tax\nRumors research shows that humans are innovative enough to solve a challenge even as big as climate change perhaps that's the reason\nFor some hope we're here at ... speaking to ... and corresponded with the California report political journalist Todd's willing and Shane Harris of the Washington Post\nBill wrote on our Facebook page I wrote out to meal at ... air force base in Nineteen sixty nine so this level of destruction looks familiar capitals in Mississippi by the way\nJohn come and sit on our Facebook page can you please discuss the national flood insurance program\nAnd how it's past patterns of payouts contributes to financial losses\nBy tacitly encouraging people who live in flood plains to stay where they are we actually did a program about flood insurance that I Would refer you to a jaundiced so you can hear in a little more depth you'll find that on line\nAt the one eight dot org but a Todd's will look I think it's worth noting that the policy questions around what we do with these big storms are getting more present\nAnd it seems like more urgent particularly with reports like the one that came up this week on on climate change\nMany more devastating storms do we have to see in this country and others before Americans collectively and their leaders take this threat seriously you had sort of shrug a response from the president of the United states from here inside the beltway responses\nAnd Republicans on Capitol Hill who were asked about there were the report this week Joshua and the responses range from dismissive to\nA joke ally dismissive of senators making jokes I might as well sprout wings and fly to Mars I mean just in order\nOrder blindness on the part of some of our leaders ah I'll bring you back to professor ... you mentioned in he did win the Nobel Prize for endorsing the carbon tax the AC DC cc says that a carbon tax now at this point\nMay never get us to the point of carbon reductions that we need and maybe there was a little bit of optimism at the base of the report but professor in our household ... quote because it was remarkable to me it's hard to be optimistic\nAnd we're actually going backward in the United states with the disastrous policies of the Trump Administration those are the words of the man who just won the Nobel Prize for economics for his work\nUh on on carbon reduction\nWe'll continue our conversation on this just a moment was Todd's will like Shane Harris and Luigi Molly coming up\nTaylor Swift and Kanye West to have a long history of celebrity rivals in this week they showed their political stripes at different ends of the spectrum\nAlso talked about reaction here in the U.S to what could be the murder of a leading Saudi journalist by the Saudi Government ... had been living in Virginia and there is growing concern about his fate wall so it gets more of your questions and thoughts as well\nI'm Joshua Johnson glad to be with you from San Francisco you're listening to one and from W.

Harris of Washington Post and lose your Molly of kick you eat is California report before we move on from the weather and climate Louis there was one more thing you want to\nJump yeah I just wanted to I can mention you know ... the other guy who won the Nobel Prize in economics this week at talking about carbon taxes being the solution to to this crisis at least in part\nAnd and you know I think it's important to recognize that sounds punitive but I think there is a positive message that he's trying to put out there and that is if you commit to a tax on carbon not only are you dealing with that issue head on but you're also in his view\nUm people who have thrown out Bob Corker his name he's currently chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee not Donald Trump ally and as of January first not a senator anymore he's retiring it's going to be looking for a job probably hoping to make more money than he would make if you were UN ambassador again those two gentlemen\nDon't get along but also President Trump does have a a demonstrated history of getting over it if you want somebody to serve and but there been a couple of other names that have been put out as a ... sort of put around the beltway as well Richard gr now is a former spokes spokesmen at the un a current ambassador to Germany\nI I Believe in the highest ranking I think openly gay Republican in the administration that's one little part of his bio um and also Brian ... who worked for Rex Tillerson Rex Tillerson ousted of course the secretary of state\nAnd Brian is one of the people who manage to\nHang on a state and and really keep his I'm sort of keep his bona fides with the Trump Administration his name has been out there as well\nLet's move on to an op ed that was published this week in USA Today written by the president himself the headline quotes\nDemocrats Medicare for all plan will demolish promises to seniors unquote stop it began by laying out the president's opposition to the Medicare proposal from Senator Bernie Sanders then it transitioned to a broader criticism of Democrats he wrote in part quote the truth is that the centrist Democratic Party is dead\nThe new Democrats are radical socialist she wants to model America's economy after Venezuela unquote\nNow other journalists quickly criticized USA Today and ... on the paper for publishing the op ed pointing out that nearly every single sentence contains something false USA Today did have an online version of the op ed that has some fact checks in it but that does you know good if you read a newspaper on paper\nShane Harris I Wonder what you see in terms of the strategy of a White House publishing this op ed it's the first of its kind how important really is it that it was tearing down this Medicare for all proposal and and how important is it the u._s._a. today just kind of let it run as it is you know there's there's two two thoughts\nOn this one is there's the political and slipped through this which is the place and get in USA Today which has a huge circulation and has a lot I think probably more market penetration in places where President Trump would like to get this message across them perhaps\nOr my paper the Washington Post um so what you're seeing here was almost the tax version of a Trump rally where he will make all kinds of assertions\nA false hoods uh maybe lives regrets calls him of them lives we can stick them in categorize them uh but but this was really I mean I think my colleagues the Post's Glenn Kessler is the sort of the fact checking gold standard used that line and you mentioned that nearly every sentence contain something misleading or a false would in that\nSense I think you can view this much more as a political document that kind of rallying document then there comes the second question which is All right if that's the case what was the journalistic obligation of USA Today\nTo push back on this and I must say I haven't met on the editorial side I'm On the news side there's a bit of a church and state separation but if I were a media reporter I Would not\nBe that impressed by USA Today's responds to say well we give people a lot of leeway in their opinions um there is the old saying you're entitled to your own opinions but not your own facts as senator Moynihan said ah it seemed like the leeway that USA Today was giving the president and his op ed\nJust random crashing right into the hall of what the basic fact checking is supposed to be about um so I'm Still not quite understanding how the editors chose to go ahead and allow this to run in the form that it did and it's frankly it's a real embarrassment for USA Today\nAnd it is worth noting that many papers you know on even on the editorial team leader or fact checkers like there is an editor who edits editorials to make sure that Iraq there will be running the facts\nAbsolutely you know I think Trump recognizes that this is again it'd be a rallying cry for the Democrats not just in the mid term but looking out ahead to twenty twenty\nAnd this is something that here in California US Senator Harris and is out front on talking about it um and she's actually the first person to back Senator Sanders on this last year at least publicly new send a Gavin Newsom was running for governor or\nOn the Democratic ticket immediately took to Twitter to strike down at Trump's add comments in this op ed and he talked about Trump's support for the grand Cassidy bill which would have allowed insurance to charge more\nFor preexisting conditions is is absolutely something that got an incentive running on he wants to government run health care system and Trump actually called him out in Montana a couple of weeks ago on this\nThing not only does news them why chat universal health care he also wants it to apply to undocumented immigrants had kept Trump joke you may even move here to California to get their free health care\nOr story would like to start getting into before we have to pause and that has to do with the new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh used in from Saturday any fifty to forty eight Senate votes sworn in as a justice over the weekend and on Monday in a ceremonial swearing in with the justice is family by his son listen\nTo buy\nIowa\nPart of the swearing in ceremony for the newest Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh\nIs confirmation to the Supreme Court comes after a month long battle between Democrats and Republicans over that nomination we'd like to talk more about how that confirmation\nHas resonated across the country and frankly whether this fight is over some senators are vowing to continue that fight against Kavanaugh so what would be their next move\nWill get into that and we continue our conversation with political journalist Todd's will like Shane Harris intelligence and national security reporter for the Washington Post and Malaysia Molly co host and correspondent of the California
