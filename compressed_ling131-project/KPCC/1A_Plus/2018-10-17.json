{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "So yeah I often work with kids who are\nYou know survivors of trauma and abuse so there's often a lot of hopelessness so not necessarily political hopeless and that's why you know in that sense it's often giving the kids I work with something positive that they can work on so giving them something that they can accomplish schools that are achievable\nUm giving them that sense so that they're earning back that whole they're taking the time to invest in themselves\nAnd what you know the political environment it's the same thing you know that a little drop in the bucket may not seem like much in the grand scheme of things that a little drop adds up to you know full bucket one day and that's a book actually with kids is how to fill other people's pockets when positivity and happiness\nThat's a great when I Know a lot of parents use that to I'm going to talk to them they could go ahead\nYeah I Want to jump in because I so agree with you and I think when people pick one thing that they're passionate about and put their energy you know towards doing something like climate change let's say\nIf you put your efforts in one thing it doesn't feel so overwhelming and you get a filter sense of control which again reduces um anxiety\nAbby thank you so much for timing uh tonight I think those are really important contribution and she talked about\nParents and children are presenting with fear based on their personal situations I think we were talking earlier about people watching the news and getting anxious because their of their opinions or their concern for the country\nAnd an abstract way about what's going on um but I Know you've talked about a mother who came in with a child by racial and so scared that she lives in a white suburban area at this time and I think we really need to acknowledge out loud how for\nFor many people of color for many\nImmigrants documented or undocumented um there's a real sense of fear for their personal wellbeing it's not just oh I like I watch the news and I feel concerned or in an abstract way right\nIt's it's terrifying in that case it it's a a teenage by racial um girl who's half Afghani 'em and um she's not only embarrassed about her heritage but she's scared of her friends are going to think that she or her\nParents her father brothers are terrorists I\nI also want to say something else about the news um people are yelling at each other on the news so\nThe whole volume of what we were exposed to has been an uptick in that were over stimulated if you think of the screen it used to be prior to nine eleven when I watched let's say CNN I watch the news\nNow there's always something going on in the ticker tape beneath right stuff's always there\nThen it's breaking news breaking news\nAnd then and then there are these shows where everybody's just yelling at each other all the time so we were just in the state of over stimulation and and I think in a in a certain way you know you go back to the Seventeen tweets to the president doesn't can taint\nHis thoughts and feelings um and I think as as a reaction to that we're feeling overwhelmed and then the news media is overwhelming and these are overwhelming times\nSo let's talk to somebody who works in the news media a journalist calling a psychotherapist jak in McCall Michigan is on the line ...\n... or ... or do you want to add\nA yard work I'm\nI'm a cover national politics at all I'm an artist surely exhausting\nOr working in the media are constantly watching the news the news um it's really hard choice when it is your job as all sorts of issues with\nOnly um our support of a darker liberal\nOr their family home\nLike hardcore and you're all Trump supporters on my family and I like some of the food you know how can you work in the news you can be so ready to so much or ... or so it's really just really difficult to\nLike have a A R kind of getting shame divide my family members for\nLike a a\nR have disagreements about Mars but I worked in the media and it's really weird their yards\nKnoxville liquor was starting to run out of time can you give them a cookie\nWest [laughter] you know I'm One of my\nUh suggestions to people I Do this\nIs um in fact your family to watch\nUm MSNBC or CNN sometimes I'm assuming they're watching Fox and in the same way um I think uh people who are CNN and MSNBC watchers should also watch Fox every now and again so that at\nLeast we are hearing what other people who think we're crazy um at least we're able to hear what they're hearing and get more of a sense of it\nCan you give us a thirty second take to go out just so we can end on something of a positive note the story of the couple where you're told us um it's bonded them together given them a shared activity crazy making news environment\nThat's correct so you know um we we always tell our couple that they should engage in you know is shared activities\nAnd for many couples you know used to be you'd go out to dinner and you'd see those married couples who were sitting there and not think much of anything right and you don't see that so much anymore because the news really giving people\nWhat to talk about a lot and all the time\nDoctor Cindy bound Baker a clinical psychologist practicing in Philadelphia\nThank you for practicing a little bit informally for nine

U. and NPR in Washington this is one [noise]\nI'm Joshua Johnson today on what a how to discuss climate change it's one of those topics that make people digging their heels and argue like crazy a big issue wrapped up in deeply held beliefs so of course that means the discussions tend to go nowhere will get tips on debating climate change in a productive way\nThen we shift gears to the British royal family's new baby a light hearted story comes at a heavy time in the u._k. is this just a distraction from breakfast or something more\nAbout the wave of what's proper are doing what precedent it's about doing what two people in love do that's just the head on one egg [noise]\nLive from NPR News in Washington ... President Trump is still standing by members of the Saudi ruling family as they continue to deny knowing anything about the suspected killing of Saudi dissident and legal us residential market ... NPR's Mara Liasson reports\nYeah we've heard from some of you about how climate change is already beginning to impact you John tweeted\nFormer a skeptic here not sure when I turned the corner maybe when I started having basement issues here in the mid west due to the huge rain falls we get these days as a kid we never got four to nine inches of rain in a twenty four hour period all skeptics will eventually see it for themselves\nSarah I Wonder if you could just chime in on part of what we heard from John he referred to people who are in his words adamantly ignorance about the problem\nIs that fair is it fair to assume that people who are climate change skeptics are in John's words adamantly\nIgnorance I wouldn't characterize folks like that and part of my job as a scientist is to be able to to speak to people with empathy and with dignity and\nOn the people that are on the fence innocent this this public conversation then so distorted across this part is in space because of how well funded the interest from fossil fuel and oil companies have have\nFlooded the market ideas with distorted narrative and so it it makes a lotta sense that people are skeptical because they're receiving a lot of messages that they should be skeptical\nAnd as well then this value system and whether you quote believe or don't believe in climate change you ask people that question right now in American politics and what you're actually asking is who are you\nWhat side are you on yeah where do you follow what how does the mine get divided on and so people are trying to respond appropriately to the environment of the discourse around them and it's ... it's profoundly confusing\nYeah the politics of this is what Brian emailed us Brian writes\nSeems to me the first step to objectively assessing any issue is to stop listening to leaders who are telling me what I Want to hear we Americans have empowered the lowest common denominator by allowing politicians to play on our emotions rather than our intelligence a true leader is one who can lead us where we need to go as opposed to where we want to go\nWe're speaking to Sarah my area of the University of Washington and the founder of the rolling Institute and Paul Bledsoe former climate advisor to the Clinton White house\nA lecture at American University and also with the center for environmental policy glad to hear from some more of you including some of you who doubt some of the arguments behind climate change here's one listener who left a note in our inbox\nI'm not fully convinced that climate change has been caused by people but I'm pretty certain and I've heard enough that I'm a hundred percent convinced that we are officially areas are planted\nAnd have to do everything we can to affect a positive outcome it's just like being a parent might not be certain jobs it's up to the wrong but we want to do everything we can to affect\nA positive outcome for our generation and their future generations thank you\nThank you for sharing your thoughts poll I Wonder if you could respond to that I like I'm interested by this idea of being as the listener put a fiduciary of our planet that's come up in a number of comments from some of our listeners\nHillbilly mystic tweeted maybe reframe the issue in terms of budgeting the earth only has so much in terms of natural resources if we keep overspending and draining our accounts then Mother Earth will effect us we will run out of resources and we will be bankrupt Paul\nNotion is very powerful in the evangelical Christian community it's they they talk about protecting God's creation and how the earth is sacred that's true in in many cultures another way to think about it is in budgetary terms\nThe U.S Congress spent a hundred and thirty billion dollars on extreme weather events made worse by climate change last year alone that's nearly a quarter of the non defense discretionary budget this is hitting taxpayers you know I also wanted to talk about the notion of\nSeparating different kinds of people who are denying are skeptical about climate change there are certain people who actually know when you're doing it for ... purposes and those people Exxon and other oil companies knew about the problem in the Nineteen eighties and and covered it up and denied it\nAnd and there's certain political actors who do that today that's different from Americans who are genuinely confused about the issue and needs to be informed and need to be reached culturally\nWhere they live and I think that's an important point the second thing I'll say is that it's time we injected some American can do spirit into this discussion\nWhen John Kennedy was confronted with the space race in the Cold War he challenged\nThe country in ten years to reach the moon what disappoints me about President Trump more than anything is he's kind of a climate wimp the problems too hard for him he just can't deal with it\nWell Paul I mean we hold on a second let me let me just push back against I Know we have to pause in a minute but his name calling going to help the debate for climate change calling the president a wimp I mean is that helpful a he's a defeat is um you've got a call them like you see it but it's kind of how you buy a longer more SAT used word wimp defeat us I mean is that helpful\nHe's denying a problem that is threatening the safety and welfare of the American people sometimes we have to say like it is Joshua we can't sugar coat the truth when we come to the American people's safety security and economic future\nSarah I Know we've got a positive minute but it's Paul right on my being a little bit too forgiving in terms of the way we talk about the president\nI mean my view is that we need to indict publicly years who are trafficking in science denial as a form of misconduct and a form of putting the American public in danger however I Do think that we as scientists have engaged\nNonstop in trying to confront denialism and often that engagement is a very it's coded male power brokering that is very problematic in the culture because it pits people against each other instead of focusing on shared values\nOr do you want to focus on some of more of our shared values and how we talk about climate change as we continue with Sarah ... of the ... Institute and Paul Bledsoe of American University Center for environmental policy we also heard from some of you've seen the damage from hurricane Michael and how that affected\nYour view of the discussion of climate change I'll get to that comments and just a moment I'm Joshua Johnson you're listening to one a firm W.

A. M. U. dot org we know that for quite a few if you're discussing climate change can be difficult\nThis isn't just about ... this is about changing the biological chemical and physical composition the nature of the planet forever\nAnd so we're talking about where on what kind of storms on the intensity of storms on what kind of sees analogy how um how the kinds of environments\nA shift towards the poles on how on mountain ice in the ice on a A R a decrease on how ocean circulation changes how fisheries and ocean ... productivity changes so we we have these metrics for\nOn temperature change and for our our future trajectories but those inside of those trajectories are encompassed vast complexities of reorganization and consequences and some places will war more in some places will more or less so it's a global average\nAnd and so in some ways it's a\nIt's it's very meaningful but it doesn't really discreetly describe like what will happen here in the Pacific northwest\nAnd I was ... was Sarah I Would just add that there's a new study out of the proceedings and National Academy of Sciences that finds that a destabilization of the climate maybe imminent\nThat runaway uncontrollable cascading climate change could happen if we passed two degrees Celsius so this is not a linear problem this is a problem where\nBig get warming begets warming the melting of ice than absorbs heat in the oceans rather than reflecting back into the atmosphere and dozens of other self reinforcing feedback that's my time is short we need to act\nAshley emailed I've heard that before the last ice age there was a warming period is there a chance that this is part of a long wait cycle could give me science lack there of I definitely believe in taking care of our planet but the left is pushing me away daily\nSo left versus right Matt tweeted I don't buy that climate change deniers actually disbelieve the science it seems to me that when most people who deny climate change have trouble with is the fact that to combat it we're going to have to radically change the way we live\nI Wonder if you know maybe I don't know our time discuss\nThis is is short but I Wonder if maybe part of the solution to improving the way we talk about climate change is to do less talking\nI'm not a climate change expert but I I Do have conversations for a living and I found that the best way to get someone to converse with me is to be the first one to listen\nAnd I get the sense that a lot of people who are still on the fence just feel they can't have the discussion because they were about to be pilloried with information about the latest report from the national Academy of sciences and that report is valuable but\nI Wonder if maybe we just need to listen to one another more especially people who are skeptical just to let them know that it's a safe space in a safe time to have a conversation series at too touchy feely years or something to that\nI don't think that's too touchy feely I mean you can talk about the science I until you're blue in the feast right but then when we were actually trying to sit in relationships\nWith people that the two way street that's a that is an experience\nYou have to listen in order to engender trust and relationships and you know part of that\nPart of the peace around this is the realizing as scientists were trying to broker power and authority in public we're trying to gain agency and authority and in order for the science that we are starting to be integrated into public decision making\nBut that peace around brokering for power man that you gotta get curious about that right because there's all sorts of lines that divide our culture around you know who is trusted who gets buying who has authority and that's why as a feminist as a public feminists\nI use a feminist lens to think about how scientific information is brokered in the public and how I as a woman scientists\nHave I I'm constantly re framed as unqualified to broker information in the public and so we if we want to talk about integrating science into public policy entered and developing trust we really want to get more and more curious about\nAnd what are the ... ... why our voices being eliminated from the public forum why do we have such a a partisan distorted narrative\nBut it is targeted pointing out that this is a U.S phenomena sure the part as a nation of climate change is not a global phenomenon it doesn't exist in most of the world and we need to reflect\nOn the U.S political and cultural system right now in our norms and and do some honest thinking about\nAre we being manipulated by people who have self interest that aren't matching up with the long term self interest in the American people which is what many of us believe is happening this is a U.S problem almost uniquely and its political and cultural aspects\nI Would agree with that but I just want to reflect back again that the entire world by and large and the world's global resources are run by men and those decisions are made by men and so one of the fundamental aspects of solutions for climate change has to do with anti racism\nAnd an anti ... and that is that a global level is that the closer we get to on an equitable and safe society for every one specifically for the rights of girls and women\nThen that's a component of the pathway for us to get his everyone at at options there\nIs a little more with this I like to discuss I Know we have to pause will finish this up on the other side of the break I'd like to kind of do a little bit of role playing of what you can say to folks in certain\nKinds of debates to some of the more common objections including like just that being or cycles are where does a science come from we also got a good question is Marlene who wrote on our website the one eight dot org so if you change people's minds what then\nI see a lot of people who believe in climate change the do nothing to try to mitigate it in their own personal lives there still driving around and gas guzzling SUVs owning their own make mention houses with the thermostat turned out not recycling not cutting back on meat and dairy basically waiting for someone else to do something\nIt's like it's someone else's tomorrow not ours interesting point Arlene even if you win the argument\nWhat do you do to turn the argument into action and if you
