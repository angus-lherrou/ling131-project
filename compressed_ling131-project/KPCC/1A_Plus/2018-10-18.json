EMTs an ambulance drivers are not considered public safety even though they're doing exactly the same job is because they're from the private sector that creates a challenge well in it and I'm\nCurious why the legislature there there wouldn't be sympathetic members of the legislature who would carry it on behalf of the private ambulances industry it's interesting that that didn't go anywhere\nWell you might have I mean labor groups might be opposed to that you know if they're carving out a way for re slow right and they are carving out a part of the labor law you know it might not get fired that\nThat's a ... yeah it's a logical argument that they'd be concerned well if they do with ambulance drivers than than who might be next that's proposition eleven and is there are labor unions do you do you know melody if they come out against this or not I I don't think I've seen a\nFor some odd reason I Know that the California Teachers Association is against us ... I don't know I just read that somewhere [laughter]\nTeachers are always on call [laughter] so\nUh that's proposition eleven the final measure on your California ballot proposition twelve\nSupporters of twelve say it is a natural extension of proposition to which was passed a decade ago and put new space requirements on egg laying hens on a pork as well as on cabs\nThat are being raised revealed and they say the proponents of it that this uh guarantees even more space\nFor those animals than I was in proposition to the opponents of proposition to say this is largely the work of a major um egg a supplier in California's Central valley and that they actually want to have smaller uh cages in which to ah to have a the\nThe egg laying hens are melted you want to start us on prop twelve\nYeah absolutely I this is a ballot measure that you would normally think that animal welfare groups would all jump on board and they're not um and the argument is that at\nThe amount of space currently under law for um says that a chicken or a a hen an egg laying hens has to be able to stand up\nTurn around and lay down now what does that constitute like what is the exact spat stacks of that\nA Cajun which in ... and can do that um or a a a breeding pig or I'm a calf I'm and so this ballot measure essentially is creating those facts but I'll animal welfare groups like peta say well you know we don't agree with that space and that was never the\nIntention of voters to give them that little of space and so\nHumane society says just as good a pita and some other groups also say that are are saying that this is going to get them actually less room and that you'd be doing more for animals by not\nVoting for that so in in you have major environmental groups your clubs in favor of this and I believe the natural Resources Defense council but as you say\nAnimal welfare organizations there is with the humane society to us when big sponsors of this as they were a proposition to which was passed by California voters Katie anything to add on this\nWell I think it is it's one of those examples on it is a tricky measure you know I mean you see this and you think well you know I I feel like animals should have faith but then you get into the intricacies and I think that's\nA lot of times the problem we have with governing by proposition right you don't you don't know all the details that you really need to know\nSell your thoughts on prop twelve yeah so so we're we're in a situation here with prop twelve where the animal welfare groups can't decide\nIf is actually enhances animal welfare you have some let's say yes you have others if they say you have like Peter to very strongly against it\nUm I Would I Would suggest I Would just really recommend that if there there's a measure on the ballot that you can't wrap your head around that even animal welfare groups they can't decide if this actually has his animal welfare um friends don't know perhaps a this can be resolved in another way I'm perhaps we can have a more deliberative process rather than have something as convoluted as\nA while and I have to say I'm for all of us on the panel like you know all of us get asked a lot my friends and family members what about this ballot proposition what about\nThat one and so often I just speaking for myself I don't know about the rest of you have to say you know how to read about it I hosted debates on it I've I immersed myself on it and I'm Still trying to wrap my head around all the different moving pieces to it\n... usually I Do I just tell every other person yes or no balance or in fact\nThe second decade thank you so much for being with us we appreciate all this a statewide broadcast or we appreciate your joining us brought two thousand Eighteen voter cram session our panelists\n\nPolitics with border [noise] Southern California newsgroup Andrew I'm\nEditor Salvador were drink as San Francisco chronicle political reporter melody group terrorists\nAnd Cal Tech professor of political science Michael Alvarez the two thousand Eighteen voter Graham session is part of the California Dream project a state wide media collaboration of K PBS cake you read the Cape PCC capital\nPublic radio and the non profit news organization Cal matters the project get support from the corporation for public broadcasting and the James Irvine foundation keep the discussion going on Twitter\nThis is the hash tag see a dream\nFor California Dream for the two thousand Eighteen voter cramped session I'm Mary ...

A. M. U. N. NPR in Washington this is one [noise]\nHey there I'm Joshua Johnson today on one a Native Americans and the mid term Senator Warren has to a farm or tribal ancestry gotten mixed reactions from Indian country\nNative Americans have much more to think about in next month's elections in the feud between warring and President Trump\nUnprecedented numbers of tribal citizens are running for office and new laws are making it harder for me to cast ballots the impact of these voters could be crucial and we'd love to hear from you especially if you are a Native American voter or Kennedy email one a acts W. A. M. U. dot org\nOr tweet us at one end [noise]\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Jim ... President Trump says the U.S is asking turkey for audio and video relating to a missing Saudi journalist Trump confirmed it during a brief Q A name with reporters\nSimon with some more Smith what about you what do you think is going on here\nWell I mean I don't think she knows what she's doing it she's perpetuating you know white privilege you know and and that's the problem as as I see it is that this country has a long and brutal history of taking from natives they take our land our kids are cultures traditions languages imagery or vote\nAnd now they just want to take our identity too and we're just supposed to deal with it but we check allies at the door all the time we have to you because you need some one of one among catches a with that their native them before you know what the opening a trading post in hosting some chicken feather Paolo and that's that's the situation it's like\n... you know white people have historically use the one drop rule then I think we're missing that in this conversation to exclude like African Americans the black community now they're using it to include themselves that's privilege Simon did not just to\nBe clear when you say the one drop rule you're talking about the old standard it said that if you were like one drop African you were considered black\nRight right now they're using it to the includes themselves in a community they know nothing about and that's the situation and as you as in my column that everyone in CNN we just want to know where where where her voice was when certain things are really hitting the fan\nWhen when I was going down at Standing Rock\nShe didn't say anything she didn't say anything about police brutality in Indian country or sexual abuse in Indian country only until recently so just where have you been and why haven't you said anything if you claim to be native you should probably be the first to say something but she has failed routinely to say anything at all mhm\nCarry I think I cut you off earlier when you were making ... was this something where you wanted to\nKnow I I think that that's fine I think when I was going to say that it's not clear that this is actually playing out in the way that she had hoped\nOne I I Wonder about that mark I mean if if there was any kind of political consequences to Senator Elizabeth Warren going forward I mean ... is is there a price for her you know in Massachusetts in a broader sense or is it more kind of a larger national twenty twenty presidential potential consequence\nI think it's a larger consequences basically she's trying to get a story\nAnd if she's going to run for office she needs to have that story be once you can tell over and over and this one has laws and that is one that it's going to have all kinds of challenges is going to be opening yourself up to a radical from both sides and I think that makes it really difficult to um continue to go forward with this\nI I think uh my friend Mary Annette ... posted on Facebook the other day that a journalist that ah she just needs to own a story to get over with it and to talk about how a messy this\nOr I Want to mention something early on you said something about what native communities are dealing with and there's a flipside to this or identity story that's just fascinating and that is we're starting to hit a generation of young a Native Americans\nWho for a variety of reasons ... or older than you try and it's got to really complicates this whole debate about identity and where we go with that uh as more and more young people find they don't have a home\nWhat why are the unable to get enrolled\nSome tribes have very strict rules on residency other tribes have really strict rules on blood quantum other tribes have a ... a system in place for where you're where you're um so if your parents are more\nAre enrolled in one tribe but they're not eligible for their kids to be enrolled in that try it becomes a problem in Alaska you have a whole generation of kids who are with the Alaska Native claims settlement act\nIf they're not shareholders in a community and they don't live in the village where they're ... or parents or tribal members they may have grown up in Anchorage they might not qualify for tribal membership and so the issue of identity is one that's going to require a conversation with in the tribal community communities in a really deep way very soon\nWe are speaking to mark ... editor of Indian country today carry levine senior reporter with the center for Public Integrity\nAnd CNN contributors Simon Moyer Smith also which kind of a writer and reporter we're glad to hear from you Jenna emailed I'm an ... a woman from the lake superior band of Chippewa in northern Wisconsin\nI don't care what Elizabeth Warren's blood quantum is she's dedicated her life to improving lives for the under served and I would proudly have her\nIn my tribe Simon way Smith this term blood quantum has come up twice so far what is that\nWhat every nation or gets to determine or who is a member or who is a citizen of their nation based on the amount of blood and you have in your your family history\nAnd I understand what she's saying this agenda individuals saying but I I Believe we must support when support is earned and do but we also must criticize when criticism is earned and do and I think when it comes to somebody like Elizabeth Warren she unfortunately has perpetuated this kind of want to be\nPlaying Indian culture opening the floodgates to people that will now use this slippery language of native versus native heritage and it is slippery language but we're used to that\nBut only I'm only ... only sure we're clear on the term blood clots are we talking about that that sounds like it's related to the sensory test about going in and and finding out how much your DNA kind of pigs you toward some kind of tribal ancestry is that kind of what that is referring to\nWell no because every nation has the right to determine what how the amount of blood determines if you are part of the nation or if you're not part of the nation so some so for one tribe that may be Seventy five percent for another nation it could be\nTen percent but it has to be traced back to family name and lineage and that's that's typically the test we have an Indian country it's who's your family who is your band who's your clan\nThat's how it's done not like I maybe somebody way way way way down the line was native and now I get to claim it\nRich tweeted as an all nighter members there was nothing wrong with what Senator Warren did what was she supposed to do sit back and let Trump attacker one drop of black blood would've gotcha lynched in the Eighteen hundreds\nWe'll continue our conversation in just a

foundation\nThis is one a I'm Joshua Johnson we're discussing the impact of Native American voters and candidates in this year's midterm elections with Simon Malia Smith a Chicano writer and reporter CNN contributor and then a glut Lakota citizen\nMark ... editor of Indian country today and they show the ... citizen and carry levine a senior reporter for the center for Public Integrity we heard from quite a few of you who shared your stories\nAbout exploring your tribal ancestry about what that means to you in the context of your life here's one voice mail that was left in our inbox\nHi this is Carol elaborately\nI mean this kind of voter suppression isn't new they've been doing this for very long time and we are the smallest racial minority in the United states and our ancestral land we are the smallest racial minority and that's pretty impressive to do over small Spanish say five hundred years\nBut the Republicans know that because we can shift that vote we can tilt the scales with our vote they're very threatened by it\nWas very tight races they want us to press the indigenous vote and I'm a proponent of not even having voting in November\nI mean look at the people that live so let's let's say you live an hour away on some ... ... on a reservation as an hour out from somewhere where you can vote and it's snowing\nAnd maybe you only have one car so it doesn't make sense to me that we have people voting in November rather than a time or maybe it's not you know there's not snow and ice on the ground and making a treacherous for people who have a hard time getting there anyway\nAnd that's also what they rely on well maybe the natives will make it out of their way out there any way you know and that's the problem\nIs that there has been discrimination against native votes we were the ... we were the last one to get the right the right to vote and it looks like we're the first ones to lose it under this GOP mark what do you think\nWell I ever got our country notion I I think actually this um overreached by the Republicans is going to improve dirt out\nIn a pretty dramatic way a among North Dakota voter native voters a tribes are organizing really fast they been issuing ID like crazy or they're going to be ready to challenge a and do a\nA legal support for folks when they go to the bowl and I think there was a lot of disinterested in this election and all of a sudden this just lit a fire and people are saying take away my vote and I'm going to vote and um I think that is going to be really interesting to see what it turns out in terms of results\nCarry I just want to add to that I Do think that the publicity around this is drawing some resources or to North Dakota some nonprofit some advocates some attention from donors and things who are giving to\nTip programs that want to organize Native Americans to get out to vote to help them get ideas if they need IDs and so\nUm maybe the attention well will produce as mark has said\nActually healthier turn out in the mid term election win mid term elections traditionally have lower turnout\nRepublican North Dakota representative Kevin Cramer who you mentioned was\nAgainst senator hike camp for her seat responded to the Supreme Court decision late last week during a town hall here is part of what representative Kramer said\nIt's always been concerned me if if people who want to vote don't vote\n'em as I've looked at the lives not very complicated to vote in fact there is another place in America there where it's easier to both in the north Dakota we're the only state in the country that does not have voter registration in fact the law that North Dakota passed allows in a a tribal id to serve as the ... the legitimate identification so\nI Would say if if I was the German of a tribe and was concerned about this I'd make sure that my tribal members got an ID from my drive if they don't have a driver's license and most of them have a driver's license as well\nThat's North Dakota Republican representative Kevin Cramer speaking late last week during a town hall Cary what do you make of Kramer's comments is that match with your reporting particularly the part about having driver's licenses and North Dakota being the easiest state in which to vote\nWell North Dakota was long a very easy state in which to that in fact until the first version of this law was passed a and twenty Thirteen after after that\nTime when hike camp one and twenty twelve\nThere were failsafe voters didn't have id if you shut up at the polls and you didn't have ID poll worker who knew you could actually vouch for you know North Dakota is a small state\nThat was something that was in play you could sign an affidavit of testing to your right to vote but those found safe they're no longer an option for voters to cut as not as easy as say devoted as they used to be what do you think is going to happen\nCarry in this in the Senate race in for the issue at large I hate to ask\nYou to to forecast the future but what does the trend look like what are people kind of expecting from this race well\nIf we pull out the ... I think I think it's really hard to know look it's um the polls have Kramer are solidly I had to have high camp um polls have been wrong before polls were wrong in twenty twelve and send the high camp one and I would draw your attention in North Dakota to the math\nTypically between two hundred and fifty thousand and three hundred and fifty thousand people in the ST turn out to vote in federal elections what that will be this year I'm not exactly sure at presumably on the high side for mid term but that's about the range of people were talking about so it doesn't take much to to change an election\nWhen we have to pause and just a moment but mark what are you seeing in North Dakota where do you think this has had\nWell I think this will make it a lot closer than it would have been I think it would have been very one sided election before this all happened so\nWhether it'll be enough or not for us that are kept to win reelection I don't know but I think it would not have been a contest at this\nAnd Simon ... Smith I Know we have to let you go momentarily but what do you see as the as the outlook for this going forward\nI think uh you know I have to agree with mark I think it's going to galvanize so many indigenous people that are going to go out there and I think they're going to have a swell of indigenous people hitting the polls and I'm\nTelling them no you can't take my vote you know my my voice matters are voice matters where the original people of this land we're stewards of this land and you're not going to take our our rights away from us\nDo you feel more fuel Simon like this is something that's that's a a growing groundswell among Native American voters across the country this issue of voter disenfranchisement\n[noise] oh yeah most definitely and I think a an especially under this this rotten administration a lot of indigenous peoples are going to come out to vote and especially to get all of them out we saw how it played out with people like you know when they were trying to get Kavanaugh in and they finally got cabin I and\nAnd we're like no this is this is horrible and this is happening on our watch as indigenous people were not going to let that happen\nSimon ... Smith that you kind of a writer in reporter uh CNN contributor and also in a global Lakota citizen working on a book coming out next year about his experiences as a Native American in the twenty first century Simon it's been a pleasure to have you with us thanks for talking to his\nEx for having me we'll continue our conversation in just a moment with mark ... and Kerry levine and we'd still love to get to see more of your questions and thoughts as well about being a Native American voter and the issues that matter to you in the mid term stickler [noise]\n[noise] sometimes it seems like the news cycle is one big runaway train headed way too fast destination unknown\nI'm Mary Louise Kelly that all things considered we plan our daily voyage carefully and take the time to see the important states along the way don't worry we'll still get you where you need to go all things considered from NPR News enjoy the journey\nWeekdays it for Ninety nine point three gay PCC\nMisha I'm a voiceover actor\nGrowing up I remember listening\nTo my dad in the car he'd he'd be listening to talk radio and I always thought well that's something that only adults do and you know I'm always going to listen to music and nonstop top forty\nAnd over I don't even know how many years now I I've been listening to keep you see see and occasionally it'll dawn on me like oh my gosh I'm listening to people talk on the radio\nAnd I don't know if that means that are growing up and I thought\nThe PC is it's always on my radio whenever I'm driving in Los Angeles you could be going one mile and yet that takes a half hour so key PCC really does play a huge part of my life\nTo become a sustaining member go to key PCC dot org and thank you\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the Annenberg Foundation committed to supporting educating and engaging communities in the United states and globally for more than twenty five years learned more in Annenberg Foundation dot org\nFrom Americans for the arts committed to transforming America's communities through the arts and arts education supporting the nonprofit arts industry which employs four point six million people nationwide learn more and Americans for the arts dot org\nAnd from the any each Casey foundation\nTomorrow we'll continue our conversation about the mid term elections with the national look at major races and issues we booked a great panel but we could use your help to focus the discussion what are your main questions and your main concerns about the midterms candidates polls voter turnout controversies or anything else\nLeave us a voicemail eight five five to three six one a one day which we talk about tomorrow when we talk about the midterms on a national\nLevel it's eight five five to three six one two one two you can also send us a radio quality audio file through our app won a vox pop you can download the app that's V.
