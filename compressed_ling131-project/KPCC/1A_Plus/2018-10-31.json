{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Jonathan one thing that might reflect a message that relates to what you were just talking about um with the gas\nI think it's interesting to watch the states where Republican governors who refused to expand Medicaid to bought people under Obamacare which was voluntary was up to the governor's\nThey might lose to democratic challengers who would take the extra aid that Washington is still offering and cover more uninsured Americans and I have the state of Kansas Wisconsin Georgia Florida South Dakota and Oklahoma they're interesting races for many reasons but there's one unifying unifying thread imagine\nIf the Obamacare in Rowley numbers go up by that much in that many states that would further cemented as a politically popular program I Would think and that might turn out to be one so far under reported message that the voters and next week\n... ... ... one week from tonight on\n... what are you ... what are you looking for and lead aside to talk about a wave red or blue but as someone who as I mentioned before several times the author of the corrosion of ... of conservatism and who as my\nColleague at the Washington Post a opinion section has been very clear about you've been very clear about your um\nYour upset over the president's ah and and the party what are you going to be looking for a week from tonight in terms of the election result\nWell what I'm going to be hoping for Jonathan is some backlash\nThat the voters will punish President Trump and the Republican Party for the way they have engaged in demagoguery and exploited Gina phobia and racism\nAs election issues I mean I think what what President Trump and the Republicans have done is disgraceful I mean for example the grandstanding in recent weeks over this caravan of for Central American refugees which if you listen to Trump and the Republicans it's like a horde of barbarians were going to invade America and rape and pillage and\nWe have to send five thousand troops down to the border to stop this caravan of fewer than five thousand people many of them women and children I mean this is just\nThe lowest basis kind of politics you could imagine lying on the air and resentment and I would hope uh that voters at least in house races will make Republicans pay a price for what they're doing because I think it is terribly destructive to our social fabric\nYou know I write a lot of my book the corrosion of conservatism about how I don't recognize the Republican Party anymore because it has ceased to be a conservative party has really become a white nationalist party under Trump's influence and if there's going to be any celebration in the near term for the Republican Party\nI think it has to began with massive and repeated droppings at the ballot box because that is the only way that Republican politicians will get the message that picking on minority groups\nIs not the way to win political advantage\nMacs are you surprised by the silence\nFrom Republican leaders who have been on the hill longer than President Trump has even been in politics and I'm thinking of people like\nSpeaker of the house Paul Ryan or Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell or the Senator John Cornyn of Texas people who'd been there who were stalwarts\nAre proponents and and leaders in the Republican Party who have basically either gone Newt\nFor gone along with gusto a with what the president has been doing\nIt's shocking the the speed with which Republicans have sold out\nThere for reported beliefs and not just sold them out but eagerly joined\nIn in Trump's extremist rhetoric I mean one of the most shocking unless reporter things that's happened in the last month or so is the fact that Chuck Grassley you know good old Chuck Grassley who's been in the Senate since roughly Riley Olympic error right one of the Republican old bowls ought to be one of the responsible members of the Republican Party\nHe endorsed this crackpot theory that George Soros was behind the anti government protests which was essentially an anti Semitic dog whistle of the kind that Republicans increasingly use to to motivate their voters now\nI mean Chuck Grassley I mean my goodness give me a break and ah you know then you have so many others that you mentioned who don't necessarily endorsed these\nThese crazy conspiracies but don't challenge them either I mean and I think about people who have gone entirely sign that we never hear about for example Lamar Alexander senator from Tennessee or Senator Rob Portman of Ohio these are very mainstream Republican rise\nIn previous Republican administration they had been in Washington for decades okay I could not imagine that they possibly think that Donald Trump as qualified or that they approve of what he is doing and yet they don't there's not a peep out of them to protest brain it's just shocking and disgraceful to my in my opinion\nAnd for additional historical context Ronald Reagan\nBasically espouse the idea that anyone who wants to be an American is probably going to be good for our country because they want to be here and they have the pluck to be in and the grey which usually the more ambitious people in the world do\nAnd that even comes back to the birthright citizenship question as I understand it one motivation for passing it\nWay back in the Eighteen sixties was so that immigrant families would feel loyalty to the United states not to their countries of origin with birthright citizenship those big waves of immigrants coming in before entering Ellis Island\nWouldn't be colonizing the United states on behalf of their original countries they would be made Americans part of the body of this nation\nAnd now Trump once the opposite to call them invaders when all they want so desperately is precisely to be Americans it's still ironic\nAnd very quick point I mean that's it's ironic that Donald Trump accused of Democrats at wanting open borders which they do not but you know who won and open borders Ronald Reagan he talked about how his dream was to erase the borders between the United states and Mexico and Canada and create a truly open market in North America so you ... the reason I said oh\nYeah and open borders Koch right he used those words open borders\nYeah I'm ... I I keep coming up the more we talk about this the more I keep asking the question and in the minute that we have left I Would love to have both of you respond\nThat the the the\nThe hate and the demagoguery that have just been unleashed is it possible to put it back in the bottle trying to start with you real quick overtime but\nSo far a running against immigrants has worked for Donald Trump that got him elected he's doubling down on that strategy for now we will find out next week if people are putting it back in the bottle himself smacks\nWell I think it'll be a less successful strategy over time as you become a majority minority nation but it's gonna be hard to reach these toxins out of our body politic and we really need to try to do that I think\nWe almost need a campaign like we did to stigmatize smoking stigmatize racism and xenophobia nativism I thought that these that these things were raised sigma ties but it turns out that's not the case max\nFood ... thank you very much for being on America on the line we'll see you again tomorrow night\nLeadership support for America on the line is provided by ...\nAdditional support has provided by the end he Casey foundation and New York public radio trustee Dr Mary White [noise]\nWe're live where local where only NPR leader eighty nine point three K PCC one would Joshua Johnson is next men at nine o'clock it's the frame with KP cc's John horn headlines next and then one day eight o'clock\n... a lot of listeners tell us the BCC is an oasis of sanity when it comes to election coverage\nBut there are people like you across America wants to engage constructively about politics and they're doing it on Colin called America on the line with a new show from WNYC it's America on the line Monday\nThrough Thursday nights at seven here on an eighty nine point three key PCC it's part of the key PCC voter game plan\nOh no\nThis is eighty nine point three K PCC Pasadena Los Angeles or community service of passing through the city college dream home to do with over Seventy certificate programs to choose from learn more Pasadena dot edu\nElection day is November six foot record numbers of voters have already cast ballots what might that tell us about who could win in the midterms from W.

Stevens the first funerals have been held for the victims of Saturday's mass shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh Amy Sisk of member station W E s a report on the service health for Jerry Rubin a votes\nSpeaking to David Barker is the director of the center for congressional and presidential studies at American University\nGlad to hear from some of you as well one eight at W. A. M. U. dot org if you did decide to vote early what made you decide to vote early and if not why not do you live in a state\nThat does not allow for early voting was early voting just not for you we're interested to know some of your stories as well you can tweet us ... when a comments on our Facebook page or email one a at W. A. M. U.\nDot org harmony tweeted I voted early in Tennessee I Love being able to vote early it should be across all states\nDavid which states do allow early voting what what kind of access do we see across the country generally speaking\nMost states allow some form of early voting now that is really picked up in the past few cycles over the course of the past decade especially or at a point now where I Believe thirty eight states allow some form of early voting the ones that don't are disproportionally uh in the south\nAre and in New England I interestingly enough which surprises a lot of people that the ones that do allow early voting that I don't want to or not yeah in New England uh for for some reason most of the states that they don't allow it still a\nA couple of a few of the lower population states or in the south like Mississippi and Alabama I'm In Kentucky and then a few states big states in the mid Atlantic like New York and Pennsylvania a Delaware a and then Michigan and in the mid west that's about it really\nWhat are some of the factors involved in terms of the states that do or don't allow early voting are there certain common bonds in terms of their rationales for doing it or not doing it\nI don't think anybody really has a good handle on that I think early on um the perspective was that bluer states tend to allow early voting you know earlier than red states did but but now as as I mentioned there\nDoesn't seem to be much of a rhyme or reason than in that respect with blue states being just as likely to not allowed as as red states\nI think one of the factors as a simple one which is just cost if you have to have especially with with in person early voting if you have to have people manning polls all throughout the day or for weeks that had an election cycle that costs money and so states that have smaller budgets or can't afford that\nWhat about on a partisan level with early voting I mean I remember after\nThe election in two thousand in Florida Democrats were very very serious about making sure not only that people knew about early voting an absentee voting but that they knew what their rights were for example if you are in line when the polls closed don't get out of the line because you are entitled to vote\nHow the different parties engaged with early voting\nWell in general right it tends to be the Democrats who are more interested as you just alluded to in trying to make sure that the voting is as easy as possible for the for the most number of people and then has to do with a demographic coalition of democratic voters they're more likely to be a people of of\nLess means Merkel could it be ethnic and racial minorities\nAnd maybe the most important thing is they're more likely to be young people\nAre in young people traditionally don't vote a nearly the same rates as older people they move around a lot they don't necessarily get registered they don't necessarily think about it\nAnd so it's really really important for Democrats in any election to try to make sure that there are people turn out and so they tend to be more aggressive about expanding the franchise and the writing of ways in early voting is just one of those\nJudy tweeted I early voted so that I can expend my energy now to get others out to vote\nWhat just happened tweeted I live in New York state that does not have early voting I like going to vote on election day but I realize it's hard for some people and I wish my state had early voting I think America needs to make voting as easy as possible so more people will do it\nDavid is there a case to be made for voting early besides you know I mean we heard from Judy why she voted early so she can focus on get out the vote efforts but what what is the case for voting early as opposed to just go on a lecture they\nMade a lot of people aren't able to go on election day right especially people who maybe have unusual types of jobs are people who can't just call off of people who can't just take the the day off I may not be remotely a easy for them to vote on election day and so\nUm you know giving people a window to do it or certainly increases turnout in from abroad democratic small D democratic a point of view that's a good thing that the counter argument to that right is that a campaign takes place over the course of this entire period\nAnd ah so there are things going on right up until election day that could in theory affect people's voting so when you allow people to vote early maybe they don't take account of all of those things\nThe question from Dwayne who asked a Twitter or early and absentee votes even counted on election day are the only counted if needed\nThat depends so I'm In in most cases yes they they are there are some places where a young they're really restrict\nIt forms of of absentee voting only in other words the where the only way that you can vote early is\nAbsentee in with a good excuse or those votes aren't necessarily going to be counted until later if if it's close or will they will sorry I should correct myself they will all they will be counted right right but they won't necessarily be counted on election day unless it's close\nUm however with a lot of these other states the they're counting them as they come in on their Web sites that you can go to and you can see the total is being updated regularly\nThere's another one of those reasons on election night to listen carefully to the coverage when they started giving returns because they will tell you state by state you know these are from the polls the early voting hasn't been counted yet there is a Twenty one day period where they double check like it's it's different from place to place\nThat's right and the other thing to to keep in mind and maybe this is one of the questions are going to ask me but uh we expect in most cases especially at this point\nWhen you look at the early voting numbers we expect to see a Republican advantage in those numbers a lot of a Web sites have been looking at this and saying oh jeeze maybe the Democratic wave isn't coming because look the Republican numbers are a little bit stronger than the Democratic members but that's what you would expect to see with respect to mail votes and the earliest voters\nOne more comment from Sarah who emailed I vote early because it's such a pleasure\nNo line easy parking any time or day I Want just easier all around David Barker\nIs the director of the center for congressional and presidential studies at American University David thanks for talking to us in the room is\nComing up we'll take a look at what's driving early voting in different states and will introduce you to some of the folks who are going to help take one eggs across America I'm

I Hope I'm pronouncing is less than ... eclipse Reddit reddish reddish clip ready as a schoolteacher who used to be a Democrat has since left the party but told you that he did not want to register as a Republican here's part of what cliff reddish had to say\nI'm not about the farthest since I'm an American and it turned to the point where when I see an American flag walked in driving through the street I'm like oh who was the Trump got all of a sudden nationalism has become this thing and I'm a gives you know whereas I never found America\nSo I'm having this conflict\nOf who I Believe in democracy I Believe in this partisanship what do I believe [noise] you know what I mean and what I Believe in is everybody should vote\nCliff reddish speaking to kill you in the public radio Michael what more can you tell us about these unaffiliated voters\nYeah ah well they're the largest group of voters in Colorado and uh that's following a trend is also taking place around the country I'm young voters especially I'm half of the half of the younger voters ... uh in Colorado are unaffiliated or I'm independent\nUh they're not voting I'm In the same numbers as Republicans or Democrats but there are enough of them voting that they're the ones who are going to decide the election and ah they're a bit of a wild card because um\nYou know in some cases they're more liberal than Democrats\nIn some cases they're more conservative Republicans than Republicans but in in other cases you know they're they're right in the middle ... what kind of like cliff is\nUm and they're frustrated I'm and I'm you know that a lot of the things that they talk about are not necessarily the issues um but how divisive politics are which is what I think cliff was getting to um they talk about a frustration that the party structures are elitist\nUm that wealth and privilege or keep ordinary Americans with\nGood ideas out of Public Leadership and\nUm there's even a sense that the system itself is standing in the way of democratic participation and representation so there you know they're focused on a really the fundamentals of democracy and I think you know listening to eclipse said ... you kind of touched on that as well\nBrian ... reporters from your station spoke to folks were casting early ballots in Johnson county Kansas a suburb of Kansas City here's what you heard from Sondra Kennedy who was voting early\nI Am I what you'd call I guess that conservative Christian [noise]\nI just I I just want to I just don't understand we're going [laughter] you know I just said that we're going down the wrong path\nWhen you have people coming to our country illegally I mean I have no problem with ... and we all are immigrants at some point so I have no problem with that\nIt's just the illegal you know taking advantage of\nThe loop holes and taking advantage of\nThe freebies that you know I just don't think that's right even when it come here then you work hard and you pay for everything yourself\nSun for Kennedy a an early voter in suburban Kansas City in Johnson county Brian do you get a sense that uh one part of your other is benefiting the most stores the most motivated for early voting\nI don't know if there's a single party that's most motivated I mean when I look at the numbers surprisingly there\nThat there are more Republicans that have have done early voting but that would be expected in a in a state like Kansas that has more Republicans and Democrats but the number of the difference between them isn't as large as you would expect which which is quite interesting ah but they're they're definitely have been more Republicans that have turned out for early voting than than Democrats at this point\nBrian ... reporter with Kim Yu W. in
