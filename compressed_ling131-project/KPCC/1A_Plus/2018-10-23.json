I just I think that this particular president is going to always go back to his greatest sitters and a public racist anti Semitic anti Muslim I agree it's um and that's what it is also sparking this this bump amongst his base\nUm I Do think though that when it comes to the economy the economy these tax cuts are two totally different things that keep in mind the stock market tanked what eight hundred points last week I mean he this president inherited Obama's\nEconomy so when he says the economy is robust he's talking about Obama's economy when April rolls around and his tax cuts kick in and all these other social safety net programs that his supporters rely on our gutted\nWe will see that this whole tax plan has been a sham anyone who took freak out in eighth grade knows\nThat this tax cut was never going to work I didn't take an eye on it and I didn't even know they do they all you know I've got you know this was it was never going to work every single independent economists\nLooked at this tax plan and said it will not work for the economy it will not work for America and it will not produce with Donald Trump is promising and the minute people start getting that dollar fifty in their paycheck\nWhen Trump promised them thousands upon thousands of dollars we know that this man doesn't do well with madam we know that he's bankrupted every single gun companies ever touch on I wouldn't be American government be any different\nAll right let's go to Mike in woodberry Minnesota who's got a question about immigration Mike thanks for calling in America on the line\nThat students districts with immigration issue I married someone who's not a system which\nOf the American embassy in the ... times the last time she got through time she came she had to give a hundred dollars Americans to get through and what can we do to make serious\nIssue between students really few hundreds and just last month the lawyer sponsored or further\nBecause of what's going on ... a lot of you know ... years and I want to bring them up here legally some guy but what I don't know right I speak with you do to make it ... people don't want to come you don't want to work that's what I'm not saying\nModel my thank you very much for for calling into America on the line I mean the frustration that you hear in my voice is frustration that I Am sure is shared by ... by millions of Americans who are frustrated by the immigration system\nThat Congress in a bipartisan manner\nWas working very hard to get a comprehensive immigration bill through the president's desk after he said in the Roosevelt Room that he wanted a quote bill of love\nAnd then turned around and kill kill kill the bill Doug how can Congress and how can an immigration reform bill ever\nCome out of Congress and certainly with this president in the White House\nWell in short Jonathan I don't think you can um I spent two and a half years working as you know I'm for house would you then house majority leader Eric Cantor where immigration was a big part of them worked on and um he talked a lot about starting with the kids folks who were brought here young people were brought here through no fault of their own\nUm and how do we make sure that they're taking care of and and treated with dignity and respect\nUm he lost his primary import because of that more there's more to it than that but I remember being at the Republican a house conference meeting in January twenty fourteen where the house leadership with general banner catching Morse Rogers and Kevin McCarthy ... laid out what we wanted our immigration principles to be and as soon as that meeting was over\nThe conversation on immigration moving in the house was over so I I'm very much of a pass a pessimist on this unless Donald Trump waves and cuts the deal and I think on a lot of issues\nDonald Trump because of in fact um some of the cost of rhetoric that he's made is it a unique position to cut the deal that or maybe a President Bush for president Rubio meeting president Jeb Bush for president Rubio or Scott Walker wouldn't have been allowed to do by the Republican base I think that's wrong guns as well\nBecause I I think the fundamental differences Donald Trump and Stephen Miller and steep and and have a very specific white national vision for this country and so when they think about immigration people from Trinidad are not welcome here under Donald Trump's America\nYou know I think he's been very clear about the types of countries that he wants to see immigrants come from and they are not countries from the Caribbean or Africa or South America or Asia He wants to Europe and he wants his quote unquote good genes from Germany and so if ...\nYou know over the line I'm Sorry John them I landed up your letters wider me not to read the law and\nSaid that if it's on how was that over the line if I'm close to the president\nJonathan this was what we have to deal with this conservatives when we hear so much about civility who is your\n...\nAnd just way find participate in the video heartless hey Doug ... and think about what your party is doing to families from Latin America every single day so you can sit here and talk about the Billy but I'm quoting your president who talks about his good genes okay Chrissie\n... Cristina dug one of the things when we went through the whole as whole country's controversy was that part of the reporting that came out of a ... out of that meeting was that he said why are we getting people from\nSay Norway so it is it is part of the conversation Doug it's not it's not ... Jonathan to hear\nYour ideas and I say this is somebody who's been pretty posed a lot of what Donald Trump ... uh come onto a program like this and I just want to hear the ... United States would disagree with a lot\nOf ... a little bit bigger than a racist over and over and over again that's not going to progress any conversation in this country forward if that's if that's the rhetoric that it's going to be and then again it's my side that's not civil as my senators are being thrown out of restaurants and things like that how's the country are going to move forward it's not serious and I'm not going to participate in the\nWell the pension might move forward if we actually try and be a little more inclusive to everyone who isn't there are I wouldn't want it on I Would agree on that and then I Would say that starts with you as well yeah well you know we're all trying but I think the real problem is that this particular president has a very specific vision and what he wound up during the recession\nChristina and Doug you guys are are done in the thirty seconds that we have ... Maria do you have anything to add in when he was like\nYeah I think ... you know what happened here I think just demonstrates how divisive or\nOur country has become and you know I Do agree is Christina President Trump has\nBeen at the helm and he has actually been the one to really injected a lot of this divisiveness and has weaponized it and use that as a political a fear mongering twelve and ... and\nWith ... river going to have to leave it there duck Hi thank you very much Christina Greer thank you very much rarer donor thank you and thanks to all of you for listening join us again tomorrow night for America on the line\nLeadership support for America on the line is provided by ...\nStiff additional support is provided by the end he Casey foundation and New York public radio trustee Dr Mary White\nWere alive for local we're bellies NPR leader eighty nine point three K.

ruled that public sector employees have a First Amendment right not to pay union for collective bargaining unions called it's unfair because non union workers benefit from the contracts that can be reached to collective bargaining but now won't have to pay for that\nSome blue state solve this decision coming in preemptively pass legislation to protect unions from high court ruling were discussing that and more issues related to state laws on unions with Scott Greenberger executive editor of state line Sarah Duncan is still with us on the line she's a candidate for the west Virginia House of delegates and she is a case a visual arts teacher\nIn states around the country the places where schools were more well funded the places where teacher salaries were higher we're in places that had\nFair share fees the places that had this so called right to work are places that actually have lower wages for workers and that makes sense because people who are workers I'm not talking about the people who fund the Mackinac center life that seat of Oscar the Koch brothers\nWho are fairly rich and well endowed\nPeople who are workers don't have power by themselves and that's why they joined together as unions and you see that historically that when the unions were at its apex the middle class or just said packs and then the last thing I'll say this no one ever had to join a union\nIn the public sector and no one ever was fired for not joining a union that is just completely false and what we do now and what has happened since the case\nIs that there is a huge value of belonging and even though people were really off at the Mackinac center that they sent an email to every single school teacher in Penn State's saying no you no longer have to be part of your union what people have been doing is basically saying we're sticking\nWith the union because they noses value even though lots of us including myself have issues oftentimes with every with with individual positions that are union state Scott you wanted to jump in\nWell I just wanted to note uh that the you know we talked to a teacher I'm from West Virginia who who talked about the union but um [noise]\nThe uh the teacher walkout in in in West Virginia last spring which was followed by similar walkouts in Oklahoma Kentucky Arizona\nAnd Colorado um there there are unions there as as she said but those in West Virginia they don't have a collective bargaining rights and there is no contract to no legal right to strike and so what was interesting about that\nThat labor action there was that it was a it was a walk out that was really generated by um the teachers themselves and and through in fact a Facebook group and it was not a sort of the top down a strike that many people many of your listeners might think of when they think of a teacher's strike\nNow Scott before the Janice ruling a few states preemptively pass laws to try to protect unions from whatever the ruling might involve what exactly did this\nStates do or try to do so the idea I mean what are the pro union states were afraid of what the Janice decision was that uh it would undermine the financial stability of unions um and so they took steps that were designed to to um\nTo pump up membership and unions to to give the unions have better chance of keeping their membership\nUp and their and their finances um stable so for example a New York which is the most heavily unionized state in the country I'm now has a law which gives unions the right to meet with new hires during the workday requires public employers to give unions contact information for new hires\nAnd also allows unions to give extra services to their members um other states have taken similar steps all with the goal of making it easier for unions to retain members\n[noise] let me get through a few more of your comments summer wrote on our Facebook page I live in Kansas and I'm a postal carrier I Love being a part of the union to keep our pay fare most companies around us will tell you if you speak up with a union rep you'll be fired\nIt makes you wonder what are the company's agendas or what did they profit from employees not being represented by a union\nWe also got a voice mail from a listener tiny in Ohio who explain what she's been seeing when her state transition school bus drivers from unionized workers to non unionized workers here's what Connie left in our inbox\nI Belong to open the Ohio association of public school employees I just want to make a comment about unions and privatizing\nBus transportation privatized mass transportation said kissed checks for safety are deplorable compared to bus drivers that are unionized\nAnd dry for their particular school district the uh differences are absolutely amazing you want a union worker that cares about their job that cares about\nTheir children first and foremost that they transport uh you can't beat a union member\nConnie thanks very much for sharing your thoughts with us Vincent ... I'd love to get your reaction to what Comey said\nHey listen I'm you know we support union members and um you know believe that obviously when you're talking about bus drivers school bus drivers republic employees that it is it's the taxpayers it's the children and deploys themselves that we have to focus on\nI'm going back to a you know something that Randy was talking about about the funders I mean these false and exaggerated on having um attacks are designed to undermine education effort education efforts aimed at the exact people that county was talking about\nUm like Scott was talking about before you know there have been bills introduced in past in states around the country to circumvent the rights that were bestowed from the giants decision\nAnd traps public employees into paying unions even if they don't want to order they disagree with the unions politics\nI just want to ... and 'cause I Know we're coming up on a break it sounds like honey was saying that union members from her perspective just do better work\nYeah [noise] well that I think that's a matter of perspective union member a non union member I Believe all public employees care about especially those in the teaching profession or those taking care of children care about those children so when said union member or not um cares more than let's say non union member\nI just want to give Randy a chance to jump in when we continue our conversation with Randi Weingarten if the American federation of teachers Vincent ...
