in from Madison, Wisconsin and I want to go to Ross who is also in Madison, Wisconsin how is it called the show Madison on the line Ross thank you for calling into America on the line\nOh hey it's actually Scott Ross try out rough [laughter]\nUm I you know I mean I think I you know and I I Know ah Craig's work at the journal sentinel it's terrific he's a great analysts when it comes to a voter turnout voter trends that sort of thing\nBut I disagree with him just a little bit in terms of there being a swing vote during the state of Wisconsin because there is a swing vote in the state of Wisconsin in the last forgotten generation X.\nUm those voters from about age thirty eight forty to fifty to fifty three have\nA job out of ten ... ten point difference in their performance for presidential candidate democratic presidential candidates and democratic gubernatorial candidate so when you're talking about those kinds of issues those bread and butter those up you know his wallet issues whether it's student loan debt childcare family medical leave\n'em what are you going to do for retirement giant actors are the first generation to not have employer provided pensions by and large you know those economic issues are what's going to drive that that demographic to the polls and decide whether or not they vote for Tony ... or they vote for the longest serving Gen x politician American history that things got Kevin Walker\nI got that this time yeah\nHey it's great I agree with you there I mean I think there are swing voters I mean there were five hundred community Wisconsin that voted for Obama and then voted for Trump four years later I mean they're definitely swing voters we know they're not a lot of them but they matter and they're going to matter in this race\nYeah but I you know here's the one thing I'll say about that is that\nYou know basically for the last Thirty years Republicans have won gubernatorial races in the state of Wisconsin the only guy who is one is a Democrat is Jim Doyle now he won in two thousand two but that was after sixteen years a Republican rule and that was wherever there was a third party candidate you know Tommy Thompson's brother who got\nEleven percent a hundred and eighty thousand votes enjoy one by sixty five thousand the real model for how Democrats should win in a gubernatorial gubernatorial election in Wisconsin It's from two thousand six where it was a wave election year and you know we always say you got to turn them on if you want to turn them out so if you're not talking about the issues they care about you can't expect them to come out to the\nPolls and get any late and we are to do to do inspiration than it is the new route to do motivation and persuasion\nGot Scott Ross in Madison, Wisconsin I mean thank you very much for calling in and use the last three minutes or so\nTo give Craig and I'm currently a chance to weigh in on everything that they heard\nFor just a couple of things if it's funny to get all those calls were Madison I mean that might be like the most politically engaged place in America in fact it's like there is no other like ultra Baluch county that votes or that turns out at the rate that Dane County which is Madison\nDoes I mean it just and it has an impact on state wide elections well we had a\nBigger and blue or when on the yes on and we had ... don't forget about Gore T the extremely conservative independent\nWho is calling in from Madison but go ahead sorry\nYeah no I mean I we we we we just sort of went into a fast of of of Walker bashing here and I don't actually disagree with ... about the uh the the corporate welfare and the\nAnd the transfer of wealth but the you know I also understand that the Wisconsin's a much larger states in Madison and got\nWe've got a lot of activists talking points there there's a lot of reasons to be critical of Scott Walker and think that he's in trouble but but you don't you know a lot of this is ... is the sort of the you know if you feel it feels like the ... the partisan we'll on education\nI think that we're having a very constructive debate about education here in Wisconsin I think it's great pointed out before\nA Scott Walker recognize you got a problem with that and these pumped a lot of money now back into education at the schools are not falling apart um the the graduation rate has not collapse the grades of not collapse\nOr university system is still one of the prides of of the country\nSo there is always a ... you know in an attempt to and there's a tendency to make things very apocalyptic but right now\nAnd this is the irony of politics nationally the economy is really quite strong in Wisconsin the unemployment rate is low taxes have been held low or despite the talking points that's a ... and not falling apart I drive with them all the time\nThe only time I see that the roads are falling apart is when they see a TV ad\nUm which is not to say that uh there was not a way for for change and an exhaustion going on here\nBut what you just heard is understand that the Wisconsin is you know there there is there is this a rural Wisconsin perspective that I think would be very very different than the perspective of partisan Democrats calling in from Madison\n... yeah that's all true I mean one of the interesting things about what's going to have Sweeney the rural voters and again we saw that between the Obama and Trump elections and these people as one of your previous guest said\nThere's no universal theory you explain\nYou know why they voted for Trump after voting for Obama I mean a lot of it with anti Hillary some of his economic some of it was just they have a history of swing against the party in power and that's again one of the problems to come back to Scott Walker he hasn't been he wanted to regularly scheduled elections\nUnder a Democratic president where Republican voters are mobilized and now he's running under the under ... run by president and that's the last time there was a Republican president the Democrats had a really good mid\nTerm it was down ... just a yes or no Charlie does Governor Walker win reelection\nI'm asked me twenty four hours from now we have a market university ... coming out of the mid middle rag the middle not on a good am Margo they're going to say that I think when you get out because he has he has a track

latest book uses that to help leaders bring out the best in their teams too many jobs demand perfection and obedience and not a safe place to just be ourselves or make mistakes but brown argues that wholehearted workplaces are not just more enjoyable for more successful\nWe'll dig into her book veer to lead and we'd love to hear from you what's helping your employees bring their best cells to work\nFor what's getting underway comments on our Facebook page for tweet us ... one egg [noise]\nLive from NPR News in Washington on Giles Snyder hurricane Michael is strengthening in the Gulf of Mexico and NPR's Debbie Elliott reports it's on the path to make landfall in the Florida Panhandle tomorrow as a major hurricane\nSo you know your options are limited here too oh shame I Know that or no I have sociopathic tendencies\nSo shame the sense that there's something about is that makes us unworthy of love belonging connection side ... what's the difference between shame and guilt\nSo the million dollar question I'm with one of the most important answers I think probably in my career shame I Am bad guilt I did something bad shame\nHas no redeeming value I think if you look evolutionarily it probably did at one time but now that we have a more sophisticated understand their motion\nShame is not helpful guilt I Am bad is when we hold censoring the guilt I did that\nOh I'm Sorry guilt I did something bad yes so guilt is that we hold something we've done up and think wow that's outside of my values that that isn't not aligned with who I Want to be and it causes discomfort that causes psychological discomfort cognitive dissonance\nHere's what I've done that that's not who I Want to be but what we have found and the research is that psychological discomfort from guilt really fuels\nBehavior change apologizing making amends circling back cleaning things up where shame we think we want to use it I mean especially now God it's rapid as a social justice tool and like\nIt doesn't work because shame drives denial rationalizing and anger\nAnd we do it because it feels good someone upsets F ... you know we want we shame them but it never leads to meaningful change\nSo that shame let's define vulnerability what do you mean by vulnerability particularly because I think uh there are many definitions depending on who you ask of what it means\nTo be vulnerable whether they're just means kind of letting all of your guard down one of our listeners emailed I Am in a small office five people my boss is very guarded my coworker isn't over Scherer I'm In the middle saying\nI'm happy [laughter] I just want to work from home [laughter]\nSo what exactly do we mean by vulnerability it's not over sharing until in everybody everything right now\nSo vulnerability has a simple definition it's the emotion we experience during times of uncertainty risk and emotional exposure it's that feeling that we get when we put ourselves out there and we can't control the outcome\nYou know when we ... we that thousands of people to define vulnerability for us and the answers range from the first date after my divorce sharing a new idea with my boss giving someone difficult feedback\nTrying to get pregnant after my third miscarriage coming out to my parents I'm sitting with my wife who has stage for breast cancer and talking about plans for our two year old and four year old starting my own business telling my family members who invested in my business that we failed\nYou know vulnerability is the willingness to show up and put yourself out there when you can't control how that's going to go\nNow several of those examples you gave have to do directly with the world of work sharing an idea get feedback starting a business saying you failed it the point that I get from your book is that creating space for vulnerability at work is kind of the core of doing anything as a company worth doing no matter what your company's doing\nThat's exactly right and you know I'll tell you this because you'll appreciate that structure I think I used to stand when I Would go to these organizations and just like you detail they would say oh my gosh we really want you to come but please don't talk about vulnerability I'm like well I'm kinda I'm Talking about vulnerability\nSo I used to spend like half an hour or trying to convince them and then one day I found myself on a base talking to a hundred special forces troops and\nI just ask one question\nThe definition of vulnerability is uncertainty risk an emotional exposure can anyone in this room give me a single example of courage that you've seen or witnessed in your life that you yourself at engaged in that did not require uncertainty risk an emotional exposure\nAnd there was just that silence and finally a young man raised his hand and said no ma'am three tours there is absolutely no courage without vulnerability\nOasis emailed I Am a social worker my boss is a social worker all of my coworkers or social workers are director ensures that we are not only empathetic towards one another but empathetic with clients in the community that we serve we treat each other we treat others as we should wish to be treated\nI Know you have to pause in a moment but that's another term we should define empathy what is it use it\nKind of golden rule mentality or is there a little more to it to that\nThere's actually for skill sets that enter pen empathy the good news is it can be taught that empathy I think in a nutshell is feeling with people not feeling for them sympathy is oh man bless your heart like\nThe Texas from west your harsher harsher right just chills up your spine you poor thing of feeling\nFor which which really just magnifies shame\nBecoming pushes you away I was like well it's almost like saying I'm Glad I'm not where you\nAre is it ... it's really bad it's yeah it's about as you think but I'm over here with that kind of stuff that happened and an empathy is dealing with someone it's not taking on their emotions but it's saying yeah me too\nIt's it's kind of I'm Glad you said me too that's kind of have it feels like it's the power behind that hold it is absolutely if you talk to Toronto Burke uh who's on who the creative to be creative and to meet you miss that\nUm it's all about empathy it's about you know it's so funny because every now and then a word like empathy or authenticity comes at you and to the firing line to researchers like I don't think that these good after all at the the is great because here's the thing vulnerability is not vulnerability\nWithout boundaries empathy is not empathy without boundaries\nIf you're having a hard time and you're down in that whole\nI see you and I'm Down there because I\nWant you know you're not alone I don't just jump in there and just be miserable with you\nAll our conversation with Renee brown and just a moment I'm Joshua Johnson and you're listening to one a firm W.

brown her new book is called dear to lead speaking of the world of work we learned today that a high profile woman in the Trump Administration is leaving her job at the end of this year Nikki Haley is America's ambassador to the United nations and this morning she announced her resignation\nIn the resignation letter Haley says she plans to return to the private sector after fourteen years in public office\nHe was formerly the governor of South Carolina has somewhat international reputation\nFor being willing to take on her boss from time to time she told the New York times she doesn't agree with the president on everything but says there was a right and wrong way to address that will pick up the phone call them or meet with him in person\nAnd so it is about setting and intention as a culture and from both top and bottom building that culture again so armor is not rewarded or necessary [noise]\nGot a number of comments [noise] excuse me I got a number of comments from several of you about dealing with this trust among your leaders particularly leaders who have proven themselves to be on trustworthy Constance is in Silver Spring Maryland just outside D.C\nConstance emailed my most recent boss made it a hobby of cruelty she always picked out one new person as a special target and did everything short of physical assault to make their life miserable including trashing their reputation with supervisors one year\nI was the target everyone knew what was going on she just likes to be mean I was told no one intervened at the time I could not afford to quit I Would like to know how you can be yourself at such a workplace\nYou can't you can't because it's not emotionally or if as it doesn't sound emotionally or physically safe but\nWhat I Would say is that as time limited I don't know when you stay in a situation like that and many of us had to have had to stay in jobs that were that South abusive\nBut you cannot do it long term and if there's not someone who in a leadership position that you can talk to about this uh you know really freely and say how do I manage this\nHow do we hold this person accountable how can I get some protection from this culture I think time is short in that position\nJennifer wrote on our website the one eight dot org ... there's a lot of good are done in rural communities and families but to suppress the emotions are one of the reasons that farmers commit suicide at a high rate if you do not know how to express and accept uncertainty and vulnerability you can literally kill you so\nThat leads me to a question about regional even national differences how have you found that workplace cultures differ across the country around the world how do I do use about shame and vulnerability manifest differently depending on where you are\nI'm at a drawn interesting parallel that I think you'll be interested in it's the same question that I got after I finished the original shame research around religion\nOr their denominations that are more shaming everyone wants to know about the Baptists and the Catholics you know that's not that's the big question more shaming than everybody else and here's what's interesting here's what we found there is\nNo denomination that is inherently more shaming however there are congregations you\nCan trace like critical masses of shame as social control not back to a specific religion but back to a specific church wow which means it's not the doctrine that how the doctrine is used by by people\nTo gain power and so what I Would say is you can't go to California and find more vulnerable empathetic people and go to Boston and like more guarded heads down it's about the leadership in an organization\nIt's how the leaders model\nAnd protect and ... human eyes work\nWhat about parts of the world I mean in America we have a very we're in inherently rebellious nation like we're kind of a do your own way do not own thing kind of people but great companies have emerged\nFrom Japan and Germany and all over the world was very different cultural standards that are in ... in some ways much more hierarchical much more centralized much less focused on creativity and more focused on compliance yeah how do you square that\nWell we we're not sure and then we hosted a training in London\nAnd we had forty people attend representing forty different nations and we went around the room and I said what is the cultural lesson around vulnerability and every single person had\nA teaching\nThat was embedded in their hearts and their families and their workplace like some of the folks from the u._k. said don't get a notion above your station yeah tight lipped yes step up or less from Holland they said you know the translation is terrible but don't stand taller than all the other poppy\nAmong the other poppies in the poppy field vulnerability is not easy anywhere because all of that armor is protecting them as human part of us are hard\nWell it's also protecting our job I mean you got to be able to pay rent\nRight sometimes it's protecting our job but sometimes just getting in the way of our job I mean I think about in my own role as a leader and not just as a professor at Twenty years but as the founder and see yeah\nI Would say armor and the lack of grounded confidence has been the primary reason\nHas been the number one struggle with employees I'm Sorry grounded confident so we can't just ask people to take armor off and show up make and you can't straight through work right and the whole disclosure over sharing stuff that's not vulnerability that something else\nBut the real ability to show up and ... you know the number one problem is people who don't do vulnerability don't do hard conversations they avoid conflict they don't talk to people when they're upset they talk about people behind their backs\nSo this whole idea that Vognar do you know being vulnerable is going to cost us our job I Would argue that not being vulnerable not being brave will cost you your job\nBecause when you start having the meeting after the meeting because you're afraid to speak out that's toxic in the culture when you start getting people the dirty yes in the meeting meaning like oh yeah Joshua that sounds like a great idea I thanks for sharing and then I get out of the media and say hey make sure you cut you off with finding out what that stuff happening\nThat isn't not protecting your job\nWhat's protecting your job again if you think phone ability as disclosure of this is confusing but so let's clear that vulnerability is not disclosure [noise] it's the willingness to stay in a hard conversation when it becomes awkward\nUncomfortable [noise] if the willingness to hold somebody accountable [noise] instead of blaming them is the ability to reset after failure and disappointment\nI Wonder if there are certain kinds of companies when we can continue this for the moment but I Wonder if there are certain kinds of companies where it's more appropriate than others one of our listeners tweeted is this person furious because it's a joke to keep your opinions out of my place of business or you are fired or there's
