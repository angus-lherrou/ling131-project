{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Has shrunk by about eleven percent so\nYou're looking at a situation where I I think there was mentioned earlier of Texas trying to poach teachers from other states\nWe have those billboards popping up here too and as the father of the student in Oklahoma public schools you know I Want the best for my kid and I want the best for the rest of the kids would save Oklahoma end up my district\nUm I ... I I haven't my notes here that are you I think this is you you preach to your your class you have to step up\nThat's exactly right and now I this is this is your Fifteen for me and each year I've got a crop of of kids that you know if I if I can impart to them just for one thing and I certainly hope\nTo teach them much more than that but if I can leave them with a sense that it's their world too that\nThey have a voice that they have the power to to make change happen for the better than than I feel like that's that's about the greatest service I can do to to my state and as we were watching you know as we were watching the clouds on the horizon as we're seeing things kind of leading toward April's\nWalk out I live in a district that had a incumbent who went almost a decade without challenge and she decided she wanted to run for another seat and so this was a completely open seat\nAnd I kept calling the local party office suit talking to people in the community saying who's running who kind of support who can I volunteer for and was met collectively with with drugs and\nIt got to a point where I said you know if I'm going to tell the kids that I see every day if I tell my daughter that she\nYou know that you can make a difference and that you have a responsibility to step up and do what's right and I'm if I'm not going to step up and what kind of role model am I what am I doing you know what am I doing with my life then so\nYou know this is this is me walking the walk\nMichael Ross in West Tulsa, Oklahoma thank you very much for calling into America on the line and good luck\nThank you so much and Amy who is aiming for Russo in while he Hawaii welcome to America\nOn the line [laughter] I Love I Love actually why ... why do I have a okay I hear a law yeah oh okay well\nThough you are running for for office in Hawaii or on the Democratic ticket what about being a teacher in your state has made you run for office\nYou know I think that what I'd like to add to that conversation is I think that all of our experiences as teachers come not just from the classroom but I'm not just some these immediate struggles\nThat were engaged in over a funding of our public schools but I'm also I Would say two decades of politicization of teachers around the education\nThe formula that rate so I'm standardization over emphasis on test scores um then moved to\nKnowledge tries and charter as the public school system I think all of these have had an impact on our public schools in some states more than others say that overall effect has been to politicize teachers and I think that what you're seeing nationally is\nA reflection of that so now teachers are willing to enter electoral politics because um it it does seem that our legislators don't clearly understand the challenges that [noise] that um [noise] we are facing us in the classroom but system why\nOther schools are Amy we're running out of time but I Want to ask you one more question how will you deal with not being in class teaching students if you win\nWell I I if I win I'll I'll go on me um and then go back\nTo teaching but um I I think that I I Do plan to be I'm deeply engaged in civic education in this state so I Want to continue that engagement with\nYoung people around the disc these questions that politics and power and public education\nAmy ... calling in from Hawaii thank you very much for for calling into America on the line thank you\nSo given a we we've heard from Amy Joe Becky Michael only Becky was ... well I should say back he was the only Republican\nI'm that we had a ... call Ian who called in or the local GOP organizers I'm taking candidates like Becky a seriously in this new teacher movement that's happening around the country\n[noise] [noise] yeah I think so I think to a certain extent that varies from state to state uh and to a certain extent the partisanship of these movements has varied from state to state I Would say in Arizona into a certain extent in Kansas and Oklahoma it's probably a little bit more tied in with the Democratic party\nUm in places like Kentucky and West Virginia it hasn't been as much um there's definitely been awesome some inter Republican clashes over this Kansas was really where this movement first started\nUm in sort of a revolt to the cuts imposed after a San Brownback former governor of that state passed these sweeping tax cuts that ended up really just guarding the state's budget and um there were some intro Republican fight between moderates and conservatives over\nThe support of the tax cuts there were a few primaries are broader trade outs conservatives or vice versa some of the people involved in that were teacher candidates and so I think Republicans realize that teachers even though teachers' unions are typically associated with Democrats\nUm teachers have a background that appeals to everyone including Republican primary voters\nAnd I should point out that the four super callers that we had called in running for office the teachers they're all running a four state Senate\nOr in their in their states\nI'm just wondering in the little time that we have left we talked to two candidates for state Senate but it's this teacher movement I'm going on the national level do we have teachers running for Congress\nSo you haven't seen as much of that you have seen this teacher movement impact a number of state wide races\nOr for example the teacher movement has really a good chunk of the reason the\nOklahoma gubernatorial races actually competitive\nUm there's an attorney general they're a former attorney general Democrat named drew Edmondson who's making a real run up that race despite being a Democrat\nHe's doing well enough of the Republican Governors Association is going up and attack ads against him you've also seen a West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin use his support for the teacher walkouts they're as sort of talking points um for his own reelection he released an ad talking about why he supported the walk out in his opponent\nDid not well Kevin rubber learned from ... post thank you very much for being on America on the line and bringing the story to our attention\nGreat to be here thank our guests tonight and all the teachers and for you and to all of you for listening joined us again on Monday remember you can tweet us at ...

of it but a lot of this happened before Twitter or Facebook really I think people blame Fox News and the ... of information and and I'm Sorry but MSNBC and to what extent to an extent I think less so but they blame twenty four hour cable news and the sorting effect there but what is it to you when you look at how red and blue\nTransformed from how you vote to to who you are\nYeah well I mean look at it is true the evolution of media and just broadly speaking media from from you know forty years ago\nWhen you were talking about ABC CBS NBC that's basically it and then you get your local newspaper local newspapers were really strong\nBack then ... and that was it\nTo cable news channels all sorts of cable channels to entertainment programs that sort of have a fusion with politics now political content all over entertainment programming all of the various online streaming platforms that are out there they lend themselves to tribalism so I I think that's one of the factors\nAnother one that just kind of occurred to me when I looked at all this was\nI think as human beings in some ways we are hardwired for tribalism and it was just sort of this this almost a fluke of the way technology and the media has evolved for for so long well into the twentieth century our politics didn't fully reflect that and what we had really into the Nineteen nineties and this is what the nineties I think sort it out but\nHeading into the Nineteen nineties if you looked at the Democratic party\nYou saw massive video logical diversity you saw conservative southerners sharing a party with big city liberals you know in the north\nAnd if you look at the Republican Party you saw a genuine liberals liberal Republicans from the northeast sharing a party with you know conservative isolationist from the Midwest and in the Republican Party that was that was still just trying to sort of establish its footing in the south that really got that in the Nineteen nineties I Would say um but the ... with in each party\nThere was a very broad ideological geographic diversity\nAnd if you almost look at the system you look at the media around it and it was almost was almost waiting to be sorted out and I think that's been Ninety Days shortage at all that will\nLook more that history in the nineties but let's not let the politicians themselves off the how much of this was strategy because we're going to talk about some of the history of Reagan and pat you can and I don't mean to just single out Republicans but but I think it is historically accurate that a lot of the\nCapitalization and and sort of\nAn operational ... of tribalism in politics started with the southern strategy started with Republicans who really said we can define who are voters are we can make them mad we can make them identify with a what they stand for when they when they kick in our candidate well and it was\nLooked at the name that looms large in this and and it was he just whatever you think of them is a fascinating character is Newt Gingrich\nAnd Newt Gingrich obviously towers over the politics of the nineties but the Gingrich story begins in Seventy eight when he gets elected to Congress\nAnd the Congress that Newt Gingrich comes to a ... is one that is dominated by Democrats at that point it had been a generation since Republicans took control the house and they weren't even close\nAnd will Gingrich was looking at was he was looking at presidential election results Richard Nixon in Nineteen Seventy two was able to win forty nine states in in Nineteen eighty Ronald Reagan wins forty say Republicans running as conservative certainly with Reagan can win big nationally\nThe reason he saying Republicans hadn't been able to win in the house is\nThey don't have that clear definition than Ronald Reagan had that clear contrast that Ronald Reagan benefits from and what Gingrich said was we need to change the way we operate in the house as a Republican Party the idea of compromising with Democrats that tells voters there's no difference between us and the Democrats the idea of working with him he's every the idea of partisan warfare\nAs a tool to mobilize voters to create contract to create definition\nThat swimming Gingrich slowly but but then rapidly got Republicans in Congress just to sort of embrace it was the key to his rise it was ... it was the key also to the ultimate success with Republicans and\nGetting out in Nineteen Ninety four definition contrarian isn't voting against the other side defining yourself\nTo towering figures in your book from the nineties you just mentioned Newt Gingrich the other one is Bill Clinton and the president whom he faced off against when Newt Gingrich was speaker of the house and I take you back now to Nineteen Ninety five the government shutdown the result of a standoff\nBetween Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton Republicans and Democrats in Washington over the budget here's Bill Clinton November Nineteen Ninety five\nGovernment is partially shutting them because Congress has failed to pass the straightforward legislation necessary\nTo keep the government running with out imposing sharp hikes and Medicare premiums and deep cuts in education and the environment unfortunately Republican leaders in Washington have foot ideology of common sense and shared values\nPlaying now see we could talk about the policy choices that led to the shutdown whether it was the environment or budget lines or how much money you're going to spend it wasn't really about any of that it was about ideological definition\nIt was about warfare\nWell and it was also it was about what a moment that was in and to put that in in full context\nThat was supposed to be Newt Gingrich finishing off Bill Clinton finishing off the Democratic party because they said Gingrich came to the house in Seventy eight when he came to the house he was a back bench or he was a GED flight his own party didn't even take him seriously\nAnd by Nineteen Ninety four he leads them to the majority and it was just shocking traumatic event in American politics are Republicans racing forty years of democratic rule in Gingrich's reading on that was there was just this rising in unstoppable conservative tied that he had captured in Chino into the Republican Party\nAnd they had control the house they would finish off Bill Clinton with a grain showdown in Nineteen Ninety five and it would be over the size of government and\nThe one of the biggest features of it was Medicare they were cut two hundred Seventy billion dollars in in in Medicare cuts that they wanted and Bill Clinton basically said I dare you to shut down the government over this and this was going to be this was going to be the test\nAnd it revealed there's this sort of contradiction I think that's out there\nUm they just prevented either party from in the modern era getting a full consensus a for a long time and it's that conceptually people love conservatism\nBut they also they like their Medicare and that was that was what Bill Clinton tap into when he won that showdown politically and flash forward to the Tea Party movement keep your government Harris yeah my editor said whether they build where we\nSaw that struck a lot of people as not just weird but also strangely historical well after that came impeachment came impeachment managers like Lindsey Graham a guy who's on the scene today we're going to talk about Lindsey Graham we're also going to go back to the eighties Newt Gingrich and his famous showdown\nWith speaker Tip
