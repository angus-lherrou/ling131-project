{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "My entire life I've seen mass shootings I've seen gun violence on the news they have a day doesn't pass where I don't see an American shot and killed by another American and that is a choice made by her leadership [noise] if it's not a total sweep in twenty teen where we knock out all the people who are corrupt\nThis is a change of culture will see more people leave this political game because the game is changing were writing the rules and we're going to make sure that you have to be a decent person if you're going to be an elected official that shouldn't be a controversial statement that should be something that is just normal comments that [laughter]\nSo even if in twenty Nineteen and Congress there's not a universal background check bill that passes there still is controversy around passing any sort of gun reform will you see that as a failure\n[laughter] no it won't be a failure of the people who are following you do you think they're going to continue to stay engaged I mean that's the other\nCriticism you get especially when people are talking about young people they say oh well they're going to be really engaged until they realize it's a lot harder than it looks and\nThere's this very patronizing way they talk about young people that you know they're going to kind of grow out of bed and they're going to lose interest and it's just going to go back to the way things have always been and a new topic will come up in its place\nI mean people are saying that like six months ago\nAnd you know liberate now right young people are still mobilizing right young people are still being active young people are still speaking about this and it's not just Parkland or march ... there's a chunk amount of young people who are working with their local organizations who are working with local campaigns were volunteering who are doing you know projects of their school to be civically engaged\nRight young people are continuing to speak up\nAnd you know just rhetoric of you know young people you know maybe they'll get tired maybe they're\nYou know give up you know it's not true you know young people are still going and also you know after twenty Eighteen we still have local elections we have city councilman mayors state houses to to elect right and those are just as important as like no national politics because\nA lot of time the gun violence that happens every day in America are going to happen under served communities majority black in black and brown communities and that comes to school to prison pipeline not enough funding going into into schools and\nUh you know creating the cycle of violence you know um it it it comes from kid getting shot going home and these aren't the this isn't the gun violence has talked about every day and the way to solve that it's through local elections\nYeah and I think um in regards to success and failure in that metric\nUh we've seen over sixty laws passed at the state level\nA lot of states that you'd never expect this sort of policy to even make it out of the committee and we've seen these laws already be used to save lives and if we're trying to measure success I mean no one has been as successful as we had been this year in regards to getting this policy through\nAnd so it's not just about Congress so much is being done at the local and state level to combat gun violence because we have to I mean if we don't act now people will continue dying it is life or death\nIs there any other message that you think those of us who might not be younger people need to understand about what it is you're doing and what it is you will be doing in the post election time period\nIn the foreseeable future I plan on fighting for this issue with every breath I have because I Need to fight for this when you see someone younger than you in an open casket the you know that you relate to I mean that's changes you for life\nAnd I know that like they can't fight for themselves and I don't know who the next one's going to be but if I'm not fighting every single day and I'm not doing my part\nLike Matt said I'm dedicating my life to this you know seeing my own friend in a casket it it does something to you and and and it breaks you inside but\nWhen you see that it's going on around the country and when you see the injustices around you and you see the systems built to keep people from you know being suppressed from from not speaking out from being you know I'm not given the opportunity to to to live a balanced life\nThan it makes you question what is the purpose what are we doing and I always ask myself and and that's what keeps me going that's what makes makes sure that I always do the work that's needed that\nWere wherever I Do in wherever I go you know I'm making sharp and good work and make sure that I Am speaking so does who feel hopeless and just try to have a conversation to spark something in them that then that person could spark and someone else\nAnd I think this mission that we're all taking on is bigger than any individual and it is part of the American dream that we all you know wants to believe and that's the American dream that my parents traveled to this country for and others to live a happy life to pursuit of happiness and liberty and freedom\nRight and economic opportunity until we reached that point I Would never stop fighting and I'm always keep doing this work\nNot in Ramon thank you guys for joining us thank you thank you met died she is co founder and chief strategist ... is a national field strategist for march for our lives\n[noise]\nAll right one more thing for me the marches rallies the walk out those things are easy to find a five we can count the people who showed up the miles traveled into votes cast was harder to assess is their overall impact or in the middle of a social movement the start of a period of significant change\nOr is this just a unique moment motivated mostly by President Trump\nThe thing about tipping points is that we don't know we're in them until after the tipping has already occurred professor David Meyer who I talked with earlier in the show\nSaid that social movements are like iceberg with only a fraction showing above the water line\nWhat we don't know how many people are sharing the protests are rallies from a desk and\nI was really heartened by the interviews I did this week with all kinds of people who are involved in political advocacy they all knew it wasn't going to be easy and they weren't expecting instant result\nWhat they did know was that their voice mattered\nIn India and that's the most important takeaway of all [noise]\nThanks so much for listening I'm Amy Walter and this is the takeaway [noise]\n\n[noise] there are less than three weeks until the matrix but already some Democrats are thinking about another election twenty twenty race\nSome people question my heritage and my family

Trump continues making waves ahead of the midterms joking about a reporter who got body slammed by a politician meanwhile New Hampshire voters have local races to the side of\nThe Democrats believe this is an issue that works for Raleigh Kelly by for background at one point she was a single mother with three kids um work their way through college and she's been running pretty much school simply

Huck\nSaudi Arabia is acknowledging the deaths of journalists ... cars showed gee at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul that's according to a report by the Saudi state news agency which says Eighteen people are under arrest including to advisors to the Saudi crown prince President Trump offering this reaction\nIt wrong on up until now Donald Trump had looked pretty bad by using these race racial slurs against her essentially and\nBecause she went out and get this DNA tests and released it and sort of dignified it with a response and it elevates the discussion beyond what it it had to be and so some of the blame is on her for starting a conversation when she she didn't need to necessarily\nJosh Rogers when we're going to talk more about New Hampshire politics a little later in the program but the folks here in the grand if they care about all of this kind of like bickering the kind of school yard politics to Ali bloody body slammed the guy in al counter pulled out of like there's a lot of other stuff going on in New Hampshire how much do you feel like these\nKinds of we'll call them shiny objects for now really matter to voters here in New Hampshire\nWithin the matter as much as many other things are Donald Trump is looking to shore up his base here on behalf of Republicans running um you know this is certainly and keeping us away he ran away with the New Hampshire primary this is really has for the place where he first one there's no reason for him to believe that this\nWon't be effective and you know for consumers of talk radio in the region or the back and forth over Elizabeth Warren's a ancestry is been standard fare now for years\nAnd ... actually as I think of that I Wonder if from your perspective Josh it's too reductive to say that voters are focused either on these kind of red meat political issues or on more substantive local issues I assume it's a little more both and that voters here can hold both of those things in their heads the same time well I think\nThey're going to hold votes but it's hard to one thing I've been trying to fathom is the degree to which a Donald Trump leaves space for other things to be held in one's mind um\nYou talk to voters who are interested in the outcomes of the fall elections and you know they will tell you the the torrent of news out of Washington and makes it hard to really pay attention to local issues and that's something that candidates are struggling with as well and as far as it was with Warren goes\nUh you know their their local indications that she's you know building a campaign organization and wait up here she has staffers working up here and certainly Democrats I've talked to about her decision to announce the outcome of this DNA test\nYou know a bunch of them said I Wish you would have waited till after the midterms and you know there are those who would make the broader points of view no identity is more social question then genetic ah you know why she wanted to do there is something that nobody I've talked to here is a good idea about\nWe did have a conversation this Wednesday about that very thing also NPR's Karen Grigsby Bates had a store had a story about what is identity quite in that context we'll talk more about what voters here in New Hampshire are thinking in the run up to the midterms\nAs we continue to round up with Josh Rogers senior political correspondent with New Hampshire public radio\nAlexander Jaffe corresponded with vice news tonight on HBO and McClatchy White House correspondent Franco or don't yes let's shift gears to Georgia where early voting got underway this week the governor's race there has been very closely watched Stacey Abrams the Democratic candidate would have become Georgia's first black female governor if she wins\nThe Republican candidate Brian campus currently Georgia's secretary of state\nHe's been under fire after the Associated Press reported that a recent purge of the voter rolls disproportionately affected black voters also eight PM reports from American public media putting number to how many voters have been purged recently it's about a hundred and Seventy thousand\nI Wonder Frank uh what the impact of all of this is Kemp as the secretary of state oversees elections in Georgia he's also in an election in Georgia and he's pushback saying everyone who's registration was suspended can still cast a ballot I Wonder what context we put this in front\nOf a ... I mean it's it's a massive issue I mean here this could be\nA close is a race in recent history it's a dog by these allegations of voters being cut from the ... um mostly talking about keeping more than fifty thousand mostly black residents off the rolls [noise]\nYou know the the camp says that he can be impartial and he points to other um other secretaries of state who have overseen um elections but\nYou know the sources that we have spoken to and we've covered this um say that look this is just a matter of common sense it is so close it is so important that he should be considered risky using himself I'm from a overseeing this such a critical election there's too much at stake um but he seems to be fighting fighting that\nUm and we'll see what happens ah this this is an issue that we will continue to see for the next several waves and just to be clear of\nIf you will become America's first black female governor not just Georgia's first if she wins Alexander I know we have to pause momentarily but this race\nSeems to be pretty close what what happens if this comes down to a few hundred votes then you've got the official who oversees elections trying to I presume keep some reasonable distance in determining whether he wins the election he is in\n[noise] yeah I mean that's a legal fight that could go on for weeks if we're at the point where it's close enough that we're seeing a recount and I was speaking with and I'm sort of election protection officials like yesterday who said that Georgia is their top priority\nThey're training you know hundreds of lawyers to be on the ground in that state watching the polls making sure that nothing happens on on sort of election day and then beyond they are preparing for a protracted fight over that race because you know it's expected to come down to a couple of hundred that\nMuch more to discuss as we continue the friday news roundup with Frank or don't use a McClatchy Alexandra Jaffe of vice news tonight on HBO\nAnd Josh Rogers of New Hampshire public radio also we want to talk about the Senate race in Texas between Democrat Beto O'Rourke and Republican Ted Cruz will get some more stories from the midterms and also talk about of loved American retailer facing a tougher natural future and saying goodbye to a Microsoft cofounder\nI'm Joshua Johnson glad to be with us from Concord New Hampshire you're listening to one ad from W.

with New Hampshire public radio senior political correspondent Josh Rogers Franco or don't is White House correspondent for McClatchy and Alexandra Jaffe a correspondent for vice news tonight on HBO\nMartin rights do you think Native American voters will vote Republican and support Trump because of this not likely\nAndy writes I relish anything that makes Trump angrier makes you look bad and I was very happy that Warren released this DNA results\nYou showed his immaturity and lack of decorum once again when he simply replied who cares and hearing the story beat him endlessly and bring him out of his whole for all the world to see that's my desire\nIs as high I'm On the FEMA recovery effort as before um but certainly there's no question that that that more they're more support would be light would be enjoyed\nBut shift gears to different kinds of storm Twitter storm from the president this week on immigration on Wednesday the president exhorted Republicans to make immigration a key issue\nFor the mid term elections Josh Rogers I'm interested in your take on New Hampshire not just New Hampshire but particularly New Hampshire and how big a deal immigration is in the midterms are people talking about it is it one issue among many where does it stand\nI think is one issue among many it is one that um has been potent for Republicans\nAre in this state I can think back to you know when John McCain him ended up here and talked about immigration reform and use them as a people leave the room of you know Donald Trump certainly a road that we're very far from the you know we're close to the Canadian border quite far from Mexico a but it is something the Republicans\nAre talking about one thing that surprised me though is that the limited degree to which congressional candidates Republicans have been talking about it if a voter brings it up they will say there's generally supportive of the president and they believe you know we need to have all on the border and and pretty much leave it there I'm\nYou know it's hard to know how much Donald Trump can invasion\nOf running for election and any other mode and the one he's chosen and you know ... we'll see where that ends up as as far as voters go of\nYou know conservative voters will tell you they're concerned about it but you just not foremost in people's minds here\nAlexandra I Wonder what your senses of whether or not immigration is the kind of issue that fires up\nYou know Republicans to kind of mitigate what some people are calling a democratic blue wave whether it fuel fuels democratic support whether it has a little bit of a benefit for both I mean who who gets the most political bang for the buck by focusing on immigration\nI spoke with a couple of Republican strategists working on house and Senate races this week who said that at this point it's more of an advantage for Republicans because Democrats have overstepped in talking about abolish ice and to the extent to which you know President Trump and other Republicans can make that the brand of the ...\nAt a party which we've been hearing that debate in within the sort of twenty twenty field and they believe that they can turn immigration into an advantage for Republicans and and just sort of fire up the Republican base again so at this point it seems like they think that it's a win and what we've seen in many polls that Hispanic voters generally are\nNot as enthusiastic about the midterms and maybe not as excited to turn out for Democrats as Democrats would expect I don't know that there's any concern necessarily for any risk rather for ... for Republicans to start talking about this issue\nThe president tweeted again with regards to immigration yesterday he threatened to use the military in an effort to stem the tide of immigration into the U.S specifically he was referring to a caravan of about two thousand migrants that are headed to the U.S Mexico border pretty much walking to the U.S Mexico border\nCan you tell us a little bit more about that what nations that he threatened why and and whether that is even within the purview of the military\nYeah absolutely so this is a caravan of thousands or this has been done before it's actually been done over the over over the years I base\nComes out of there is um but the country's the most of these are migrants who are involved are come from Honduras\nGuatemala to Guatemala and El Salvador they come to the ... they they make the trip to the United states their purpose is to bring attention to the plight of migrants are but also to come to the United states and to seek um seek relief some some apply for asylum there's no question some will try to get into the country illegally\nOthers will kind of shrink a drop off on the way trying to get opportunities\nUm in Mexico for example is a is a massive issue it as a massive issue or for the president right now he is completely jumped on this issue trying to stir up a motion strip concerned this is obviously a two thousand sixteen issue a as well he ...\nYou know he used a immigration as one of his signature issues if not the signature issue um to take them to office and this caravan\nUh is is being used in that sense of saying look these tweets that he did yesterday blaming Democrats are blaming open borders or to the Democrats that I spoke to they see this is largely a political move\nOn to try to steer 'em responsibility away from his own policies because of some of the policies that you got that was talked about just a minute ago have not been successful and\nCamping down or clamping down on some of the migration take family my ... family separation policy that really blew up in his face I'm trying to\nCut down on the border and the reality is we're seeing a we're back to kind of record number of migration coming to the border\nAlexander before we have to pause to the defense secretary did authorize deploying four thousand National Guard troops along the border I Wonder what we make about whether it was kind of a deployment with the hopes that the governor's refused to deploy these troops I mean ... was behind that\nI mean as Franco now that it's a bit of a political play um it's sort of accept Trump's promise where I'm at least an attempted action but the question is will that do anything will that change anything and Frank mentioned even though the ministry should have implemented stronger immigration policy it's\nThese border crossings are still coming and folks are still attempting to enter the country so at the end of the day it it seems like more of sort of a PR move for a move to a back up the president rather than anything that'll happen in fact\nMore to discuss as we continue the friday news roundup was Alexander Jaffe
