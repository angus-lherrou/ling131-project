{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "The me too movement by Republican women some of whom will see this as weaponized saying a movement which until now has been bipartisan and has not been political\nUm and has failed men of both parties and all philosophies but now it seems to be sort of aimed at a political and very overtly and um I think that there will be some resentment or about that on the part of Republican women\nIn fact in that cue poll I did see a graph um that the Washington Post ran where it did show of all the demographics splits Republican women saw an uptick in support of judge Kavanaugh ... like you're you're trying to jump in here\nYou know with the caller brought in was a really important point and that is we must be intellectually honest when we have these conversations and I think you know we have to realize here is that Republicans have that\nTheir future on two things\nOne is a lack of intellectual honesty and number two is their ... their future on the misguided rage and resentment of white men ... engine and so that is what is at stake here that's what we're seeing play out or we didn't expect to see it play out in the Supreme Court nomination fight\nBut we definitely see play out in you know the policies and certainly in the behavior of this president so I think that you know we really just need to broaden out and really see what the core issues are at hand here I really don't think it's not surprising that we're we're seeing a\nYou know this kind of gender divide I think it's being engineered by the policies in behavior of the sport\nIs speaking the gender divide here's something that I'm Wondering if this is at all helpful\nTo the president and um and the gender gap that he has has today in the rose garden and an extraordinary announcement of the new the new NAFTA and then in the long press conference where he took questions from the press corps\nHe took a question from ABC News White House reporter Cecilia Vega take a listen to how that went\nYeah go ahead [noise] sure [noise]\nShe shocked that I picked her as I said a ... [laughter]\nI'm not thinking that that's okay I Know you're not taking you never do something\nNo go ahead\nThat was pretty extraordinary Brian I'm I mean we know the president talks about the press and very [laughter] I'm disparaging terms but for him to do that to a a female member of the White House press corps just even hearing it yet again\nIt's so it's it's shocking in\nHow I'm I'm at a loss for words\nYeah and I think he also cut off another woman reporter and occurred way when she yesterday my blood is Kevin lied under oath I think that was the question ... of CNN so maybe for the absurd contrast of the day Trump also said that he and Kim Jong on have fallen in love\nHe actually said that that they started off rough but Kim has now it in a beautiful letter to him and they're in love one of the most brutal dictators in the world often seen as running the worst government on the planet\nBut he and Trump are in love according to the Trump and women journalists who ask tough questions or have an even asked a tough question yet as an Sicilia Vegas case\nOr the enemy of the people and they don't take\n... you brought up I'm Caitlin Collins from CNN [noise] um if the the other female journalist who was called on by President Trump and take a listen to death it's very quick\nTo go ahead please can you ... you know what you've ... you've had enough\nNow she said that that was very quick is only about five seconds but Caitlin Caitlin Collins you hear that tail end of her trying to ask the president a question and he keeps talking over her as she tries to ask a ask her questions I mean Janelle\nMade a journalist job is hard but when the president is this respects um women journalists like this and I put it like that because I\nMean he does that two men but in this moment that we're in it just it ... to me speaking personally it hits me it's rather galling\nYeah [noise] I mean this president certainly has a habit of disrespecting both the press and women are in doing so openly and I think we've become a little bit to newer to that if it ... it's not quite enough of a problem\nOr in this in this society but I think that you know [noise] you have your an example of him not being able to contain his ... nature and a\nPress conference you don't get to choose which questions you get asked\nAnd I think you can make that point herself afterwards you don't get to select a you know what ... you know get brought into the conversation\nYou get to answer the question and I think frankly if a President Trump or was not willing to\nBe a part of that he very frankly he should never run for public service and I know that that sounds maybe a little bit of a to Z given the fact that he's the president and there's all these kind of\nA you know benefits of the office re loves but I mean frankly he's a public servant he answers to us in the press is an extension of the public needs to quickly either ... understand that were being made to understand it by the people in other people or once we have a voice here\nAnd when I'm going to give you the last word on this but I also in your in your response I Want you to respond to this or are we flash me am I making too much\nOf of how he treated Cecilia Vegas and Caitlin calling\nWell I understand your reaction and I shared a little bit but I Do have to say that are in the president's defense he is an equal opportunity jackass\nAnd um has gone after men in the most demeaning possible ways that he can think of at the moment he after all he is most famous a controversial comment at the beginning of twenty sixteen was about John McCain and and challenging his heroism\nUm he made fun of Rubio's sweating he said the case it was a slob\nUm he accused a Ted Cruz's father of having been in on the John F. Kennedy assassination it goes on and on so um yeah he's he's grotesque to women 'em up but he is to men as well so that's my defense of the president\nYou know I wanted a in a little bit of time we've got time to play at a here is what Senator Flake and senator Coons have to say about the Kavanaugh nomination\nIf judge Kavanaugh is shown to have lied to the committee [noise] nominations over Oh yes I Would think so\nAnd ... yes or no or answer Brian you agree yes or ... agreed the nominations over if he's found that of life\nI think they could get to a point where they're quibbling over how ...\nIt should be motor\nIt's going to depend on how a senators Collins and Murkowski and flake interpret what alliances\nAnd with that we have to go thank you all for being on America on the line tomorrow it's all about the Mueller investigation we'll see you tomorrow [noise]\nSupport for America on the line is provided by Emerson Collective additional support is ...\nI did by the end he Casey foundation and New York public radio trustee Dr Mary White\nIt's a minute before eight o'clock here in eighty nine point three K PCC coming up at eight one eight with Joshua Johnson at nine o'clock it's the frame with John horn at nine thirty listen for the daily and then at ten o'clock it's fresh air with Terry Gross\n... a lot of listeners tell us the BCC is an oasis of sanity when it comes to election\nCoverage but there are people like you across America who wants to engage constructively about politics and they're doing it modern colon called America on the line in a new show from WNYC it's America on the line Monday through Thursday\nNights at seven here on an eighty nine point three key PCC it's part of the key PCC voter game plan\nThis is eighty nine point three K PCC Pasadena Los Angeles or community service of Pasadena City College or over two hundred programs offered students the ability to dream pro do\nLearn more Pasadena dot edu\nTrue or false government gets nothing done [noise]\nMay be true with the federal government but chances are your state house is highly productive\nFrom W. A. M. U. at NPR in Washington this is one egg [noise]\nHey there I'm Joshua Johnson today on on a we begin our special series the state where at state lawmakers tend to get a lot done including responding to cultural trips\nIn part one of our series we focus on gun laws a hot topic after the mass shooting in Las Vegas and Parkland, Florida some states to bipartisan action on new restrictions fathers expanded access to firearms we'll see where this trend might be headed what gun laws are coming from your state house at how are the affecting\nYou email won a a double A. M. U. dot ... comments on our Facebook page or sweet us at one a [noise]\n\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm chase Stevens President Trump says the FBI should do a comprehensive investigation into the allegation surrounding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as NPR's Mara Liasson reports Trump also says that Senate Republicans should determine the scope of the probe\nA top priority and not contagious what we're seeing across the country plus Parkland is a huge resurgence of activism on this issue and of course state legislatures react in response to what the people want\nAnd so that the grand total from Brady is review for twenty Eighteen state run down as about sixty six gun violence prevention bills that's broadly stated\nHad been signed into law in about twenty six states just since Parkland so I think the impact of those young people\nThe march uh that the focus on this issue that we're seeing going into November's elections and twenty eight ten of course those are federal\nUh cannot possibly be discounted it's very profound\nRichard film and I wonder how you see these trends in the states particularly since a number of states other than say Florida in Vermont kind of stayed\nIn their patterns of either being more ... inclined toward gun restrictions or gun access there were a few states that made some unusual lose but a lot kind of maintain their patterns is that how you see it rich\n... well I think it's a little more complicated and I don't always find myself in agreement with Chris on these issues but there's no question that\nWhen the citizens of this country get involved in an issue the elected officials take notice\nAnd I think it's very healthy whether I agree to disagree with that particular outcome on any particular issue\nIt's very healthy and a good thing for our nation when the citizens take control of their own destiny uh that's what a democracy is all about you know as a lobbyist I always used to say to people who um\nWho don't get involved other than voting thank you very much because by your a lack of involvement in the system you give me far more power than I really should have is a lobbyist um\nI think the issue that we all of us probably agree on in this country surprisingly none of us want guns in the hands of unsupervised juveniles\nDangerous mentally deranged individuals or violent predatory felons\nThe heat isn't passing legislation because we have to do something the key is to pass legislation that actually impacts the problem and keeps the guns out of the hands of those who would Miss USA\nYeah Richard I hear you in terms of the areas of agreement we also heard from a number of you listening about what you support based on your politics we got this call from someone who describe themselves as a strong Second Amendment supporter but also supports background checks for gun owners here's what Terry left in our inbox\nVary from San Diego California we have gun legislation passed in the state almost annually\nAll your further restricts on while body to own it does less and less criminals I Am for background checks on her Second Amendment support or listen to NPR\nFerry thanks for calling I assure you you're not the only one there are quite a few out there but regardless of your views on the second amendment we'd love to hear from you in terms of what's happening in your state Chris Brown one particular kind of law we wanted to touch on is what's come to be known as extreme risk laws or red flag laws eight states\nHave passed red flag laws recently give us a sense of what these laws are and how effective you think that could be\nSure so extreme risk laws are laws that allow law enforcement a family member or in some a specific states a few cases um loved ones too in the community to petition for temporary order\nRemoving access to firearms from at risk individuals\nAnd that these kinds of laws have been in effect in some states for a long time\nNotably in Connecticut um they've had a long experience with these laws and and what they found is that they can have a profound effect and a a removing guns from at risk individuals and then the\nGetting the kind of treatment and help some of these individuals so desperately need but often don't get in order to address the at risk behavior at south now I I Will say in response to to Richard I completely agree with you on the American public\nAh does not want guns in the hands of dangerous or at risk people the frustrating thing is that while eight states have an act that these measures post Parkland and and I think that's a really important point to know\nThe n._r._a. and almost every step\nHas opposed the enactment of these measures and they do it on the spurious arguments that somehow this will deny people due process I Want to note for your viewers that in every instance every state\nHas passed these laws that allow a hearing before a court where the individual who's subject to the order can raise any issue an argument for why should not apply to them and not as across the board that case in every state that has now adopted days I can save lives\nI Do want to talk more about the impact that we are able to Richard let me give you a chance to jumping briefly before we have to pause\nWhen you know everything that we do in life is really all about balance and when we're balancing the risk to the public\nFor someone who's gone off the edge we just have to be careful about what we're not doing is using an excuse or allowing someone to get even with someone else and uh we do a good job\nThis is a fair a risk that we should take and I support in principle the red flags last\nWe'll continue our conversation in a moment with Richard Feldman president of the independent firearms owners association and the author of riches shake confessions of a gun lobbyist Chris Brown the president of the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence and Scott and Greenberger executive

A. M. U. where we produced one aches you can find out more about the project on line\n... and America dot org by the way Scott before we move on from bump stocks remind us how states did with bump stocks which ones banned them which one is allowed the what's the national picture look like\nSo uh as we noted earlier the bump stock that are really people began to hear about that after Las Vegas and uh since then we now have we've seen ten states\nThat have banned bump stocks um it's a fairly easy thing to do I think because uh it's not something\nIt's not going to affect a hunters are most gun owners or however there are a concerns about just how effective this might be and in states that have passed it a lot of questions for example you outlaw bump stocks and you're basically saying if you have when you got to turn it in and\nAnd places that have passed as we've written about this uh people are not turning them in so some question about the effectiveness but\nWell then there's also the slippery slope argument that has come up with bump stocks I mean NPR's MORNING EDITION interviewed Michael Hammond last week he's the legislative counsel for a group called gun owners of America which is basically against all gun control\nThe group is not the in Iran to separate group but it takes similar stances against gun legislation that restricts access to firearms in that interview with MORNING EDITION Michael him and said he worried about what a bump stock ban could lead to\nOur question is whether or not this effort to go the back door and ban semiautomatic or by regulation\nRichard Shelby what are you making Michael's argument\nMine I Know Michael a long time and I think what he's trying to say is that\nBump stocks had nothing to do with a a semi automatic it allows as you correctly identified it earlier in the show the kinetic energy of the firing a gun\nTo allow it to essentially go up against your finger and fire another round but without a bump stock I can do exactly the same thing with my finger\nIt doesn't make a semi automatic an automatic um it's\nJust very wait wait wait wait a minute you can you really do exactly the same thing with your finger I mean having that degree of kinetic energy as opposed to having to rely on your own reaction time your ability of your index finger to go flick slick slick slick slick slick that is not the same\nIt's exactly the same thing I think are inside the trigger guard\nI can um fire that gun just as quickly okay I'm ... and ... and ... you know again this is one of those issues that\nWell let's just ban it I mean if there was a terrorist incident involving a red Ford and we said well let's ban red Ford's it's true that over time that won't be read for us on the street so terrorists couldn't get a read for it and go into people\nThat's a very very sorry Michel red Ford's they're not designed to do mass amounts of damage I think that's kind that's that's an apples and oranges are done and I'm I'm ... I'm Sorry I I presume that you and I are of different generations I don't think that someone who's a twenty two year old a ceiling versus someone who is\nYou know in their fifties or sixties or seventies both on with firearms have equal capacity to flip through index finger at the same rate there or not to say\nIt all depends on your training but there's not much training involved in using your finger inside a trigger God is going back and forth again\nThis is feel good legislation and it really had nothing to do was a reaction if it was used in the gun much than it is the same number of people had been injured but without the use no one would be talking about banning that device there\nAre other kinds of devices that have come up and some of this legislation drew in Pittsburgh tweeted we'd have smartphones which can open with face recognition or fingerprints why can't we apply the same tech to firearms they'll know solution is perfect I Would think it will help curb the issue\nThere are some laws to propose doing things very similar to that we'll talk about that and more in just a moment stimulus [noise]\nThis is a test of the emergency alert system\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\nThis includes this test to the emergency alert system [noise]\nWhen you look at ...
