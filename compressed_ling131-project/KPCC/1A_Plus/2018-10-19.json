{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "And around the world and lied as frequently as Donald Trump [noise] now you mentioned we mentioned was made of the a morality of Trump\nHowever I see it as the failure of the Democrats is due to their abysmal moral leadership and on November the sex and the Democrats have an opportunity do on June the election of Trump the winning strategy for Democrats is to make one and only one promise give us a house\nGive us the Senate and we'll impeach Trump that's the only way to fire up the Democratic base\nReally ... that that isn't the things for the call now that that's of course not when Nancy Pelosi is saying and and um I mean that there'd be a lot of leaders have been been ... have you been avoiding that\nThe case because it's it's risky if I may a Charlie it's a it's a risky thing because you may rile up democratic voters but you may also rile up the Republicans who will cut turnout in response to that through as they see it to that threat\nAnd I have to assume that the fact that Democrats have not decided to make that their message reflect some internal polling or external only there maybe some other point that I'm not aware of\nThat suggest that it would be very mobilizing for the Republican base but I didn't want to mention I didn't want to do something in response to the first call about um [noise]\nI mean Trump not being separated from that GOP there was actually a poll that came out yesterday from morning consult which found that the share of Americans who believe that Trump represents the majority viewpoint of Washington Republicans has grown\nA overtime so so it is they can't not just not one color it was a huge number two is fifty six percent of respondents said that Trump represents the majority viewpoint of watching the Republicans that is Thirteen percentage points higher than a similar poll conducted in April of anything there are the two identities have emerged even more\nOkay let's go to a let's go to calling from Tampa, Florida Monti from Tampa, Florida you're on America on the line\nA little bit evening\nSo your your your costs you was you know the whole news or you're folding or you're older you are ...\nYou don't see a lot more or again from your exactly find have been all my life a registered Republican of reform the bullet life\nYouthful actually this new germs and hundred and twenty twenty on voting Democrats for them 'cause job through the filter is going to lose power he started living\nWell let me let me ask you this let me ask you this Monday did who did you vote for and twenty sixteen for\n... and here's\nWhat did you vote for twenty sixteen money who did you vote for him twenty sixty\nEight twenty six feet I did vote for Trump not because my my reason was it was all the all the best of bad situations and you always slow what's something that's not in the political will to guess\nShortly after that is when I realized that huge mistake fears of more early human being there for the United states of America\nWhat changed your mind Monty what changed your mind\nYou know every every every time he starts walking the dog ... votes the authors of the United states and that happens within a week after\n... when he was locking people before Charlie that's what I that I was ... asking people\nBefore he was sane women the disabled\nMexicans immigrants um [noise] so I find it very ... he was talking about explicitly grabbing women he there among the charges of sexual\nHarassment is so all of that you were okay no no yeah somewhat Monti you were willing to overlook that\nBut what what is it because we went into the I'm trying to I'm just trying to ... very rarely find people who are going to miss they change their minds\nYesterday and and I agree I mean why why would but I Would talk about this all the time you know again like I said it was almost as if it was entertaining up with all the ... find that he was elected and then you you realize when you when you wake up all of this coma my Josh did I ever make a mistake\nAnd multi things I think money thanks for the call I'm American was in a coma I Want to go to Knox Knoxville, Tennessee natural tendency Kim from Knoxville thanks for calling into a miracle on the line you are obviously\nIn one of the key swing states uh this year are you going to be voting you see this election as a referendum for or against Donald Trump\nVoter today and it is definitely a referendum on trial\nEspecially since Marsha Blackburn is basically strapped herself to the president in this race for the Senate and I'm a mom of two moderate I voted on both sides of the aisles I've of the aisle over the years because I Lived and very conservative place but I Am a hall\nThat my children are watching a president because I have in this way and I was raised Catholic Republicans\nAnd so it is just stunning to me that this man as everything that we are ways not to be yet my Republican friends and family voted for this person and so I Am definitely vote and based on the president\nAnd this race and he has taught himself Marsha Blackburn and so I have voted for Bill Braniff\nBase for the call I appreciate Marsha Blackburn has tied herself to to Donald Trump you know it's interesting that you get asked the question every once in a while you know when when when Trump campaigns when he goes into red states or does it help Republicans I mean is is Donald Trump nationalizing this election does it help or hurt Republicans\nAnd I think that the the honest answer is well it depends where you're talking about that you have the the double edged sword you know that every time Donald Trump goes out I think he probably does fire up the Republican base but he also fires up the Democratic base as well Mona\nYes agreed um and uh but but the tolerance for his kind of politics vastly exceeds anything that we imagined in earlier times like\nTwo years ago um and uh [laughter] and we were laughing about that but that's true I mean another oh there are things that are hanging in there who used to think it was like before nine eleven after nine eleven and now it's like pre twenty sixteen after yeah and\nUh and so you know we will see the the um the the Republican Party I cannot disagree has become more and more Trump aside and more and more fine with him as their leader and as a\nAs a spokesman for our country and um [noise] you know I I Am not at all confident that there are large numbers of Republicans who feel as some of our callers to\nThat they can no longer support this president if they once did or that they never did because they're embarrassed by him I think all too many are sent an yeah this is great were winning and this is what it takes and we were jumps before\nAnd now this is this is a success\nYeah that is one of the extraordinary things at least from my point of view is is that you know Donald Trump is who he was he he didn't actually change but a lot of Republicans decided they were going to adapt to him looking for should we have to leave it here we can go on for another hour\nI Want to thank all of our guests

Bo of applied economic research here in New Hampshire before we keep going and introduce our next guests I just want to kind of add a yes any meant what then you'll you just said\nThere is no shame and getting a career that doesn't require a college degree\nNot and we did a show last year called how to earn six figures without a four year degree about how to get into some of the skilled trades that requires some training or an apprenticeship but that don't require a four year bachelor's degree one of our guests are Nicholas when Louis Wyman who was the c._e._o. of the Institute\nI couldn't be happier with my trade and the degree wouldn't have made me have to live in that line work does as a proud of union lineman I encourage young adults to seriously consider working somewhere outside of the cubicle it builds character and strings\nChristine that was a ringing endorsement from ... give me a sense of what kind of training you provide particularly for young people who are getting into the skilled trades you may not be used to hearing many of their friends talk about getting in skilled trades what's the training like\nRight well that that training is very much hands on just as that Dan was describing when he was speaking about welding\nIf you look at New Hampshire and really any state in the country there is a NASA network of career and technical educators all across the country and they're all faced with the same problem which is we've got to get our graduates trained and skill to fill the jobs that are out there and he's hiding in sectors\nSeventy look at New Hampshire set of drill down to our state we have twenty seven centers\nFrom North to south east to west staff by incredible professionals we have you know twenty seven very passionate and committed\nAnd a professional directors reading those centers to get kids trained in manufacturing automotive in construction industries along with others like health care financial services in tech\nAnd those programs take students from tenth grade through twelfth so by the time they're in tenth grade they're already thinking about their career to looking at what kind of pathways they want to explore and our programs guide those students through that process and\nAt the end of the experience working within a CAT environment those students have skills when they graduate and they're ready to work and they're looking for jobs\nOf course I'm Sorry to see the environment as a career in technical education\nIt is clear in technical education which is really um a an acronym for the national community of people who are involved with training career in tech technical education programs\nWhich is a massive community I mean in New Hampshire alone we have four hundred instructors are teachers who are delivering services to our kids every day\n... I was gonna say I think that part of the issue here is that the technology of a lot in involved in a lot of jobs as outstrip the ability of our educational system to keep up with her I recall going through a manufacturing plant the manufactured ball bearings and I looked into a room and there were\nMaybe thirty people sitting at computer screens and I said I didn't realize you needed that margin accounting department and he said no no no most people are running\nThe genes are not again they're not accountants and so I I think that the perception of a lot of blue collar jobs as their ... its grunt work\nAnd in fact it's not grunt work anymore it's really very technical and a sophisticated or work and we need technical and sophisticated people to fill those jobs and I think to some degree there's a mismatch between the perception the training and the needs\nWe got a voice mail from a student here in New Hampshire who was studying to become an automotive technician here is what she left in our inbox\nMy name is maximum I live in Deerfield New Hampshire and I currently attend conquered high school I'm a senior as well as him also enrolled in classes that may chested men to ... my seniors definitely lot different than what most seniors do through I'm not taking just regular general classes that aren't really going to help me\nI'm that's the whole point of view being in ... I'm I'm CC is so that way I can take classes that are needed in order to me to get close to my degree when I finally graduate I plan on staying in New Hampshire I remember going to be leaving but it opportunities have definitely pushed me tour opportunities I have gotten a definitely pushed me toward staying in New Hampshire\nMaxwell thanks for sharing your story with us and best of luck to you for staying here in New Hampshire and going into your chosen field Christine I'm sure that your heart and your messages like that from Maxwell but what does it take to replicate that how do we make more Maxwell\nIt takes a lot of work it it really starts with\nUm middle school would be a good time to reach students to start talking then about the things that they're interested in what they are inclined to do and meet them you know where they're at developmentally and that's happening in a lot of schools across the state and across the country and in New Hampshire we have a number of programs that are looking at how to\nCreate a career exploration pathway for students so that by the time they get to ninth grade they have a much better idea of what the options are in terms of what kinds of\nPathways there are number one increasing the awareness of what the options are but then also having a better sense of what they are drawn to you and what they want to do and we're working on a number of initiatives within our community to Institute or create a framework for pulling students through that kind of a learning experience\nA career exploration learning experience\nI Know we're going to lose in just a moment Christine but I Wonder what your senses in terms of New Hampshire being a place that younger people\nWant to be I mean it seems like a lot of millennials are eager to move to bigger cities the places with a little more urban density New Hampshire is gorgeous but it is very rural and it's not nearly as bustling metropolis the seed Boston\nHow much do you think the challenge here is just\nI hate to be ... about this but New Hampshire being New Hampshire New Hampshire not being a place where young people are clamoring to be before we let you go how much is that just to a built in challenge\nWell I Would argue that it's not really a challenge because really for young people everything is here they have a full lifestyle every this state is designed for young people you can do anything you want outdoors you know whether it's skiing or\nBeing up in the lakes and there are a ton of young people really really into that lifestyle and as far as having cities and um you know communities to\nTo be drawn to it look at places like port sniff conquered Manchester Nash what even in the western part of the\nState there's some great small cities that have great options for young people whether it's you know some kind of social life or other activities that they need to you know to have around them so they can feel connected that's out there I think the challenges into rural sections of the state\nAnd then finding that can activity when you're in you're a little bit further removed you have to find your people\nChristine cars the executive director of the New Hampshire career and technical educators association Christine thanks for talking to us thank you for having me\nSo if you move from your small hometown to the big city for a new
