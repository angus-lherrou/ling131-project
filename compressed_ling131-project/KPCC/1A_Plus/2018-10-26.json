like yourself you're bringing us into this new wonderful um enlightenment\nAngela I you know Brian I think we need to an angel it to the cabinet [laughter] to bear very optimistic sort of echo echoing a James Fallows and uh and and the book the he's written I Want to go to Jay Street in southern pines\nNorth Carolina ... thanks for calling into America on the line\nThank you thank you for taking my call\nI I Am extremely optimistic about how the limits to have decided to run for office says it doesn't matter if it's so they probably couldn't order democratic\nA party but just the fact that they are setting a good example for not just the they're younger children not just their their doctors but also for their sons\nUm and that are so many more opportunities for women to to participate\nIn advance and the government is businesses\nI was amazed I moved from a nun New Hampshire to North Carolina at the years old and I applied for a job and uh I I got that job\nAnd it's a wonderful that you know at my age if I Am able to get the job ... trained and then he listened to the younger younger folks as to how much they are like you said faith\nIn getting interested in what is happening in this day and age\n... thing I Want to thank you very much for calling in brand I think we now however secretary of labor um I'd want to go to song in Brooklyn salt thank you for calling into America on the line\nYeah thank you thank you all um even on conservative I'm optimistic about Saudi Ocasio Cortez wouldn't\nKnow why in the court yeah only because\nI have this opinion it was a permanent us in Congress 'cause I think\nThat for when showed that I'm I'm representing for the people by the people coming back in the style proudly were there for years\nAnd they don't really care about her district because he had gotten already so Washington or whatever\n... basically told if I'm going to care about you and if we go back to that where people and their representatives are caring about them their constituents not necessarily about national policy that support that necessary but about their national policy that will be amazing I Hope that's on step in the right direction for not only hurt for everybody\nWho were yeah look where everything is caring about their local populace\n... let me ask you you a question so how much does what's happening in in Washington and what we've been talking about in terms of\nUm the president's the president's rhetoric and the inaction in gridlock in Washington how much of that or concerns you or are you focused locally on what your state and local officials officials are doing to um\nTo help your help your neighbors help you\nHonestly I think that is about the rhetoric and stuff like that I think we've come to the point where everyone is trying to get there twenty second soundbites and that's not helpful but I personally would rather focus\nBack to what your focus on their local things take care of your local issues and build up for your city them fix your fate than fix what yet good qualified people arriving to the rank them a feeling that national politics said it will become president center and what better qualified people metric reactionary if I\nSaw in Brooklyn thank you very much for calling into America on the line and Helen Peterson Brian Lehrer been an interesting calls we've gotten from people around the country I Would love 'em just for us to end the show talking about getting your reactions to what you heard and Helen I've always start with you\nYou know I really think that it's one of those things where you know there's this old steady about how\nPeople ... perception of how much violence there was in there in the world like in the United states\nIt there was a correlation with how much violence they saw on television on how much violence was depicted in the TV shows they watched and so they just got the sense watching shows is late seventies\nThat oh there's violence on these shows that that means that there's also violence in my world and I think that our media diets you know I'm not going to go back to the the old saw like there needs to be a new more good news in the world but I think that the more you know glued we our ... our phones into these quick\nTake you know like there's just a lot of things that are really suck that are happening and it's hard to have the\nBalance summits that to think about you know not personal like developments in your personal life developments in your community\nAnd your kids' lives you know things that that other ways to paint a more holistic portray it instead of thinking about like oh we're screwed and so I think that there is I've just watched people who are more likely to this stuff\nFeel sadder feel you know like a real depression and you know I think that the fears warranted but at the same time there is as this program has emphasized something to be optimistic about\nHere and Brock Obama at the end of his term used to talk about how we are living in the best time and all of human history to be alive but the major metrics of poverty and life expectancy and things like that and if you take a big step back\nYou can say from a progressive point of view or if you put just a little bit of an optimistic spin on it that we have been moving for the last century so an steadily in the direction of social justice\nAnd it's not a straight line hardly a straight line we're in a period of major backlash right now but look where we were in this country in this world a hundred years ago\nA and it is possible that still the arc of the moral arc of history is long but it does been toward justice if we've been to\nUh I like to tell people uh in in speeches just how wonderful ... this country is and how far we've come in to bring that point home I tell people that you know I Am the son of parents who grew up in the segregated Jim Crow south\nAnd that I and my cousins are the first generation in our family who did not have to pick cotton\nOff so I Will I Will leave that their thank you for listening tonight we'll see you on Monday remember you can tweet us at ...

mark urban the only journalist known to have interviewed scribble he's got a very dry sense of humor that pan and you know tends to make law each of the sort of negative things in life that's just ahead on one egg [noise]\n\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm shave Stevens [noise] New York city police say they've given the FBI more suspicious packages intended for high profile critics of President Trump NPR's Quil Lawrence reports that authorities are now examining tens of parents bombs\nSo there's there are some reason to think that this person either was not a particularly good bomb maker or\nMay have designed a bomb that he in some fashion may not have wanted to go off a you know it's there's obviously you're obviously sending still a very stark message even if he's bombs don't explode\nAnd Dylan I Wonder if we should clarify that none of these bombs none of these devices went off on site they did not go off where they were apparently intended they may well have detonated\nIn bomb squad custody if they chose to detonate them so I I I'm not sure maybe you know wetter than I Do whether these devices work capable of exploding or whether they were incapable of exploding but as far as we know there was no debt nation that injured anyone right\nCorrect and and we've been told that these were a these are viewed as a at least many of these devices reviewed as live explosives or in the package now you can have a live explosive in a pipe that is not a very well made bomb and is unlikely\nTo go off or or maybe even very difficult to go off we don't know enough yet to nowhere on the spectrum that falls\nBut yes and and what they have but what they do have is to to your question about destruction what they do have is they have as best we can tell\nTen unexploded pieces of ordinance which they can now come over for clothes and that's a big deal to do explosives investigators because they often don't have that they often have detonated material which is much harder to look through sometimes\nThey don't tell us more about the targets or at least the people whose names were listed on these devices we've already said that none of them was injured but how did they factor into the investigation\nRight and and the victim allergy what what a behavioral scientists call victim allergy of crime is very important because a lot of investigators will tell you who the victims are\nA show me the victims and I'll and I'll show you the criminal um and so the first bomb a that was discovered was found in the mailbox of George Soros a billionaire who funds a\nLiberal groups and and pro democracy groups around the world I'm a huge target of criticism from from the right wing uh and then very quickly after that we saw\nBomb sent to Hillary Clinton's residents to Iraq Obama's residence 'em to a John Brennan the Obama's former CIA director but that was mailed to him at CNN a and that got a lot of attention yesterday obviously hum when they evacuated that building\nUm and so what you see a sort of a what would emerged from that what path a pattern that emerged was essentially a a bunch of folks who have been a critical of President Trump or\nHave been sharply criticized by President Trump including congresswoman Maxine Waters is another one of the intended recipients we're told and you know that leaves a lot of people to wonder what the political motivations of all this were\nUm and obviously politics seems to be playing a part and the decision making process of this person\nUm but I always think you know criminals don't ... necessarily rationally and we shouldn't try to impose too much reason our logic on what they're doing necessarily so I think we need to know a lot more before we can make any significant judgments as to as to what ... what precise message this person has tried to set\nFor sure and it's also worth noting that John Brennan they sent this package to CNN but John Brennan is not a CNN contributor he's an NBC News contributor has been since I Believe this winter in the interest of full disclosure I'm an NBC News contributor also but CNN has been a frequent target of the of the president and some of his remarks when were you trying to jump back in\n[noise] no I was just going to say so you know the target list suggest this is a person who\nUh is angry at her wants to scare or many of the people on the left that a Trump has criticized the most\nOr people that have criticized Trump the most um and what's interesting too is that you know one of these packages was addressed to former attorney general Eric Holder but we're told that had the wrong address on it and was essentially return to sender\nThat alleged center or at least according to the package being Debbie Wasserman Schultz obviously they don't think she had anything to do with sending a bomb but I I've spoken to investigators who think that because these packages all used\nHer as the return address this person has a particular antipathy toward her and that that Eric Holder package may well have been set deliberately mislabeled in the hopes that it would go to her office and and might hurt someone they're\nDevlin

Khan and his daughter were poisoned with the ... not agent other types developed by Russia this is part of the group of ... ... ...\nAnd low profile or that enabled me to sort of to get a handle on how to find him\nWe are speaking to mark urban whose book this cripple files tells the untold story of Sergei Skripal by the way we know that there are some of you in our audience who heard his mentioned to the Americans and perked up we did a conversation about\nThe reality and fiction of the Americans with two of the program show runners as well as a historian and a curator from the international Spy Museum you'll find that conversation on line at the one eight dot org that's the word the the number one the letter a dot\nOrg why did Sergei Skripal defect from the G argue I mean you mentioned that he had been doing some work for the British\nYes that's right well I mean he ... and I'm just going to be slightly EPA nicotine ... where he he he was on a defect to in the sense that somebody who contacted the\nSaying I Want to come across what can you do for for me he was an agency in place\nSo he was somebody who uh agreed to spy for my six while remaining in the jail you and he was the British spy agency indeed yeah that that the James Bond organization of of of fame and fiction\nSo right so he he had decided that he was willing to trade secrets and I think he he had lost all faith in the people running Russia\nHe won't see a a ... if you'd ever came to that and of course he wants to payment for what he was doing so uh he was cultivated during the cools off or the spring and summer of Ninety Ninety six in Madrid where he was stationed by\nA deep cover and my six officer who was essentially sent that specifically to cultivate him and they had various meetings over the months they got more friendly and then of course eventually walking in the parking betrayed uh the the British do I put the question\nAnd as a guy told me when when we were speaking\nBefore the poisoning that you know I was ready is the way he put it he'd had these um internal dialogue about who is who this person was who he was told them to will see a spy for western agency then of course when the question was off things became much clear up\nHe was ready to to basically enter into this kind of agreement even knowing of course it could be extremely dangerous to him self to do say\nLet's talk a little bit more about the poisoning attack he was attacked with the chemical nerve agent known as no shock Dr Steven ... was among those who are on the front lines of trying to save scruples life when he was brought into the hospitals here as part of what Dr juice set a time\nWhen we first what uh what was that an invasion and we were expecting them not to survive we would try to therapy we would ensure the clinical cat but all the evidence was that they that they would not survive\nI imagine mark you've not had a chance to speak to Mr scruples since he was poisoned but I Wonder what your take is on the use of poison first of all and a poison like another chalk which we said many times on this program is kind of spoke to Russia it's it would be like if I shot someone with a bullet that I had signed my name to\nYes I I mean first the no I haven't spoken to him since the poisoning I'm a I I think ah the the\nAssumption of your question about sending a message I think he's gotten important one um there are obviously ways that this could have been done I mean some people said well why didn't they just woke up to them in the streets and shoots him well\nIt's a user geo you will for so without dramatic cover to do that it would be very tricky from from an operational points of view because obviously someone might give chase a they'd be instant ... that description would be everywhere they needed something that allowed them time to escape\nA now even having said that she didn't necessarily have to go with no Mitchell clearly there are other forms of poison a ... and it was always intended to be absorbed through the skin\nAnd in a formulation actually that would observe quite slowly very viscous formulation so that was the idea in in in in a sort of cold operational sense of what was used but undoubtedly as you implied\nOr with your question it did carry a a distinct signature of something that it's been a developed some effect in the ... lab in southern Russia during the Soviet period\nAnd was quite distinct tube in terms of its chemistry now in the early days off to the incident Russians tried to claim all sorts of people from the checks to the Swedes to the British themselves Ukrainians much made this\nA then they sort of moved away from that law and then they don't tend to use it so much anymore but I think if we look at these\nUm and we compare it for example to the case about ... who was a another form of Russian intelligence officer who was\nWho was killed in London in two thousand ... string a different poison or radioactive isotopes ... to ... and\nThe ... very distinctive and you could say carried a Russian steaks and should they be substances that only a very very small number of people in special the ... trees in Russia might get access to\n'em so old I mean theory you've got the idea is that maybe someone was bribed to\nOrganized criminals to hold us such material\nRight by and large you can you can say I think a lot of people do some of the people I spoke to in the intelligence business say then I it's designed to send a signal that while you tonight at the diplomatic level everybody knows that it's you and the messages sent\nA if you ever consider working for western intelligence agency or not only will we you know try and catch you and put you in jail for a long time but if you get away will trunk come for you\nWill get some more questions with mark urban the author of the new book to ... get some of your questions on the details of this as well Marco put some more of those to
