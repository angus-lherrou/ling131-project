things I didn't know about my dad\nAnd I didn't really that was really it was kind of hard in that way because I I thought maybe there'd be some more greedy details somebody might be able to share shed some light on like what happened you know where did it started going wrong\nAnd there was yeah everybody was just like he was so great he was so fun what a great singer and uh you know there's more to it than that and I think Ron had the most insight into it um\n[noise] but\nAt some point while we were filming it I kind of had a breakdown because\nI started feeling like he was absolutely gone\nBecause more I looked for him the more I just heard the same story over and over again and I felt he was disappearing\nAnd you know all of my memories and you know childhood memories of my dad seem to slip away and what I was left with were these stories of how great my dad lives and that's not even part of the truth you know it's just like this tiny sliver of the truth and\nI guess that was a bit of a turning point for me 'cause I\nHad to find them somewhere else you know and that was the point at which I realized he's actually in the song like all of them as a you know his spirit is experience his wisdom like his sense of humor it's all in the songs and that is definitely where I feel closest to him and what a joy to be able to have that you know\nIt is it took a little while to figure it out ... what I was doing [laughter]\nYou had to I mean we we we don't we didn't get into whatever they want to be had to relive some\nReally horrible life moments to to to make this film mhm yeah I can only imagine you you did it hoping that maybe someone else will be able to take something from it\nYeah ... yeah windmill asked me if I wanted to make this film she just was looking at it from a different angle more of a tough father child\nYou know she has a a father who is a big personality as well and so she could relate to that part of my story\nUm which I was interested in in exploring for sure but what I really wanted to explore with mental health stuff so I definitely signed on to talk about it because because I have to because people need to hear about it I Need to explore what it is you know and\nAnd as a performer I think you know I'm allowed to be a little bit crazy until I get to get to you know fully live through it you know and not everybody gets to talk about it openly so I feel like with my awesome job comes a little bit of responsibility\nThat thanks Burt thanks for coming and talking about is nice to talk to you so I think you're going to go over

employment rates though and you've got to concerns about concerns about economic growth that the Federal Reserve have any other option than to stop looking at raising interest rates\nI don't necessarily think so because in this part of that they like the set of tools that they have higher or like slowly raising interest rates is one of the things that they can do and they have always done in the past um that's one of the things that I'm One of the tools that the the Federal Reserve has and\nYou don't necessarily want the economy to overheat by saying okay well we have very a

support flexible habitats in orbit around the earth and then eventually have to also be able to come down to a surface like the moon and be snapped and more easily\nAssembled on the surface that I have a gravity body as well so the dual purpose\nSo that space hotel we've just envisaged the self assembly space hotel how much time do you think that was you know the older have come here but they're too do you think that that that could be given that we are now see space tourism began\nThis is a great question second saving the research standpoint we're pushing very hard we'd love to see

which we can make money on is space debris\nSway spurious getting really serious we're putting up a huge number of low we owe satellites\nTo do first observing and high speed Internet a large number of them so the space debris is going to get worse because there's a lot of defense satellites that there's several million particles up they're down to the size of a screw in anything bigger\nAnd there's all kinds of scenarios that are getting closer to was that will wipe out the access to this race capability because things will get a raise or don't warrior it turns out that the major problem

noisiest clunky is most you know we get movies about space travel ever made and I mean that in a good way\nThe film adapted from James are Hansen's biography of Neil Armstrong returns us to a time when NASA technology was in its early stages\nWe first meet Armstrong played by Ryan Gosling as a test pilot in Nineteen sixty one flying a small fighter jet over Southern California at an altitude of around a hundred and forty thousand feet\nThe director Damien ... though doesn't give us anything so beautiful as an exterior shot at the plane's going through the sky\nHe locks us inside the cockpit\nThe engine noises deafening the images blurry and disorienting the tense close ups of Armstrong's eyes and the rattling motions of the aircraft remind you of the irrationality of human flight the sheer violence of defying the laws of physics\nYou learn a lot about Armstrong in this scene alone he doesn't say much and he's very very good at his job\nEven back on Tara from the camera has a

outsized ambition the movie captures the flux and upheaval of the sixties when NASA found itself caught between the pressures of the Cold War with its mandate to beat the Russians by any means\nAnd the resistance of a public unhappy with the program which cost millions of taxpayer dollars and several astronauts lives\nAgainst this tumbled chose backdrop ... and his screenwriter just singer set themselves the tricky task of dramatizing the inner life of an American hero known for his lack of flash or pretension\nIn one scene Neal was interviewed by NASA panel and he responds to even a probing personal question in a stoic professional way\nI don't know what space exploration well\nUncovered but I don't think it'll be exploration just for the sake of exploration\nI think it'll be more of the fact that it allows us\nTo see things that\nMaybe we should have seen a long time ago I just haven't been able to until now\n\nSee anyone have anything else yeah you know sorry to hear about your daughter\nI'm Sorry there a question\nWhat I what I mean are you think it will have an effect I think it would be a reasonable to assume that it wouldn't have some effect\nGiven how carefully Armstrong guarded his privacy before and especially after the moon landing there's something a bit invasive about the way first manned keeps returning to parents death linking family tragedy and professional tryouts\nBut for the most part should selling Gosling respect Armstrong's reticence he's unwillingness to speak on this absolutely necessary\nHis home life predictably suffers as it becomes emotionally withdrawn from Janet and their two sons but he develops the balance of warm camaraderie and unspoken rivalry with his fellow pilots played by actors including Jason Clarke Patrick

first man when the disjointed and this of the filmmaking drove me to distraction the leaps forward in time the which he close ups the stubborn refusal to let us get our bearings but after a while

show the flag after it's been planted he just doesn't treat the planting itself as a combination point\nHe takes the moon landing in achievement that might have been played for easy triumph and turns it into one man's solemn personal reckoning with all the sorrows failures sacrifices and convictions that have brought him to this extraordinary moment\nWe may not truly know Neil Armstrong buy movies
