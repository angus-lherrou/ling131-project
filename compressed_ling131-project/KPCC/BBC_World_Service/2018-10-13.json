{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "How did you come across prodigy song of a story of sickle cell anemia\nSo we had to health unit my co host Mary Harris and I\nI'm here at WNYC we went looking trawling for some new stories to tell and we wanted to move away from just looking at one of the stories that just lasted for a few minutes we actually kind of want to do to do these deep dies and tell deep health stories through the lives of of real people and so\nMary found this story about sickle cell anemia and\nHow how it kind of represents a lot of the health disparities in this country and felt like it could be a good springboard\nAnd one of the doctors that she spoke to ... I asked her about prodigy who had recently died he had sickle cell and she knew about the sickle cell piece of it I knew ... music from being a hip hop fan from when his group Bob deepest getting big in the mid nineties and we kind of took it took it from there\nI Am Ira Flatow this is science friday from WNYC Studios [noise] now the ... the the lyrics were pretty stark my handicap took a toll on my sanity pretty strong words\nYeah he acted you yeah yeah I mean he it is\nAs far as I Know the one song that he wrote explicitly about his life with sickle cell anemia even though he was born with it of course and it was something that really really um shaped his life it's it can be an excruciating disease\nI'm it's extremely painful especially for him and uh he grew up having these crises from the time than he was a baby and um and it took to his music a lot but a lot of people didn't necessarily know that he had sickle cell um until he passed away\nThey didn't know that even from his music no one was questioning why did you use those lyrics yeah\nYeah I mean he\nPeople will people knew and they didn't know he didn't talk a whole lot about it if you look at the full sort of canon of his music both as half of the hip hop group of deep and also solo rapper he just didn't talk about as\n... as an African American to this story hit home for you and served as a catalyst for the for the real miss\nIt happened it absolutely did I mean for for me\nIt's it's both about sickle cell specifically and it's also about the reality of health care disparities in this country\nAnd even for someone like prodigy who as a celebrity as the superstar as someone especially in the mid nineties was successful and had access to the best treatment even as a child he had one of the best doctors working in sickle cell he's still went through what he\nWent through were you a little surprised when you know when you you knew that he had sickle cell that he did not even talk about it in his as in in his music as something I'm using my music as a way to inform more people about it\nI mean I I wasn't really surprised I mean knowing music from that era and looking at the image of a group like mob deep\nUm I didn't have a chance to ask you this but I Would guess that that along with that music comes an image of toughness and sort of ... and certainly sickle cell and this idea that he was constantly Iraq with pain was probably not something that he wants to put out there in fact ... Tupac\nIn one of his songs that was basically a distract aimed at all these other rappers included mob deep in in that song Tupac used he sort of weaponized sickle cell and use it as kind of a part of his desk at Marty so prodigy probably was not\nInterested in putting out there that he had this disease that made him or they may have made him appear weak huh and I imagine in in\nIn preparation for your your your story in the real issue must have had to learn a lot of mount circle so absolutely a lot of land is falling to [laughter] and and you learn why this disease is so painful what it does to the body yeah absolutely\nIt I'm so very very basically the way that it works is that if I normally are red blood cells are so shaped like lifesavers and their smooth and they move through our body of fairly smoothly with sickle cell does what Linus Pauling found was that\nIt causes this glitch in the hemoglobin which is part of our red blood cells\nIt's where I areas the oxygen through the but it it causes the the ... the cells to kind of take on a half moon or like a a fingernail clipping shape is how I looked at it they sickle\nAnd they get sticky and tacky and they can clog up the veins and when you exert yourself exercise walking upstairs even it can cause pain all over the body and that was\n... and a lot of people can be carriers of it and not know that they haven't\nExactly you can have the trade and not have full blown sickle cell and you can also have full blown sickle cell and that experience it too\nThat prodigy experienced it yeah I Am from I Want to thank you very much for for taking time to say hey thanks for having me on whether it's a it's a great series Chris Johnson co host of the real news from a WNYC Studios and uh so so great story thanks again\nAnd you can check out or the real much podcast by going to science friday dot com slash the real mess\nAnd we're going to thank all of folks who helped us today want to want to thank BJ Lederman who composed our theme music and also thanks to Dr Michelle ... who provided us with those squirrel monkey calls and a very special thanks to all the great folks here\nAt K.

we're going to avoid catastrophic climate change an expert wants us about the unintended consequences of wind farms\nWind turbines by changing the wins they change the flow of heat him I'll mention at that in turn can have some kind of climate consequence\nAnd that may be legal consequences to research this habit of bloating copyrighted material to one of the major academic networking sites\nThe uses of research gay or uploading scientific papers that normally would have to pay to access a lot of this just for me reflects the atrophy among research is when it comes to copyright policies they simply don't care they just ...\nA big legal you may change those attitudes plus the sweat on your fingerprint a potential clue to drug taking\nThat you can't just be listening to the world service this week without being aware of the massive report or keeping global warming down to one point five degrees just has a degree beyond what we've already reached\nIts report that talks about the compromising the economy about renewable energy electric cars even capturing CEO to from the atmosphere\nOne headline from oil company ... massive read for a station\nThat point the report was into the territory of agriculture the business of feeding the seven billion and rising mouse on our planet itself a major source of greenhouse gases\nSo appropriate a second report appeared in makeshift shortly afterwards headlined options to keeping the food system within environment limits examining not just the climate but ooh the ecological impacts of farming\nLead off the mark or spring when came into the studio and told me the point was to see where sustainability meet food security\nEnvironment in health and really two of the fundamental pillows that determine welfare broadly defined so we started from the point that we have to be able to feed a growing population in the future a healthy diet\nWithout wrecking the environment so therefore we look at both healthy dietary patterns and ways to limit the environmental impact of the food system\nAnd you can break the impact status of five cats of grace I think the principal water which is the greenhouse gasses carbon dioxide was on but as a whole range of aspects that you're looking at\nYeah would we know is that the food system really has tremendous impact on the environment on the range of different issues you named greenhouse gas emissions but it also occupies about forty percent of the earth land surface it extracts Seventy percent of global fresh water resources\nAnd over application of fertilizers have already led to dead zones in oceans where you don't have oxygen anymore and fish died\nSo he goes fertilizers or things like large traits which are manufactured in big factories and then put them to the field\nWe looked at nitrogen and phosphorus application those are the two big chemicals that are also responsible for aquatic pollution Monday run off the field\nBecause that hadn't comes to the second step in your analysis this idea of a pilot treat boundary [noise] they seem to fade as it comes to me\nYeah they're a little bit vague so they are intended to describe a safe operating space for humanity so if we don't see them then we're sort of find where at conditions that we know we can operate with\nAnd the idea is if you're a seat them then you run the risk that something goes havoc such a say so to give you an example for climate change it would be if we pass a certain limit for example one point five degree bombing or two degree warming then we have a higher occurrence of extreme weather events drought flooding and song\nFor phosphorus and nitrogen we might have excessive pollution of water systems with more occurrences of those dead zones and also with the other ones I mean you would interfere with ecosystems be at farmers are to global hedge logical cycle\nAnd your analysis applies to narrow and twenty fifth day it was sort of a simple question oddly already operating beyond the packaging boundaries that sense\nYes we are we know that we have already emitted quite a lot of greenhouse gas emissions so the climate change boundaries really at risk of being crossed and we also know re or in several regions applying to much fertilizers so those two things already into dangerous soon so to say\n... to go back to the security if we're already over ... marks are you looking at some areas by which we couldn't go on feeding a bigger population while reducing this impacts\nYeah absolutely or at least not increasing them right I mean for fertilizer application we need to reduce for a greenhouse gas emissions we need to reduce but there are several things at our disposal booth which we can do that I mean we know that some regions really over fertilized they don't need to fertilize that much to crops will grow with a bit less fertilizer is well\nSame with a bit less water use so a big part of this whole scenario exercise is really\nWhat needs to be done globally and in different regions so if we were to let's say rebalance the application of fertilizers from over ... reaches beyond applying regions then we wouldn't have a net increase but more food available for people\nI mean it sounds hopeful but on the other hand if people are applying to much fertilizer or even now suggests that you're dealing with people who are making very good decisions\nAnd the thing is they don't have good tools at their disposal either so we know if you really properly monitored or how much you apply to fields and if you know how much your crops need then you can really be a balance that much better and some countries mostly in high income countries have those technologies and they don't over fertilized to that degree\nSo it's really a question of how can you make available those best available management practices to a growing number of regions predominantly low income regions\nThat some of the production and the other one which we're also talking about here on the will surveys is about the ... the change of ... I think the important pressure it all of this as the world becomes richer\nYeah exactly we know that once people have more money they usually spend it on so called higher value foods and among those are meat products but also fruits and vegetables but processed foods\nAnd we know that isn't very good for your health nor is it very good for the environment because many animal source foods have a high impact on the environment and just because they're so inefficient converters of feet into calories that we eat\nYourself semester I was expecting you to come in and sort of be do include me and you seem to see a lot of hope it all the fifth another ... to this is as a huge amounts of starvation even ... even with the scene efficient system\nYeah that's right we know though that we could already now feeds the current population much more healthy leave without all that stuff ... so a problem is really inequality in the food system so high income countries consume too much lower income countries consume too little and almost everybody consumes the wrong stuff\nSo if we were there to visit gay realign the food system and really clearly communicate what is a healthy diet then I think we would be in a better place\nThis is the weeks the Y. P. C. C. the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change has come out with this\nTwo reports about one point five degrees of warming for one thing is all these projections or against a changing global climate was presumably if they didn't have you\nSo it is that if you were to implement all those options that we analyzed and hopefully we could avoid dangerous levels of climate change\nWe know if that were not happen then for example we could expect reductions in yields yet other changes in the eyes of people that might make them an healthier\nAnd also it might be harder to really implement some of the other patient measures like building I dance and all that that would be needed to protect yourself from the impact of climate change so if we go on on our trajectory what we projected might be an underestimate actually\nMarkers spring than from the Oxford Martin program on the future of food\nRenewables all the big weapon in the fight against global warming was looking for any source of electrical power that doesn't put fear to into the atmosphere I don't think really far off making a cool to have well generational ready and moving to a third by twenty twenty three according to the latest international Energy Agency research\nHarvard University's David Keith backs solar power and in a pair of widely debated papers last week found full with wind power suggesting that by changing atmospheric behavior wind farms can add to global warming he's at me through his logic\nBut they are legitimate organization in that sense\nWhat else do we decided it's kind of a gray area because I have almost even open access advocates you know people who\nAdvocate for or science being freely available online even they will admit to an extent that was ... legal whereas we said gay as more of a gray area you know some people would advocate for it just because it promotes open science in a way and some people wouldn't be for or against it you know they use it because that\nThis is all happening over the Internet these are all online papers resent sketches online all the technical ways of copyright can be protected\nOh definitely I spoke to someone at the American Chemical Society and they told me just like you chew would ask you in the background music video your clothing whether that's called the right material that's similar solution they want to do the research gates solution they've definitely solutions out there and also the and the American Chemical Society they have\nOffered technical solutions to research gate but what they say that within the last year\nThey haven't responded to that old entertain the idea which I find really surprising to you and it's a bit of a no brainer so called long hikes on this do you think yeah definitely the United states has the biggest user base on research gate whether those who is follow the schools and the previous case which was followed in Berlin where research gates based both\nOf those cases the outcome will be influential I think\nA sense of that is sort of tension between ... to ... that stuff published incredible journals most of which are behind payrolls on the other hand they believe in freely sharing information with all the hold is being subsidized by governments in this seat seems to go to the heart of that tension\nYeah kind of role and you know a lot of this just for me reflects the atrophy among research is\nWhen it comes to copyright policy they simply don't cat and they ... they are the customers will these ... these publishes aren't going to go off to each individual research for sharing that article so as far as the researchers are concerned you know until they told they can't do something they'll do it\nBluntly put those scientists will still be of Rio cools down meet up we've linked to tell me things will is reporting on our Web page at BBC World service dot com\nAnd finally drug testing but not with blood or urine samples with a sweaty fingerprint and what was the leading suspect but on a cool some smart chemistry explained here by its develop a university based ideas David Russell\nDrugs when they're ingested by somebody whether the smoke 'til injected or whatever they're metabolized by buddy\nAnd then they have to be excrete to and they typically are excrete today in urine and so when you hear of drug testing for the Olympics or whatever\nThat detecting it in Europe but we also investigated whether it can be detected in swept specifically the sweat that is present in a fingerprint and we were able to establish that there is all the metabolites all these drug residues that are excrete in sweats and were able to detect bombs\nSo it's just really a question of analyzing whatever's in that sweaty mark executive ... ... that's simple prices is it I mean is presumably wants to be simpler than doing it with your net artifice\nIt's very simple so far up detection method we use to a church that is very similar to a pregnancy test you put your thumb print town just five seconds later you can remove your thumb and there's enough sweat that for us to be able to determine whether you're taking any one of four different types of drugs\nI mean imagine the ... the tiny this is really sensitive chemistry\nVery sensitive indeed we're looking at ... grams of drug\n... billion ... executive and you're able to actually detect and this is actually why be done with people\nYes we what can with a number of different groups ... recently where you work with a chef who coroner to establish that there is sufficient sweat on the fingers of deceased people and the sweat was sufficient so that we could detect whether\nThey had died of an overdose of a particular drug will sort of drugs you talk about we're looking at four different classes of drugs so kind of this group of trucks amphetamines opiates which includes morphine and other pain relieving trucks and cocaine\nIn these instances with Carla says these are people who have died how long have they been dead for a pretty grim question how good would the fingerprints that you were getting from them compared to the people who are alive\nThe whole study that we have done was conducted by three different more trees in the u._k. we wanted it completely anonymous we didn't know how long these people have been to some being that very recently others not so\nAnd it was completely randomized so that we just didn't know how long people have been in the ...\nThe house I said was the test almost I mean the variations or was it was good\nIt was always good remarkably clearly if a person had died and was in the water for a long period of time than the buddy would decompose very much more rapidly than have they been in control conditions in Moultrie\nAnd if you will to do this presumably there is a desire for very simple way of doing these tests with people who've died\nSo at the moment to be able to establish the cause of death a full tux ... investigation has to happen\nThat very expensive four to six hundred pounds per person and this is a very simple way of establishing whether there's intelligence that person has died of an overdose to establish whether that's the case will know\nIt is used as a kind of a screening device where you then say okay we're going to do more detailed analysis old kind of gets to the quantitative information out that this person\nA sort of have so much ... for example so much drugs before they died\nIt is a screen so we're looking to see if there's the presence of the truck is varying the body and then the talks clergy cool roof you can establish the exact concentrations and\nIn that case of false positives or an issue of echoes positives even\nYou always have to worry about false positives false negatives we've established that the accuracy of this is very high so we're comparing results with the ... coup d'etat from blood analyses where over Ninety percent for ruled focus drugs up to Ninety nine percent in some instances\nOne foreign all the fish you looking for stuff which is owned the fingerprint which you think is being sweatshirt but presumably as I Walk around the building I can pick up these cards with contaminants and that may give a full story about how I pay ... a drug metabolizing\nEurope to write for a live person clearly the easiest ways to wash your hands Dr ... Patel and then Fifteen minutes later there's enough sweat on your fingertips to be able to give us a new sample\nThe other thing that we're doing is protecting the metabolites rather than the actual parent molecule so we know that the body has metabolize a truck and then X. creature that\nMakes sense to me David Russell bringing a chemical damaging to fingerprint analysis I'm bringing to an end this edition of SARS some action which was produced by fear the robots\nOr I'm reading piece on our Web page at BBC World service or comb has links to more information on everything in the program and to port costs of our politicians\nBBC World service wearing these series licks that philanthropy in Africa\nSome of the richest people are giving away all of a mobile\nAn additional ... billion dollars\nAnyway\nWe believe that we can make a better life\nAll it gives you jumped off and finding out what types of large scale private do think some people in Africa Africa's\nThey censor paid at BBC will have it don't slash dumps him and treat\nYou are listening to the b._b._c.

I'm\nA which is about a a a mission to the moon which goes or a ride and they end up on Mars which is a little crazy [laughter]\nAn accurate [laughter] you know teaching with that write letters and they they experience things like I'm from asteroids storms and things like that they were thinking about stuff like that\nConquest of the moon Congress the moon about Nineteen fifty five or something like that they they they have air locks in that movie they're really thinking about the way this would actually have to work there and for being aliens or you know but all of them that were there\n... it's been when we get to the sixties when just the space travel itself becomes relevant as you said two thousand one in films like that I'm In in the seventies all become space opera of course you know the star wars and all of the ... knock\nOff the star wars and then and then I suppose in the eighties and nineties we get back to ... serious space travel again red planet a mission to Mars with the palm of film things like that there's still usually some sort of aspect of a horror film or something going on with the technology they're working really hard on getting the technology right by the time you\nGet there there's one when I was a kid I remember that that I like more ruined was the\nMovie about a astronauts who who get a you know travel no way no way to return Nineteen sixty nine so would have been ten years old for for me and uh it was released just after the Apollo eleven\nMoon landing won the Oscar for best visual effects and NASA\nProvided um authentic replicas of equipment and an early sky lab mock up for that film\nRuined from Nineteen sixty nine a dent in Culver City says and not necessarily realistic but his favorite space film a star trek to the wrath of Khan has not great performance by Ricardo months old bon\nUm I think probably his best performance in a whole career of drifting performances but\nThat's that's such a great well let's talk with Theresa who joins us from ... your favorite a space film\nLarry King for didn't plan it\nAltered pigeon yeah Forbidden Planet\nNineteen fifty six Fred Wilcox directed that movie the technology the state for one thing that was a studio film that was not a B movie a of a ... yeah it was very lush looking yeah of course it's just the temperature has The Tempest reconstructive uh and uh it's it's just lovely really love the planet\nYeah so Theresa that that's still a you're faced his favorite space film\nAlright were Forbidden Planet All right thanks so much a bill in the San Gabriel valley says Apollo Thirteen is one of my two favorite movies it satisfies the space program side of me\nUh and I'm Wondering if first man might replace that I also love\nTwo thousand one I I consider bill says Star Wars Star Trek more as popular psi phi swipe put them in a little bit of a a different category I as opposed to movies like the Martian that are uh are are would have more real is the minute NATO what'd you think of the Martian\nI thought it was a wonderful movie the book I highly recommend reading anything having 'cause he goes to excruciating details you can actually make sure that it makes sense so I thought uh the movie was quite accurate I think that technology challenges and the technology solutions that\nUh the lead character came up with were correct I think the premise was a bit flood which was the absolute loss of the communication signal because you always invariably have multiple antennas so that was my one issue and of course we do have an orbiting with several satellites in orbit Mars specifically the Mars Reconnaissance orbiter so I'm pretty sure\nI'm sure they would have been able to see that he was on the surface before that other than that\nThat minor ... it was a wonderful an accurate engineering\nSo interstellar as I recall there was some controversy about the science as depicted in that film ... very very popular movie what what'd you think of it\nWell I absolutely love interstellar and I'll tell you one of my guilty\nPleasure of international plane travel as I always watch interstellar on every flight that I I Do absolutely love it so ... was a part of that movie in terms of providing um you know technical input so I think a lot of it's just really thinking outside of the box and I think part of what makes science fiction so wonderful though is that\nYou can't always think about things in the context of how we do understand physics how we do understand particle physics or quantum mechanics so I think\nThat movie tried to make us think outside the box and perhaps what a bit too far but\nAt the same time it was very entertaining and it was very beautifully done\nYeah a pep he writes red planet with Val Kilmer in ...\nYeah that sounds like something you would have seemed to be written is on my list and again\nI'm a working real hard on the science and the technology that movie and then they have to turn that robot into a monster\nBecause you know you gotta have something else going on in the movie but they're working real hard on that's speculative science the space suits and things like that which I saw the new national designed for space suits and they look a lot like this ... suits and Richland sort of what we were one of those\nUh you know on earth to Mars was ...\nThat movie I haven't seen from Nineteen sixty eight that apparently Robert Altman was directing called count down if you heard of this film you can't sell yeah I was seeing this this variety article that goes back a few years ago but\nUm apparently has a Cold War thriller about two American astronauts\nTrying to beat the Soviets to the moon but Altman was fired by Warner Brothers according to variety because he wouldn't re shoot you had the overlapping dialogue thing and they didn't want that and he refused to ... he was fired by the film but apparently um\nNASA granted a Altman a tremendous access\nFor doing that film so that's fifty years ago this year that film [noise]\nAll right ah any any other she wanted to add to your list\nOh I'm I'm just entering the nobody's calling us anything about the release got for me the U.S.'s which I'm fine with I'm fine [noise]\nUm yeah I mean it is an interesting point like why do we always need to throw a monster and it was based movie why can't they just the awesome enough and and to me that that is frustrating I think based on its own should be great I always read this got made alien movies where it wasn't always the poisonous plant that they would take people over I think

who is just a couple of hundred meters away waiting for him\nAnd ... cents do you get of you know how much trouble to give them want to cause for Saudi Arabia I think that\nTurkey and Saudi have very bad relations right now maybe the lowest in their history they find themselves on the opposite sides of several major regional issues including Iran\nOr Qatar the Muslim Brotherhood and these are the big issues that overlay much of the region um they you know aren't even so much in agreement on Syria anymore once they were in alliance a ... on the Syria issue but right now turkey is working with Russia and Iran in terms of\nCreating a settlement and Saudi I don't even know what it's doing with regard to Syria anymore so I I think that there's big issues there I but on the other hand I don't think that you know rich of type ... wants to create a huge diplomatic crisis with Saudi Arabia or with the Gulf but I think that they're slowly coming to the conclusion\nThat Turks that they don't really control this this is a bigger than they are and\nThat there's several major political constituencies in Turkey there's the Islamists who are the kind of base of a retro type or to one's a justice and Development Party there are the\nNationalist hardline nationalist who are a somewhat align with her to want on certain issues and there is the opposition liberals center left at cetera and\nAll three of those major constituencies want answers the local media is going crazy on this issue is the top story and every single newspaper on every television broadcast\nIf you go to the Saudi constantly where this incident apparently took place um you'll see cameras camped out twenty four hours in front of the consulate and they're all the Turkish stations as well as like CNN and international channels\nAnd we do have this agreement for joint investigation between the ticks and the Saudis me more hope though that that will be transparent\nI think that I Would have very little hope that the investigation itself and its public pronouncements would be transparent but given the nature of both governments and and just the nature of how these things are workout but there's you know the sort of culture of leaks in Turkey and other countries and so you know things you just can't be hidden that much\nIt's just not that easy to hide this kind of stuff especially when there's so much public interest so much demand for answers\nAnd that was ... he generally for the independent newspaper in a stumble\nSo President Trump spoke of severe punishment if it was proved\nThat mystical shrugged jeep was murdered by the Saudis but well full might not take in golden book is the middle east expert at the Washington think tank the center for a new American security who's also a former State Department official under President Obama\nLast the thing nobody really knows what form it might take the reality is you know there has been no real consequences for Saudi Arabia for\nA series of problematic actions over the past few years even just the past couple of years and he got the war in Yemen they launched a blockade and with Qatar was no real plan for what they were going to do afterwards\nThey picked a fight with Canada over Canada just routine commentary on Saturday human rights record and I've also done things like crack down on their own leadership and put\nHundreds of people on to the Ritz Carlton next door to billions of dollars and then with no real consequences so it's just why\nShouldn't have what kind of consequences can you actually bring to bear I think in many ways the most severe consequences come not from the U.S government from the fact that companies and individuals and institutions start to back away from Saudi Arabia\nMight be the most profound count a response and just now honestly I think they are already feeling some consequences in the form of\nInternational embarrassment or that they are probably getting right now and are questioning why did we actually do\nYou say there's been no consequences from the Trump Administration but I mean you could say that about a whole list of us administrations including the one you served under President Obama I mean a whole list of administrations have basically turned a blind eye to Saudi Arabia ...\nNow that's a legitimate ... seat and I think that's absolutely true to the U.S out of the relationship is a long time going based on you know the U.S provide security Saudi Arabia provides oil and that's how we've worked at for a long time I do think the Trump Administration is a little different\nIn the ... the president seemed at such a personal affinity for Saudi Arabia no previous administration no previous president would have gone to Saudi\nArabia and the first country that he went to you know previous administration did criticize human rights violations in the ... it might lead to profound consequences but some laying the Saudis that you can't do it every once and I think the message from\nThe Trump administration's and Jared cushion earned a strong relationship between Mohammed than someone and Jared\nKushner the president's own phone over them in the early visit it's really been you can do\nAnything you can literally do anything so no wonder the Saudis miscalculated here there's a difference between looking the other way and almost actively promoting giving green lights to a problematic be\nBut I mean the arms deals that President Trump claims credit for all I think a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of arms deals I mean many of those deals are actually
