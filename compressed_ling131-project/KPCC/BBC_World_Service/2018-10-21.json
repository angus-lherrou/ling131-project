for that money\nAnd you know land in any of the big sort of scientists who can't get as many without really thinking why we ... we would want that means in London they actually sort of they think lowering the standards that require\nAnd which of the many people who have been to question the time\nAnd what struck has struck me I'm In the policy mountains is how willing people ... to ... and the hunting down some of the big reform and a great reforming and everything's going to change without looking at the evidence not on the we have to have to tell the people on top of my town and\nYou write briefly and never say much willingness to believe that story they didn't actually seem to have any ... any any reality to last Denny\nWhat worries me here is that you know at a time when we're told leaders and more accessible more and um they seemed justice on willing to tolerate dissent you know if indeed mammoth and sell them a commission this killing then it goes hand in hand with the accusations that vitamin who was responsible for the knocking off as as a form of spies around the world\nAllegations that pogo drama has gone and kill people outside of Rwandan a form of dissidents\nAnd so there's something here about how I'm deeply into ... to dissent adjusted\nThe time and we need open constructed debates\nI mentioned the business side to this uh and we have a guest in the studio to to look at this in more detail got a new survey is here the founder of cornerstone global associates\nThat is a London based political and economic risk consultancy covering the Gulf

we've seen significant figures\nPulling out of that I'm welcome to the people who have pulled out while the impact is that likely to have do you think is important\nThings in context in that individuals have pulled out but not a company has a lot have spoken to many organizations of who have confirmed that the participating perhaps ... will German level but\nThere's more junior level um in fact I spoke to someone who was participating last weekend and he was trying to get to him and he said it's it's an ... over books with a number of applications they've received a forest and these are so it's very important thing to make a distinction that people are not participating for the optics for the media\nBut in reality they're still going and they're still looking to do business deals which is very revealing\nIsn't there because that might satisfy the media's requirement for something to be done or it might require might satisfy the share holders equal recall him up for something to be done but it doesn't stop the business going on\nAbsolutely absolutely I mean all receive still unraveling and we need to see what what would happen but I very much doubt that there will be a long term repercussions that would stop business uh between a Saudi Arabia and the west and it's important to make the distinction between west\nAnd the rest of the world because no one from China or Russia\nI'm off putting out there in fact looking and waiting for this for the west to vacate the scene with Saudi Arabia which they would feel very very quickly\nYeah study I look at it as it happens I've I've been invited to this public investment for them and I I was never going to go and I don't think I'm an important enough figure I'm for it to matter but you know what clearing the imitation is it doesn't take very long for for the you know the public investment fund to boast about a hundred and Ninety billion dollars of assets on their management\nThat they have an presumably that's the game in money talks and with so many people many countries desperate for an investment the Saudis have surplus money\nAbsolutely one of these investments and you look at the trade between for example of Britain and Saudi this ... billion or ... pounds of of of five billion dollars worth of annual trade ... at\nThe trade balances much in favor of the u._k. so that translates into about a hundred thousand jobs in the u._k. as a result of trade with Saudi or we propose to give this up the price residents\nWell one of the things they love\nBritain leaving me is that we\nAnd our I'm willing to skate lies or other things that we have our without the I mean at somebody like that to somebody in midlife crisis leaving leaving that reliable and partner and gathering and finding that as a lays out there\nAre more dangerous friends and I think I'm willing to ... come on tonight with safety ... tales of leaving the biggest market in the wild\nAbsolutely I mean the ultimate question is how much does Britain or any other country want to be the policemen of the world is this a role in or is that is that the global responsibility and when we say global that includes Russia and China who work on the church is different set of values that we in the west\nOperate on what though if more images I mean clearly there is talk of more evidence emerging from turkey if some reports a right to some of that evidence could be extremely gruesome would that change things\nWill murder Israel was gruesome regardless of how he takes face um and I think ah the Turks have been politicizing the way they've been dropping dripping information and then saying don't don't take this into account that's authorized leaks so simple to to look\nAt a at the whole thing in context social she was murdered and he was a as a Saudi Arabia has said was murdered by at least senior officials and on and I think we just have to wait for the results of the investigation by the Saudis and how's the world would react to it\nIt might be that you're trying to actively district yourself where you might think about what you may be rewarded yourself at the end of the event it could be that you're choosing what

infrastructure projects but ... says ... who is senior develop a manager for Africa ... society\nIt's on the ground when they say intimate exchange point but it's actually just a normal traditional layer to switch the speech that you'll probably find any office or a data center is pretty much what he tastes\nBut building one in a lot more about social engineering than the technical side of it because\nWhat you're doing is bringing operate as who are inherently competitive as the market and asking them hey into on it can exchange traffic among just tells for the benefits of you your network on your customers you both lean\nAnd making them see that Russia now take some time and then once they actually do understand it they become a chunk of it\nAll right so we're not talking about digging up lots of streets and laying in ... you know they say the technique fix as simple as is often the way the technical but as the relatively easy but it's bringing people together and that's what's going on with the Internet so I'd say one of your partners for instance if Facebook say who's getting invoked joins ...\nBecause a lot of ... a lot of\nA capacity building a part of the reason why these exchange of not being established is because um most of the network or protests and the stakeholders are the community involved in providing networks ... access services are not aware of the other thing we're going to do with this project is also help\nThose that are already existing\nTo be able to grow and kill to be able to meet the increasing demand we've seen\nSome of the ones that have come into operation in the last\nTwenty four month that his six month how ... significant growth in the amount of traffic and so they need new equipment because what they started with was basic as he's needed\nAnd then the growth has been a lot more uh exponential than anticipated at the beginning and so they need the equipment new technologies to help them a support the growing demands\nAnd Facebook has all kinds of initiatives to increase Internet access in\nDeveloping countries in some of the poorer parts of the world including is while the controversial free basic site there where you know you were given free broadband access but in return Facebook has a lot of control over what services people are able to access\nI just wondered if Facebook the right partner for approach it like this\n... um yes I'm double see that looking at the whole picture that you know the Internet is for everyone and they they objective here I used to actually weaving tending to exchange points to in fact ah the quality of access and local stocks is\nBasically a beta experience for and he uses so all of our mission and out of Facebook is quite aligned with respect to try to bring access to everyone and so am I thinking in this particular case we are very much aligned\nAnd what about then and finally or how many uh BBC World service listeners across Africa especially in rural areas he doesn't have Greitens now access but what does this really means that ... how soon might it make a difference if a tool\nSoon enough if you look at how the Internet is designed ate and ate exchange points that sort of like and I would say a facility that helps make that intimate tickle system grow so uh you know it's sort of like that and we sing ingredient that makes everything went well so when you have any tenet exchange ... means that\nYou can attract a continent savvy provided us you can I ... a creation of local content\nYou can attract many Saudis access provided us to come and connect because it was the cost of them having access to content that teams as warm and\nWithin a very short time at the market itself grows and that means that Saturday's provide as well previously paying a lot of money\nTo kind of a local content too expensive international leans cannot offload the local traffic onto these uh exchange points and the savings that they a crew from these offload evolve local traffic or from the international expense evenings\nGoes into building that last mile a which basically helps bring access to people who are far from the urban centers\nSo that summit shaky more on gay and it's interesting that build something that he isn't cooling fed digging up the street from some huge infrastructure projects that I see on a ... logical basis these acts pays these exchange points that's a pretty straightforward bits of ... by the sound of it I\nMean that they're they're they're sophisticated themselves but you know what you're actually doing is just changing the connections ... network so they don't have to use the the long distance yeah for the base and international networks that that do have ads lack a do cost a lot of money\nAnd and it's it is a really important that they should have I think it was interesting that you mentioned Facebook's pretty basic stay because which is such a different thing that they do a good thing holders to be supported that it takes us back to the days of the ... when the Internet started it was about rich in connection of networks that made the whole thing possible\nAnd having moved over the last twenty

looking in the studio to see what you do every day Monday through friday and you know in some ways what we're experiencing here is sort of the spirit\nIn nature of KBC see in person it's an opportunity to interact with people\nFace to face in a range of types of programs and activities in our Crawford family forum right here in Pasadena waving to some people behind you Larry\n... and around Southern California it's a big part of what we do and really really the spirit of KBC C. dot dot dot in person\nWell so exciting or the crowds of people have just been comic and coming and coming over the course\nOf this hour John a share with us about how the in person programs have been grow going because from a you know a number of regularly scheduled events here on the Crawford family forum\nThis has really expanded to go all over Southern California in fact we've even done some advance a collaborating with other stations where you've joined me going up to\nThe Sacramento San Francisco San Diego we've we've traveled are relatively far and wide absolutely\nAre a couple of years ago we officially rebranded decay BCC in person which was you know the the result of some some brilliant [laughter] marketing and re branding a certain sort of thought process and brainstorming but it began that most of our our program and our live programming or event programming which is on the content side of capers you see\nThe vast majority of what we did was in the Crawford family forum and as a radio station with a with a with a broader reach with the opportunity in Southern California and one of the most diverse cities in the world\nWe realized pretty quickly we needed to get out of the studio we needed to go to to places in communities where people are inconvenient about the topics and the issues that matter most to them\nAnd then also bring in a range of programming that is a little bit more key PCC adjacent bringing in shows that you hear on KBC see like snap judgment wait wait don't tell me and others\nFor live shows were were not only just informing people but we're also trying to create an opportunity to delight and entertain\nOne and I think of an heard LA is something really entirely different because that is taking the Cape you see see in person experience\nA into places where um you might have whole new communities who wouldn't necessarily be a as where a key PCC a whore telling their stories back and and giving us an opportunity to to highlight those communities and that's a very exciting project it it's\nBeen incredible we just finished our second season of unheard of LA and like you said we go into places that we've either never convened or rarely convened\nWere meeting people that may not be familiar with the PC see but the sort of common denominator is we share this place Southern California's a place that we live\nAnd unheard of layers community driven story telling these are people that are sharing a personal narrative related to them they're themselves and their communities um and and you know a lot of these people have never been on stage before Larry there are some people that are performers there's some people that are are polish storytellers\nThere's a lot of people here never been on stage before never done any kind of public speaking\nAnd hear it in a a region is asked to Southern California have an opportunity to tell a very personal story or before people who might be their neighbors and not know they'd have such a story to share\nJohn thanks so much as always will be doing a next uh
