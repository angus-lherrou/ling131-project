investigation\nWe're not talking tens of millions we're talking hundreds of millions if not more than ... yeah I mean what's oh this is my boss of President Trump's\nLawyer says the claims of vote but is the real story that no one seems\nTo cat there is a sense that everything is through the financial world is corrupt anyway and you don't need to trust traditional means you've got to do things that little here in business daily from the BBC [noise]\nEarlier this month the New York times published a fourteen thousand would expose a on the apparently opaque financial dealings with President Donald Trump and his family\nThe allegations of serious the paper said the president and his family had in all likelihood shoot changed the government of hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid taxes in some cases via outright fraud\nIn a moment we'll speak to the reporter who spent Eighteen months researching the story a story President Trump's lawyer school both and defamatory\nBut first in another age an investigation like this had the power to bring down a politician even a whole government on Twitter President Trump himself that he gave it to the tension that was just a single tweet in which he called it quote boring but what about American voters\nHis view from a town in a state that voted overwhelmingly for President Trump San Antonio in Texas\nThe New York times is regularly putting out I think incorrect information so my first inclination is to just not believe anything I say\nAnd do you think that's like an opinion that a lot of friends neighbors amateur yes I didn't know what if the allegations turn up\nThen I Would want to look into it and I'd reconsider and you know maybe changed my mind but so far the New York times has been zero for zero\nI already had a very low opinion of Trump and\nStill have a low opinion of Trump and the article I feel like he he is just like he can do\nWhatever he wants and articles don't matter it wouldn't change my opinion if someone's on the fence about Trump at this point I'm not sure that this investigation and change and I mean there's probably enough information out there for you to make up your mind one way or the other\nSo nah nope all that does then Craig is one of the New York times journalist who spent the last year and a half of their lives delving into the details of President Trump and his family's tax if as to how much would she put into it\n[noise] when was it now was march of two thousand and Seventeen for Eighteen months ago and Rachel Maddow who has a talk show and the United states she had three pages of Donald Trump's two thousand and five tax returns\nAnd what was striking to us was that he had actually made a hundred and thirty five million dollars in two thousand five and we were just shocked and so the next morning started this odyssey of digging into his finances\nThat ended up with the story that we ran\nAnd it's an incredibly detailed story fourteen thousand would article was it difficult to take that deep I mean how was it hard to get rid of the few to get the documents you needed\nIt was like having a million puzzle pieces thrown into the middle of the times square and are being asked to put them back together we started out trying to figure out that really simple question and it led us to Fred Trump Donald Trump's father who died in Nineteen Ninety nine\nAnd four or five years later the Trump children's sold Fred Trump's empire and it was a massive sale that went through very quietly to another real estate developer in New York and not let us to just think wow like Fred Trump and a lot more money than we'd been thinking it through public documents\nWe were able to piece together how Fred Trump\nStarting when Donald Trump was just three started establishing trust for his children so he made them his landlords he sort of putting land and to trust the Donald Trump bone and then he would be paying Donald and his siblings rent and then we started making calls and we were just incredibly fortunate where we had sources who gave us access to\n... and thousands of pages of confidential financial data including two hundred separate tax returns\nAnd the results you know who that you've written is really forensic is there a reason why you went into that amount of detail\nWe felt given the allegation that we're accusing sitting president of tax fraud that we owed it to our readers to document that as well as we could\nGo out and she said that the accusation is so serious you have to be forensic in what you're saying\nYeah the New York times to accuse the sitting president of multiple cases of tax fraud has never happened and it's incredibly serious what all the legal consequences you think now for the president\nI Know that the city in the state or looking at now various taxes that could build both on a city and state level\nSome of it for criminal liability has passed the statute of limitations but there could still be civil fines coming the Internal Revenue service could also open it you have to remember now that the person ultimately in charge of the IRS as Donald Trump\nDot and I'm sure as a challenge there should be a right and wrong and all of this and if they did something wrong I Hope somebody who's able to show it in a way that results at least ... taxes being paid on the money that they do\nDo you think that Iraq school will change anyone's opinion about Trump in terms of his support base\nI don't know I mean I [noise] I sort of try not to write into a political ends or think that way I think what it does is it sets the record straight the Donald Trump got a lot more from his father than you knew you said so many times you know what I'm self made billionaire and my father mainly gave me moral support\nThat line was repeated so often that it has just been repeated as fact but we were able to pin down that it was it\nFour hundred and Thirteen million dollars was transferred\nBut at the New York times you quote used to say that because the White House is so antagonistic when it comes to the New York times the default response to be well they hate the president that will they will run this kind of stuff yeah I don't want to be\nPlayers wouldn't say that it's not political because we're we're writing into a political world but it's just not what we do Washington is going to say what they're going to say and and that's their job so I just sort of try to figure out on our and how we can best ... stories to publication that we're proud of them that are right\nNow\nIs on Craig narrowed the New York times for some the absence of a political fall out to the New York times story underlines just how much the will to find that the media and politics have changed in the past decade\nJohn Otis has just started a new job as senior editor at the financial news says Bloomberg in New York before that he spent twenty nine years writing about finance and markets for the Financial Times newspaper he\nWrote a swan song optical for the F T as he left ruining the loss of trust in traditional media immune response to the New York times story he argues is a sign of a mood deep rooted Monday's\nBasically since the rates crisis you've seen trust in the media in the most important institutions that go up the coloring you've seen trust collapse\nTheir various reasons flats plainly the single most important one is the sense that the crisis was Bruce on us by the political and financial establishment and that the way in which was resolved\nWas unfair many people were left behind in those responsible was\nPunished as quickly so you have that's\nBasic sense that everybody's in it for themselves anyway a sort of numbing belief that nobody\nIs behaving well anyway\nAnd then very specifically and perhaps why this particular story consenting Donald Trump has had a little impact as it has there is a loss of trust in Egypt and unprepared and this to believe actual empirical\nFact a loss of that's possibly does come from the rise of social means yet but there is\nA sense now that there is no particular reason to believe the established means zero ... shows that in some ways it's almost paternalistic to think that somebody like the New York times during the huge investigation is more to be trusted than anybody else that's I think he's a big sperm\nSubsequent installments will be doled out weekly as they are on broadcast TV\nAnd unlike the past two drama series on which Weiner worked his own Mad Men and David chases the Sopranos this new series does not tell a continuing story it's an eight episode anthology drama\nBut we're such modern anthologies as ethics is Fargo and HBO as True Detective telling news story with a new cast every season the Romanoff is an anthology series in the purest sense\nLike the twilight zone or Alfred Hitchcock presents are such live golden age drama anthologies us play house Ninety in Studio one each episode of

writer or co writer and as director of every episode or set in the modern day but in various locations around the world\nI've previewed only the first two episodes which isn't enough to deliver a final verdict on the series is a whole but some judgements certainly can be made both of the opening movie length installments are sharply written compelling we performed and confidently directed they're beautifully photographed\nAnd just like anthology shows on to do they go in unexpected directions because none of these characters are actors have to show up for the next episode\nAnd there are some episodes specific quirks as well the opening installment the violet our is set in Paris and features a surprising amount of dialogue and French with English subtitles\nAnd the second episode the royal we managed to turn into some weird sort of mixture of twelve angry men and the love boat and improbably features more cigarette smoking than Mad Men ever did\nThe Romanoff announces his intention to shake things up and go its own way immediately by starting with a polite instrumental opening scene that shift suddenly into the defiant lyrics of Tom Petty's refugee\nThe first story

know what were the the ... channels going back and forth what were the give up from the American government I think that the Turkish government was finally to be relieved of getting rid of past ... months and\nAnd if the Turkish government is saying it shows you the independence of the judiciary in Turkey then we'll find well we'll take that home and it will take it to the bank\nNow the pastor Brunson is on his way home so we're very excited and we're thankful to God\nWell if this wasn't a political decision that certainly will have political repercussions won't sit Reverend done and what do you think of the fact that this is an enormous boost to President Trump in the run up to the midterm elections he will say this is this is his achievement\nYou know whoever wants to take credit for it I think frankly as the economist periodical wrote last month that a pastor Brunson had become the world's most expensive prisoner turkey had the pressure\nOf their we're we're going down of the terrorists that the U.S government placed upon Turkish goods coming into the U.S I think there was an enormous amount of\nPressure and there was an enormous amount of chest bumping you know this is what happens when you have to bombastic world leaders who are proud and pride full and that would be President Trump and president everyone\nAnd it was like a this big fight and who's gonna win\nAnd I think it was to the Turkish government credit\nAnd air to one the Turkish government Trump whoever takes credit for Paul words as grateful he's out and he's home and this is another one in the ... column for religious freedom\nAnd human rights around the world there are many others that are still being in prison not just of the Christian faith but of every faith and so that's what I'm focused

live deal and the cleric who lives in the U.S and who the authorities in Tokyo accused of being behind the failed coup in Turkey now you supported that cool his extradition earlier this year didn't you is that not I don't think for the U.S justice system alone to decide\nPresident era once said you give us a school in we'll give you Brunson so I think\nIs it is in the interest of our relationship the U.S relationship with turkey that we extradite grueling so as I was talking to us diplomats today they said that the grueling extradition because we had that treating with turkey\nThe goal in extradition has been the most examined extradition in the history of the United states that's quite a statement to make but right now the judges who were overseeing that extradition hearing\nThey find no reason why for to law school in this a mom in northern Pennsylvania should be extradited to turkey I think it'd be a great idea it should have happened\nI Hope it happen soon so we were able to receive now pastor Andrew Brunson that I Hope some day for tool a goal and we'll go back to turkey and meet justice back there\nThat was passed a William and dabbling who's from New

mind of the coup attempt\nOf July twenty sixteen I asked the BBC's mount blow in it he thought Mr ... states is in the United states could be in jeopardy after this no I\nDon't I think that he's too big a fish to trade from the U.S in this way and to trade him anyway would be an impeachable offense for an American president and his case is going through the courts because the U.S does have a much more of an independent judiciary than techie secondly according to the rankings by Mona says cetera\nSo President Trump constant people a veteran like you'd have extradition and the way that present that one can probably over to the release of an American pass to ...

referring to the disappearance of the veterans Saudi journalist your mouth I shall gee that's a serious very serious Saturday I'm waiting for the truth a complete clarity to be established France would like everything to be done urgently so that we know the whole truth about this affair\nThe initial elements are extremely worrying and deeply serious\n[noise] but even as the Turkish authorities claim they have proof that he was mud inside the Saudi consulates in Istanbul western warnings have serious consequences remain justice\nAnd businesses still being done mostly as usual with the Gulf
