does he know about the economy\nWhich I wasn't I used to actually sort of bragged that he doesn't understand too much about the economy and that's almost seen as a strength of the fact that he's delegating all his powers\nAnd what lessons to Brazil's new leaders learn from an economic experiments in Chile people are\nReally suffering we have people living in poverty we doubt houses without shoes on these was because all the national industry went to bankruptcy\nAbout today's business daily from the BBC [noise]\n\n\nTook office in Sao paolo celebrating the election of giant for an hour a Brazil's next president's\nThe far right candidate had been seen as a fringe player in Brazilian politics he's been accused of having a ... tendencies criticized for his comments on homosexuality women and his praise of military dictatorships but despite that he wants to be part of the sense of devotes his won't support you're on the streets of Sao paolo area how\nCountry is going to move forward because of my cat my president not homophobic here the man of God he's a man of character he has not corrupt he will fight for oil Brazilian\n... surprising is that supports both scenarios gained from the business community and on the financial markets surprising because he freely admits he doesn't really know much about the economy\nSo I Want to know more about how the parent maverick could gain the support of businesses so I spoke to the BBC South America business correspondent Daniel got us\nShe is definitely the candidate of the business community at this stage um\nBoth some NATO every time she had good polling numbers in this election football the stock exchange was sorry and going up and we had a pretty good run this month with the stock exchange basically investors pricing in that he will win\nIn the past the business community used to be tied to a center right candidates but they performed really badly in this election this is an election for an\nAn outsider to politics even those edible so that has been in Congress for a long time he's always been a back venture and he presents himself as an outsider to the mainstream politics\nOr you have to understand about president economics and markets is generally what they're really concerned is about stopping left wing parties specially the workers parties hard for someone who's not in ... which is sort of understand just how much\nA most businesses big businesses in big financial plays they hate the workers parties and their policies of intervention in states so basically they wouldn't brace at any one who stands against that\nEven somebody who's such an outside of it because you know markets that have lots of businesses really like stability and predictability so as an outsider who's been such a fringe parts of a Brazilian politics in the past he was still seen as a preferable alternative to um his left ear finance\nThe thing is that the sort of center right politicians couldn't get enough votes so the business community to have to make a choice of you know who has the best chance of winning and the tribal for NATO was definitely the person [noise]\nSo what she did it to get the business community on board he named a powerful figure for his economic team that spousal gadgets\nThe bank or from the business community himself a liberal economist and someone who's permits to carry on with very pro business reforms\nPuzzle gauges became a very powerful figure in this campaign he's almost seen as a sort of a prime minister to hide both not of being a president in the sense that you get all the power that he needs\nTo get the economic reforms approved and Congress and move forward with this very liberal agenda of privatizing state to companies can no promoting budget cuts and that's something the business community was really happy about\nThat's a good job that he's got someone who's a an experience to call them if there isn't it because it or in an interview earlier this month with a global a newspaper Brazil you said\n... I Know nothing about the economy\nExactly had well so now I used to actually sort of bragged that she doesn't understand too much about the economy and that's almost seen as a strength of the fact that he's delegating all his powers to ...\nBut a lot of people in the markets are also concerned you know what happens if they have a fight to ... you know if they break up from from the spin this has been described a lot as a sort of a marriage of two people so what happens if they break up\nOr what happens if other people inside it both in his cabinet or get a stand against ... no one can really predict what will happen because ... pretty unpredictable a lot like Donald Trump which is sort of person that he's been a mirroring himself and the during this campaign\nSo it's a real concern then that's the business community or or people in Brazil in general are voted in a ... an hour because they think they'll get parlor judges to run the economy but they might end up with general scenario but ... says\nYes that is one concern and that's one thing that China will so now has been stressing all along that he will not divorced from ... in that that they will remain married until the end of the term\nBut also now's views about a lot of things are very different from what all the gadgets stands for ... in the past ... pretty much a supported interventionist policies or he was always in favor of you know state controlled company Petra breath\nAnd now she is sort of changing his speech at least to fit this idea of you know minimal state and then ... companies\nSo it's hard to tell what happens next to ... old views stand or will his new self and the person of balls of gadgets are actually be the one that that goes forward\nBoth ... a very divisive figure some people even say quite dangerous to democracy he's seen as north over Terry and figure he said some things are quite offensive to a lot of people have arts um homosexuals and women and his approach to fight in crime is not something that the business community is so desperate to sea\nChange in the way the country's run from an economic\nOverlook well they say the bull so now is just as bad as the workers' party when we're talking about democracy or even a a not as bad as the workers' party [noise]\nUm there's a deep hatred within the business community especially financial markets against the workers' party which they say support regimes like Nicolas not due to him in as well so they really turned a blind eye to all the things that will ... says about you know are\nTackling Congress Supreme Court and all the risks that he brings to democracy they changed the game a bit around and they say well look the other guys that are just as bad as most a lot of\nThe BBC's Daniel guy last in Sao paolo\nBrazil the president doesn't know much about the economy don't worry his right hand man the Paolo judges does at least that seems to be the hope for businesses and the financial markets he's an avid proponents of free markets and privatized patients get the government science of running the economy and let the markets work it out\nBut will the approach fix Brazil's economic problems\nBrazil recently emerged from the worst recession in its history and it faces rising government debt Gabrielle ... is a Brazilian economist and associate professor in development economics at Oxford University here in the u._k. we have a very\nDelicate and difficult situation I have to first perhaps and foremost is the fiscal situation which is very worrisome I Will have a extremely large deficits and a growing public that we need to urgently shape public spending for the TV job's labor has stagnated so the challenges are had a considerable\nWhat do you think is the thing that the people who voted for a Wilson are what you think that they will wants him to do first in terms of the economy in terms of business\nTo me honestly it's unclear what the demand is in terms of economic policies I think they're voting for him for a kind of like a sense of security and to tackle directly corruption\nI don't think people understand what the stakes are and what the necessary measures are to attack or economic challenges I think they believed that actually he will be able to cut taxes which has been a into that but I don't think that's possible at all given that we have to tackle our current us\nI think they also expects major privatization and reducing the scope for example for corruption in state owned enterprises\nYou show you Fifteen reasons why the Holocaust didn't happen and then people just sort of buy into it\n[noise] um after Charlottesville a in a march had a lot of you know white nationalists neo Nazis white supremacists or whatever you want to call them and I'm sure it was like a mix of um racist and anti Semitic people\nWho are represented there I'm the president blamed both sides for being violent um and how does that resonate with white nationalist\nI think it was um a clarion moment a and over the last year\nCharlottesville has proved to be a very bad moment for them and everything was bad about it it was bad PR because it was gross because normal people wouldn't want to be involved in a disgusting brawl in the streets or the sea swastika flags or\nTo uh see the sort of a just a bad scene everything was bad about it in terms of PR except for the fact that the president of the United states tried to salvage what they were saying they showed up to say the\nConfederate memorials or American history and they represent white history ended up taking them down as an attack on white people and that's what they wanted to say and it all got lost in the chaos and the violence and the disorganization and the only thing that redeemed it was the fact that the president was on their side or at least seem that way\nThere are black as a former leader of the white nationalist movement who has renounced those views ... who is the author of a book

Post reporter ... who was also the author of the book rising out of hatred it's about white nationalism and one of its former young leaders\n[noise] anti Semitic crimes are on the rise the Anti Defamation league's annual report said that the number of reported anti Semitic incidents in the U.S surge fifty seven percent and twenty Seventeen that's the highest percentage since they started tracking anti Semitic crimes in Nineteen Seventy nine\nI'm the president has turned up a lot of fear about immigrants from Mexico from Guatemala and Honduras and and the so called caravan uh immigrants from a Muslim countries he's very concerned about and has stirred up a lot of fear about\nBut we have a home grown hate movement in the United states and the the mass shooting at the synagogue is just the most recent example of it\nHow seriously do you think we need to take this home grown hate movement and do you think that that we as a nation and that our government is taking it seriously enough\nI don't think we're taking it seriously enough I'm not sure it would be possible to take it seriously enough I think it's potentially the greatest threat that we face I'm just if you look at last week with\nThree major incidents of of\nFar right extremist and terrorism and and our country a I think that that that's a much more real threat than for instance a caravan of of immigrants uh that's thousands of miles away um and and that is hoping to potentially come here and get jobs at\nNight and it's no Charlottesville on a mix of course\nYeah of course um the other thing is that among these really have a valid white nationalist groups and\nI didn't really understand when I began reporting this book that uh\nThat white nationalist tend to blame Jews for almost everything and you know and and so I think when we see something like a deal report thing that last year was that was one of the the largest years for for threats and threats of violence against Jews I think they're almost two thousand incidents and\nIt's unfortunately not surprising to me because\nThese are the people that that white nationalist believe are working hard to undermine our country through bringing immigrants through a hoping to bring more refugees to the country and through trying to empower people of color in the country so they get a lot of violent backlash and from from these white supremacist ideas\nIs this an unnerving time for you ...\nYeah it's it's a hugely unnerving time for me in part because one something\nWhen something like the synagogue shooting happens I'm I feel a haunted and depressed but I don't feel shocked um you know in order to feel shocked you have to be surprised and\nUnfortunately these kinds of incidents are not surprising to me anymore and in fact it seems like there's a certain kind of inevitability and that is true in terms of mass shootings in general that this country has not been able to address off them but it's also increasingly true in terms of you know acts of hate or\nYou know I don't think that this will be the last one and and I think probably like a lot of us I sort of live live in fear and with a sense of
