corresponding Gordon career and\nCourt in what are the new claims to what do we know and at that at this about the identity of Alex Michigan and it's under Michigan\nWhen they see a report from the battling kept investigative groups I specialize in open source investigations and they were the ones who identified the first individual if the two are they put out a pretty detailed report which explains how they came to this conclusion for instance looking at a car wreck cool it's um\nA ... a application files doing facial recognition looking at ... academy a graduation reports uh old to

that that could be someone who was part of the team precisely because none of them was being deployed either to protect the individuals who to know how to deal with him\nAnd another piece in the

trying to hack into the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons in the Netherlands and so I think it is not sense of trying to put as much into the public to Maine in the hype of exposing and then perhaps pressuring the jail you average activities\nAnd and that's really interesting what you're saying about the availability of this information because this ... this latest development about Alexander Michigan comes off the back of the u._k. the U.S\nAnd other governments have you were saying accusing and and and and bringing prove against Russian cyber some sabotage and and other kinds of an espionage how does the u._k. react how does the west generally react to this\nWell I I think what's in some cases they've there's been a I think a a a a degree of unity which is apparently some people I'm a last week you sue the U.S\nThe u._k. and the Netherlands will come out on the same day\nAnd to criticize the jail you an ... specify wanted to be not to when it came to kind of cyber activities now the spending cap report to set but it's not a government documents you know being organized with the government but I think it has that same sense so the the best perhaps way of dealing with these activities by shining along to them\nAny reaction from Moscow no no yeah it's a I think we've had them skepticism before of course we should say that the two individuals who have been named

this is the ... the treatment that is going to transform you and your life and you're going to look better and feel better\nDo you feel that your business is add to that pressure wedding yeah this is something that we have to deal with every day when it comes to creating the product services we can't let that connection human connection and the skills to speak for itself but when it comes to product how do we then market\nAnd tell people that this is something that really works because there was actually very very little legislation governing how people market death claims and it meeting lives on the integrity of the business itself\nBut it is a good thing that the consummate trends are changing and that consumers are getting ... and get away from the minute enough by the way from the consumer yes just in general do you think that you were part of\nThis pressure on women to look a certain way\nNo I I don't think so because we are part of skin care having good skin it's a right when your skin has a problem at an ... recall a post NATO pigmentation issue is equivalent to us having a cough all skin is not well it's not healthy\nAnd I think it's absolutely necessary to seek out the kinds of treatment to make sure that it becomes healthy again so in terms of whether or not we are pursuing an unrealistic sense of duty\nWhich then now you know in a world where Instagram and and and this kind of ... is very rampant how do we cut through all these noise and provide exactly what we seek to do which is to give the best product Soviet\nClients can't get healthy skin from the inside out that can heal and regenerate itself\nAnd we have to be able to like the result speak for itself sort\nOf caught up must walk so I think that it's not like I think it would do is vanity yeah you think of as a female than anything else that's right that's right well preaching to the convention\n[laughter] can I I Want to ask\nYou nailed it sound it's optional you don't have to you know I\nGet your point I Know what you're saying ... ... pounds and they feel ... my base nays\nDoesn't increase anxiety amongst women\nBook there's always going to be as I say\nFor many many different reasons so although I could say yeah now's are optional\nYou don't have to do them it's more democratic and you don't have to be skinny ties nails all these things\nThat always will be will go who will be like a carnival to go to all announced that for I'm not part of the gangs that fall I'm not going to like myself as much as I should do so we definitely all part of\nAn anxiety introducing affecting women but I Would say that we are the lower end of it\nNow I came across a quote from a beauty executives he said that mood and beauty has been redefined as health self esteem and ... do you agree with that is something\nI Would say that times have definitely changing there's so much about the culture we live in right now which is about enhancing ... de Gaulle rather than\nHiding my skiing advertising ... to be about you know hide your pen pals and that will like negative connotations but what I find now it's definitely about showcasing the best version of yourself and that's a really exciting change to see\n... what about the term empowerment is that isn't a good way to sell products\nTo be honest at the end when it comes to beauty I Do think that is a little bit overused I think that the rationale behind it it's extremely powerful and impactful but it can be deemed as a marketing gimmick in in reason yes due to overuse off that\nWorked out a hundred percent agree I think the concept is obviously positives but the way ... along with many many other words like self cat they now just become mocked employees and Instagram slogans and only the other day I was in a very well known British train [laughter]\nOf cosmetics and every single product down one oil was a male fellow no no no production is a huge gatekeeper for wells NBC\nOn what you tend to find is very very few of the ... all distributed nationally and globally all founded by women and thought is what I struggle with the empowerment blood used mocked him because you're not truly empowering women because if you date would be economic empowerment\nOn when it comes to that issue of economic and palm isn't there but now with entrepreneurs there's often an origin story but let you start in your business and something I Believe use with pot delayed by a bad experience getting your nails done\nI Would always go and get my nose and every Friday is this ritual with my friends even as a student with another show of money we would go and get a loan and brushed crazy palm trees and all kinds of stuff now is one of the few treatments impeach way you can actually have a conversation with someone while it's happening\nSo I found the social ritual anyone else done really lovely and then also the designs were amazing like show my identity and I just still stunned that one up to ... for me and on the kind of person who if I see a problem I'll just be like what I'm going to build my own solution\nSo then I was like I'm going to wipe my cell phone and it was all very hot posit\nOn three months after I had to bulk up now so I don't so well I was twenty four years old for a while I hated it\nYou have to watch the news business division is everything I'm largely an academic and I like studying and I like fair is about how we communicate refreshing light on staying here I was doing the road to an opening chateau\nAnd cooling the council unveiling we'd license because it only grind yesterday and grind it I I was not prepared for the la\nBoating I Want to bring you ... did you have any\nReservations about going into business with your mother\nOr a question that I often and I'm also between yes and no depending on when you ask us but she is an amazing woman with a great passion for skin care\nBut not to discount her but she did not know very much about the business side of things because you have secondary education but a really really hard working and diligent woman so and on and I graduated from college and decided to just help her do a business plans and help set everything up and so that plus I signed place\nSo that the mistakes that she made in the past would not happen again so that's how we got stopped it but that was nine years ago and a lot of things have changed since then so that one of the reasons why I decided to joined a business fulltime was I found that that was a gap between what consumers were looking for as well as what the industry was providing\nA ... process both inside and out a feeling that you'll you'll actually ... to ... to be able to do the things that you need to do and I think he moved ... about how things are being marketed at the moment and I think the the big\nSurge into wellness industry and the the the term is very ... and well this could be anything from you\nToo you know buying a lipstick lunchtime to help you pick up\nAnd I'm just wondering if these in risk that\nOf ... put too much emphasis on duty in particular way I mean every single salon owner will have hundreds of stories of our customers have come in feeling won't emotion left fading another positive emotion so we find telling you that\nAre you have spent time with someone and improve the quality of that emotional wellbeing thing here is wellness where it's going into the high street and buying a steak\nAlthough yeah it does make you feel good it's more of a short lived good humans are social animals and we need connections and I see beauty treatments as one message of which there are many\nBut obviously this is my industry some Trump came into this [laughter] but maybe the services all one message Web all you can feel a close a human connection and that to me it should be valued much more likely than it is so that women don't have to be paid low wages\nPutting this idea of being undermined because it's women's work what do you feel from that I absolutely hear from Indiana\nAnd in fact we have taken a very similar approach in terms of\nHow do we increase how much we pay our therapists\nFor the work that they do because for each patient it takes two hours basically each therapies only can take for clients a day\nAnd so by increasing the environment using the best products investing the best equipment so that we can charge a premium allows us to to then be able to pay more but that was what I was referring to as a choice of the M ...\nHow they would like to structure to business\nAnd whether or not because my hair stylist is a guy\nAnd his assistance a guy's as well and in fact the men who are Harris distance I Believe they make about the same as a female ... assistant in Singapore so based on my understanding all\nThat kind of animals are eight so they make the same when they get to senior level naming some famous female hairdressers right around me off the top you had it's very difficult\nTo do I even while awaiting a chance to to to do because I was a good question I I I Love this kind of ... yeah\nI just feel so passionate about this because it's reflective of so many industries that the very booked him men and women all on a level playing field and if you go out I should go up it changes how did you go with him the T yeah very very few\nWomen putting yes this is something that I Know does as well\nFor hair actually if a style as as as a director level whether they are female or male doesn't make a difference in the amount that we pay for them and uh it doesn't make a difference in the amount that they bring home I've got friends who are personally in this industry and\nIt's more about the level of expertise and you're right that in terms of makeup and hair we do see that Islam is dominated especially in the fashion industry strangely do in the beauty industry we don't see that many men in fact I have had zero in the last nine years of applicants who applied to be a therapist\nSo I think by the fact that there is a very very tiny fraction all ... males in this industry it might be a little bit sleeping\nTo say that is the cause that women that's why they're paid low maybe you're right that is very difficult to pay above market wages for the technicians while doing it but if it's a male technician who is doing a job\nI Believe the pay would be the same as a woman if you know if we compare but as we go up the bulk room yes there is more men but when it comes to small businesses versus a big now to national corporation I think that the game is a very different\nAnd I would like to think that women are given very very far apart you Nikki in Singapore at least in the duty industry\nSomebody when you look back at your career yet what do you consider to be your biggest say and how you recover from it [noise]\nIt was just going to sound so whacked by just don't believe in this whole ... thing come on now I'm being serious I actually have to ... is a celebration of because I think there's much and I'm I'm ... now my ... my\nJourney was random ... any of the value of say that it was a series of experiments that I learned from\nIf you really want to force me to say a foul yeah I Would say it's not realizing oddly enough the power structures within beauty to not make the right amount of money that I could have made very early on in my career because I was guided wrongly find powerful men\nRight I Would say that I had many opportunities to capitalize on a trend that are created or we rather as a team\nBecause then we change the culture of novelty didn't exist in the west how it did not own at no point did any of the men I spoke to who wanted to invest or develop prone to do anything with me say you need to make project now otherwise other people are gonna make product\nOn basically still you'll stuff see missed out on the the changes have we definitely missed out on a ...\nI Would be a multi millionaire now in my products in as a ... but instead a license more prone to two guys a license doing my creativity to two guys who made that product and then start paying me royalties\nSo you know there are many small examples of places well enough of example there that's that's interesting yeah but I wouldn't call it a failure because I just love to learn from lessons learned a pooling likes Germany and I don't believe that\nThey might I mean I won't go early you have to say thank you and it was a great one [laughter] very good one to become um [laughter]\nUm it's a little bit with loads off challenges and obstacles along the way that two people who I mean in this business and in anything I've always always wanted to help people grow help people become better and be more confident and one of them will be my employees\nAnd two people that I actually grew from scratch and they were really really you didn't have confidence why pay for tuition I send them to school\nTo help them build a career one of them actually stole my money from us have this from the fan either [laughter]\nYeah and another one actually decided when she didn't want to work with us anymore because she's still contract it was because of the um the school fees that we sent her to school with she went to the ministry of labor\nA got a lawyer and decided to sue us and India and she lost she had to pay us quite a bit but\nIt was a very this distress and also the hot chick that came of it at that point it had a choice to decide to continue to trust my people and continue to groom them or to just take away all the privileges\nAnd you'll to change the way we decided to operate and I'm really regret that we decided to stick with the former because you know we cannot let one person one bad experience changed what we truly believe

the U.N Nikki Haley is leaving the Trump Administration at the end of the year she surprised many with her decision to leave but as NPR's Michele Kelemen reports\nI think that's true and like so many people who are serving stranger perhaps they are not initially supportive of the president when he got the nomination\nThey back their party's candidate and they chose to serve and they sure with distinction issue is a rock star at the un certainly credible and great assistance to our country\nGreat help to the president so she will do this\nSteven company ...\nSo I think the domestic political assessment is probably right I think you know certainly her star rose\nIn conservative political circles here in the United states I think she gets more mixed marks for her performance at the United nations I think her legacy includes pulling the United states back from institutions that advanced U.S interests and values like\nThe human rights council and other bodies I think also she will probably be associated with the politicization of humanitarian assistance in terms of\nThe U.S going back for its support for Palestinian refugees and I think we're approach to human rights has been pretty highly selective and I think that that will over the long term probably hurt us credibility on those issues\nYet you know those assessments that she was getting on the way out to what she's saying do you think amongst the diplomatic comb friends that she wasn't it to a certain extent a more outwardly looking possibly the administration than others so I think you know\nTo some extent people were probably quite worried when the Trump Administration was coming in that they didn't know what to expect\nAnd whether or not the you know administration might turn its back entirely on the United nations and you know to give appropriate credit I think she did protect to some extent you know the budget that the United states put into the United nations and the relationship between senior U.S officials in senior un officials and I'm sure that her colleagues at the United nations were very grateful for that\nRod Blakeman who do you think will should come next\nI think somebody

to the points that Brad Blanton was making\n[noise] yeah I just don't know I don't agree obviously fundamentally I think\nYou know obviously multilateral institutions aren't going to align themselves

cleansing or the atrocities against the rain gear that's an issue that\nNikki Haley cares about the\nInstitution of the UN that's been the most vocal and and sort of forward leaning on those issues
