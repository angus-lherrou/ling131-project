{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "The most uh exalted form of transporting the most traumatic form of transport in America look it was incredible and uh I tell all my friends in on the coasts you know from New York to California if you want to understand\nNot the real America we're in the real America too I think Seventy percent of America lives on the coasts or one of these big cities so we're as real as anyone but if you want understand pretty much what happened and what he's sixteen get on the hand get on the dog and\nAnd see the other part of America because one thing that was interesting was you know when I got in the house in ... in June of twenty sixteen you know and I thought okay there's a selection happening but\nTrump as a clown this is just a mistake the GOP made by the time I got off in September in San Diego I was pricing I was pricing Montreal real estate 'cause I thought this is not going to end well for our country everyone along outside of the coasts was telling me you don't understand what's going to happen is going to win and she's going to lose states like Pennsylvania and I thought oh come on people get real\nSo a lot of the what happens on the house in in like success is a reflection really of what I heard it was more journalistic almost than than me making things up\nSo I Want to play this for you this is a sort of like a movie trailer only a book and trailer it's with Ben Stiller a it's an infomercial for the hedge funding question in this book\nWhat is ahead take money from the right to invest [noise] like your mom [laughter] and then transfer that money to invest\nLike invest that money sometimes really your stuff\n\nToo I just lost half a billion dollars on a futures ask who we want you to know\nHow I learned\nWe want you to fail that's how white people learn airy stand guard from his new novel legs except book trailers now yeah I mean people\nIn America anyway I think Canadian still read books but in America books are like oh gross they smell big whatever um so you need to make a trailer or to attract them to to read a book to begin with so I've done trailers with the ... to Jones there was one when I was married to James Franco and made out with them for a while very soft lips\nUm so yeah I I Do these things now\nTell me um we've been dancing right I think the whole interview to tell me about the story of America you want to tell them that\nWell you know I'm an immigrant so I I was always viewed America is a kind of I I Am an American at the same time you know I'm parked in Manhattan which is sort of and you know an aircraft carrier parts off the coast of of of of of the rest of America um recently I started spending half the year living in upstate New York I learned how to drive ...\nNot well enough and I you know I I drive to malls and I buy you know a family sized um bundles sharman and ... and that makes me feel a lot more a part of the land you know\nSo the idea really was to to to try to understand now again I still enjoy sixteen and I wanted to explore America without this kind of political edge\nBut the political edge kept pursuing the ... you know at one point during the trip a bunch of white supremacist got on the bus talking loudly about crucify Muslims and Jews so this is on the bus you were actually this is not ... but it became part of berries Uri and just like Barry I mean I'm Jewish of course and so I you know\nJust like Barry we're getting off the bus and I saw a New Testament coloring book\nOr an buried buys went to prevent them from being crucified by these white supremacist but they were a new voice I mean this was two thousand sixteen they were talking about Breitbart\nThey were talking about their love of Mike Pence are all these things that seemed to me fantastical back in the summer of ... sixty and you know at one point were rolling through granting State University which is a historically African American college and one of them said well\nThey got their colleges one day we'll have ours\nMeaning colleges with white people that I thought what part of Dartmouth don't you understand it seems so strange but the but the scariest part about that was that the people on the bus myself included mostly people of color\nWe looked away pretend to we were asleep we did not engage with them even though we were in the majority and that snapshot that idea that we were on the bus but we weren't challenging these horrifying people\nWas like a snapshot of American twenty sixteen and beyond because the people on the bus became that people in the government pretty quickly well Barry\nIs is he's not a white supremacist but he's a he's a guy with the ... character in your book he's pretty ignorant and when it comes to issues of race and initiate the class for sure\nFor sure issues of class and he keeps saying you know I'm a\nI'm a liberal Republican I'm socially liberal but fiscally conservative is a book goes on you start to see how that fiscally conservative idea [noise] basically reinforces a social a lack of social liberalism because it keeps the power structure exactly as it is and always has been\nA which in part leads to to to to the kind of nationalist politics that we see in part I mean the other part of it is I think just straight up racism\nUm so you know Barry keep saying I'm good guy I'm a good guy but if the book continues you see how just being a part of a hit the hedge fund elite the financial each you know being a part of the elite where you can lose half a billion dollar ... dollars a lot of the futures and because you're a white male people like oh I have some more money to lose you know\nAnd no matter how much you lose you're still making money because hedge funds are set up in a way that you make two percent of whatever people give you\nUm so he can't lose in a sense you know while the rest of the country keeps losing and losing and losing Barry can't lose\nYou know maybe we should all become hedge fund managers think anyone here come on Canada wise up here [laughter] I feel though I'll I'll just aside I Do feel like you might I don't know I feel like you have some empathy for the ultra rich perhaps you didn't have in the beginning of this book well there's\nThere's human in the sense that\nAnd I said before there's a really deep unhappiness that to me reminded me of the ... I went to a kind of procedures math and science high school where almost all the\nKids were immigrants from Asia and Russia parts like that because I was in high school in Manhattan and um we struggled day and night to please our parents we could never who could would still keep hitting us if we got less than you know Ninety nine percent of the score on a test less than a hundred percent\nAnd the many of the people I've met in hedge funds are those exact people you know and now instead of fighting for a tiny you know point oh one percent of their GPA they're fighting for basis points in their Bloomberg monitors so the the the struggle continues but nobody benefits from the struggle not them not their children that their spouses\n... looks really funny [laughter] I Know I feel like we've been we've been going down that road ...\nThank you so much though it's been a I mean look these people are funny in their ignorance I mean to me what is what is comedy to me comedy is\nI think I'm ... I think I'm a draft but I'm actually a zebra or something you know that the humor is the lack of self awareness in people that we all have that you know but I think people who live in the point of one percent because they're so isolated so loaded from everyone else it's just ten times it's pushed up to eleven\nDo you think you could tell the difference in the thirty five thousand dollar bottle of scotch and like a ten thousand dollar bottle of scotch scary\nEnough I think probably yeah let's get a taste testing going or maybe the I think that's the CBC is budget this year but I think we can make you would kill the whole budgeted jak one delicious tasting good to meet a guy thanks for coming in thanks so much Gary ... new novel lake success is out now\nBenefit for today tomorrow and the show can John you might know from the hangover and senior Chang community and crazy Rich Asians we have this amazing conversation in front of a live audience in Toronto last week at J.

do\nMy grandmother when I was growing up suffered from very severe depression that went undiagnosed for quite a long time it ended up actually leading to her very early demise\nThat was one of the very early sparks that interested me and better understanding how we can think about disease and and treat it out of my own experience but then as I developed in the field of women's health and beginning to understand\nThat there were these profound sex differences across organ systems and in psychiatric disease as well and to better understand what happened then and how we actually changed the path forward\nOne of my earliest seminars that I took as an undergraduate at Harvard was with a professor at Emory Harvard and she was the first ten year old woman and the biology department at Harvard\nShe was a renowned feminist and had work to develop a field that focused on looking at biology through a feminist lens\nAnd it really opened my eyes to\nThe historical issues that women face but also how that intersected with biology with science and with care and I came in wanting to be a physician and it just sparked a life long journey for me\n[noise] sticker why women for you\nOf course my mother's first gynecologist in Somalia so seeing her working hard and saving the woman's and she lost her mother doing the birth so that was the motivation for her and she was inspiration to me\nWell she's an incredible woman you mother took to how I Am the she's a physician human rights activists and twenty twelve Nobel Peace prize money which she pulled to the reason you choose to become a doctor actually that was not my first\nChoice when I was growing up because hospitals to me were second like um area we leave the next to the hospital so as a child that used to run and hide in plain hospital and in our home family my both siblings and my father had a severe asthma\nSo I have seen and learn new med scene so early as age of ten I knew with induction meanness and everything to me it was a little bit boring\nAnd there's like no one of the story and I love history I used to listen old grandmothers who come into the house and\nMy mom's like no you didn't have a choice I built the hospital for you so my journey was chosen by my mother and I resisted when I was very young but one super war had been and as age of Fifteen when I deliver first child\nAnd decided to use where I have to be you know this is where my image is more important than anywhere else so my delivery and my first child that made me to accept my mother's plan\nYou when you live with your first child Fifteen\nFifteen I have no idea in midstream background anything I had to watch this woman was my mom was doing this surgery and I'm running to them and saying that she is about to deliver and they see we in the middle of surgery just to\nGo look on there and I'm standing next to this woman freaking out the screaming and she's holding my hand and tell us that like just told the child makes you it doesn't fall so and he's today twenty four years old men and he'd just get married and and I'm so proud of him and is it is I\nActually do incredible [laughter]\nAnd did did you come across any of these ideas and your medical training of sex differences in terms of how we diagnose and treat patients because he will trained in Russia is that correct\nDefinitely for us as my mother's work and my work it's just putting the woman's house first\nIt's not the scientific level is just to give them access and being first and instead of coal continuation taking care of the only children and emergency but no one is thinking about the woman so that's where we were thinking about it I'm every woman has to have access to health care is a basic healthcare cleaned delivery\nAnd knowing about Dr Jackson's work it just makes more fascinating yes that's ... that's what the research should be\nPointed when you were practicing cardiologist how do you think your agenda in since you approach to work\nAs a woman I think that women look at you for sure with a certain level of trust and you as a woman also understand the context of women's lives so approaching women holistically that as such at the center of women's health\nIs the intersection of the biology with what their social and environmental context in which they live\nAs well as somebody the other factors that impact their lives like the legal structure and I think being a woman\nYou've lived that life and you think have a more natural affinity not that it can't be taught it can be taught but I Do think you were starting in a different place\nYeah you have a headstone decode when you're treating patients on the ground what difference does it make you were a woman\nIt's a huge difference you know the way they listen to you the way they\nYou can share a lot of deep connection and they're very open to you in discussing the sexual issues there Ninety eight percent or some other woman went to the FDA and female genital mutilation and so there challenges they're difficult to stay facing you know\nAlso their rights biggest challenge you face in a position in Somalia is woman cannot consent on their own body so if I Want to do any procedure I have to wait\nHer husband brother or someone else to sign to educating her and telling her like I'm here for you this is your body you know you can do it it's just\nDifferent activities more if we do in within the conversation talking to the woman so it's it's a lot actually I go whole holistic\nYou just ask what was your breakfast I usually ask my patients do they have you eaten you because she sometimes forget herself she has ten kids and she had been even eat and you know the ... she's feeling maybe she was just to serve in more than twenty hours\nA day could could you take us into your clinic when a female patient walks in one of the things you've taken into consideration and it comes to diagnosing them I think\nFor my last eleven years since I went back home my view is completely change because I got my education from Russia and now you spent several years here but a couple of years in North Dakota\nAnd you go back home with this western mentality of you know family planning this is what we should do and we push our patient as the paternalistic way of telling what to do what's right\nAnd one patient I had really she transformed my view and from that day on the way I see the woman in Somalia and how I interview and treat them it was completely change\nSee every action I make in the conversation I have with the community leader or maybe we're lord I have to things like what is the consequences of this\nCan you give an example of a situation you face where you've had to come up with a solution quickly\nIn the middle of a war we had attacked the hospital when one time and I was communicating with one of the leaders in the area and making sure they stopped shooting the hospital because they were just shooting everywhere around and he\nDidn't understood would hospital you know the consequences of people there I had to take a minute and or almost ten minutes ... mothers children these guys had no clue what he was shooting\nThe sitting with him and talking to him and begging him and saying we need to evacuate and the word of evacuation I could on finding somebody language that was my struggles I couldn't explain in some money to just wait\nThirty minutes to evacuate the patients and he was like I can stop someone shooting me and I could understand his point because there was a cross fire and he says like you telling me to stop someone is shooting me I Can't stop\nIt was very hard and until I fight for him and talk to him and they spend time with him and I got a window Fifteen minutes to save almost\nForty five the shouldn't we had in the hospital quickly than those kind of situation you have to be understanding them and being flexible and not being aggressive I have to watch my voice don't make him more angry so he started shooting more\nThat's more extreme level of some which is rare happening but it's not every day but every day it's just you have to watch what you're saying and you can cost a risk to the community\nThat's an enormous level of responsibility to ... I mean how do you handle it\nIt's enormous and then it showed my mother being just Seventy two now and\nThe two strokes she's build chair bound to the house distress we are going towards extreme and its effect in our house it was always telling my mom I don't want to be in Seventy two in a wheelchair I'm very honored and lucky to have a lot of men tourists and\nViewers in here in United State and I got all the ideas information I learn how to improve my leadership so I'm trying not to be the only one defendant and everything so I give the leadership to a lot of leaders on the ground and ...\nAfrican American president to Wellesley College in the United states and this is a prestigious women's college him he's alumni include Hillary Clinton Madeleine Albright what was it like to take on that for all\nThat was a great honor as you can imagine having a focus on women's health ... through my career and academic medicine to transition to a position\nOf leadership and understanding not only how we prepare young women who are students to really make a difference in the world but also what is it that Wellesley College can also do to make the world a better place\nIn ... you've cooled women's health and equal rights issue as important as equal pay is it really is important\nWithout health what is there I think that we have to really focus on health and wellbeing as central to our equality and it is an equality issue as we think about\nThe work that we do here\nProviding an environment in which young women can grow strong where they are educated but also where we focus on their health and wellbeing it's the totality it's a holistic\nApproach health and wellbeing and economic parity or in my mind and extra complete linked and societies that don't provide economic parity are most likely not providing parity as we think about health and wellbeing\nAnd decode what does it mean to you to be a female community leader\nMy community undermines you as a woman but being a woman leader I have more windows to have a conversation with men because I'm not affected them so they could she didn't know community leaders elderly word loads and go in front of them have the conversation much easier than if I was in the ...\nI use the disadvantage that country things as a woman leader as advantage and that's how we save our community me and my mother was doing from a steady five years this work\nIts owner is very crucial to be a woman leader and woman you on the table so that's that's the only way we can progress and bring peace in my country\n... what does it mean to you to be a female community to\nIt's a great honor to be able to use your voice to improve the lives of others and to have influence on\nVarious aspects whether it be policy whether it be here at Wellesley whether it be and how we carry out medicine both in the United states and beyond before I left academic medicine we\nHad produced a large policy report talking about the sex differences\nAnd pointed out where progress had not been made and that report was taken and what led to was a very large policy change just uh two years ago at the national institutes of health\nThat will now mandate the inclusion of women an adequate numbers in all phases of clinical trials but also mandate the inclusion of female cells and animals in pre clinical studies\nTo have that on her to work with my colleagues overtime to see that change happen it's what we live for\n... what do you think you take away from your conversation with Puerto today\nIt's a deep of honor and gratitude just

the world from Greece to go on a new way to New Zealand or Spain South Africa Australia to as much on the list goes on the person who actually kicked off the whole movement\nIs Martinez plus my machine and say oh I think you become ahead of him\nWhen did older star and more importantly why did you decide to to kick this off\nWell it started um nine years ago and at the time I was a journalist and I wrote about sustainability and most specifically about waste reduction waste prevention at a certain moment I wanted to do more than just write about it\nAnd I wanted to really try to change people's behavior in this respect\nIt's a very difficult thing to change people's behavior will come on to that yeah absolutely\nBut I thought why do people throw away so many items and uh\nOne of the reasons is that we no longer make repairs\nSo we don't learn how to do it's um do you think it's a skill that we looked absolutely yeah in the old days people were told by their parents that when something breaks you try to fix it and a\nTechnique was one simpler then so it was easier to fix but nowadays we no longer learn that we have no tools we have no skills\nAnd new products are around everywhere and they're not so expensive so when something breaks down the road do you like them much simpler easier than the road to having something we've had\nI mean you talk about the little scale to the people who don't have the skills anymore I'm not a ... works and depends on two things it depends on as you mentioned earlier on people actually being prepared to bring this stuff and to get it fixed in the mix and the second thing it depends on\nThe other volunteers for them to kind of give up that time and do this I'm going to want these repairs um where where did you find them how'd you get in touch with these people who first they say if you say to those new skills alone so some people do have\nIn in many people do that in communities my experience is that all communities there are still some people who do have the skills and the two news and the time\nAnd who really like nothing more than ... and fixing and they've been doing this for twenty Thirty years in many cases so that's my that's what I realized when and when I first organized supposed to be back I say it turned out\nTo be not so very difficult to find these fill in the U.S because when you talk to people then everyone says um oh you've got to talk to John he's always been coming around in his a\nShare and you're listening to talk to someone who does tinker around in his shit I mean we can bring in Chris Lee who's in London Hi Chris you run or a pack up and roasted nuts ethnic Cambridge arrived\nIn Enron and yes whereabouts aren't miles from Cambridge\nJust tell us you know what you constantly get out of repairing stuff why don't you give up your time\nI think ultimately it's the satisfaction of saying somebody's face when something is men that that they have a stronger association with that title was going to have to be thrown away but they didn't want to try to why\nAre they wanted to try and Cape May in use for as long as possible and I and I think earlier you mentioned about the sentimental value of of some items that are paid less hosts right away\nYeah it's not it's not just new checking you catches the descendants don't just electronic stuff um someone how to do them right can hear about your own system wouldn't write\nA book on the top of that from one of the or RIMPAC up as I was doing and uh\nA woman ... to an adult and folk\nAnd we worked out that it was about a hundred years old the mom and I said to her I said well of course you you could get a new handle but it's spoken she said of course I could but it's it was my mother's garden for was her mother's garden folk and it was bad\nHands but we're working the soil with it and she said that's what matters to me it was a lovely story through several generations in about a hundred years\nYeah ... that's that's really a beautiful story and it's a typical repair cafe story and that's what a of course you can can be play things by new ones but some have sentimental value just like you say and that's what makes it beautiful\n... on an average day and one of your ... you know how many repairs can you make\nA we usually get in about a two fold Shiites them for a three hour session and on average we retire we recognize a fifty percent um and we think we're doing well but in fact some of the RIMPAC\nI'm trying to get those hires Seventy and eighty percent repair levels which we think is a spectacular but even people who bring along something that thinking of taking to the tape\nIf when you say it tastes beyond repair then at least if I go to the check you know give free\nA machine that how many RIMPAC cafes actually all around the world now at this moment around sixteen hundred on and it was brought up in two thousand nine yeah pursue what you think that spread so quickly [noise]\nPeople deep down they don't want to throw things the way they feel that it's wrong so when\nThis illusion presents itself people are more than happy to make use of it that's my experience from the first repack I say that I started you surprised at how how far more is going yeah absolutely I never expected to grow so big [noise]\nOkay well let's this RIMPAC cafe gets underway preparing

[noise]\nIn the world of marketing this year there are very few ads that will have caused quite as much chat and debate as this one if people say your dreams are afraid\nAt what you think you can do\nBelieve in something\nEven if it means sacrificing everything\nThat's the Nike commercial using the face and woods at the American football quarterback Colin Kaepernick\nThe reason is ... is that dream crazy is the adage in title place directly\nOn Capitol next high profile role in refusing to stand when the American national anthem is played during NFL games he and other players were protesting the large numbers of deaths of African American use of the hands of police officers the so called\nBlack lives matter movement many American football fans denounce capitalistic as unpatriotic anti American when he kneeled during the anthem the Nike campaign this year also as a result prompted a backlash some consumers took to Twitter posting videos in protest\nNow only my burning my favorite pair Nike's your burning your sales you know how many other sneakers or to buy you're going to go ahead and say hey we stand with people who meal for the national anthem ball sorry Nike I Would buy a new fellow past twenty plus years not any more\nFive pairs of shoes and they all going to let them burn Nike decided to me calling cabinet when he doesn't share the same opinion [noise]\nThat's how it's going to be Nike found Kaepernick is going to be your spokesman now okay when I spent my whole life as a Nike man not no more though so that's how you're going to do it I'm sure you harm or doing how you're going to put ... on the cover of your advertisements burn your shoes I like that [noise]\nWell along with him president from past him self even tweeted in early September that in his words Nike was getting absolute he killed with anger and boycotts\nActually it hasn't been spilt Galloway is professor of marketing at NYU Stern school of business and he told me what had happened to Nike shoe sales since the campaign began\nInitially there was some concern that the firm was alienating a core consumer group and you saw the stock to hit the next day there are a lot of people that went on line very sort of vocal minority of consumers who burnt their nineties and the marketplace was concerned that they were alienating\nA core consumer base what's happened since then now is that it's apparent this may have been actually a good thing the stock has more than recovered and touches all time highs and his online sales are proxy for broader sales it looks as if their sales have noticed we picked up\n... how do you account for that given all of the negative publicity the public shoe Bunning that we've been seeing the tweets from Donald Trump complaining about Nike what's going on\nWell to borrow from Nike's tagline Nike just did it or specifically Nike just did the math Nike's sales are thirty five billion dollars twenty billion is registered outside of the U.S Fifteen billion domestically\nAmong that Fifteen billion two thirds are from consumers under the age of thirty five and if you're under the age of thirty five and\nCan afford a hundred and fifty dollar pair of Nike flying that racers\nYou likely a skew towards a higher earner and maybe dwell in a city which means most likely you lean left show by my calculations they'd probably wrist about one to three billion dollars of business domestically amounts at the high end\nWhereas abroad that twenty billion dollars there are very few people outside of the U.S would argue that the U.S is on the right track\nAnd is doing a good job of handling race relations so in exchange for potentially alienating one to three billion about thirty five billion dollar franchise they strengthen the relationship with thirty two to thirty four billion\nSo distinctive whether you think this was the right or the wrong thing to do it was absolutely the shareholder thing to do so in some Nike adjusted the math\nIt's interesting it's almost taking a leaf out of the Donald Trump playbook you might argue to galvanize urine coal supports even if it risks alienating alienating some some on the outside\nThat's all right great brands not only decide who they're for but who they are not for and they made a statement here it came across as bald it came across as authentic and genuine\nAnd it was just a great trade to potentially upset one to three billion dollars of your consumer franchise while strengthening thirty one or thirty three was a fantastic nerve Nike has\nThem the move to embrace calling ... will go down as one of the better marketing moves of the last decade\nDo you think that's more broadly true that in the age of social media and the age where people are much more used to kind of shouting out of the hops opposing other people that that that being ... kind of more okay than it was\nWell we're all hoping that sports for the kind of this away from politics and it ends up at the last firewall\nOr politics sports has been breached so there's no escaping it now what Nike was able to do with dominate the headlines and buy some standards or by some estimates garnered somewhere between a quarter of a billion\nAnd three hundred and fifty million dollars in free advertising this to a certain extent is taking up a page out of the playbook and Donald Trump who constantly dominate the headlines with controversial statements\nAnd also big tax that is known for not advertising why because they don't need to show Nike has gone to a great job hair grabbing the Mike back\nFrom other big tech and other consumer companies\nStill got away here on business data from the BBC so is this the start of a white a trend in brand promotion I Wonder as professor got away suggest seeking headlines can be more profitable tactic than splashing at unconventional commercials Nike themselves wouldn't speak to the BBC for this program\nBut we want to take it wider anyway some brands in the u._k. also taken to activism have personal conviction\nThey've always done it for purely commercial reasons either take Tim much in the founder and chairman of the British pub chain whether students\nAs a long time you were a skeptic he came out ahead of the British referendum ... membership in twenty six dean as an all didn't ... even stuck that message on these pub ... how did that affect the best sales I wondered well\nWe'd been fairly apolitical it with a spoon for the first twenty or so years of our existence and the first thing that cool ma I was the debate over the euro and that is what started the bull rolling so campaign successfully\nAgainst your own and then said nothing for a long time until the referendum when the country was given a choice like everyone else had to say what's the best for the future of the economy and for a company and decided to campaign that just ...\nRight but I mean it's one thing isn't it to take your own stand on that particular question it's another just to get on your band mats and to decorate your various ... with that message\nWell that's right of course there were a lot a lot of other people doing it to a lot of the foot sea hundred\nCompanies signed a lesser saying we'll definitely be better off if we stay in a new\nBut did you worry about campaigning directly to your customers I suppose that's the question I mean there's one thing to go on the media and and express your personal opinion it's another given that you know presumably fifty percent of your customers might well support staying in
