O. two increases is driving the extreme weather and sick and it's something about the way climate change was that does more than merely adjunct the worst whether by increments\nThat second one will take us to the Arctic which could be locking us into patents have drowned them then huge like we've seen this summer the first takes us to the new science of with an attribution as practiced by climate scientists like Oxford University Freddie also looking for the links between climate change and extreme weather\nWhat education brings is basically it's bringing climate change home where people live because\nWhile global mean temperature is a very good measure of climate change\nIt is not what kills you how climate change many tests is through changing extreme weather events and so with that ...\nWe can show which extreme weather events that people have experience and you can say is climate change really a game changer here and it still by how much but they're also extreme events that are not made more likely\nMean extremes are just part of the climate system they're part of the weather too they happen naturally but they're sometimes is a human induced effect on that and we want to be able to parse out what is natural from what his anthropogenic\nA very extreme and that is unique say you will never be able to say that an event was just caused by climate change I Would have an impulsive but without climate change how ... what we can say is how the likelihood of an event occurring is changing the cause of climate change\nThe player in this exercise is more ... of ... the ...

and extreme weather and actually that's where we're already seeing changes and extreme weather you know with with one of his papacy contributed to that discussion actually showing that especially heat

of weather records to and this year analysts like Freddie also ought to stick to them as they happen ... outfit will win attribution examines the European heat wave fixing on seven European cities including doubling you tracked\nIf you want to find out what the role of climate change in that heat wave and to what extent it has been made more likely or less likely you need to find out how likely is the heat wave that is happening in the well we live in today and so for example in Dublin it's about one in seven years and then\nAnd then we ask what would the likelihood of this heat wave occurring me and it well without end to the climate change and then the case of doubling ... it's now with the climate change about twice as likely as would have been laid out and to pretend that climate change\nWhereas for example in Copenhagen they land was made five times more likely to buy into the getting a climate change\nThe story was more complicated in Finland where temperatures of over thirty degrees were busting their records they seem surprising and according to the world where the attribution study they're likely to remain that way\nThe further north so in the to finish places we looked at like found that if a much much of it right then and the well we live and so it was in the south on one and then it was at least in one Ninety year then and then the other one it was about a hundred and forty years then\nSo it was a match rare event but we could actually not quantify the effect of climate change because the observations in these places are all over the place and so you're uncertainties that much higher layers and that's how climate change actually make this a relatively common event\nIs pretty explains the study was based on a mixture of where the data and climate modeling this is the emerging former says Andy ... who you heard briefly earlier and who's currently putting together the latest of the American Meteorological Society and you'll extreme weather analyses\nSo the comparisons that are generally made are made between our current climate where we are now in a climate before humans began to exert an effect on the climate system\nSo what we tend to do is we run parallel experiments we run experiments where where simulating the earth as we see it right now\nAnd we run another parallel experiment which we stimulate the earth before we have climate change okay so what we do there in simulating before climate changes we make estimation of what we think the climate may have looked like\nPrior to humans producing an effect and we compare those those sets of simulations to one another and then we say OK events either happened more frequently or more intense or none of the above and the current climate relative to that parallel simulation of the past climate\nThe American Meteorological Society approaches methodical and cautious with analyses being invited from will explicitly off to the U.S has finished and then with cycles are reviewing number crunching to follow the assessment for twenty Seventeen is now taking shape\nWe won't know what they will make twenty Eighteen until December next year\nBut the appraisal of twenty sixteen the followed up by the strongest El Nino event in two decades makes it interesting reading\nThe extreme looms across Asia one study said would not have been possible without climate

between changes in Arctic temperatures in the high level jet stream wins the guy with a ... as much of the northern hemisphere\nWhere we talk about the large scale circulation would talk about things like jet stream and will be called storm tracks so the jet stream that's threatened by the temperature difference between alone that to go to the sub topics at high latitudes towards the Arctic ... of course much colder\nThe temperature difference created pressure difference that pressure defense trash the jet stream\nThe jet stream owes its existence to that temperature contrast\nMichael Mann has been collaborating with improvement in studying how Arctic warming is changing the north and with our parents and\nThat's actually what creates the jet stream has banned a very strong winds from the west in the upper part of the atmosphere that trope is fear that we live in those strong winds arise because of the north south contrast in temperature and if you reduce those contrasts you can slow down the jet stream\nOr you can slow it down what that means that you no longer have that strong jet stream that's there to take those weather systems and move them along so they're more likely to linger\nThis is a study and we have done a couple of years ago and we showed them the debts in summer the jet stream as weekends and the particular\nThese storm threats that we can and that is important because he's stolen strikes at a very moderating effect on the weather conditions over particularly Europe but in general over in the mid latitudes over the length regions and the reason is nice weather systems are generated\nOver the ocean over the Atlantic travel to which to Eastern Europe\nThey have relatively wet add relatively mild temperatures and therefore the according effects on continental temperatures so he sat slow it's weakening\nYou have less of that cooling effect and that favors to build up of hot and dry conditions over the confidence uh this is yeah we've seen quite pronounced changes in that weakening of the weather systems\nThat favors to build up a whole to dry extremes as we've seen for example this year\nBut the weakening has an even more dramatic effect think of it is a slap cunning with the wind driven more slowly it's more likely to be diluted and increasingly all with the full cost of our pizza show or launch weedy lines sneaking\nNorth south around the north pole this is the jet stream being pushed around by global conditions and it internist hearing on whether in more alarming directions\nIf you know in one region the jet stream moved north what's it brings warm air hopes of topical regions far north that creates very warm temperatures region slight Siberia\nAnd at the same time be just where the jet stream bent south what's it brings in the Arctic all of a self correcting relatively cold conditions so what'd you tend to see if you have to weigh the jet stream you tend to see\nAlternating are normally this recall them off warm and cold regions and that's the kind of a very regular pattern around the globe and that that we saw it and do the two thousand eighty\nAnd the particular version of the ways that most of ... when Michael Mann is called ... treat wave residents where these ... take up more and more energy become more and more looked into place the culprit this yeah it did happen\nIt did happen in the summer twenty Eighteen was an example we know this isn't published yet but if you look at the weather diagnostics it becomes apparent that this phenomenon of planetary wave residents was playing out and that's why we saw this sort of global coherence it wasn't just\nOne particular region that was seen extreme weather we were seeing extreme flooding extreme drought extreme heat of course in these wildfires breaking out in these hot dry areas\nOr around the entire northern hemisphere in that corresponds to the fact that we had very large low pressure systems very large high pressure systems that were basically staying in the same locations day after day it is a classic planetary wave residents set up\nAnd it's not just the heat waves that were affected by the fixed passing the jet stream waves\nWhere there's a high a big high in one place that means downstream there's going to have to be a big low because it's a way because high low high low high low with those peaks and drops and that means that when the western and central us had that big high pressure system the eastern us here in Pennsylvania where I live\nHad this low pressure systems that sat there again for weeks on end and it was one of the wettest summers that we've had because we were stuck under one of those lows\nNow here's something else in the eastern us and then the southeastern us where we had a tendency for that low pressure system and there was a lot of rainfall and it was really wet and then we got hit by Florence that means the soils we're already saturated and many of these locations\nFrom a very wet summer and then all of a sudden you dump a whole lot more rain it's got nowhere to go the soils saturated that means you it's got nowhere to go but to flood the surface which is what we saw\nPlanetree wave residents is a new plant in the discussion of global warming is not fully incorporated into the models it may not be the game change it currently looks to be research into that will needs to be developed but if it is and Arctic warming is the driver and the news from the always caps not good\nWe find it very strong linear relationship between global warming or global CEO to emissions and to see X. decline in the Arctic and we see it in summer but we also see it in all of the year that's really strong relationship and what that shows is that there's a really dominant mechanism of\nRadioactive warming from increasing the greenhouse gases and that is the overriding factor\nIn terms of a long term trend of the ice change in the Arctic\nAnd and our two thousand sixteen paper we computer that for every metric tons of year too that's added to the atmosphere you lose three square meters of the ice and this relationship seems to hold both in the observations but also we see the same kind of relationships and Clinton lotta forecasts\nBut the models tend to be showing a slower rate of sea ice loss per increasing CEO to\nWhich leads us to believe that when we look at our future forecasts MCI conditions from climate models that there'd be conservative and that actually will probably be seeing an ice free Arctic in summers much sooner than what the motives are forecasting so according to our calculations if this linear relationship or to hold\nOver the next Twenty years we would see an Arctic Ocean that would become ice free first in September but with more to it also is that becoming ice free in August in October and sort of extending out from there and we cheer in about Twenty years\nIf this has anything to go by indeed and he's a policy is that\nHas to be very alarming climate scientists are currently meeting in Korea to debate what the world might look like if nations do manage to keep average global warming below one point five degrees above pre industrial levels an ambitious and probably impossible to get\nWhat we are learning is the worst the weather can throw jobs can be more dangerous than we did mentioned and that the climate is reorganizing itself to amplify those was after the twenty ninth team will bring our way well\nThat might be a topic for another edition of discovery from the b._b._c.
