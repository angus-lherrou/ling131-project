live from a Washington bureau I asked him why he was just taken the step now rather than any other point during this bloody war\nI think there's a lot of external circumstances that have converged at this moment I think the ... shows you fear does have some impact on thinking in Washington certainly in Riyadh I think the reputational costs of the Yemeni war now to the Saudi regime at a moment of enormous stress\nIs has to be taken into consideration I think the most recent un report\nDiscussing have a much worse than than situation humanitarian crisis is going to be exacerbated\nOr in the coming weeks also has to fact in our thinking as as a fact that the U.S Congress has been going in peace in the in patient with our continuing support for the the Saudi coalition in the air strikes do the sales of of the nation's and logistical support and I think all of these elements\nLend a certain sense of urgency to the ministry nation which is most welcome as more and Griffiths said\nBut they're not his ... at the moment has great to liberate the crown prince Mohammed bin ... previously\nWhile I Would like to think that's true I don't know that's the case but I certainly hope that we do believe we have an opportunity here to demonstrate to Saudi Arabia are continuing support for the government for the regime for the royal family are in exchange for some very careful and thoughtful decision being made on some of the crises that Saudi can help\nResolve [noise] so how do you see this conflict or coming to an end I mean the United states uh could um hold up on supplies set to Saudi Arabia for instance\nWe could I'm not sure that would be the the magic bullet that would solve this if you will um I Do think Martin Griffiths plan that he is has outlined for you hear this afternoon is certainly very welcome and I think that's something the United states should and will be supporting and I hope we'll do it very publicly and very energetically because I think that this is going to be one of the final opportunities\nTo put the parties in the same room and have them sit face to face and decide how they get out of this terrible mess to both of them all in principle parties in fact are responsible for creating\nDo see Iran that being prepared to deliver the who says to the negotiating table\nI'm not certain Iran could if it even one or two I think that the uh the who is a very happy to take support from Iran and they've been receiving some missiles support and some other support from the Iranians but they've never been beholden to ... know as was this something and it was engineered a in Iran either so these will\nAgain they'll make their own calculus on how to benefit themselves in this situation and I think if I'd like to see Iran be helpful in ... suggested they can be and I know they're talking to some members of the EU so I Hope those talks will advance the process that Martin Griffiths is engineering himself\nBecause even if you do resolve the immediate conflict in Yemen are you still have those two regional pies Saudi Arabia and Iran ... each other tend to\nWeigh you certainly do and and that's one of the issues now is at Yemen increasingly becoming a an arena in which Saudi Arabia and Iran can go toe to tell if you will over their rivalry and I think that is one of the enormous consequences I'm for you\nIn which is clear right in the middle of this and that we need to get this over with so that is Saudi Arabia and Iran can decide other ways to to to figure out among themselves between themselves how the region is going to go forward\nI bet that he referred to an end run to the reputational damage perhaps to Saudi Arabia and crown prince Mohammed bin Salman mom but has that we should be reputational damage to the United states because of its involvement in this conflict\nI think that's a consideration I think that we are now increasingly in publicly associated with the coalition and its behavior and its conduct in the consequences\nOf the way it is that is prosecuted this war in Yemen are we are the first supplier of weapons in the sport for the Saudi coalition that I think that is something we would like to be able to walk away from we can do that if we can persuade the Saudis in the ... and the other is to figure out a way\nTo compromise sufficiently to win the war find out what we can do to make that easier for them to achieve what is there will weaken constructively play that will allow them to make the tough decisions I think that can be our role I Hope that we're going to be doing in the coming weeks\n[noise] fat
