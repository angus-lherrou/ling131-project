{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "You have to kind of getting them out of a bunch of different characters ... done with like a like an opera\nWhen I was listening to it\nA two things occur to me I tell you the first one I thought what the sniper and a stone throw or so the\nPerson in a position of privilege you could still do an awful lot of damage the person is ultimately power less and therefore full of rage and can't really do anything and the person who wants to cut through at all and said what are we all fighting about I feel like not just me but we all sort of inhabited\nWe all can inhabit each of those characters asked me in any given time yeah so\nYou just summed it up a lot faster than me yeah that that's pretty much that's pretty much [laughter]\nYou know so so at the end of the day it's it's almost about an internal conflict right and like you know these are all sort of feelings and and prior you ... yeah absolutely enough that I can\nVoice them All right like enough that I'm In touch with them and I can write them and perform them so that means there's somewhere in there that's really beautiful yeah it really is something when I was listening\nTo the record I kept on thinking is the fool\nYeah getting all of us in the shadow or is it Jesus yeah like I went yeah that's cool because there's a strong element of spirituality on this record yeah didn't line that stuck out with me is it's hell on earth anywhere love is president ... says to the pool and the song right yeah yeah I'm going to talk\nAnd which is a pretty actual strict definition of hell mhm big biblical basically rain ... like if we if we you and I both know the drill deep in\nInto the Bible to help out some place with a pitch fork in fire and someone in a in a suit it's it's a it's a place without without love ... and then at elsewhere in the same song you know we let the creators create I mean let the creator John ...\nDid this feel like you were and but please don't\nTalk about you should be comparable talk yeah so it was a ... was it an intentional or what was his decision to kind of reveal\nA maybe a more spiritual side of yourself [noise] [noise] yeah I mean um it's a spiritual records\nYou know as we were saying like ultimately these characters exist within us you know and I say towards the end of the album you know I guess the moral of the stories of war continues within us you know like this is a struggle\nAnd so I'm as much as there's like political residences and all sorts of stuff on the album I think it's a spiritual album um I think\nHaving the perspective and holding onto the perspective that is required to live peacefully 'em and by that again I don't just mean in terms of physical violence I mean in our posture towards one another um that's that's a spiritual\nThing mhm and uh you know if if I'm able to you know find that fool character and and that character's voice and wisdom it to me it's through\nSomething spiritual you know that comes from my spiritual you know education um through people through religion you know um so yeah absolutely it's it's a spiritual album and\nListen to the the reason I said that I Am just recognize ultimately ... you were saying I don't know what I Want a bumpy by the reasons recollect ultimately make made me feel good and I think it will make people feel good because I mean joy with no diversity is hardly joy you know there needs to be darkness in order for there to be light and if we can ourselves mired only and darkness wish I had all the time\nBut if we're able to find I mean just to be speaking from an extremely privileged position but if you're able to find joy enjoyed it a little bit more\nBeautiful like the character jak she comes out at a really cool nice time in the record you know what I mean I really appreciate\nYou saying this time because that's what I'm saying like uh that's one thing I'm I'm a little nervous about is it is a dense album yeah and ah there's a lot going on and uh\nIt it gets dark before it gets light on this album again I think\nThat that joy without adversity is is this sort of cheap joy and I think that ... the sadness is cynicism into something worse than that disease and what I Love about this record she added that I'm just when you think it might be a cynical\nRecord becomes joyful after she um it's nice having you know thanks thanks for having me Madison's great to do this\nChap stick around to perform one more song for you another brand new track I was brand new record out this Friday

D our TV which is even worse\nAnd what was what happened here was that the treatment success was Ninety three percent and that is excellent by any\nAny comparison to even usual tuberculosis and even though there were at will be called adverse events or some lab abnormalities almost all were manageable and treatment didn't have to be stopped with this study does\nIt speaks to the importance of the need to expand treatment for the most difficult cases the most difficult forms of tuberculosis which is the ... in a multi drug resistant and extensively drug resistant tuberculosis and this is a problem all over the world\nWhere they are an estimated almost five hundred and fifty eight thousand people with empty or TV and only twenty nine percent are treated\nSo when we use this new drug but ...\nAnd this is one of the only one of the two new medications that we have in the world for tuberculosis and that seems to have been the key so what's your major point here we just had a very important meeting called the high level meeting on tuberculosis at the United nations a month ago\nAnd the point was that we have to treat people with tuberculosis no matter what form of tuberculosis right ...\nAnd we need new tools and neutral like a new medication like the ... is very important we need to be able to diagnose people well and I think most importantly and ultimately we're going to need a or a vaccine to actually address the burden of tuberculosis in the world and for that\nAnd then of course of ... I Would think especially in in in in the parts of the world where patients don't have access to this kind of treatment\nAccess is extremely important in the fact that ever done in a country like the ... is not you know it's not one of the richest countries in the world that they were able to do this using their resources under their routine or so called program conditions I think is really shows the um the fact that they were that they were committed\nTo addressing the tuberculosis is way and this is this is ... ... all over the world\nAnd it's interesting because it's such a big breakthrough a bit remind us why TB is so deadly and why has some forms of the illness become drug resistance\nI think we need to remember that tuberculosis something there's careful and the fact that we're not able to cure all the people with tuberculosis as as a ... in my mind a real tragedy so what happens when programs don't work will you develop these um these forms of tuberculosis\nIs empty arch you'd be this ... TB and that's what is so deadly because it's very very difficult to treat until we came up with uh the regiments containing ... for example the deck on treatment was\nUp to two we uh two years and now when we had the short course regiment which doesn't even have to use what we call it an injectable drugs we have to you you get these painful injections for many many days of the treatment\nIt means that we can cut the treatment down too short and is nine months and we're working now and the TV to me to get the regimen down to just six months\nFor for our listeners this new drug ... and ... it can it really cure TB in all instances\n[noise] but ... is one of the as I say only the one of the two new drugs that we have\nWhenever we have a new drug or with time if it's not used properly what can happen is that a resistance can develop to that drug so it's very important that we keep doing the research that is needed to develop new medications that we can give that we can give people\nDr Paolo if would you are there at the scientific director of the international union against tuberculosis split with ...\n[noise] not surprised some is it a little this morning after his impressive display for us no last night he scored and set up two goals for ... and make a bunny Angus they'd be less to three one and now two points of the top of the table and it's ten consecutive wins for the gun is an old competitions\nAwesome coach and I am remade as captain for the night and commended him for his commitment\nIn the European champions each day to the return of Christianity and now that you mentioned the United in group age is one of the fixtures of the night and swipe your man or a day of Costa could become the fence and golden cup treats the fun of the African champions league\nThey take one lead into the second leg of the semi final awake at their own ... eat chips and the ... on on city of Algerian leading to nail\nIn basketball the brawn James is still waiting for his fest may not be any Lakers after they fail\nTo one hundred and forty three points to one hundred and forty to defeat to San Antonio ... says that's not three defeats from three at the start of this record a season and that's what this full Mitch many thanks we say it in unison [laughter]\nNow China is officially opened the longest see breach in the world it's fifty five kilometers long and links or Hong Kong Macau to the Chinese mainland fill it is on our business is uh it's got like ... it is\nKind of ... troubled times between uh the different regions from four hours to ram Fifteen minutes the bridge which is designed to withstand earthquakes and talked looms\nWas built with four hundred thousand tons of steel enough to live on sixty Eiffel Tower was about ... kilometers of its total linked crosses over the seat of the ... river delta\nThe driver of a train that crashed in Taiwan on Sunday killing Eighteen people has said he turned off its speed control system before the accident investigation is at the time left the tracks because it was traveling nearly twice as fast as it should have been\nThe Japanese government says it's found multiple examples of medical schools altering entrance requirements for applicants based on gender and age an inquiry it was set up earlier this year after revelations that the Tokyo Medical University systematically reduce the schools are female Africans\nIndia's Supreme Court has imposed conditions on the use of firecrackers during the ... coming to Ali festival about stopped short of banning them the court ruled that only license to try to sell fry Caracas and joined volley people can only setting off during a two hour period each evening\nOn Facebook has removed more than a hundred pages on the accounts linked to a marketing company involved in the online campaign for the Brazilian far right presidential candidate ... opinion polls put him ahead of his left wing opponent Fernando high died before Sunday's run affect police in Brazil didn't investigation\nBBC News\nThey face to face in the program about how women are shaping the world I'm ... and each week I hear from two women from different parts of the world about how they ... they successes and the struggle of\n[noise]\nDown to who remains music videos directed from Nigeria industry yeah music videos not just in these recent case of an artist who they want to be away from ... to ...

I think it depends on the project um it depends on who you're working with and how collaborative the oddest wants to date I always approach every project openly and seeing that each time it said a whole different experience because I'm always like different people\nThat can get very some authors to his but you've worked with a lost his email on this is my choice will buy Jones yes\nIn some ways I have a choice in what I pitch on but the results or the fact that you can often be potentially I Would say taught cost or pigeonholed based on your previous work so say if you had a lot of successes women felt an artist it's very likely you'll get a lot of those trucks which has been my experience for\nYou tend to work with them at the beginning of the Korea is when they still trying to stop dish ... who they are going to be in some ways yeah yeah I I find that those kinds of projects get sent me a lot can be when I look at the spread of artist you've worked with they are a lot of women as well is that being deliberate on you and ...\nI don't think it's a conscious decision for a meet people would think more women gravitate towards me but I think I've actually done using videos for more men that makes any sense but then even though I'm working with the men I Do try to use women in the videos from a place of strength\nOr publicly so strong story\nTelling well I Want to get into that little bit more because one of the most effective ways of promoting music is via sex you know when she video naked album cover some ways to send in production\nBut can we do you post ... drew the line between portraying sexiness sensuality in an office and you know the exploitation\nIt depends on what I'm inspired by\nHighlight flooded with the idea of the Seventy body\nAnd sects of course but it's from a different places from it takes place is from a place of sensuality there's a certain section is a woman holds when she is powerful in her own sensuality I Do explored but is it tastes well yes I think a lot of the\nQuote unquote booty shaking in videos I mean if that's what inspired by that what if I had my um you might be gratuitous to some places I've never gratuitous when I Am\nPutting a concept together that few things I'm looking at does this promote the art is what are you trying to say I've never seen going way way I'm going to put a a girl in a bikini\nAnd just have someone to do all of that horrible if I'm going to do that you have to be for appeal at the end that makes any sense I'm not knocking anyone that does it I'm just saying I personally just don't think in that way\nBecause I was watching your videos for the Nigerian musician was kid on the song is called tease me and said to the gentleman's club\nYou went to a gentleman and the woman\nDancing but I think in the hands of a different direction that video because I didn't really see any absolutely just described to us how did you handle that particular setting how did you do it\nI think that is actually the most raunchy videos ever done when he came out it was a it was a big deal because prior to that was it was kind of seemed like the Justin Bieber but just to me but clean cut and that video was one of the things that broken into that sex symbol kind of thinking\nAnd I know he's had a little bit nervous about it do attending Twenty one I mean at that time but we came up with this idea where it's just him and it it's just these women ... says but it's not like you said it every once in the hands of maybe somebody else\nWill not have been tastefully done if you saw from the costumes that they were wearing they had the ... there was something very sensual about the ...\nThey have the power and he was the one actually I was overwhelmed\nThere wasn't anything where you'd be like a you know that makes me feel uncomfortable is as you probably want to say oh I I wanted to pull daunting now after that you know\nIf there was no particular thing [laughter] you know can get one of you and\nThere's a famous videos is out of the American sing a Katy Perry you know the song is called our kids to go and that was done in two thousand and eight and I was looking to move some production views on the video for ... and by then we can sing or how would you say you work has changed in that time\nI mean if you compare the two videos of very very different I Would say that it is all for two very very different artists inevitably when you're working on a project and collaborating with an artist no doubt you're putting your on Pakistan on a project is no way to not do that because\nEverything you do with why human intuition and you're making choices that no doubt we'll bring in a little bit of king about his flavor to project however I always really tried to not\nLet that pass them stop or to take\nAn artist and I think for me Aurora and Katie could not be more different [laughter] thing that you\nDidn't want to put your personal simple enough that that is one of those that are just wanted to do so you can recognize easy that is the king of as a product\nYou know and and and it's it's funny because I was a real fashion about five years ago where all these ... to start putting their names on projects and I always felt really uncomfortable about that which probably was not really [laughter]\nThe best thing to do for my career but I just felt like oh this is not a passionate about it is not the ... and ... but it's meant for the artist if anything suit\nCan you would you say that the common theme is about how women want to come across these videos about you're listening to how they want to be perceived\nWell absolutely you know when you're working with an artist you're thinking about festival what does it mean to them what is it about you know also you walk away and you listen to the tracking me Steve how you interpret it because sometimes the ... or ... I don't always have to\nFall or the lyrics meanings I can walk away and cops aren't completely different but you know if they have to say that they want to show in the video and then I have to take that into consideration\nOkay Kenny I'd like to me through how either from page to final products like what are you techniques\nSo you know they gave me the fall\nI go back I can listen to a song and immediately I see snatch is of pictures in my head like I just feel like steel frame and then I just have to read those things together and sometimes it takes me a long time I got to you know please don't when I'm washing my teams that played when I'm cooking when I'm drinking some why\nI wouldn't really necessarily say without listening to our chocolate without getting a brief nerd anything I I I Would like to consider everything that falls in my life but having said that I'm doing commercials\nNow and I'm also a mom and I have\nA husband who's on tour and family life is a balance and I unfortunately have to say nerd and much more than say I did back in the day when\nThis started but would you say do nines that you're willing to cross due to the content of new and it was in the brief when the ...\nWell I don't know I mean let's say I mean ... or ... let's say to some artists that are\nParticularly distasteful or not my cup of tea or it's\nMaybe it's just like I just find it really boring or and I'm not really inspired by it then yeah I if I'm just not feeling it basically it's enough for me to say not\nKenny what about the issue of ... which is about prejudice or discrimination against dark skinned people so I Would say that the love interest and and most African music videos is almost always light skinned do you agree with that\nI I really don't watch anything [laughter] he must have seen some things that I Know that it's a conversation that\nI mean it's a very serious composition of the articles on his I've seen are they taking to talk for maybe elevating the life has been women in your videos or just using light skinned women and the videos and not\nOf representation of the different types of women yes I've seen that I don't watch a lot of music videos which is really weird because I mean we live view direct among other things but I don't know if it's a big deal sharing Nigeria\nOr were the easy at ease in Niger and end up getting a gym music videos and I think he's a huge factor so it's not something that you think about it too like\nWithin your costs thing we knew nothing about I've never never come across an artist I said you know do you get a lighter skin personal I Know that way from\nMusic videos and so she was a huge problem now with girls wanting to change and all of this in because the thing like the son of the beauties of international thing as being a lighter skin navy yes I can I knew that that's happening a lot in the Niger in society where they need to do is I've never been put in that situation ever\nAnd if somebody did say if somebody did request [laughter] and light skinned female lead is that something that you would ... would you have any say on that\nOh I definitely do that on that because\nIf what you're trying to portray all what you're trying to tell me that life has been posting is more beautiful than a dark and just because of the causes getting then I'm going to have a problem with that I never been put in that position than goodness then gone so it's very easy to sit here and be on the Mike and go this is what I Would do\nBut then if someone was going to act that way I Would probably\nKnow from all the conversation I had to that person I knew that this is not the kind of person I Want to work with but I never ever been put in that position\nThat you see more women coming to the fore\nAbsolutely that's a lot more female directors now and that's just amazing thing when I started out I was maybe the only ... director ... which is a very big global company I was definitely the only one in your ...\nMaybe that was like one other one in the U.S but there was really out of maybe a hundred and fifty directly you know he was in Paris and [noise]\nI Am now but I at the time when I first started I was based in London so yeah like I said I was one of fifty directors who was female and now I'm not saying that it is twenty five twenty five\nThat's definitely a lot more room for improvement but luckily women are now realizing there's no reason why women shouldn't be directors and there's a lot of young girls popping up\nWhat do you think it's changed can get what is it allows for them to come out now\nTo be specific and to know exactly but I Would say technology you know the fact that feels much less daunting to pick up a camera now and to\nAccess editing and and also I think maybe a relatively new thing as of the last few years it's been a initiative started by a female director quit on her I'll quote free to bed which is really wonderful because it really encourages females in our industry whether it's in commercials or music videos\nIt's a database that exist on line basically just need to be female to be a part of it [noise] so are you in case somebody looking for a funeral director that can just sort of go on the website and have a look and say he's out there\nThat basically that the whole point of it was to encourage\nAdvertising agencies she actually pledge\nTo have females in every single pitching process of commercial this health again doing doesn't\nKnow Kenny how who for OU that soon you wouldn't have this dubious on now being described as the only female Nigerian music video director it's\nAlready happening when I first came into the industry I mean you had fuel directed by the window music videos if you think it's a problem globally even was in Africa and especially in Nigeria\nPicking up or something of an earlier on when she goes as a trend of putting the name on the the music videos actually do that and one of the reasons I Do that is\nBecause it's imperative for me at the little girl watching the TV can see that any less looks like a female name that's the goal that did that video how things have changed is\nBy these young girls who people like king us people like me\nBut I'm not just in the industry but we are actually competing in the industry not just in the ring of women but also in the ring of men when I have interviewed I very very conscious of was that I use a lot of times when you when when you have interviews in my gym at what they tend to say is oh and what does it feel like being in in ... industry\nPlus correction is it's not a real industry the male dominated industries they're trying to change that I wrote that tell you how I have been able to come into the industry things I have to jump to remain I Need to use positive was if I go oh why me it's so hot and not enough\nAnd then you might get into the hands of the little girl watching and she's going to go it's too difficult you know I'm just going to\nStep back and not get involved that's not what I Want I Want them to be able to see me and see that I Am actually competing\nIn this industry that's number one number to lend to ship something that's big for me is every once in a while and then she would go on Instagram go anywhere and just pull out women\nAnd go come over here and you can be on this project and then dumped just being around understanding that it can be done senior woman in the position of power and building them as well and so many of them have gone on to be their own direct to doing their own little projects\nI said last question is your dream artists which is what you'd like to work with Kenny\nI Would say beyond say 'cause she will challenge\n[laughter] sorry we can go there and a half\nAgainst each other for that one [laughter]\nAnd my hair and the other time you pay [laughter]\nBeyond say it is then thank you both can me and ... and it's been a pleasure speaking to you

about lead today as the U.S is preparing\nFor midterm elections we're looking at one hearty perennial of American politics gun control I literally carry my pistol all within minutes loaded by me having the gun and gives me a choice\nIf I Need to protect myself and my wife or my family I can do that yes this yet but I'm more of an Amazon role and funding of the gun lobby has become a big electoral issue but which side will it help\nAnd we have a candidate outside of stories on whose son Jordan Davis was shot and killed and Florida\nI think the environment and the United states is different this year than what we've seen in the path\nThat tool to come on business daily from the BBC [noise]\nFebruary fourteenth Valentine's Day at Stoneman Douglas High school in Florida what you're about to hear some of the distressing audio recorded by panicking students a lone gunman is making his way through classrooms\nThe attack in Parkland led to the deaths of Seventeen school children and stuff\nIt was the most high profile multiple shooting in twenty eight teams but in fact less deadly than to others last year in Texas in Nevada the rate of these horrifying killings breeze by loan shooters\nThat seemed to accelerate over recent years is also intensified the political argument in the U.S when and by how much should America tightened its gun laws\nCarolyn is a reporter with the progress of gun control lobby group based in Washington DC\nGun control is very much a part of this election I think we've seen a number of\nMass shootings and the United states in the past few years that have made gun control a political issue and I think the timing of the Parkland shooting\nIn Florida that February just before the midterms really made it so that candidates across the country have to respond to this issue of gun legislation and what they would do if they were elected\nHow is it coming across a congressman themselves being direct lobbied\nThere are more interest groups coming and supporting candidate from the left from the gun safety lobby then there have been in past elections\nI think it's interesting that the national Rifle Association has decreased presence in these midterm elections either because of their financial woes this year or because they just understands that\nThe money is really coming in from the other side\nThe national Rifle Association or NRA is as as a player in this debate America's oldest civil rights organization that lobbies for the rights of us citizens to bear arms to keep\nAs it says with the second amendment to the U.S constitution Bob Spitzer is a professor of political science at the state University of New York and he studied extensively the roots of the organization\nThe n._r._a. was formed way back in Eighteen Seventy one by to civil war veterans who during the civil war saw first hand that the typical American young adult male didn't no one end of a gun from the other\nAnd so they formed the at our aid to improve the shooting a marksman ship skills of militia eligible men and they did shooting tournaments sporting competitions things like that and there really wasn't until the Nineteen sixties that it began to turn ... attention more to politics\nCongress passed the gun Control Act of Nineteen sixty eight and in the Nineteen seventies there was a measure in Congress to severely restrict access to hand guns\nGun rights people within the enter a felt that they were being attacked in besieged by the rest of the country so that group took control and ever since then they become much more political much more focused even obsessed with what they call gun rights and it's produced the organization that we know today\nCity in our age is kind of rabble rousing group that is ... is the right to the Americans to bear arms is not a gun lobby group and yet it does have a presumably an intimate relationship with a gun making industry\nWell the ... does have a long connection to the gun industry and had behaved as the sort of political mouthpiece because they have one overriding common interest to press as many guns into his many hands as possible\nThat have been a number of school shootings of course in the United states we think of Columbine Sandy Hook and others most recently that's been the Stoneman Douglas shooting in Florida which\nDoes seem more than other events to have galvanized a movement against the gun lobby how much of a threat has that been to the ...\nThe high school students who tended to Parkland high school in Florida\nThey did something that victims have never done before instead of seeking privacy and avoiding the media they went in front of national cameras\nAnd said look we're sick of this our leaders have failed us we're tired of them being afraid of the gun lobby and they have aggressively push this issue\nThroughout the spring summer and now into the fall of this election year and by doing that they're trying to keep the issue as a top tier concern so that after the elections there may be greater momentum to perhaps enact some stronger gun laws [noise]\nOf the shooting them and Douglas students like Emma Gonzalez here have directed that political file on the and All right\nGood kid relented describes how surprisingly affected the students efforts to galvanize political opinion and an emerging ... campaign around the n._r._a. have been\nThe victims and survivors of these of the shooting were high school students who knew very smartly how to use social media and how to kind of leverage their pain and\nTheir fear into politics very quickly and there were a few dozen companies that were offering discounts to NRA members\nLot of them were household names you had a rental car companies that I'm sure people use all the time and we just decided to publish a list of all the companies for transparency the public deserves to now which companies are supporting the gun lobby\nAnd I think because there was so much pressure and attention on the n._r._a. in that week after the Parkland shooting\nVery quickly those companies started getting a lot of pushback and very quickly\nHold their relationships with the IRA which was something that we haven't really seen before and I think it was pretty shocking and new and surreal for people to see that\nYou ... some of that are as power\nDid we see any of the major retailers pulling back from the sale of firearms for example\nThere were a number of major sporting goods store as that said that they would no longer sell assault weapons so that was a very big deal we also saw among that less of a few dozen companies I mentioned that offered this has\nAll but a few pulling their relationships um Delta Airlines and United Airlines told us they would no longer offer discounts to enter a members who wanted to fly down to the annual convention\nIs there any way of measuring the financial impact on the end All right all of these moods\nIt's hard to know exactly how these companies pulling ties impact in the ... finances we know that they are complaining of financial well as in court documents about it's hard to know exactly what that entails\nBut I think one interesting effects of that like I mentioned earlier is if you look at the n._r._a. spending in these twenty Eighteen mid term elections they're spending far less on candidates that we would've expected them to go all in for\nNot much does appear to be true reason filings in early October showed that the n._r._a. was spending less than two million dollars this year on political campaigns one tenth of its spending at the same stage of the twenty four team mid term elections\nWe did try exhaustively to speak to the n._r._a. for this dish in the business day from the b._b._c.\nAnd the state conceded that twelve thousand registered voters who are just support from the African American\nWere purged from the voting rolls and an able to vote because they were wrongly labeled as ex felons and that number of people purge was twenty two times George W. Bush has five hundred and thirty seven vote margin of victory I think coming out of the two thousand election Florida we said this could never happen again we could never have\nThese kind of voting problems but I think elements of the Republican Party however saw different strategy\nWhich was that small manipulations to the country's voting laws to state voting laws could make a very big difference in close elections and could benefit the Republican Party so we saw the same kind of efforts and the two dozen for election in Ohio when there were massive lines to vote in democratic areas\nAnd then after two thousand eight when there was record turnout for President Obama and five million new voters cast a ballot think Republicans realized that if they were able to restrict access to the ballot particularly for democratic constituencies like African Americans Latinos\nAsian Americans first time voters younger voters\nThey could gain an advantage and they could gain vantage by changing the voting laws and all of these states they control so I think if you look at what we're seeing now\nYou can date it back to what happened during the two thousand election Florida and then fast forward to twenty ten and Republicans took over so many key swing states nor control of state voting laws all across the country particularly in states that were decided the next president and decide control of Congress\nAnother issue I Want to ask you about and I don't know how carefully you've been covering it there's a lot of concern about um Russia or other foreign countries hacking into our electoral system or interfering with it through\nA fake a Twitter accounts bots\nFalse information you know um so I think twice Republicans this past summer have blocked efforts to increase funding to uh protect our election security against hackers like the Russians um what can you tell us about that\nThe Trump Administration and Congress have done almost nothing to make states voting systems more secure and this is\nClearly ongoing we just saw an indictment last week\nBy the Justice Department that showed that Russians were trying to influence the election through fake Twitter accounts and other things that by the way promoted things like voter ID laws\nAnd raised the specter of widespread voter fraud so the Russian boss were basically echoing what Donald Trump and Kris Kobach and others in the Republican Party were saying about voting issues\nWe know in the twenty sixteen election that Russians access to a voter registration list or tried to access voter registration list and Twenty one states\nThey got hold of voter data in Illinois and half a million voters which is very alarming and people focus on the potential of voting machines being hacked and that is possible particularly in Thirteen states that have\nNo paper backups on their electronic voting machines which includes some very important swing states like Pennsylvania in Georgia\nBut they don't even have to have the voting machines themselves\nIf the Russians are others where to get a hold of registration less like they did in Illinois and if they were able to do it undetected and they were able to delete people's names from the voter registration rolls or change\nOne hyphen in the case of someone in Georgia or were able to change someone's last name and states like voter ID laws that in of itself\nWould create huge chaos when those people showed up at the polls and if we could potentially disenfranchised\nThousands of people so it's not just the voting machines are at risk gets the election systems themselves particularly the voter registration lists and\nI haven't seen any aggressive action by the federal government to try to do anything really substantive about his problems a lot of people are worried about what might happen in twenty Eighteen because the Trump Administration has done so little to try to counteract the threat of Russian hacking\nWhat are you going to be focusing on on election day\n[noise] I think I'm going to have my hands full there are\nA bunch of new restrictions in place in very close races so places like Georgia and North Dakota and Kansas\nI'm going to be looking first off on if we have any hard evidence or what the stories are of people potentially being disenfranchised and then looking at did that in impact\nThe outcome of the elections even if it didn't impact the outcome of the elections the fact that people are being prevented from exercising such a fundamental right is alarming in of itself\nAnd then I'm also going to be looking at all of these ballot initiatives in seven different states that would potentially expand voting rights\nFor millions of people I'm going to be looking at what's happening\nIn local races that have a huge impact on voting rights local secretaries of state races for example were Democrats actually have inability to take back the seats from Republicans and really critical swing states like Ohio and Michigan and Iowa and Georgia and so I'm going to be focused on one hand\nOn the potential threat of voter suppression but on the other hand I'm going to also be focused on the opportunity to expand voting rights for a lot of people so they're twenty aging election could go into different ways\nIt could be tainted by voter suppression or it could be remembered as an election in which voting rights were expanded for millions of people\n[noise] Laurie Berman I Want to thank you so much for talking with us\nThank you so much for having me back

billions of dollars in deals is underway and Saudi Arabia however in recent days and weeks a flurry of individuals and organizations including prominent Americans have backed out\nAnd turkey Saudi Arabia as its opponent in this power struggle clearly right\nVery much so because you go on one side turkey Iran and Qatar as allies\nAnd on the other you've got the the Sunni molecules plus\nPlus Egypt so you've got Saudi Arabia offering a ... an Egypt and they all died matriculate posed to each other the ones I've just mentioned that like the Muslim Brotherhood they banned it they see it as an existential threat to the rule Turkey's ruling party is very much tied up with the Muslim Brotherhood so\nMy feeling is that the Turkish government specifically president Edwin is holding some stuff back as a useful bargaining chip with Saudi Arabia\nNot because they're scared of being revealed as having broken diplomatic protocol in bugging the consulate apparently everyone does that do they\nThey do a lot of people do um\nThat is one possible explanation and yet why would they have leaked it through the pro government semi official media that this ... this tape existed but he didn't mention the audiotape deliberately um if it was going to reveal the naked truth in that tape existed well what would it be a good time to say exactly what was on it but he didn't\nIf that tape exists then the only way I think we're really going to know what was on it is if it's actually played to some kind of international independent rep will to cause the problem here\nIs that all the people involved in this investigation of go to chip in the game the side as well to minimize the damage to them and move on and say well jump dumber invest we've cleaned up the mess to have a\nTurkey has got a vested interest in making started to look a lot about the typical relations America wants to preserve the strategic relationship with Saudi Arabia or not lose all this juicy contracts\nThe BBC's Frank Gardner go new tall is the director of the center for Turkish studies at the middle East Institute in Washington she told me that observers were expecting a much stronger speech from President or the one\nHe mentioned that he was going to do the electricity that he had so people who are taking a lot more and in fact he did not feel or anything anything that we now know before so this was a major disappointment\nOr but on the other hand I think the fact that she is the president of turkey acknowledge that this was premeditated murder [noise]\nUm I I think that was in court to step and yet I think\nYou're saying no ... he he claimed it was a premeditated\nMurder he claimed he claimed that this was a premeditated murder [noise]\nUm and I think that was an important step on his part and yet in in the field he praised the king for instance and I fear for his efforts\nAre in the investigation and he suggested that the crown prince Mohammed how mine was behind what he did in Iraq knee\nAnd target him quite fingers at him so I think the strategy\nAll along has been to try to isolate and accountants from from his father the king and add long tried very hard not to burn bridges with Saudi Arabia that's you know as a important at partnership for I'd want it\nActually at a time when the Saudis have been investing in Turkey and Turkish economy is struggling\nSo I can once he's trying to do here is undermined Mohammed and saw him on\nAnd with these lead a by unnamed Turkish officials he's been trying to increase the pressure\nOn Mohammed and saw him on especially from the west and push the Saudi regime to to own it\nRight so as you point out it's a complicated game that the Turkish president is playing from his point of view what is the best outcome here how could this go really well from now on\nI think that that's an audio for him if there's any steps down as the crown prince because despite all the troubles and at this point there is a long running rivalry between the two countries and yet the two managed to have a whole new relationship\nDespite the the the tension because of what happened to cut ties\nBecause of turkey and the Muslim Brotherhood and then a in a very sensitive chain such as Saudi officials for instance importantly visited uh the Syrian traditionally she just wasn't there a terrorist organization by turkey\nOn uncharacteristic knew knew that he hasn't responded\nSo she tried very hard not to target or openly criticize the solid you need your shift because this relationship is working for him\nBut after ... am on the loose on line to over\nShe has become a theory a host on against turkey only or find the guest turkey statement in Egypt defining turkey is part of a to Z axis of evil in the region\nAnd especially in their interest in foreign policy approach to their own vehicles earning so on and and so if I'm making some money out of the picture\nI think that's a nice picture for president died on\nIf turkey has audio recording of missed the show Jay being tortured and killed why didn't miss the other one play that in parliament as part of his speech well I Know\nReasons and why is that they did not have an apple team at all you recording legally they weren't probably spying on this out the consulate and Turks do not want to embarrass themselves that could be one reason and another reason he's I think he's still holding that that as a ... car and you're trying to leverage that evidence to extract\nConcessions not just from ... also from Washington\nWhat's the mood in Washington where you are because senators and congressmen are trying to pressure Mr Trump to come out most strongly against Saudi aren't they\nYes the Congress feel very strongly about that and given at President Trump's close allies
