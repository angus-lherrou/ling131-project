I think in English as a whole summer unfortunately but\nWhen I ride black characters I give space\nFor them to be interpreted by the actor that I Choose always say hall from what I Do and the cost of ... um because that actor is going to embody that person\nSo to me that's the thing language is absolutely important and we need to see ourselves in in an authentic conduit especially 'cause we're so yes\nMeans yes you are guaranteed to form another one of your big trucks will Latvian multiple languages\nAnd there's an offer so no one would walk [laughter]\nSo I'm going to do a kind of hit and what can happen\nWell we're going to see you in action them moonshine saying them every day [noise]\nYou want to\nWith you on the same room\nA long gun habit I\nGuess I gave up\nOn\nOn Monday [noise]\nMan de dum de dum de da da da da da\n\nDa da da da and the fact that you all the dance moves I had thought them out hopefully we love said thank you ...\nWe've been talking here and the seven to in Japan is about up becoming the past let's turn to the future to see what are your hopes for the future creatively in your career\nFuture well I'm like I don't think about like the future in terms of like in the future future because the future future I just wanted to be the grades who's greed in the world but like I'm doing a special next year so that's going to be a national\n... ah do you think South Africa needs to continue to talk about the apartheid era or move on from that there's no ... on the\nJob of it but it died [noise] um I mean\nTo me it it'll lose essentially to the title of my phone which means the title of the winter to my skin which for me as a butter reflective so that looks back at their whole life\nAnd they look at even the hardest times and they look at them and they say you know what that made me who I Am so yeah I think we look at a party and hopefully we'll look at it and say that made us who we are as a nation so no no no no there's no there's no ending their politics to talk\nAbout what do you think I think\nThe legacy of the parties are still some evidence in determining so much of how people still live\nAnd it's still so normalized that that's the way it is\nSo I think it is totally rid of him to be talking about I think the security as a white person and I ...

Day weekend in Nineteen fifty five over one hundred thousand mourners almost all of them African American filed past that open casket which lay in state in the south side church\nBefore the funeral service a staff photographer from jet magazine was permitted to photograph Emmett Till's body and those images were disseminated to other African American magazines and newspapers including the Chicago Defender\nBut as a historian Eliot jade born tells us in his new book on the Emmett Till case the mainstream press didn't reprint those photographs and of course they were considered too
