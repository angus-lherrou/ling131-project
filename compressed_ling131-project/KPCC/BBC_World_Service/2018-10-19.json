attributed to literary luminaries including Dorothy Parker in Norfolk Howard and selling them to unsuspecting collectors\nMelissa McCarthy plays Israel and the movie which co stars Richard II grant and it's directed by Mary Elle Heller here's Justin's review\nCan you ever forgive me it's a rare Jim a sweet movie about a mean person in which the sweetness and the meanness don't cancel each other out it reminds us that in the right hands a missing throat can make positively joyous company especially if you have the good fortune to be played by Melissa McCarthy\nAs Lee Israel a struggling biographer turned literary con artist McCarthy gets more expressive nuances out of an angry scale than I thought any actor could manage\nWhen we first meet Lee in Nineteen Ninety One she's being fired from an office job for cursing and drinking leaving her unable to pay the rent on her cluttered Manhattan apartment or her cats medical bills\nHer writing career has stalled and her agent played by a snappy Jane Curtain tells me that no one is interested in her or the new family Bryce biography she's working on\nDesperate for money we sell off a framed thank you letter she wants to receive from Katherine Hepburn and learns that there's a real market for celebrity correspondence but this year the better\nAnd so begins her criminal career she uses her old school typewriter to forge letters by the likes of Dorothy Parker and Lillian Helmand then sells them to a used book stores for a few hundred bucks a pop\nThe movie's attention to process is fascinating we see her practicing Norfolk Howard signature and baking her letters in the oven sort of the paper will look yellow with age\nBut the real work isn't the writing and lead takes genuine pride in it channeling her flair for words into inspired feats of mimicry she becomes a fraud and an artist at the same time\nEvery drifter needs an accomplice and leaves as a man named Jack hawk played by edge role and delicious Lee funny Richard II grabbed\nJak as a drifter with little money and no permanent address just some street smarts and plenty of hustle and he quickly latch on to lead after running into her at a bar one

Valentines to nineties New York a world of bars in bookstores crammed with people who deploy the English language with devilish wit and style\nThe facts that Leon jak are both gay quietly underlines their status as outsiders\nAt one point lead is caught off guard by the gently romantic overtures of a bookseller nicely played by Dolly Wells and we see just how ill accustomed she is receiving human kindness much less responded in kind\nDespite the turned to bleaker more downbeat territory can you ever forgive me feels like the movie Melissa McCarthy has been working toward her entire career\nAs we've seen from her performances in spy and bridesmaids she has always been a splendid comedian and a genius of mad cap improvisation but the lows that have dotted her uneven body of work have made it clear that even a dynamite actress needs a sharp script and a good director to soar\nShe gets both those things here the director is Mary Elle Heller who tackles this character portrait with the same clear I touch that distinguished her twenty Fifteen filmmaking debut the diary of a teenage girl\nThe screenplay us by Nicole hall of center an excellent director herself and Jeff witty they've written a terrific script about the rewards an ad in the use of being a writer\nYou might think that lead Israel a professional crank Cooper first cats to people is a character only a critic could love but at least cranking is is genuinely captivating in part because it's so uncompromising\nHer talent as a writer goes hand in hand with the harsh jaundiced way she sees the world\nThe title can you ever forgive me which comes from one of those fake Dorothy Parker letters is clearly meant to be read sarcastically we Israel didn't need redemption she needed a chance to let her talent speak for itself even if it meant speaking through another writers mouth but\nIsrael got her due in two thousand eight six years before her death she wrote about her criminal misadventures in a book that the New York times hailed as pretty damn fabulous the same can be said of this movie\nJustin ... is a film critic at the LA Times\nOn Monday showed Melissa McCarthy who stars in can you ever forgive me

David Kirkpatrick is co author of the newspaper reports\nWhat's his information and uh the sources he's getting this from\nWell we're hearing this ah from people ... million or with the Saudi plans I'm On the side and some I'm a White House ... for the Saudis have\nConveyed to the Americans that their investigation is moving towards or pointing towards identifying general theory a ... as the culprit bold move on their part because he is\nRather or a senior figure who is known for his closeness to crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nAnd was the general part of the team of Saudis who went to assemble\nHe is not one of the Fifteen names that has been disclosed by church officials as the Fifteen Saturdays who flew in and out that day the idea is that he was the brains of the outfit he is something like the number two ranking official\nIn the Saudi intelligence service before that he was a general in the military and the spokesman for their military intervention in Yemen in that capacity he is someone who is very well known to many many journalists he's also somebody's often had in on meetings with the crown prince\nHas had was visiting western diplomat so he's quite quite closely cropped print the idea is not that he went in with his own hands and cared about this like the idea is he's the one who planned it ordered it back with the Saudis and we're trying to say\nSo the the accusation is old rather your sources are telling you that general theory oversaw the killing of Jamal ... all one state and interrogation that went wrong\nOr I don't know exactly what the ah what the Saudis are going to say on that delicate nuance of what I'm told is that an area they're gonna lay out goes like this\nAre generalists theory got some kind of a sad or approval from crown prince Mohammed\nTo carry out rendition or interrogation that is to get a ... and to bring him home for questioning or somehow there was either on or a misunderstanding or generally Siri overstepped his his orders in ... through some personal ambition and ended up\nKilling that your show any answer that is going to be credible to the Turks are will not include\nA furious element of interrogation because their evidence they say is that Mr Kashkari was killed quite quickly after he arrived in the conflict there wasn't a lot of time for questioning\nBut even in the scenario that you are out lining on the crown prince is involved\nYeah the crown prince the wrong that's what I said to be out that this is a very significant scapegoat if you will if it's just a scapegoat it's a pretty serious scapegoat but because of his proximity to the crown prince I don't want to prejudge this is just a made up story but hypothetically if it were just a made up story to cover the Trump grid you would have\nTo name someone who is very very senior\nBecause only that kind of a person could give these orders and have them carried out without the direct involvement of the ... even so many people are going to question whether even general theory could have pulled this off without the direct involvement of crop breads it's not clear whether the world is going to believe this story\nYou said at the outset Mr cook Patrick that you were getting some of this from from White House ... says so\nUm it it it's fair to assume that um the White House is is aware of this ... emerging plan\nYeah I didn't say people in the White House but I think on the White House and if things I Believe they've been in for the Americans are certainly aware that this is the direction the record is moving him\nWould that be some sort of explanation for President Trump's reference to I'm a road candles teen saint Catherine the weight\nWell how about that reference because that occurred right after his conversation with king Solomon himself it certainly was pressuring if not a evidence that he had for knowledge of this scenario\nWhat do you do make all of the um playing by the ... that ah this was suddenly old ... the killing of ... ... by the crown prince himself\nWell I I've listened to serve John's comments closely and he doesn't exactly\nPrecisely say or that it was ordered by the crown prince he said it looks very likely that all the evidence points to it being ordered by someone very close to the crown prince uh but I think that if anybody is in a position to judge he is and because of his stature or in the u._k. and the U.S\nI think is very public comments today are going to make it more difficult for people in western governments who might be inclined to accept a this explanation that someone else was responsible it is going to make it a little bit more difficult for them to do so you know the the United States government\nThe government certainly some people in
