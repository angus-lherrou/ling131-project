Redlands a community service at the University of Redlands we're on Twitter Facebook and Instagram and online a K PC dot org\nA hearing for parents telling us to get through his nomination to get on to the Supreme Court was extraordinarily painful and contentious and here we are\nHowever many years I guess twenty seven years later watching another extraordinarily painful and contentious a Supreme Court nomination process unfold\nWhat is the direction of travel with your experience been on your observation of what's happening now what do you feel\nWell you know it's it's interesting that you should ask that I'm here in Philadelphia because just last night I was on a panel with Anita Hill and we were talking about precisely that what do we make of twenty seven years later the fact that this issue is still being presented in many of the same ways to the same and\nThings there's one has to look at both what has gotten better and what has not I think what has gotten better um is the idea or at least the recognition that these um claims have to at least a appear to be taken more seriously than they were taken twenty seven years ago so we were able to see that\nIn the way for example that Dr Blaser before it was a question\nNot by an all white male Judiciary Committee a but a bi racial Mitchell and I think there was a recognition that the optics\nWere important I think there was a recognition on the Democratic side as well one of the differences that I notice between what happened with Anita Hill and Dr Blasey Ford is it the Democrats in this instance were very clear that they saw the allegations as a credible\nThey saw her as credible and they want it to her for her that's not what\nWith Anita Hill even the Democrats more or less as I said a left her hanging out to dry so there is a recognition that these are very important issues and and uh they can't be dismissed on the other\nEnd game is pretty much the same\nUm and I as I look at what we learned ah two weeks ago is that\nA woman still have to run the gauntlet of credibility she still has to show an appropriate level of of trauma she has to be truthful um she she can't be a overly um resentful or angry\nUm and and Dr Blasey Ford was able to do that so most of the commentators even on\nA Fox TV that leans a to a supporting a President Trump everybody was saying\nThis is a very very grave situations very very serious oh it was a testament to her credibility\nYou are a civil rights activist and you're also a feminist as well as ... a law professor\nYou've written a lot about into sexuality and the different themes of oppression on how they work sometimes in concerts sometimes in different ways and how people need to be aware and react to that\nTo put it bluntly do you think America found it easier to relate to the issues raised by Dr food root causes of working woman but may found that to relate to everything that Anita Hill raised where she was a black woman complaining about sexual harassment from a black man\nI absolutely think that\nA race has a lot to do with credibility I think that\nThey were a both white ... both elite um\nThat she was seen as more credible more reliable and that's the part of the story that is a reflection about racial differences both and the stereotypes that women carry with them and their ability to be believed\nAt the end of the day it's it's more or less that it just didn't matter\nUm so yeah she might need believed her name Susan Collins who was who cast in many ways the deciding vote said that she believed her she believed that the trauma had happened um she didn't necessarily believe she was remembering correctly that it was judge Kavanaugh's who did it and at the end of the day\nHappened to her didn't really matter\nA in judging a\nThe the qualifications of a judge Kavanaugh um so I I think at the end of the day what we see here is is what I sometimes call you know this person a symmetry she had to do a lot to be credible and even when she did all that the burden basically shifted their hand\nAnd there was virtually nothing he could do\nWould have destroyed his credibility if that performance that we saw in including a loss of temper threats\nTo Democrats if all of that\nTo undermine his credibility one wonders shorter coming in and throwing themselves on the ground and say I did it I did it\nOr whether anything would have allowed a Christine Blasey Ford to prevail so it really is a recognition that there's a huge gap between what men can do and get away with and what women can do to actually being taken seriously\nYeah or I should just articles the governor denies all those allegations and uh\nThat was a scene throughout the the hearings but but here's the the basic question I have for you because your analysis of the way society works and you'll you'll work on this is what you call into sexuality it's it's become extremely influential across America would it be fair to say that you see\nThe the key components in society in America today as being ... rather than individuals who is that a fair reflection of how you see things\nWell I see things in terms of structures that make your group identity a subject to a ... this empowerment our power so the entire a conversation that we've been happening over the last couple of weeks has\nMen it's been about women um it's it's been about Republicans and it's been about Democrats\nAnd really bring the food would be the men and women within\nThe genders have a whole range of opinions on Brett Kavanaugh earn a whole bunch of other stuff too I suppose the the charges a lady talking\nExperiences so the question really comes down to\nAre there differences in the kinds of experiences that people have and can those differences be mapped onto things like gender can they be mapped onto things like race I think one of the things that it could be the silver lining I don't know from\nIn the hearings it's fairly\nA different range of expressive possibility without being penalized for it if one can simply imagine\nA doctor blazing for coming in a in spewing that\nA judge Kavanaugh did and still be seen credible one can even imagine it and then we wouldn't be a matching a world in which patriarchy has significantly lost some of its constrain but that's\nWho is senior business in banking Vegas has pulled out of an

around the marketing industry\nSo it's a closed secure network you're offering the spoke to each organization\nYes exactly and spoke it being a good word because it's fully branded to their organization and and so it's got the features of social networking chat technology for collaboration fundraising advertising an RSP matching\nSays interesting because it's a it's a bunch of things as you say but I was going to last could really Flatow's question which is what's wrong with a Facebook group or a or ... something equivalent\nWell to be easy answer is that a Facebook group first of all can you trust Facebook in our environment in our platform you own your own data which is really key you can control your environment you can control the experience your members have so that's a really big deal it was more secure you think you'll hack proof\nGroup is a strong word I Would never ... nothing is ... weren't enough to know that\nBut it is very very secure an encrypted we're

implementing block chain technology which will increase the privacy and security of the data\nLemon jumped just in the companies the private sector people you speak to the clients who come to you do you get the feeling that there is a growing demand that we need I suppose for this kind of sharing off of the Web the Web has become such a hostile environment for many companies\nIsn't it absolutely and that's I think what we're really picking up on when we started five years ago\nI had to explain what community was\nAnd now everybody understands community everybody understands that the public social media world have this purpose but it's more about\nBroadcast messaging an advertising and it's not about privacy and security and it's not branded so like when a company puts their page on Facebook they're giving Facebook the right to use their brand\nAnd that's if you think about it a little bit crazy\nDenise Hayman lower who says she's now getting interest not just for corporations UN

numbers are impossible block they're impossible to keep out of your general kind of data to use and so when I use my pseudo\nFor is I generate a persona that allows me to sell on Craig's list with a

there so\nSteve the guy who's regularly setting his tickets because he can never make it to the game you you've got one set of numbers and Steve who's actually now called John but you put another

we think about the history of black people\nIn science and somebody putting this and to search engines on line or what comes up is the history of black people as subjects scientific research\nA rather than the history of black scientists and so this is this is a very interesting to me and so when when when I was asked to write an article about black people in science I started really digging into it and came up with the story of I'm a young woman hold I'll spell\nWho when she was in her very early twenties [noise]\nDeveloped like a serum uh using ... oil for oil from um a tree that grows in Hawaii to put leprosy a intermission and people leave out ... oil was something that\nCould uh put leprosy into religion but it was you couldn't take it or early because you would instantly come back up it was just so bitter and terrible nobody could keep it down a and also to just inject it um it was so what does this give that up but stay under the skin and like a [noise]\nLike a bubble or and so she developed a way\nFor it to be absorbed into the bloodstream and she did it when she was twenty two years old and almost overnight a leprosy in Hawaii went in for a mission it was really remarkable\nA and I just thought this is an incredible story and I I don't know why we don't know more about this\nUh any ends ah she ended up passing away at the age of twenty four I Believe she was um it was the advent of World War one and she was teaching a allowed on how to properly use a gas mask and she ended up\nInhaling and mustard gas and she passed away and um unfortunately she died before she could write up her findings are and you know into a into another sort of official paper\nAnd so what happened was a colleague of hers at the or the presidents of University of Hawaii ended up co opting them like stealing them and ... and putting his name on the findings and um [noise]\nUh it was a while before her her colleague a colleague step forward and said no no no no this was this was not his doing a you know he was already sort of looking for a way to patent a says\nThe serum that she had developed and and you know this is not an isolated are just looking at the history of
