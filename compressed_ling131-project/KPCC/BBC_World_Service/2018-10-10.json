{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Um a friend of mine was teaching a class he brought me and for like a guest lecture and then the next semester you said I Want you to teach half the class and then he left um did a history of hip hop or it was a history of hip hop class at the time\nUm and it was an art history context but then when he left I had just I felt like hip hop is too big to fit into twelve classes I split into two semesters and then grew it from forty students to two hundred students a semester and one of them is be trends in life it's about the production and so there's sort of break the mold and get origin stories from creative and then\nIt's bigger than hip hop as about social science research studies origin hip hop and now it's still influencing race and ... society\nThat is the second one is interesting to me 'cause I was gonna ask you and I I I Hope you take this must respect the way possible but I was listening to an interview with Leonard Cohen um when he was twenty three years old so he's in Montreal\nAnd they it's it's a very funny CBC kind of interview like nothing has really changed very much a poet Leonard Cohen is twenty three years old and I'm reading poetry at a bar in downtown Toronto and Leonard comes on and he says\nI wanted to take a ... a paraphrase because I wanted to take poetry away from academia\nAnd put an end to where it's supposed to belong he says but the hipsters and the boosters so it made me think about what happens when we take our forms like poetry like in my case country music like jazz like hip hop and we bring in an academic basis or does it ever cross your mind yeah hip hop\nDoesn't need the university for it to be acknowledged the pop of knowledge itself so hip hop is bigger than the university I'm going to say that I'm as I as a culture for the use\nIt's something that's way bigger than what they experience in classrooms so when I approached my teaching method it's never like oh what's the paradoxical meaning of I don't you know that's part of the thought process of putting together the curriculum but\nThe end the moment in the class education is really a bad experience so I take them to concerts we'd go to museums we watch films we dissect media we talk to people um\nThere isn't like a you need to learn these facts about the culture and WWNO rat tat tat and how you write bars and stuff you know um\nIt's very much about experience in in the moment and then now what's happening is tiny says something crazy on radio that we ... yeah we're going to talk about him you know I'm so like last week we talked about fame and mental health and\nA public instability and things like that and um so yeah it's very shape shifting and very much about the moment I don't want it to get stuck in a box you can't put it in that university but do you think their relationship with hip hop is different than yours and you were their age\nI mean yeah I was listening I was in the drug dealers they're listening to drug users\nYou know what I mean so the music now is very much about the ... the stuff that's at the top of the radio play is really like you know people who are using the drugs you as I was listening to the guys who were selling the drugs and talking about the ills of society around them and so how does that change\nI think like we we as a generation\nAnd the golden era we were born in the foundation right like I Can't take it for granted that I'm not African American obviously I my perspective comes from a very privileged place to be able to view this perspective that's being shared and the music yeah but uh\nIt was ... it was more like escaping to find your dream yeah now I feel like the landscape of of pop music is very much about skipping\nThe reality that you live and yeah and of course because if if we if the people who are making it aren't living in an ... it'll be like are totally are out there is no but but if they're not living in there now if not president there trying to get some kind of escape yeah and that's not to say that\nObviously obviously not all of hip hop is that I think we do you know I think we can say that goes without saying for sure in case somebody like takes a chunk of this but like we have a lack of responsibility and I think at this time\nIn history and the western world if whereas knowledge and all these faults that have been done by everyone from mentor people to we need to also take responsibility for what we're putting out into the world for the youth because they are that for a generation to be drowning in information so like we have to make it clear or at least set a clear path\nThat they can choose right um\nI think that's the difference like he said we don't know how to live in the ... that's the difference between our generation and ... it's scary that you're going to be one more song and this one is called animal but can you tell me about her animal is about abusive relationships

interesting figure he was once close to the ruling family but his writing has criticized the Saudi oil so does he went into exile you continue to write critically a particular about the actual root crown prince Mohammed bin so I'm\nI'm so ah what sort of impact is having on people who are still express themselves about Saudi Arabia such as McDonalds over she'd\nShe is somebody who Sophie's

threatening message and um it is as you said they're no conclusive evidence it now and to claim that he's being killed but uh it is very very unusual case because as Saudi defector\nAs Jim ... had been working very closely with the government for decades but then ... a year ago he arrived in Washington and got their job with the Washington Post and that continue to rise critical obstacles and opinion\nPieces on the Saudi Government so his case is very unusual\nBut would you give us an idea of the profile of that because we're not talking here about a dissident or a government in exile you refer to them as a defector how ... how much of a thorn in the side was he\nHe didn't work very closely with several princes and Saudi Arabia at one point he was the adviser and spoke about ... and ah to the Saudi ambassador in London and Washington at prince Turki face on he was\nToo close to power and that suddenly he probably decided that that there are distinctions on him and Saudi Arabia in terms of what you can ride he's a journalist as well\nAnd show his appearance in Washington and his ability to continue to rise critical articles probably ... the south is because in my opinion I think your mouth shut the nose too much about that intrigues politics of power\nAnd he was too close to those princess he could also his disappearance could be a message to the prince says he had worked with\nAnd and intimidation campaign and I'm really thinking beginning to think now that at this it doesn't\nAnd nor are they wouldn't go into the confidence of his country if he had\nBeen an opposition figure in very very unusual\nWhy did she go to the concept that yes you need some documents to allow him to marry a Turkish women but and he could have sent annoying and he would have sent

very\nThey have been other disappearances recently haven't done I mean people I'm sort of popping up in Riyadh as well but it's just that this gets a lot of attention I think partly because of his

only drivers syringe there there are women Danica Patrick as the obese one who's ... who's made a huge pressures emerges spoke to a mascot ended because in the states not everyone's in favor of this move so what is the reason behind it\nWell if you look for in the one that have been nine hundred drivers over the last sixty eight kids and I need to if those drivers have been women and it's forty two years since the last woman driving a formula one race\nWe believe that there's a structural problem in involved major sport said W series is being launched today\nIn order to redress not violence or we're going to recruit drivers from all over the wild and we can to train them and we can time six races in Europe next year\nAnd hopefully we are going to propel all drivers up into ... we will tell drivers to embrace against men to\n... you see it as a stepping stone to you to kind of balancing things up in the world ... rule\nYes indeed major sports is the un sport in the wild at the moment that doesn't have an eight women Sarah's and we're not saying that women and men column race together oh we're just want to give women increased opportunity so that they have a better chance of

as I say she'd be let it go all\nPoints in the game the players began to look at that funds the next day I asked him about small things on the digital world we increasingly spend ...\n[noise]\nOh yeah I think people are really starting to reexamine them I mean the a lot of talk about visual addiction and a lot of the larger players really looking at how they can communicate how long you been on so you can more responsibly interact with social media if people are just\nSpending so much time and feeling like they have to report every moment of their lives or it didn't matter you know especially with things going on with Facebook getting even you know this week we've ... you're talking about concerns by favoring from Russia Iran\nAnd the misuse of data yeah I think everybody's kind of like looking at all the different ways that feeds me are being used and are asking themselves you know should we be sacrificing all this data and so much of our time and so much for attention to the company that basically monetize again\nI think it's really important is a game designer to think about how we're interacting with the way people think and and their behavior or does it you know I I Want to be respectful that you know and and be cognizant of it\nAs I said there's no communication and one of my professors that graphic design is behavior modification and that seems crazy but really ultimately it is when you're whenever you're communicating something or you're doing interaction design or any of these types of design your goal is actually to to make people behave in a slightly different way and I think that comes with a certain responsibility\nThe things that you learned when you worked in the development of software you employ any of it in the game she make now she exciting make people want to get involved [noise]\nYou know it's funny I don't use a whole lot of the techniques for engagement that we explore in software but I Do use the folks who said that I use when I'm designing and so the Internet design process including all the different types of design research when it came to usability testing an\nEthnographic research and all that kind of stuff went directly into my my talk and in fact\nWe did a lot of ethnographic research if I thought well how does that look so a Yahoo is actually going to people's homes and see how they worked we saw how they interacted with people on their machine 'cause you learn all sorts of\nThings are from their environment and um and from the way they behave it just gave us a much clearer picture then for example bringing them into a laboratory environment whether to an air it's very sterile and you don't really understand sort of a person's situation\nBut if you're trying to develop a new products are people you want to understand how they couldn't their lifestyle\nWe've been talking about the fact that both gaming allows you to log off got away for digital media but really there's a lot of the stuff that you learned feeding into the design of the game\nYeah that's right I mean like I said all the techniques that I use an industry a design software when applied to these off line experiences uh so do you understand human psychology and behavior and cognition and um Iraq design principles and all that sort of thing it applies directly above software and four games\nSo it'll be creepy using people's psychology\nWell it's better to know how it works and then do it responsibly than to be poking around in the dark blindly and you know you someone something that works you know like this is amazing and then you go to town on it and then later on you realize in retrospect wow that was awful you know like wow that really hurt a lot of people I so I I find it much more\nMore valuable talking there about how software companies but I\nAlso work companies are like that but yeah I Know I mean I I mean the about how the big ones some of the uh yeah I mean there's a sense of uh I I certainly picked up on a sense of bravado where it was sort of like a move fast and break things was a model\nFor a long time and you know I got out of you know two and a lot of the companies I work that it was just sort of like it was all about getting eyeballs right away\nAnd you know down the consequences and I know and I think now I'm the answer is growing up a little bit and people are thinking okay well we need to be a little bit more aware of um security and safety and and things like that\nWe speaking about these cheap places the bulls game will so analog digital wellbeing really different books the fact is we display different to say there's on line and we'd like to adopt the name the kind of games that you create\nYeah that's true I think to some extent I mean like the dearly promise to the Web was that you could be anybody right you can be a dog in order now and so on I think what we found is that uh if you are yourself you connect with people in a more true way on line and this whole notion of being anonymous as a lot of pitfalls as well as advantages\nUm in games they create a separate space to separate like people call it a magic circle where you can adopt these other ...

Kathleen Greg ... had something to say about that relationship with the online world\nThe three of us worked in the film industry and she works in publishing\nAnd so like all of us are constantly using our devices to communicate with other people in our fields and like this would be something that's always at the forefront of our own Hampshire we sat here and play for hours of its game tonight and I looked at my phone one subject but John who am I like to travel\nIn our thirties like taking time out of our Saturday to me that you know like this and then just like oh we're ... we're going to go hang out this is a very land eerie an event that we do every like every other weekend and the interaction\nIs everything is so much better like I've I've all but stopped playing video games\nI think we all get Internet fatigue and social media ... I'm like I'm definitely trying to cut back\nNot just because I think it's unhealthy but it it gets kind of repetitive and wearing ...\nAnd sometimes I mean the Internet as well like shrinks the world that allows you to connect with people who are far away but I think we're always seeking connections we want to try and reach out to as many people as we can but\nI think a lot of times it's better for\nOur own mental state to stop reaching so much and just calm down and just be in the moment and just enjoy yourself in the moment instead of looking for something else that somewhere out you know be be here a year now and just enjoy the people who are around your\n[noise]\nWhat do you think this kind of game playing it's so popular [noise]\nI I don't I Can't explain\nThe phenomenal growth in the industry I mean it's been growing like ten to twenty percent year over year like like crazy um I Do wonder if people do want some way to kind of connect with each other away from their devices [noise] making a connection is important to you then\nYeah I mean some of my favorite stories or when people talk about how this game really brought me closer to my dad or even just today or a guy came up to me and says\nI'm this really see my marriage you know when they tell you they don't like yeah the ... yeah yeah and that's not the first time I've heard that and\nI really got me closer to my wife but today it was yeah I Would say by Maris\nRegain gave them an experience that they could share together I agree that you know helped create this kind of intimacy I mean that's wonderful and makes me feel raiders of the matter [noise]\nCalifornia's earthquake warning system will soon be used to stop bart train to the San Francisco bay area water other practical applications are coming this is Larry natural next time on TALK\nHow close are we elevators heavy machinery even operating rooms instantly responding to those earthquake warning\nYou talk weekdays at ten here on eighty nine point three can't be ceasing\nBringing Southern California public radio too you\nEighty nine points ...
