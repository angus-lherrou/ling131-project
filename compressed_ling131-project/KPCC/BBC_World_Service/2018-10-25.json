{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "And so this flag runs through this book as a reminder of that\nIt's interesting that you say that 'cause you know between ...\nBetween between Donald Trump or just reading the New York times and reading the Washington Post I often do you think about I mean I remember being Fifteen sixteen years old thinking of myself being somewhat political right we're going to myself\nI only kind of really understood what was going on and everything seems maybe a little bit easier back and it makes in terms of things that were able to be understood I didn't necessarily need to understand\nEverything that was going down the road right now I guess I guess about what stuck out to me in reading this book is\nHow people who are fourteen Fifteen sixteen years old do interpret the political cultural racial situation in the United states right now sometimes you don't have a choice\nYou know I often ask and my political writer or do I consider myself a political I think living in America I'm as a African American\nYou are by nature living a political life ... because you're constantly reminded or or that you may not be fully American but you're you're being told that are you being shown that um when I was Thirteen living in Brooklyn New York\nMy father who was the headmaster of my school which was the worst thing ever yeah he he comes home and he says tomorrow we're not going to school and I say why and if that were going to march\nOver the Brooklyn Bridge and I said I'm not going to march anyway he says yes we're going to protest police brutality and I say I refuse to go and he said why I Believe in the cause obviously I get it a few what's important I read the newspaper to my friends and I taught\nBut they're going to open the bridge on us or we're going to all fallen and die and so I cry I was not going my parents' dragging into this march three thousand of us were marching over the bridge I'm ball and we get to the other side we're facing off against police officers on horses\nRiot gear and I'm In the front row because my dad's the headmaster and I'm Crying and and all of a sudden he started singing were fired up we can't take no more were fired up we can't take no more and my friends started saying and I start singing and in that moment I sort of I start crying\nI sort of find my footing and\nI guess I found my voice and lifted it I I Want to write books and I think ... is that book that reminds of young people that they got to find their voice they gotta lifted age Thirteen fourteen Fifteen um want to create better adult I think we've got to start with the imagination of our children\nWell then you know that's going to lead me to the final ... to be just Cheney and my guess is coming Alexander we're talking about his new book swing so you're going to read a call now from the book called men in blue\nPolice officers don't say freeze like they do in the movies they just make you freeze interfere cloaked in deep dark ... and they don't look menacing all the time\nSo it looked like they might actually be a little gentle little on the ... side but then there's the gun pinned to their hip that makes their heart that makes your heart pounds so loud your ears burst\nAnd you're not sure what to do or what to say or how to move what if it's the wrong move\nSome looked so stern like they don't have emotions or heart beats read\nBut you wonder if they might smile when they're home with their own families playing with their own kids like the guy in front of me he has no expression but under his straight lips and steely Steyer someone must make them smile someone must make him love ... love somebody you've got to love somebody\nAnd I hope you remember somebody love us too\nHe's got to love somebody I Hope he remembers that somebody loves us to you that is the line that that that stuck out to me more than anything else in his entire collection\nAnd that's I think that's interesting because as I read it I hadn't read that line in a while that's got to be um probably the great impetus for writing this book is reminding the readers is reminding us that we're all matter we all are worth\nWe all are loved we all love we all smiled dance hope\nUm live laugh cry the same it's about embracing that full humanity and it starts with started with love\nAnd that sounds cliche but it is what it is\nI you you you talk a lot about 'em and you can ask a lot about the form of your work\nI don't know why you chose chose to write you choose to write narratives inverse in in poetry\nRight but it's it's really effective um thank you I think\nThe immediacy of it you know the ... the the white space it allows you the reader to take a spiritual journey yeah it's about the words that are there but it's also about the words that aren't there and how and how you imagine that\nUm I think poetry is a great way to get young people engage with literature in a really profound way it's so short you build that confidence you know you you trigger that voice\nSo um this book is so much about love there's one thing we haven't discussed that is also prominent in this book just take a listen to this [noise]\nWas a bomb\nStrange and can involve a\nThey say he wandered very mom oh\nI'm Alexander ... what what is that is that my friend is Nat King Cole singing nature boy [noise] you know that is\nThat is quintessential jazz jazz that's I mean something to write [noise]\nThat phone lose a lot to me why um\nI think because it really represents one again we're getting back to what this book is about as so many layers you started with baseball and talked about love and social justice and and now jazz and went Marcellus talks about How Jazz is like\nReally a metaphor for American democracy it's really a metaphor for democracy you got these\nThree or four or five people you've got a vocalist she got a sexy gotta truck to get a piano you've got percussion and they're all on stage together and they all have their roles and they're creating this music together\nBut at some point the sax player is going to have his time is going to have his solo in everyone's going to sort of step back it doesn't mean they are less than what they're going to give the respect to allow the sax player and then the vocalist is going to come in and do their scat and weather's weather's Ella\nOr or or or or or Nat King Cole and then the trumpet player is going to have their so everyone has to work together but they also have to allow each person to have their individuality\nMan what better way to represent American to represent democracy in our world them through jazz music\nPlus you know I just think it's the coolest music ever [laughter] it just might be love social justice cool baseball jazz I I think I think we've covered all here and we marry Rand has\nWho wrote the book with me we try to tie all that together because we do understand it's a lot of layers would try to title together with a little bit of a a twist at the end\nYou for the book thank you for having Kwame Alexander or his new book is called swing and it's out now that is if you're a

exactly what information they can get from them they believe there is a chance of fingerprints or DNA and that could make a real difference to the investigation\nThat is Washington correspondent Chris book club owned by the politics but also the investigation into those devices [noise]\nSo we're at ... talking to your earlier in the news about that remarkable story from South Africa University students say this invented a brick made using human you are in\nThe process takes place at room temperature avoiding the need for the costly and environmentally damaging kilns which are used to be normal breaks at high temperatures and we have at one of the students here a witness who can tell us more about a\nAbout the research tell us more about what you've discovered\nI I'm Sorry I'm actually not a student on the supervisor all\nThe students forgive me on the giants then\nIt's fine [laughter] so so basically what we we looked at the natural processes to make the break and we use the prices coat and microbial carbonate precipitation so it's essentially the same way that Carl is made in the ocean\nAnd what we do is we use bacteria to remove the calcium carbonate ions from the urine and in that kind of makes cement\nAnd when you when you add the bacteria to a mold of any shape you essentially get a solid off that shape so we first started with little columns and so we solidified his little islands using the prices\nAnd then we moved on to making the ... and that was unveiled two days ago\nSo you were mimicking the natural process ...\n... ... and tell me how he went about doing that because you you use human urine did you ask people to ... to volunteer [laughter] or not even going back to electing Samuels\nSays I actually it's part of a integrated\nPrices are the first stage is we also developed a the world's first fertilizer producing urine and in the urine or we produce a solid for life and then what we do is we remove the liquid component and we used to make it\nSo that's why I always call it a stage prices so the stages we make it like that and then the second stage is we make the brick and the third stage is we make another driver\nSo John Cho Christian object we collect that you're in well we installed our ... year in those in the engineering building a University of\nCape Town and we had some mail Dina's donate their precious urine and from that and we made the brick\nNow I've I've seen the brick obscene brick kilns and reporting stories about ... about how it's made in the damaging effects of it and and they are really really hot now\nThese these breaks don't need to be heated ... heat it up at at toll according to your research and your and your experiments how does it solidify the way the way it does just naturally\nSo essentially what happens is the so the little bacteria or keep on producing a calcium carbonate which is the Senate\nAnd the longer you leave it the most meant they essentially make and what they do not actually face in ... in the sand particles together so when you\nWhen they are the assault dealing as as a as a break because I'm a I'm a normal break\nSo it's just to give you an idea when we first\nStarted this crisis last year we the very first run that we had we achieve the same Congress' ability strength as a forty ...\nAnd then just a few months later we've doubled that strength now just by essentially changing the material that we put into the mold\nAnd then allowing the bacteria to a point we've only for longer with zero heat\nWith their oil at room temperature so any any energy required um\nIt's right on the market there many people find that hard to believe\n[laughter] we have the results that\nHave you actually kind of thing yeah you're on the news or any other any buildings that you've made with these Brits yeah\nUh no no no no it's still very early but um I have to say that we went the first people to come up with the idea of making bricks using\nYou're ... ... that's actually what we take from the urine is way up to the area so there's a company in the U.S ... by a Mason and they use\n\nThe day I but they use in the area and if you know anything about what comes from it's really not a sustainable prices are essentially what they do they take the nitrogen from the ...\nThey use a lot of energy and then they converted into your ear\nAnd when we started this project we we well I knew that for example year and have a lot of area that's on them for an Indian it so I wanted to know whether we could actually the same thing but is that you're in the states are offering them much more sustainable prices\nAnd the short answer is yes we can some now we have to see how we take the sport\nSeventy questions on this my editors just said that does it does stink Dillon I guess it does [laughter] just as well\nOr the ... well\nNo it's so let me just clarify initial prices or what it does is as a byproduct purchases\nAnd its them or any of that going to smell us or if you've ever had the opportunity I guess it's safe for example you had to pick like maybe a cat and Pete in a corner and you have that strong smell them or any of being released\nAnd so those prices produces him as a byproduct but what we want to do is we want to comment on that ... into another ... because he essentially at some nitrogen rich source of potential for drivers so that's the third part of the price of federal was talking about\nSo that's the next days to see if we can think of it back into another\nFertilizer any health risks in this done\nSo I get the health risk so we had to apply for complete ethics approval as you can imagine the university so that was drawn to it\nSo they use it themselves joined ever come in contact with the urine it's it's just like you wouldn't using all year and all the health effects so if if people are concerned with the pathogens and harmful bacteria\nThe prices for using stage one actually kills all on full pathogens actor because we operate at a stream the hockey H we operate a twelve and ... so that ph has been trying to kill pretty much everything\nAnd then what we do we take a liquid component we dropped the ph slightly and then we allow the bacteria that we want to be in the mold and then that's what we use for the brick\nQuite remarkable ... thank you so much for ah for joining us and explaining this to us

going on in the United states yesterday we had the ... news fool the nuts that are down ... as some people I've hundred also extending this roundup ... they've had over the last full night but\nWhat exactly is happening here well he's just ... who's a columnist or brutal Street Journal\nYou have to separate the stock market from the real economy in the U.S because the uh oddity of the ... development over the past couple of weeks the markets are unfolding\nAs the main street economy in America is really booming I mean we've heard a series of phenomenal is strong employment numbers or GDP Growth is very good ah so I think that part of the story here is the is the Federal Reserve who's\nYour very slowly trying to find some way to normalize policy of a lot of\nA priority for the Trump Administration and bank lobbies is to roll back regulations put in place after the crisis and especially what became known as the dark Frank act here's Adam twos both of crashed how it's okay to

mess that level of\nLegal wool fat at the bank has to wage tests are complied with Doug Frank is remarkable that the kind of saying that the Republicans promised is is very likely to make the system less resilient\nAnd his promise to drain the swamp and get rid of the revolving door between Wall Street here in Washington obviously reverse the points to Goldman Sachs banker\nIsn't that no no I mean the sense that Trump was getting to mark any fundamental break a with the incredibly incest Jewish relationship between American politics and about businesses clearly just an illusion\nThat is at

and leadership the truth will emerge well\nAll of this at the showcase F ... event which is meant to spearhead the country's reform process what kind of reform can we now expect from Saudi Arabia given the outcry around Mr ... death\nThat's a theme in today's business daily to name just some of the corporate leaders have public severed their business links with Saudi Arabia and the last few days Richard Branson an his moneys Nelly cruise all of them making clear the costs that Saudi Arabia may have to pay in very real terms for what has happened\nMany others from the will to finance media and politics of also opted to boycott the conference one of those staying away it sets Bannon he's the founding partner of the Silicon Valley seat fund fifty years\nAnd it affected me quite a lot you know at the end of the day we\nWanted to be able to support those positive reforms a buddy became clear that showing up at the future investment negative or would not be taken as a pro reform message but would really send the\nMessage that what was done to gym all was acceptable and that's just not a message that I'm willing to stand\nSo you're sending a message to the Saudis are you're sending a message to the people in the states to invest in you\nKnow I think it's a it's all all around I think that there's an ethical awakening happening in business in general driven largely by millennials\nAre who believe that businesses justifying question of behavior in pursuit of profits is simply not acceptable in Silicon valley more and more entrepreneurs are starting to ask venture capitalists\nAre where does your money come from who are your funders are and we think this newborn awareness is incredibly healthy for the Silicon Valley ecosystem and his incredibly good for the world and it's a trend that we hope continues and we believe that you know while most diplomacy as best left a diplomat that business leaders can have a role to play\nAnd so we hope that this help send the message that Saudi should move in the right direction\nThat will be those who say it's ironic all of this because I haven't been summoned already had a\nA ... an unsavory reputation in terms of the war in Yemen for example the bombardment of that region some of his saber rattling towards some of his Gulf neighbors are and indeed the oppression of journalists especially some women activists in Saudi Arabia itself\n[noise] absolutely I and you know we have not like a lot of what we've seen but it's my belief that you can't judge someone just based on where they are you have to judge them based on where they're going\nAnd considering the culture and values of Saudi and where that country's been I think a lot of the reforms that have been some on have them at that have been very positive and so in terms of the arc of its progress up until recently we've we've lived where it's been going\nSo what are you going to do now\n[noise] well now I'm going to hope that they re committed to the vision twenty thirty towards modernization towards the liberalization and if we see real\nPositive signs that they are doing that and that they're taking seriously human rights that they're taking seriously sustainability that they're taking seriously the rights of journalists enough women a venerable will potentially re engage but until then we're going to be standing on the sidelines\nRight I mean what would that take we would literally take a major gesture such as the release of various human rights campaign is all something specific law that are those would\nBe good for steps I mean I think we have a long way to go in terms of gender equality on the ground in Saudi Arabia would have a long way to go in terms of liberal realizing the cultural norms we have a long way to go in terms of moving the country away from fossil fuels and of course there are a lot of people who are wrongfully imprisoned right now and I think all of those things put together what would be in a very good picture\nIn recent weeks on this program we've been talking about the full thing of businesses to take a stand on gun control for example the position of Nike that it took on the black lives matter movement and the Colin Kaepernick uh\nI'm paying it seems as though more and more companies are being forced to take a stand on political issues where they bats didn't in the past\nAnd I think this is fantastic uh since the Nineteen seventies business has been dominated by this idea called the Friedman doctrine put forward by Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman and the essential idea of it is that the purpose of business any sole purpose of business should be maximizing shareholder value and nothing else\nAnd what we're seeing is that in that way of thinking about business had has led to a huge number of problems when businesses chase proper at the expense of the welfare of their employees at the expense of the society around them at the expense of environment they spent the human rights bad things happen and so we think that there is a real generational shift underfoot that's very good for the world\nSilicon Valley venture capitalists sets ban and so what do we know about the embryonic Saturday reform process he refers to the\nWell not all that much in concrete terms we have had some relatively symbolic changes already best known among them

battle against opioids across the United states that's a question I put to Keith ... he's a professor of psychiatry at Stanford University and served as a drug policy advisor in both the Bush and Obama administrations\nIn the last twelve months drug overdose deaths seem to have been stable in United States but we can do for sure if that means it's getting better because we had a period about five or six years ago where they were flat for about twelve months so we're hoping that's going to turn down but we really don't know\nAt the same time has to be said you know when you're at over Seventy thousand best year I'm being flat would be good enough I mean we really need you know a substantial decrease to feel that we're making a big impact on public health\nAre so remarkable comparison saying that Seventy thousand cigarette is almost as many people who die on the roads and from guns in the United states each year\nYeah it's extraordinary I mean another figure that you know I I sometimes call it to people is since the turn of the century more Americans have died of drug overdose than died in World War one world war two put together\nOh this is the worst epidemic we've seen you know ... it's even worse than age actually the peak in terms of the the amount of death you'd have to go back to the flu epidemics of fifty years ago to find a time where as many people were being cut down in the prime of their lives as we're experiencing right now with opioids and\nAll ... to ... still prescribing some of these drugs\nPhysicians have changed their prescribing significantly in the United states in the last five years but we are still way higher than for example or the u._k. would be I mean we got to a point that we were outstripping Europe by you know factor\nOf six to one per capita and outstripping nations like Japan like thirty five to one way or we have a for profit health care system that\nYou know doctors are paid based on the number of people they churn through and I think prescriptions help you churn through quickly we do not regulate our industries tightly enough and they promoted products like oxycontin is the most famous one\nVery aggressively they pled guilty in federal court to lying about how risky drug was and uh you know I think that sort of corporate lightly regulated way of of regulating pharma and regularly to health care system is a big reason why the U.S has had this explosion of prescription opioid addiction now\nPresident Trump signed into law a new bipartisan bill to try and address this crisis does the government have a grasp of the full extent of the problem now and how much of a crisis it is well\nThe bill or the law was signed yesterday and I worked on that closely with our Congress it does many smart things in terms of covering a care for people who are addicted to opioids through our various insurance programs Medicaid which is focused on lower income people Medicare which is focused on\nOlder Americans but fundamentally we have a very long way to go\nI mean the the bill is allocating you know something like five or ten billion dollars towards this\nProblem uh whereas the White House council of economic advisors estimated the damage of the profit five hundred billion dollars every single year so um we still have not uh you know put the kind of money on the table that we did for age in which was needed to turn the AIDS epidemic around\nAnd uh it's really just going to depend on you know we have an election coming up and who comes in and whether they want to make them more substantial commitment and has been made so far ...\nIs not limited amounts of money going to be able to do ... would you be able to do if you had more\nAh it will have things in it like the overdosed rescued drug ... uh which doesn't remove addiction but certainly saved the person's life and starts they're breathing again will be distributed to example police and firefighters and families and people who use\nOpioids around the country if we'll find some training of professionals who we get more people in the field and know how to take care of addiction\nThere's some interventions for people who are leaving correctional facilities which is a very high risk time for people to ... contrary to stereotype it's actually hard to get heroin in prison and then when you come out you haven't been taking it for a while and your tolerance is lower than are extremely high risk of overdose there's a lot of smart things like that but you know if you really want to\nMake a difference got to make a long term commitment throughout the entire health care system and\nThat would ... rather than saying we're going to have a two year grant programmed to do now locks on or a three year funding stream for treatment of people leaving prison you would just say look addiction is part of human health it has been for all of human history we need to make permanent commitment\nTo have adequate treatment for addiction adequate screening for people when they see their GPA so that we catch a addiction early we need to permanently invest in training doctors how to handle pain properly and
