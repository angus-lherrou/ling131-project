Goldwater wrote to the surface would mix with a warm water and will stay within thirty forty meters\nIsaac says his idea is purely theoretical for now he's crunch the numbers and one company did put pumps off the coast of the meat it to see if they work but he says you need a grid of them and obviously no one's actually tested this in real life conditions\nI think probably the best approach would

every three hundred meters will say\nWait a little bit more so it will be yeah hundred fifty thousand us a hundred and one of them come\nYeah I'd found significant of course but if we could put this

indeed destruction from this weekend in the easiest Saddam he will not trust you enough it appears that's a planned early warning system that could have presented some of the death had not materialized\nSo that as much discussion about other technology now predicting the nominees in the region\nWill further west in in the easier for where we actually had to the west of this we can see it on me as a prototype system that's been underway for a few years now two or three years and this is a system of ocean to taxes and so being honest about them off the coast of\nPot on the capital of West ... province now this is a partnership between universities in Indonesia and outside the country including a academics at the University of Pittsburgh in United States\nFrom wherever just been speaking to the professor Louis ... he's the principal investigator on the porch before we had about the ... I began by asking\nYou about the warning system that's already being put to him and was in use this weekend by the engine easy an agency for a meteorology climatology and geophysics at the B. M. K. gee\nThis weekend ... did have notification from its standard seismic network and they were able to identify the epicenter of the earthquake and the magnitude of the earthquake what they did not have\nWas data regarding the change in the water column that would indicate as the nominee\nThey also had tied gauges but the tide gauges were regular tied gauges that catch the incoming tied\nIn the morning and the outgoing tied in the evening but they were set for every Fifteen minutes so they did not and they're also observational you can see the wave actually almost at the same time that the tide gauges come in\nIndonesia does he have global positioning systems that I Believe there was the only one about two hundred\nKilometers away from the epicenter that would not have covered the area so in fact what being cagey did not have was any measurement for the change in the water column that would indicate us in a\nRow and that's a really important point which brings us on the prices that you'd be working on with other universities in Indonesia over the last few years because this was the assistant ... ocean science is on the ocean floor that would be able to detect changes in the wool to call them and that would give some kind of indication of us in on me\nYes that's exactly what we're working on and we are very advanced in this prototype this is our last year for the project\nBut the prototype does need to be fully installed and tested before it could be approved for adoption and installation implementation and other coastal cities in Indonesia\nRight well let's find out more about the price and so it's a system of sentences and they're able to measure and crush it basically be able to tell the tax changes in the will to call them so that would be the stigma of an oncoming signal me\nBut the really interesting but here is how they communicate with each other because if there's an expensive fiber optic link between the senses that rubs the loan which is a ... how do they communicate with each other\nWell this is a very interesting part and here are ocean engineers are taking advantage of the thermal Klein layer in the ocean waters Indonesia located in stride the waiter\nHas warm equatorial waters and the sound athlete bounces up to the surface and then re frack back down again so sound is able to carry much longer distances underwater in these equatorial waters than elsewhere\nOr just to be sure to stay on here is ... to be like so you're getting this really important writes about water pressure and it's a waste of time trying to communicate with radio waves down that say it's included in the south and that bounces off the surface and back down to the other senses you end up with the ...\nThat would that be right and so the electrical signals that are transmitted as sound are really transmitted from the bottom pressure censored to communication censor\nThat transmits it to another communication center sensors say twenty thirty kilometers away too and now they're they call this a bellhop method and then it is picked up by a cable censor that is capable to ensure station\nAnd I came from a show station up to this act like an eventually to the people who need to have the warning now about ... seconds they just very very crucial but only because we're stuck for time I wonder if you can just go on and tell us about\nHow effective you think this would be on it was approached by people at the moment it's off pot dying off the coast of the ... province\nBut if you can nail this price so I can get it working what difference would it make\nIt makes a huge difference because the undersea the acoustic communication is much less expensive than the surface Louise I'm In and also easier and safer to more secure\nTo maintain so it would be possible for a developing countries like Indonesia\nTo mount and maintain such a a Sunni detection system\nSo that professor Louis ... listening to that bill Thompson and\nIt's impressive to see

Institute for climate impact research who in twenty twelve co authored a study looking at the previous decade of extreme weather events including the European heat wave of two thousand and three so something the climate model stern and the school she rushed him some of twenty ten\nI guess around twenty ... twenty eleven\nClimate scientists more and more worried about links between climate change and extreme weather and actually that's where we're already seeing changes and extreme weather you know with with one of his papacy contributed to that discussion actually showing that especially heat waves but also hedging rainfall events\nAre strongly increasing to climate change and that this was already a mini detectable into observational data we have\nWith just a few years hindsight's didn't

this year analysts like Freddie also are defecting them as they happen ... outfit will win attribution examines the European heat wave fixing on seven European cities including doubling you tracked\nIf you want to find out what the role of climate change in that heat wave and to what extent it has been made more likely or less likely you need to find out how likely is the heat wave that is happening in the well we live in today and so for example in Dublin it's about a one in seven years and then\nAnd then we ask what would the likelihood of this heat wave occurring me and it well without end to the climate change and then the case of Dublin ... it's now with the climate change about twice as likely as would have been laid out and to pretend that climate change\nWhereas for example in Copenhagen they land was made five times more likely buy into the getting a climate change\nThe story was more complicated in Finland where temperatures have over thirty degrees were busting the records they seem surprising and according to the world where the attribution study that might be to remain that way\nThe further north so into to finish places we looked at we\nFound that it's much much of it right then and the well we live and say I was in the south on one and then it was at least in one Ninety year then and then the other one it was about a hundred and forty years then\nSo it was a match rare event but we could actually not quantify the effect of climate change because the observations in these places are all over the place and so you're uncertainties that much higher layers in this house climate change actually make this a relatively common event\nAs funny explains the study was based on a mixture of where the dates and climate modeling this is the emerging former says Andy ... who you heard briefly earlier and who's currently putting together the latest of the American meet your old school societies annual extreme weather analyses\nSo the comparisons that are generally made are made between our current climate where we are now in a climate before humans began to exert an effect on the climate system\nSo what we tend to do is we run parallel experiments we run experiments where where simulating the earth as we see it right now\nAnd we run another parallel experiment which we simulate the earth before we have climate change okay so what we do there and stimulating before climate changes we make estimation of what we think the climate may have looked like\nPrior to humans producing in effect and we compare those those sets of simulations to one another and then we say OK events either happened more frequently or more intense or none of the above and the current climate relatives to that parallel simulation of the past climate\nThe American Meteorological Society approaches methodical and cautious with analyses being invited from wills explicitly off to the U.S has finished and then with cycles are reviewing number crunching to

stream or will be called storm tracks so the jet stream that's based on by the temperature difference between alone let that go to the sub topics at high latitudes towards the Arctic so the optics of

been collaborating with them ... in studying how Arctic warming is changing the north of where the parents and\nThat's actually what creates the jet during this band a very strong winds from the west in the upper part of the atmosphere that Trump is fear that we live in those strong wins arise because of the north south contrast in temperature and if you reduce those contracts you can slow down the jet stream\nOr you can slow it down what that means that you no longer have that strong jet stream that's there to take those weather systems and move them along so they're more likely to linger\nThis is a study and we have done a couple of years ago and we showed the debts in summer the jet stream as weekends and the particular\nThese stolen threats if we can do that is important because these stone strikes at a very moderating effect on the weather conditions over a particular Europe but in general over in the mid latitudes over the last regions of the reason is nice weather systems are generated\nOver the ocean over the Atlantic triple torched it used to what Europe\nOr they have relatively wet Arab relatively mild temperatures that for the according effects on continental temperatures so he's got thrown was weakening\nYou have less of that cooling effect and that's safe for us to build up of hot and dry conditions over the confidence uh this is yeah we've seen quite pronounced changes in that's weakening of the weather systems\nThat favors to build up of holds dry extremes as we've seen for example this year\nBut the weakening has an even more dramatic effect I think if it is a slack inning\nWith the wind driven more slowly it's more likely to be diverted and increasingly all with a full costs like pizza show or launch we lines sneaking north south around the north pole this is the jet stream being pushed around by global conditions and it internist hearing on whether in more alarming directions\nYou know in one region the jet stream moved north what's it brings warm air hopes of topical regions far north that creates ferrets\nI'm temperature is a region slight Siberia\nAnd at the same time they just where the jet stream been self what's it brings in there for you ought to all the way self correcting relatively cold conditions so what'd you tend to see if you have to weigh the jet stream you tend to see\nAlternating nominees recall them off warm and cold regions and that's the kind of a very regular pattern around the globe and that that we saw it and do the two thousand eighty\nAnd the particular version of this wave that Muslims Tim ... is called ... treat wave residents where these we'd go take up more and more energy become more and more looked into place for ... this year it did happen\nIt did happen in the summer twenty Eighteen was an example we know this isn't published yet but if you look at whether diagnostics it becomes apparent that this phenomenon of planetary wave residents was playing out\nAnd that's why we saw this sort of global coherence it wasn't just one particular region that was seen extreme weather we were seeing extreme flooding extreme drought extreme heat of course and these are wild fires breaking out in these hot dry areas\nOr around the entire northern hemisphere in that corresponds and the fact that we had very large low pressure systems very large high pressure systems that were basically staying in the same locations day after day it is a classic planetary wave residents settled\nAnd it's not just the heat waves that were affected by the fixed cars from a jet stream waves\nWhere there's a high a big high in one place that means downstream there's going to have to be a big low because it's a way because high low high low high low with those peaks and drops and that means that when the western and central us had that big high pressure system the eastern us here in Pennsylvania where I live\nHad this low pressure system that sat there again for weeks on end and it was one of the wettest summers that we've had because we were stuck under one of those lows\nNow here's something else in the eastern us and in the southeastern us where we had a tendency for that low pressure system and there was a lot of rainfall and it was really wet and then we got hit by Florence that means the soils we're already saturated and many of these locations\nFrom a very wet summer and then all of a sudden you dump a whole lot more rain it's got nowhere to go the soils saturated that means you it's got nowhere to go but to flood the surface which is what we saw\nPlanetree wave residents is a new plant in the discussion of global warming is not fully incorporated into the models it may not be the game change it currently looks to be research into that will needs to be developed but if it is and Arctic warming is the driver and the news from the always caps not good\nWe find it very strong linear relationship between global warming or global CEO to emissions and to see a decline in the Arctic and we see it in summer but we also see it in all months of the year that's really strong relationship and what that shows is that there's a really dominant mechanism of\nRadioactive warming from increasing the greenhouse gases and that is the overriding factor\nIn terms of a long term trend of the ice change in the Arctic\nAnd and our two thousand sixteen paper we computers that for every metric tons of year too that's added to the atmosphere you lose three square meters of sea ice and this relationship seems to hold both in the observations but also we see the same kind of the new relationships and Clinton lotta forecasts\nBut the models tend to be showing a slower rate of sea ice last per increasing CEO to\nWhich leads us to believe that when we look at our future forecasts of CIA conditions from climate models that there'd be conservative and that actually will probably be seeing an ice free Arctic in summers much sooner than what the motives are forecasting so according to our calculations if this linear relationship or to hold\nOver the next Twenty years we would see an Arctic Ocean that would become ice free first in September but with more CEO to it also start becoming ice free in August in October and it sort of extending out from there and which here in about Twenty years\nIf this is going to go by indeed and he was a policy is that\nHas to be very alarming climate scientists are currently meeting in Korea to debate what the world might look like if nations do manage to keep average global warming below one point five

close and now he was actually getting me unfortunately around and all the while I'm thinking he's not supposed to be lots of lots of lots of hostile\nMe and he let me why I think I've been pushing around widely thinking now to that's now\nOff the moon's does as recent interviews to other women from Bollywood have also spoken about sexual harassment some or hoping the me too movement will not come to prominence in India a South Asia at a time but our son ... is\nHit in the newsroom studio so ... is the extent of the allegations and what's going to happen with the investigation\n... above

was living in the United states for the past few years probably as she was talking about it and she got inspired by this me too movement\nBut neglect contest the widespread idea that this coalition government from twenty ten to twenty Fifteen imposed austerity\nAs it happens the extent to which the coalition government was accused of imposing austerity is often wildly over done not least by our critics on the left actually a public spending not least because of interventions from me stopping George Osborne the treasury going for a public spending as a proportion of GDP\nBy the end of the coalition government with three percent higher than the average on the ... the government\nThe coalition government reduce public spending ten billion pounds in its first yeah emphasizing the dangers associated with the debt burden and such about reducing the government deficits which is the difference between what governments raised and what they spend mainly through cussing expenditure\nBy twenty Fifteen the deficit have been reduced to half of what it was when the coalition came to power and subsequently the conservative government has confirmed its commitment to a balanced budget\nFor many this looks and feels like self imposed austerity\nWages in economic growth over the last ten years have been the weakest they have been since Eighteen twelve the Napoleon's invasion of Russia\nThe average pay package projected for twenty twenty two is still likely to be twenty pounds a week lower than before the crisis\nProductivity growth which reflects improvements in the value of

lasting impact on social cohesion and politics\nTen years later I mean you don't have to realize how big this was by putting this in perspective in ten years later we're happy that we kind of back to the pre crisis levels dishes you know talking about a lost decade this was the mother of all those decades you know\nAcross the advanced economies the political consequences of us there have been rising public anger and support for extreme policies wage growth in the advanced economies ten years off the crisis is still quotes of what it was before\nThis crisis was unusual as for the first time since the great depression eight years before it started in the advanced economies but its impact was global\nThe share of children living in ... households increased by over ten percent in countries as diverse as island Croatia lack fear Greece the U.S and in Mexico\nI asked I agree uh it was the Mexican minister of economy about the impact on his country of the financial crisis\nOh we had a very serious impact because uh the girl just evaporated worm a mid sized very open economy depending very crucially on trade and investment flows and of course a country where the level of savings was not enough\nSo it needed the savings from abroad meaning foreign direct investment it also needed that technology et cetera and all these flows which were part and parcel of our daily life stopped cold\nAnd of course a country like Mexico suddenly of course felt this impact it was very harsh very hard the impact was very serious and we still living with the consequences\nPut people have less savings and their families and friends are less able to support them and poor countries are less able to provide welfare and other benefits\nThe impact of the crisis was filtered through the in Africa too and goes the country was that was the minister financing Nigeria off to serving is managing director of the world bank\nWe were struggling with the food crisis Sunday you had this and the impact I think with three or four transmission can know what was the that private capital flows that was ... flows that flight to safety that means that the invest us now felt\nVery risk of a sudden they will withdraw their money to places that thought with they've they had the transmission canon of trade\nAnd trade volume fell dramatically so does developing countries that didn't matter of fact ... says it says ... drop in volume of demand for their products which are plus rebounded on the economy then you had an impact on commodity prices that was another channel\nAnd in Africa you know many countries that still at sport in primary on Monday the so you sell prize is a a Monday This from oil gas to\nAgricultural goods to metal\nFalling and in fact the price of oil is I thought if I recall correctly fell dramatically from about ... forty four dollars a barrel to about thirty eight dollars within a very short period of time and really unmanageable lunch\nOil exports is such as Nigeria lose out when prices go down on imports is such a South Africa Tanzania save money\nAnd goes the highlights another impact of the crisis which is that just reduced opportunities for migrant workers to send money back home\nThese remittances from rich to developing countries amounted to three hundred and fifty six billion dollars in two thousand and eight three times greater than aid flows by two thousand nine fifty billion dollars lower\nCountries is to that remittances from that people working in developed countries and because a developed country economy's less struggling I'm going into recession\nCourse jobs do at impact that and people were not\nSend them back normally remittances resilient in all kinds of crisis like this time there was an impact\nThat the financial crisis caused immense hardship is indisputable and poverty increases as a result in many countries not least in Africa\nThe response of governments the crisis mastered enormously\nA massive stimulation package meant that China was relatively immune as well as India which are largely insulation itself from the vagaries of global financial markets\nThis meant the Asia was least influenced by the crisis in Japan and Korea and as a result it gained enormously economically politically and in terms of confidence\nThat has been as you note rising cultural confidence in Asia India ability to take care of their own societies and or the global financial crisis gave a set up with a sense almost like an explosive bussed\nIn the cultural self confidence of the issues because they say hey maybe we are doing

engineer\nWas the depression that he suffered was not linked to the ... the rules of the things that he could do which he was no longer able to do\nThat was certainly part of it he wasn't able to work and he was of a generation and temperament that a lot of his identity did come from his work and one other Asian dynamic that is often the case is a shame\nAnd in Asian contacts shame based context you don't talk about things like depression you don't talk about things like mental illness or struggles in general because that would bring shame upon your family and then the irony afterwards is that the families left behind them themselves also feel shame\nTell us about the the phone call that you know the unforgettable day\nIt was a Thursday morning before work was surprised who would be

my mother and she said\nDad he killed himself that he killed himself and it didn't register at first to daddy daddy who my daddy and uh she just kept on crying and then there was a neighbor who was

reading the clarinet that he was teaching himself how to play it\nIt was a practice of remembrance in any way as a as we were looking at the Mentos and my father's life to remember\nThe things he had done a who he had been because I think when a suicide happens we're mostly focusing on the immediacy of the death the horrible way that that the life ended so it was good to take a step back and to remember my dad's larger life and that his story is not just in the method of his how he died\nWho judges a book by the last paragraph in a two hundred Ninety page novel your employers didn't contribute flowers or the funeral they give it was something rather more interesting is adjust your support for you\nThey sent us a tree and we were a little bemused at that thing a tree what would we do with the tree and in indoors kind of tree in a pot but we really appreciate it and that it continue to live\nIt wasn't cut flowers I Would dry off and die but it was a tree that had ongoing life

Facebook friend has uploaded a picture of them to Facebook that people are almost incapable of resisting the temptation to look um and that sort of tweak that just minor behavioral nudge turned out to be um really hugely important to the growth of Facebook\nNow Facebook is in a lot of trouble these days because of data breaches it its role in elections but you're right that some form or Facebook executives are voicing doubts about the company's role for other things are exacerbating isolation outrage addictive behaviors you know give us an example [noise] this is a big\nChange for Facebook traditionally it's former executives have been silent they leave the company and and very often don't say much about it starting last year\nSean Parker who is Facebook's first president he's sort of well known Silicon Valley figure um gave an interview in which he said that as he put it he's become a conscientious objector to social media a said God Knows what it's doing to our children's\nBrains and and then a few days later there was another very prominent former Facebook executive named ... who had been the head of growth and vice president of user growth which was an absolutely central position at the company for a number of years and he came out and said\nYou know in the back of our minds we all had a sense that something might be going wrong that our product the thing that we were building I'm paraphrasing here was as he put it contributes to the breakdown of social discourse the breakdown of society and he said he would never let his children use this kind of\nProduct I think because the public face of the company has been so on message about how they contribute in their minds to doing good in the world to have some very senior former executive come out and talk about what the public has come to believe which is that there are these very serious side effects\nTo the company's growth was a real wakeup call externally and I think somewhat internally\nYou talk to ... a fair amount about this you know pushing the boundaries of privacy to grow that is he regard this kind of experimentation\nWell he absorbed a central belief early on in his career and I think it's become just key to understanding why he's made choices that he has an and some of the mistakes that he has which is that he\nDecided early on that he was very often going to be criticized he said look this is just a fact of what we do it he said look we're not selling dog food here we're doing something inherent intensely inherently controversial it's at the intersection of psychology and technology and\nSo when people criticize Facebook for being [noise]\nUm too casual about their privacy for allowing data to get out of the world I'm very often what he came to believe was that they would criticize him at the time but it overtime eventually they would accept that they would get used to it and they would keep signing on they would keep growing\nAnd that idea about criticism really hardened and became a central governing principle at Facebook the sense that they were\nLeaders they were pioneers they were forging ahead they had to push the public beyond its comfort zone when it came to being\nLess private because if they didn't do it then people wouldn't wouldn't go there but they were convinced that even in the cases of controversy when you had\nA civil libertarians or regulators or politicians ordinary members of the public complaining about Facebook that that was simply a sign that they were being bold and that idea continued really until until the present day\nYeah is it true that in two thousand ten he said privacy is no longer a social norm he\nDid and it caused a big uproar at the time or he said look this is a generational difference we don't feel\nThe same way about privacy that our parents and grandparents did and people so that's ... that's wild that's not right privacy is built into the very nature of the United states and it's really embedded in the bill of rights and\nUm his belief was that it was as ... as it was often described an antique and that we needed to push people further there was in in the early days of Facebook there was a\nA ... a phrase that was bandied about called radical transparency the idea that you had to be aggressively transparent in order to be modern this the sense was as one person to put 'em\nIn the future because of Facebook and other things like it that were exploding the boundaries of privacy that extramarital affairs would become impossible people couldn't hide things like that they could no longer hide\nTheir lives outside of work from their lives and work and they believe that to be a virtue the sense that there would be this fusion the union of our private cells in our public solves\nBut that put them at odds with the public and and the key fact I think was that over and over again Mark Zuckerberg believed that being at odds with the public was not assigned you were doing something wrong it was a sign that you were doing something innovative and they're\nThey're monitored their motto of course became move fast and break things and that motto really captured the way that they see the world that\nAlmost like redefining what it is to be him on [laughter] [noise]\nYeah they believed that this that this tool Facebook had that kind of power and and and they came to being at a time in Silicon Valley where were you had this almost messianic\nSense of ambition this belief that that you weren't just building computer applications you were actually building tools
