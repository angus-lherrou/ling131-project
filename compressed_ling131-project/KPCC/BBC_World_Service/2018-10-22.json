couple of reasons number one reason is equally wants to spend money it doesn't have the second reason is that would break the rules in the eurozone about how much debt you're allowed to have so you might remember earlier in the year is really had an election\nA couple of new parties formed a coalition and both parties made a lot of spending promises to get elected now they're in power and trying

these they have and the colors and the and the hair and so on and the skills and and the genetics I think most of most of that is is sort of wildly off\nFor no use for racial distinctions and differentiate actions can be made no I don't think so not for biological weapons as we were all such a mishmash mishmash and\nThe ... and and we are human beings except next to this way um I think many people think this they think that as it were in fourteen Ninety two when Columbus set off\nThere were these four or five major population centers East Asian South Asian European African and a\nA former Indian population and they had been there for very long time not mixing with anyone until the quote unquote pure and then they were sort of pure and separate isn't the mound it off from one another and then uh uh with the ... the sort of age of exploration and so on suddenly all these things all mixed up that's just not what happened\nUm who is being as as a biologist with the gene flow genes and people and the genes have been traveling all the time and we none of this because we know that Alexander the great six thirty thousand people you know across great sway the measure we know the gang has gone to people grow grapes ways of the world and so on but that turns out to have happened many times and\nWe read and I understand that but I guess in that in in that sense he is where\nIt's difficult for me to see how the the the well researched a public intellectual lose you connect with the ordinary let's say black person living in southern Mississippi\nWhose life experience tells him there is such a thing as race and he is a victim of racist attitudes and systemically racist society or what not meaning is your message that race is a false constructs have for him or her\nWell I don't think I I I wouldn't start with that with that person in that situation though if they wanted to talk to me more I Would point out that there the the way they're treated that\nBecause of the way they look doesn't predict how they would be presented in lots of other parts of the world so that way you are in a particular place in a race can have a very specific meaning which is why I Would not say there aren't any races but there are racial identities and those racial identities are shaped by the way people think\nNot everywhere but in particular places so in Mississippi right now uh the distinction between black and white people is extremely clear on the ... remains the case that this significant differential treatment by the by the government by other people and so on a in that place\nThough there are going to be people even in Mississippi or how to place or they're going to be people who have say one African ancestor or four generations that go with the rest of the European\nWho might be thought by some people to belong in the back side in Mississippi and by others to be on the white side so the the boundaries aren't going to be clear even in the place I mean the city but the consequences of being on one side or another those are as clear as as as anything\nAnd that's why you can't draw a from a from the fact that there aren't any race and you can't draw from that the conclusion that racial identity as a matter they matter enormously\nBut insisting that they aren't real I'm pointing out that they're created by these forms of behavior by these beliefs when he was a false that's why the what's called the lies that by but what what created\nThe same approach to religion or creed as as you call that on presumably to sort of gender\nPolitics good again under class policy so in essence what you're saying if I may say something this I don't mean to sound ribs and fairly simple in the way you were saying that\nYou know people in power which particularly in the nineteenth century which is a very important century for all of us were white men basically constructed a whole series of different frameworks in which they could explain ... their own power yes\nI mean I don't think they would clear that that's what we're doing a if they'd been clear about what they were doing it wouldn't have been so easy to do is much easier to do these things well known or accepting that that's what you're doing but\nI Do think we are living with a legacy of these forms of transportation and I do think that all of them have serious mistakes built into the witch hunt with this untangling it\nAt the end of this untangling will still be men and women and the few people in the world who how to testify is either that was still the people who in Mississippi or lack for all practical purposes that will still be people who are Protestant and Catholic in Northern Ireland\nBut I think we can we is important in trying to respond to the problems\nAssociated with this identities ends or to the good things that are associated with it and this is it's better to be clear about how they're actually made\nBut do do you find
