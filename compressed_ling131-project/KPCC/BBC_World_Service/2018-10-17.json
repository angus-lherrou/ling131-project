like you know I'm not I'm not a sense grew I'm not Radiohead I'm I'm a guy who write songs and uh\nAnd that's what I messed up so I think I'm kind of ... you know sort of rested back into that that comfortable place\nIt's it's beautiful I Love that you say you're not the most fashionable part of the industry right now but I mean I but I think ultimately that's going to that's what that's what people want I Want you to be honest about stuff yeah right I Want you to write songs that well they can smell the U.S you know yeah and\nSo I I think uh I mean I don't ... and you can't you can't know or expect what people that don't respond to anything so why not just put up the most honest thing possible and see if you know at least if it if it doesn't work then you know that you you did your best\nMaybe just tuning in speaking with iconic west coast singer songwriter who of iron that'd be like the the the lines on the script they made you say that when you've been around six years of them\nHad yet a west coast singer songwriter day magazine about his new album more or less which is out in November second how\nDo you find toying with the youngsters how many you got now too I've got to a five and nearly two and um it's hard you know he took some time off the air I didn't see around as much as I wasn't too much yeah I I mean I we're this is our first Canadian Turin four years\nOh my God yeah with the last Canadians who was in February of twenty Fifteen so if it I mean I just I'm so excited that um you know there's a there's been playing with new guys\nI made the record in Los Angeles with new players um there's a new chapter in my life you know and it's the sort of\nA you know if I made the analogy of jumping head first into a swimming pool now like my head as kind of come up above the surface and I'm like well yeah I'm a person I'm not just the debt I'm Wondering avid of this whole other than it is it's hard to tour\nYeah of course yeah I Know and you know face time helps I don't know how they did it and like the sixties you know like a Charlie Parker whatever's calling home once a month on\nMy own my my dad was Charlie [laughter] I haven't seen him in six months ago um they you know but it's not\nThe same and you also you're leaving you're supposed to you know to do all that work and and it is hard work to tour and it's it takes a toll it's an energetic sort of spiritual\nExhaustion on on the road but it's um you know it's a lot taking care of two kids and my wife works to\nYou know so she it's it's a lot to get a ... story just invented all his dad his Barney been totally tell tells the story about his dad came home for you guys he put this on line so I think I can tell it as a that he came home from the ... came up from their dad came home from the road one time and he walked in the door and lay down his guitar in a suitcase and he said\nI'm tired [laughter] and Justin's mom went oh you're tired or yeah or you know you're sleeping give you back roads [laughter]\nYou understand you've just gone for three months\nSo yeah I mean there's the it's like a beautiful thing where you come home and you'd be your your feel sick because the landing was rough for something in the plane and then you're on your phone and the taxi and you just feel terrible and you haven't eaten in your breath smells and you walk in the door and just get handed a baby you know like a kiss on the cheek Leo nice to see a here's a baby you know he's got a booby diaper go for it\nYou're you're right yeah you got to do it yet or if it's a habit that being a father do we hear that on this record\nBig time and actually to be honest I it it was a weird thing is is not the sexiest topic you know Parenthood or father now that are providing or anything like that [noise]\nUm and strangely I that made it really exciting for me to write about because I felt like there was an untapped kind of area of songwriting and of course I'm sure that some people have done that but I'm the record very much lyric we I think there is like sort of two opposing forces there's\nUm you know here here I Am resurfacing as an artist and and who am I now that I've had these kids and I\nYou know I spend more time with domestic bubble than I Do out in the world\nAnd then the other thing is like what are we going to do\nLike what are we going to do with this world and what kind of world or my kids growing up but they must they must keep you up of course yeah I mean it's it's it's a jarring world and and I've made you know the worst thing you can do is like start is like open Twitter at twelve o five at night you know because that's like one thirty and you've just been reading about the most terrible stuff\nGoing on and all of the world like twenty forty and your kids are out down the hall asleep right yeah and you know during the mathematics case will be like twenty two and you know and oh my God oh my word I go that's gets just be finishing college in the world ends okay oh my gosh\nBut you know at the same time that song you know as I use the line I feel the Bolden the newsprint on some level\nI feel an enemy maybe this is just an aisle or maybe this is like me just sort of like sugar coating it but\nThe than the headlines have generally been and bold forever mhm you know\nHow that might have a song or I I I hear the bowl I feel the bolt in the news\nYeah right yeah and uh and I think that we're in this sort of state of like inflation of urgency so it's like OK yesterday's Twitter posts was that the world so we need something more juicy than that because people are used to world sending tweets now so other words ending sooner than we thought oh no you know and so like there's this sort of\nThis and and the the the more intensely we sort of a [noise] I don't consume the world's pain the more we have an appetite for it and the more we're desensitized to it for us to take more and more of it on\nBut this has been talking about some pretty serious things keep things that keep you up at night but we started this interview by you saying I feel like this is the warmer lady said last album was colder and only assume that this album is warmer so how did that squarely how does this sort of existential and environmental crisis going on and make its head it's like a log\nInto the air saying here's here's where I'm at guys like I've I'm like I Am tweaking out here in this world it's a it's a joy to record it is a joy for rent and you know what it's tender and it's um there's ... there's an earnest ... to it that I think was maybe not in my previous records [noise]\nUm and the production is a simultaneously kind of the most experimental and also the most approachable of any of my records that nothing gets in the way of the song or the melody or the lyric\nUm but at the same time there's a lot of sort of like bizarre identify an ... an identifiable noises it's not like a typical singer songwriter record 'em and that really excites me that lives in this sort of space for its it doesn't sound exactly like other things and yet it's you know here are some songs yeah and part is the\nCore and it's about real troubling things about Parenthood about the environment but yet somehow still happy\nRecord yeah and I think that maybe like that's you know I if I felt at all like not that I had anything to do with it but if I felt at all like putting a club meds which is all about this this topic world we were heading into maybe this is sort of ... but what about you know I just want more warm\nIn the world and the ethics are coming in thank you so much stuff ... men brand new mountains called more or less is app November second\nThat is it for you today tomorrow is the day I don't know if you've heard that marijuana is

list of achievements but for over Twenty years Eleanor Roosevelt did write a popular column that advised Americans on everything from the feasibility of interfaith marriages to the wisdom of the north Atlantic packed some of these columns have just been collected in a book called if you ask me and our book critic Maureen car again has a review\nAs an advice columnist Eleanor Roosevelt was not especially witty nor psychologically acute\nUnlike many of today's inspirational life coaches Eleanor didn't invite her readers to accompany her on extended journeys of introspection\nIndeed when a questioner wrote to her in Nineteen forty four asking what does the president said to you when he proposed Eleanor firmly drew the curtains over that intimate subject by replying there are some things in life which one should be allowed to keep to oneself\nBut one of the things Eleanor did have going for her as a counselor and dispenser of practical wisdom was the fact that she was so real\nShe clearly was not performing nor winking at her readers and she certainly wasn't checking in with the PR team before weighing in on questions ranging from the death penalty anti\nBirth control pro and how soon a widow might begin dating again after the loss of a ... husband\nHeavens above Eleanor explained in a column in Nineteen forty six you can decently be seen with other men whenever you feel like going out again this is your life\nOnce upon a time in America ordinary people turn to Eleanor Roosevelt for advice\nAnd does these columns that test she repaid their trust with responses that are downright startling to read today because of how seriously she took even their most mundane problems\nEleanor is advice column was cold if you ask me and it ran first in the ladies' home journal and then ... calls magazine from Nineteen forty one when of course she was still first lady to her death in Nineteen sixty two\nA selection of those columns has just been published in a book also called if you ask me edited by Eleanor Roosevelt scholar Mary Jo banker\nAs with anything Eleanor you have to wonder where she found the time to be a regular magazine columnist in addition to among other things writing her syndicated newspaper column called my day\nHolding weekly White House press conferences traveling around the country on behalf of new deal programs and answering some estimated one hundred and thirty thousand letters a year as first lady\nThe America that emerges through this Twenty years sampling of Eleanor advice column is it once familiar and very long gone\nWe're still wrestling of course with arguments over civil liberties national health care the electoral college and institutionalized racism and sexism\nEleanor gamely weighed in on those hot button topics but then there are a whole slew of other letters here that come out of an America so earnest it almost seems like the product of a work of speculative fiction\nImagine being a young woman in Nineteen forty nine and feeling that it was okay to write to Eleanor Roosevelt to ask do girls who refused to neck ever get married\nOr the Nineteen year old boy in Nineteen forty six who's already a veteran of World War two who asks Eleanor if he's too young to marry his sweetheart\nEleanor uncharacteristically waffle on that one\nAlthough she was by nature and upbringing emotionally reticent Eleanor sometimes responded to the genuine need of her questioners with an openness that was rare then and almost unimaginable now\nIn Nineteen fifty four Eleanor received this letter that reads my sister eats her heart out about mistake she made bringing up her oldest boy\nShe thinks you are in great woman Mrs Roosevelt and I wish you could tell her a few mistakes you think you made when your children were growing up\nEleanor wrote along response that in part contain these raw admissions I gave in and allowed one of my sons to be sent to boarding school I did not have the courage to fight the family tradition it was a serious mistake on my part\nI did too little for my three older children personally when they were babies\nAs trivial a cultural artifact as an advice column may seem to be Eleanor is if you ask me columns reveal multitudes about the extraordinary relationship she forged with her fellow Americans of all races young and old\nThere's something very democratic about this twenty plus year monthly conversation of sorts that Eleanor conducted on the pages of popular women's magazines people felt they had a right to contact Eleanor and she felt she had a responsibility to respond\nAnd all those seriousness was her hallmark as an advice columnist I also get the feeling that writing these columns and consequently being more connected to the lives of everyday Americans gave Eleanor great joy\nMarine Corps again teaches literature at Georgetown University she reviewed if you ask me essential advice from Eleanor Roosevelt edited by Mary Jo
