{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "And it's true to of women who have abortions\n'em when they are told they've done something wrong it's your fault you should have known better you got yourself into the situation\nYou hear that enough and you start to believe it you see it in the air around you and in the media around you and you start to think maybe I Am a terrible person and that's what keeps these women from speaking out\nAnd it is truly my hope that this book\nEncourages women who have had an abortion to normalize it to tell someone that had happened and tell them why\nOne out of four women has an abortion over the course of their lifetime that's a lot of women and that's a lot of stories\nJudge Judy Pico um you you mentioned Brett Kavanaugh there and you mentioned the it's a week it's been going on in the U.S right now I mean Brett Kavanaugh ends up on the Supreme Court I don't want to see what he will do but it's possible that he could end up passing the deciding vote to overturn roe v way the decision right that effectively legalized abortion in the U.S in Seventy three\nHow does a fuel for you to be talking about this book right\nNow with the debate this record so church right now [laughter]\nUm it's in a way it is liberating because I have a lot of anger inside of me right now [laughter] and I am able to go out and speak to seven hundred people a night and encourage them to remember that women matter and that women's stories matter\nAnd being able to say that every night is very healing but this is a real threat\nAnd if Kavanaugh winds up being confirmed\nAnd rosy way it is overturned what most likely will happen is that abortion will go back to the state level in America we currently have seven states that have a single abortion clinic Mississippi is one of them if we overturn roe versus Wade and and it does go back to the states those seven states that have one clinic those clinics are gone totally gone\nFor you for judge Kavanaugh says that he considered you will be ready to be settled quote settled law is that enough for you\nKnow based on what he said in the past I Do not think that she would hesitate to try to overturn it drew\nTo because we've we've been spending a lot of time talking about the individual can have someone who opposes your views or the empathy you have to have wild watching someone else's views and how it all comes together on the lens reproductive rights in in a spark of light are you hearing from people who are angry about this book\nSo here's the thing if you read the book what most people are saying that they're shocked at how balanced it is right and if you don't read my off there is no you really don't know what I Believe\nWhich is awesome it means I did a very good job [laughter] um I had the privilege of being a pod cast a with Jen Hyatt have maker she is an evangelical Christian with the giant following in the south\nAnd she asked me to come on and talk about this book and we'll wait conversation even though she does not believe what I Believe\nBut it was really fun to model what a conversation like that could look like and I have heard from so many of her listeners who've said wow that really gave me a lot of food for thought one of the things that I talked about and that pod cast was the fact that\nYou know if we really want to talk about how to come together given that I think we will never agree on this topic um there are things we can do that have nothing to do with roe versus Wade and of course one of the first things to look at is the fact that if you want to reduce the abortion rate just don't get pregnant right so let's talk about contraception\nAnd yet people who are pro life are very often anti contraception and that's a confounding thing to me it's a bit of a ... because\nI I Would think that contraception has very little to do in my mind with\nA baby and saving the life of a human being to me it's more about controlling women sexuality\nAnd I stated that on the podcast and I received a letter from a woman who said you know you wanted to talk to someone who is both pro life anti contraception and I would love to be that person and we had this fantastic email exchange\nUh she sent me a snippet from the Vatican bioethics quarterly that had a study in it that was done by the ... Institute saying that there is no correlation between increased contraception and falling abortion rights and I was like wow I never saw anything like that and so I dug up the study and I read the whole thing\nAnd what I realized was that the the quarterly the Catholic quarterly had a cherry picked a sentence or two but had not gone on to finish the rest of the paragraph which explains why that happened and how within months they did see a correlation\nAnd so I sent her to the entire study along with other ones that I had read and she was like oh my gosh I never would have thought that they would do that that's really interesting I Can't wait to read these other pieces and then she went on to explain to me that\nHer for her her decision about not using anything but natural family planning was a choice that was how she saw it and I was like well you know I can get behind that\nSo we had a really great give and take and I've enjoyed every minute of it\nBut I but I think needless to say no not everyone can appreciate the new law says what you're describing people people who are fans of your previous books might just say well I heard your Jody Pico wrote a book about abortion and I'm Wondering if there are you worried about readers turning their back on you a little bit over this this this book\nI'm not because if you're going to turn your back without reading the book then I think you're making a mistake if you read the book I think you will be very pleasantly surprised to find how even handed it is and then if you want to have a conversation with me about it I Would be delighted to talk to you\nBut if you're going to shut it out without even giving it a chance then I think that says more about you than it does about me as a writer I Will always make a promise to my readers to not tell you what to think and to show all sides of a situation fairly and that absolutely exists and the spark of like\nI'm In Jody ... by the way thanks so much for talking to me about it uh before we before we say goodbye and the book is is about abortion you've written stories about racism about school shootings about medical ethics about white supremacy all kinds of sort of moral dilemmas that humans can have why why are these the kinds of stories you like to tell\n[noise] because ah it's twofold I Am gravitating towards them because they worry me\nIt's what keeps me up at night that usually makes a great book and I think that the act of writing it for me is similar to the active reading it for you I have to Wade through all sides of an issue and really ask myself why do I believe what I Believe is that valid\nAnd I think that's a great exercise for any human being frankly when when it comes to any controversial topic um the other thing is that I really believe in the power of fiction\nTo subtly change minds\nVideo where you see the fiction is a great way to suddenly change mines is that what you set out to do to to change the readers mind\nI set out to make the reader question themselves that's all you may not change your mind reading one of my books and that's totally okay as long as you've listened to what the other side has to say\nThat if you go thanks so much for talking to me my pleasure appreciative Jody ... new book is called a spark of light is out now\nThat is it for ... to find us on Twitter at CBC Radio acute you

disorders which is spreading right across the welts most populated country [noise]\n\nEating disorders such as anorexia and if I said the ... and binge eating disorder I ... which ... says two passions eating behavior as they once thought to live in the effect white women in high income countries but we're such as national problem to be global\nAs the field evolves we have gone from believing that eating disorders were a phenomenon that only affected young affluent white\nEuropean or North American women to understanding that eating disorders actually are prevalent around the globe\nThis is Kathleen pike a psychology professor specializing in eating disorders at Columbia University in New York\nShe told me that in China up until the Nineteen nineties only a handful of cases of anorexia ... had been recorded recent studies suggest that as being a dramatic increase since then there are no official statistics\nIn multiple different locations in China the rates of eating disorders and the presentation of\nAnorexia nervosa blaming nervosa binge eating disorder are all more or less on par with what we see in North America and Europe at\nThis point Kathleen told me China's rapid economic growth has driven the change as countries on the guy's social and economic transition she says conditions become right for eating disorders to develop\nOne of the things that happens is that populations on average increase in weight and in many cases that's a good thing but it is a problem for a subset of individuals within the society who then are at greater risk for eating disorders\nAre you saying that needs to be an abundance of food in society before someone has anything to soda\nThat's certainly the case for the eating disorders that are characterized by binge eating so believe me nervosa and binge eating disorder they tend to correlate with\nRising population weight and you can only have rising population way when you have an abundance of food so it's not totally the case for anorexia nervosa that\nTends to have a pretty steady prevalence rate\nRegardless of population wait the cause of eating disorders is multi factorial right so in the context of economic development people also become much more sedentary people are eating more and burning fewer calories and so our weight goes up\nThe problem is that in a global world the global beauty ideals are largely\nThin ideals and that's not such a surprise because beauty ideals are typically the state of being that is difficult to achieve and so in our world now where there's an over abundance of food\nAnd it is difficult to avoid gaining weight then the beauty ideal of the thin woman becomes all the more paramount is it too simplistic than to say this as a result of West and I say\nYes as we see the rise of eating disorders and other parts of the world the patterns\nAre on the one hand similar but in each case there are unique aspects to the presentation and the understanding of eating disorders and cultural context\nFor caffeine than to really understand the rise of eating disorders in China we need to explore the cultural context let's start by asking someone he's had an eating disorder when they felt there was anything about Chinese culture that make them particularly vulnerable\nOkay so everyone um my name is staff I Am currently Twenty one years old\nWhen staff was that team she went on what she described to me as a bit to the health kick which spiraled into anorexia and eating disorders characterized by an normally like body weight which typically results from a pass in reducing the amount they eat and increasing the amount they exercise\nI think it was the first of January very dramatic reach um my mom brought me to um my GP it was just like a regular check up but when I got there they couldn't find my pulse and they they said I was like you know on the verge of ... I didn't even know it\nOr not eating is just glides is the most powerful [laughter]\nIt was pretty [laughter] I Know it was it just kind of um\n[noise] it's kind of like a past um section of my life\nHere as we talk that despite the ... stuff takes over this very seriously she's ... she could have died had talked to I wanted to put her in hospital where she would have been cheap fat but not given psychological support instead her mom agreed to help her recovery time\nThat was five years ago and stuff now a psychology student in the U. S. writing a thesis on the intersection between culture and eating disorders she's from Hong Kong but says the cultural factors she's identified applied to much of China\nIn Chinese culture you might be expected to eat everything that I was put in front of you but let's say the media and I was being approached by at the time was saying like oh being said as better all these kinds of different like moral connotations that are attached\nTo weight loss and wait in general and so it would be like oh am I supposed to respect my culture\nAnd you know eat everything that's put in front of me or do I want to be quote unquote successful in terms of what the media is prescribing it as do I want to be the best and of course in my competitive minds of the of course I Want to be the best um and so there's this weird conflict going on and\nDo you think there's anything about women's role in society that comes into play here\nI just something yesterday so [laughter] but uh what was the is a portrait of a young\nMen who\nWas suggested by not to leave out when we invite her\nTo be nominated a decision name and we ask her give us an example of somebody at work with that represent a workout done over twenty five years and she said you assess you said he's this kid who whose family collected the money for him to get out of Syria during the war he arrived here\nWithout money home last ah without speak English English with any connections and after five years of work with him you know putting his life back in track and now he's studying by medicine\nAnd this ties in with other work you've done with this immigrant movement international you were with a long time you've done some extraordinary installations one I think here in London involved a people having to take a lie detector test to answer your exhibition on the light the test was based on the immigration service in full face when they come in the u._k.\nAll of this seems to be a message that that your delivering about the\nPositives of migration but you must surely be aware that in many countries around the world including in the u._k. immigration has become the most sensitive of political subjects with many people's feeling that migration today threatens\nTheir identity the culture the economic will be\nI think there is a lack of education around migration um and a lot of politicians use the fear of the other in order to get people around their own political or issues um and I also feel that\nEverybody has the right to move in the world really everybody should have\nThe rest of the negative consequences on on a host communities\nBut the the thing is we need to learn how to live together with people who are different from us\nYou've taken it to extraordinary lengths over the years I for one of them are striking and twenty eleven you chose to live in a very poor neighborhood in Queens New York city\nAlone aside a group of illegal immigrants who were eating out a living in New York and you have the same income as them you're at the same lifestyle as them and you lived nothing for months like\nThat but I wasn't but ultimately a stunt\n'cause you could look at all times that lifestyle at any point I'm I'm really struggling to season offices I thought that was the what was the genuine authentic members of doing that\nI sort of like I don't understand where you're coming from and of course previous human being able to leave a situation a point that you'll decide people have no privileged but people can take 'em leave a place one day while they are in the hands of others so of course I notice I have the privilege to\nTo move around the world but what I Want to do with my eyes is for people to have empathy with others to feel how other people feel to understand what other people come from\nJuicing you persuade people do you think you change lines with your own [noise]\nThat's what I was like then I don't know that's not for me to say that that's something I Would like to do\nLet's go back a little bit because here you are in one of London's most prestigious contemporary art museums and yet in some ways your journey is quite unlikely because you were raised in communist system\nIn Cuba where culture was very much part of the ideological hold\nIt was part of the system and you were supposed to talk to the line both artistically as well as politically [noise] how did you become such an individual is in the ...\nI don't think I'm an individual is I think I'm a person who have a very clear a goal with the work I'm doing and understand that everybody has the right to freedom of expression\nWhich makes ... in the system you were in made you a rebel\nYes unfortunately I'm In ... by the government is mine too same been in power than empowered to people that work that she'll be working for\nAnd yet I Can't help but no you can go rather privileged finally I Believe your father was a diplomat ... yes\nHe'd be leaving the revolution and I think what I could take from him is that they'll be living in your principles I have different principles but he has his I had mine\nDoes that lead to a full out with your father is you've forgotten to measure the boundaries of what was available and then what do we say to you [noise] [noise]\nWell it was a very intense relationship the first time I was in third and if I did take up on his was when my father bringing into\nThe immigration that really you may not be turned him as a hitter men walked\nYes yes Nineteen Ninety three he planning on it for you\nTo you now the secret for these ... says his shoes\nYeah do you want with her now it's extraordinary\nThat will happen in a country like Cuba where everybody thinks that they have to save himself\nYou know and where if you go against the government thinks are so dramatic that you have some people sometimes turn against their family\nCould you do you forgive your father for that [noise] it\nWasn't very tough relationship after that it was hard for me it was painful by the end he got in disgrace like happens for a lot of people she starts in reality for what it was an odd from his divert tower and\nI'm happy that before he died he said that he was proud of me and that I was right so I think I think that was the time away\nIt's an interesting because obviously over the years you pushed the boundaries further and further there's one series of work you've done which you served in Cuba around overseas ... whisper\nIn which you use different scenarios and different foreign minister invite people to think about\nCensorship about freedom of expression on one of your installations and inside of a U.S policy at the time in which the series you put a microphone on a stage you have\nSort of pretend security force personnel on either side and you were invited Cubans to take the microphones and speak their mind mhm say what was on land mines uncles their thoughts as close to them well they were going to do as a fundamental threat to the security of their system\nThey don't even want people imagining that can be afraid\nThat's the problem with having Cuba then I don't want people were her sing feeling freedom\nSo what I Do in my art is I take the propaganda that government housing Cuba or an additional has and put it to death when I did that project grow costs or just coming into power and he said he wanted everybody to speak their mind but of course it was how they see after\nWhere people knew who was talking the meeting what they were saying it was all scraped and I say well if that's why you one let's do
