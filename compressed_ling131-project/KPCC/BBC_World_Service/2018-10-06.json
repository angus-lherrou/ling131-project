I Can't get that some of the food that was produced locally on smaller farms was which was widely control that you have\nWas safer and better he would really like that I think he would be dissatisfied with labels which are still not as transparent as they should be and I think\nIt will going back to the big catch up fight right the preservative that he wanted to get out was a preservative called sodium ... uh and he didn't get that out to in fact his hostile boss censored his or did his best to censor his report\nOn that preservative will you still find that preservative like imagine him you know him rolling in his grave over the fact that we're still eating sodium ... but\nYeah he would love some of the directions we're going he would disagree with some of the you know ... by our current administration for instance arguing that you know some of the control of food should be taken away from the FDA and go back to agriculture right [noise] um and I think he'd be horrified by the\n... but he's argued like the Michael Pollan's the world things like that who you know he'd be what your grandmother right\nUp to apply you know what I mean one of my cases is that the stuff your

all of her I always imagine them being slightly stunned students principals of chemistry she put chemistry and her cookbooks right sorry walks through all and then\nAnd this tells you something about how bad things were back then she did a whole sections in her cookbooks about fake food and about the dangers of some of the foods like milk she wrote a\nCookbook which was cooking for you know people who are ill in Nineteen oh four and she put in this whole section saying yeah but if you were going to make like a milk toast or milk gravy for your invalid you better be really careful about that milk right could be poisonous\nShe actually included you should she tried to get people to pasteurized milk at home even right\nAnd and I think this is part of you never get change unless there's a

this feeling we start though with\nThe tragedy ensue the way the the Indonesian island that was first rocked last friday by a powerful earthquake\nThen inundated by us you know I mean there's a lot of attention on the humanitarian crisis that followed but I Want to focus on the geological setting that made the city of ... population three hundred and fifty thousand so vulnerable\nThe phrase ring of fire is being thrown around but that's only half true\nTo the laziest sent back from the main ... Pacific tectonic activity but it is cool too complex network of geological fools squeezing and bending it every which way and one of them runs right on how to\nDo with just fill ... area very well I think produced a comprehensive seismic hazard map of the region only two years ago\n... as a city that sits in the sort of long gated policy valley\nAnd that is a long did it all along a big fault called the public or a fault which is the strike slip fault which has considerable relative movement four to six centimeters a year of movement along it and that's quite rapid for fault so it has very high potential to rupture in large earthquake as it seems to have done\nAn strike slip means that one side to sort of moving north on one side is moving south roughly\nThat's right to the east side is moving north and west sides moving so\nSo how much movement was that and how much if not full broke on friday\nThat's a good question I mean it it varies of course along the fault but let's say the U.S just so we should have about six major maxim slip but I also saw satellite analysis to suggested about five or six major slip extended it all along the fall through pollen itself\nAnd that's one of the boat and things as I understand it is that although the earthquake started some distance away it spread and Polly itself was moved it was broken by this as quick\nThat's right that seems to be what happened the thing is the fault goes essentially right through Palo at skirts the western edge of the city but it's right there and if you were close to that they will be very violent shaking\nIn a sense I'm getting a picture of ... because of its geological history being incredibly vulnerable to all kinds of consequences of an earthquake like this\nFirst of all was right on the fault is in this narrow valley that's right on the fault this value filled with very soft sediments in the sediments can amplify the seismic waves and they're also as we've seen recently subject to liquid faction and that it's right next to ... bay in which Saddam is can be generated\nAnd when you talk about liquid French and that's basically when the soil tunes liquid ... you know just still holding buildings up that's exactly right\nOnce the questions I had the non said A's how long it took full the suit on me to arrive after the shaking had happened\nYeah no one really knows very well because until now we haven't had any data but I did just see that there was some tied gauge records from policy which suggests less than ten minutes of travel time if the timing has to be believed that suggests about ten minutes which is extraordinarily short travel time for this and um\nAnd you can turn that into a distance because I guess you have a decent target of houses you know many ways move\nYes you can it depends on the ... century so you have to look at the symmetry and sort of trace the re back and I think it would have to be generated in ... bay certainly not up around them Delaware the epicenter was\nAn people when they heard about the nominees recently they've been these subduction full like you have off Japan and off Sumatra when the whole see big changes that shape and that's what pushes the walls to call them and that's not the case I proceed with the strike slip this kind of sliding motion\nWell that's right so the subduction zones are what are we call thrust earthquakes for when we're the plates are being pushed together in one sort of pop up and down and that of course pushes water and that's what causes the Saddam\nWhere's this falls is a strike slip fault so it involves side by side motion and it doesn't necessarily push the water up or down you know it does a little bit but it's far less efficient engineering some army than subduction zone earthquakes typically\nHowever in this case there could be two things at play you're one would be submarine landslides the sides of the\n... bay or relatively steep and there could have been slumping or land fighting generated underneath the water along that bay that could be one factor in during the tsunami but also there might be complex fault and we've had the fault\nOn the east side of ... bay and that seems to have switched than to the west side so there might be something happening between those two strands of default that led to uplift underneath the bay\nSo it's still hard to say this point which of those costs to smell me\nBut presumably if they go out to map the seabed they can and that kind of thing at Kennedy and it's important to do so\nWell I think it's important to do so presumably it's not as easy as it sounds yes you can map the sea bed and you could look for a landslide scarves\nAll the issues the after effects that you don't really know how fast the landslide was and that's a critical parameter in determining needs to nominate generation that's really fast you will be more effective in generating so now I mean it won't be open and shut case so to speak\nThere's been a lot of comments about this you know the warning system that but what strikes me is that these ten minutes if that's the right time is an incredibly short time for people to read to anything and you can find people had buildings collapsing around and\nOnly a few minutes before the soon Amir arrived it strikes me is a really difficult and dangerous situation for people living in that area\nThat's right that's a very very short time and now says the message with a local ... like this and and me that are generated you know right off shore the shaking is the warning so if you feel very strong shaking and that means the kind of shaking that makes it difficult to standard that last for\nTens of seconds you really need to head up hill as soon as you can as soon as sick to do so you should proceed to high ground\nBefore we finish you know this is one full which possibly has released its energy for the meantime ... pseudo lazy itself seems to be the most pulling the complicated tectonic setting that seems to be ... with a place\nThat's true there are quite a few faults and ... go to these ones that cut through the center of the public coral and associated fault but also in the north there is a very active subduction zone and there are also a couple of active crust of false up there so yeah there are quite a few faults and some of these folks go right near population center\nAnd along with that you also now have this volcano supports on which she's now erupting I have to us you know either a sitcom\nIt's of what just happened or just shows us how geologically active that whole area is\nYeah it's really hard to say for sure when\nMore chaotic corruptions are triggered by earthquakes or vice versa those kind of events are connected by the stress field in the interviewer so the earthquake will cause a ... to the stress field and that might have some kind of\nInfluence on the magnetic plumbing system overhaul keynote it's more likely to happen if the volcanoes already close to a rupture and and it just took either the stress perturbation or this passage of the seismic waves to sort of push it over the edge and forget about her up and that's certainly possible but it's really hard to tell for sure\nPhil comments from the Australian National University in camera\nFor something more uplifting ... to to the Japanese space agency jak says

something that binds to a protein on the surface of the south and that's how he started during the rest of the immune system think of them as like Michelle slide off by the immune system but you can make them in the lab and then they can have a medical role too if you tip them inside patient\nNow how do you find the right on the body that works and that's the price has been called for this way of creating a huge array of antibodies and then fishing for the right ones that hit the target that you wanted to hit and then refining that proceed to get a really good match between the antibody and

pure and defiance and this is a really interesting example the book on these monoclonal antibodies that really gets into Mets yeah\nYou have to give brag a lot of credit for that though because when he realized the potential of what he was doing\nHe took active steps to commercialize it have been set up companies and of course now it's a multibillion dollar business six of the top ten selling drugs are monoclonal antibodies against the variety of diseases from arthritis to cancer to hold sorts of things\nAnd there is it's interesting connection antibodies that the foot soldiers of the immune system the medicine and physiology prize was about so says boosting the body's own ability to do that yet but this is one way to sort of your head can nickel intervention into this sort of\nSupplementing the body's own abilities if you like so anti parties or proteins that the immune system naturally makes and they have the ability to target a molecule and bind to it\nAnd what great figured out was how to make these anti parties and make them in a humanized way so when you inject them into humans are body won't think of them as foreign and will accept them and then he also figured out a way on how to improve the blinding of the antibodies to its target the Nobel\nCommittee makes this important point that they seize using evolution in the lab\nYes exactly so you have the target and you produce a whole library these anti parties\nAnd then some of them were buying more tightly to our target you choose them and then you amplify them\nThen you go to the next round and choose the tighter of those and so after a few rounds you have an antibody that binds very tightly tail molecule so it's kind of design that immediacy\nI wouldn't say it's design or because you didn't design anything you let the system choose and that's in fact the opposite of design you're letting evolution of selection choose what are the body to produce\nI chose that were designed because the winner of the other half of the chemistry prize told this program two years ago that evolution is the best designer of all time\nFrancis Arnold was on Fox and action actually twice in twenty sixteen

clean power\nBut they say don't say one of the world's biggest producers of oil and gas fulfills have made no way rich and then making the world will not be asking how new way deals with this Thailand and if it can be a political leader and the battle against climate change\nThe new region environment minister tells us choices will have to be made and they won't be easy and we hear how melting ice in the Arctic is affecting animal and marine life and we'll get some warning about the impact of rising sea levels on people who have it well that's a little off the b._b._c. news\nBBC News with female gun marine the head of the European Commission\nLive just don't feel swimming and ... tell us about ... ... relationship with the ... and how it's fun to change the fact that\nWe have few features of the seals in front of us here one of the fear to fail fed\nIs a hard core Arctic endemic federal only in the fire stricken serve are fixed nowhere else on the planet they've read an

changes that serious changes so why should people who live on the equator federal thousands of miles away why should they have [noise]\nIf you have to take it to a human only part of an equation which I find in the family depressing to think about if they need to do that they can look at sea level rise a sliding\n... threatening seriously low lying cities and you're in the coming face if they have to look at human solutions they can already see ...\nFavorable arises because the prices of climate change\nThat's kits Kovacs that all the changes due to climate change your own the is on the global public and I need some convincing but\nThe new region public from what I panel have been saying\nUh quite conscious of the environment this is a country that sees itself as as being quite green there recycling bins every ... something I've noticed as you mentioned the sounds and electric cars are going up thoughts let's talk about heart attacks and that is no way on pocket to meet its targets agreed under the Paris climate change agreement and twenty fifth inning as anybody\nKnows about that there is a very well to shore towns that do that is no and that's actually something that we've been debating in the parliament that with the past couple of days as well because us is right now I think it's important that we realize that we're not on track towards reaching that that targets\nAnd also that we don't have any significant plan that's embedded hair mentioned to how to reduce our climate guessing missions in Norway it's important to understand that the climate policy in Norway over the past Twenty years has been mainly policy on how to reduce ... emissions abroad\nAnd a lot of the work that we've been doing that life saving the rain forest it's been great but it's also in a way to sort of postpone the transition that we need to do in Norway and postponed is really tough choice is and how to reduce our climate get some and ships\nCan Goodman send to the public in a sense being sold a bit of a a green wash us a puppet note that green after all\nI Will disagree or two cups care about that we don't have a clown I mean seriously we have debated a clown in the parliament and uh we have also a reduction of a seal tool in the atmosphere we have ah as I told a fifty percent electric cars that's\nA part of the ... of the taxes for cars I mean we have Ciro Texas if you buy a electric car but if you buy a car with the fossil fuel it's full taxes\nSo for example does is active policy and we have to also take into account that this is a global issue so some of the export of oil and gas is also part of the words so do\nYou have to shut down the coal plants they are more pollution in making this a problem and I mean Norwegian gas can be part of the solution\nBecause new region gases clean up but if you think about ... new way could do given that it's wealthy what shifted to what more can it do I guess I should new way innocence be able to make more choices because of the wealth that enjoys\nWe have to do all looked at the same time on many different levels and if anyone tells you this is a magical buttons you can do one thing and then it will be sold\nThat's not true because there's a lot of things to do you have to do energy efficiency you have to do more renewables you have to replace coal with gas like in the u._k. they could use energy for the first twenty four hours last year without the lump of coal because of the region gas that was disillusioned for them\nAnd of course it's not the solution forever but it is a solution on the way it will take time it will take decades\nBut we're going in the right direction and we have to go on the part\nThat rich I don't really think you're going to the right direction they discuss that oil and gas policy it's because we continue with business as usual there's the political consensus amongst the biggest part is that we will maintain high production levels and we actually subsidize the expiration and\nThe longer we continue with the business as usual the harder it will need\nTo go and get away the magic wand and put you in charge you said there isn't a plan what should the ...\nWell I think we should start taking part of the national debates about how much more oil and gas and we can put into the atmosphere because if they burn all the research about now it reaches almost three degrees\nSo everyone needs to take responsibility here and I think the challenge for the government and for the oil industries to first of all run the company in a way to the benefits of ah the owners which is the states with\nThe north and the government also needs to be in tune with what the people are thinking and that many of the plan for how we can get off\nThat fuels and I think there is a division now for the first time in our fifty years of experience with oil that that the public has for example we don't want to Seventy percent in the north sixty percent totally Norway said that we don't want to open the most vulnerable areas in the north the different areas and the the also have\nPools showing that people are willing to leave oil in the ground for climate reasons that governments and\nI think we're missing a a major part of the energy world energy debate here because the biggest problem is the large number of coal plants out in the works looks are trying to for example\nAnd uh the CEO to emissions they don't know any national borders so we have to look on a on a grander scale and I mean that's since no wage an oil and gas is one of the most green ones produced in the world well enough to come through such shouldn't stuck with this should be no way because now specific\nPoint that that brings up if you think about that has been a big public outcry in this country about this idea\nThat that the ... islands is very important environmental area and then all of us have no way could be opened up to ... really important to marine life important but it's not something that has made the Norwegian public wakeup perhaps the cost of oil to this country\nYeah that's a very uh special area on the whole lot of Mali as horse so do you think the tipping point as far as public opinion can said no I mean it's a quick or easy now because we have a political from other government where we have to agree to let this area and be left as it is\nBut it's very important that we have activity on the other parts of the of the country because\nWe produce a lot of oil and gas that's are very important for the European production of electrical power\nAnd ah it's actually part of making Europe more green\nGay we have to remember the sheer scale of this because if you take in consideration the Europe screen ... the new region hydro power in the region hydropower is one tenth in energy or what we export natural gas to Europe which is important because\nIf we don't export from Norway it will be other countries will take place in Europe\nI don't think that you can take out twenty five percent of the natural gas coming into Europe of the equation and just relax and said sit back and say that nobody will replace it of course it will be replaced and\nCarry this this ... not to view that shed by much of the new age in public that actually better that new way does this we do it well it's\nSo I Believe ... when the power comes from Norway we take it out the knee from the ground where the good guys and all of us I think that's been a very important part of the story that we've been telling ourselves in the way over the past\nTwenty Thirty years or being an oil producing country at the same time that we're trying to frame myself as a climate friendly country in a way\nAnd what we're seeing now is basically a shift because we're also taking into account both that the consequences of climate change that we are seeing today but also what's really going on in other countries in the world and in Europe we're seeing this big energy transition now\nFrom fossil fuels and being dependent on importing from ... in in many countries to want to be\nEnergy independent and building more and more renewable energy in the in a lot of unusual energy\nAnd that's a whole new transition that we are seeing and and that's happening in Great Britain it's happening in Germany and that's going to change the markets\nTo which we sell our petroleum at the moment as far as you can sense should the Norwegian government be granting new exploration licenses for oil and places like the ... seats in the ... I Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and the main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe is sort of missing in the debates so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about it because if we accept and say yes to a new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the ... today they will be still be producing in twenty seventh day\nCrown prince Mohammed bin Salman and Saudi Arabia and said that his country's consulate in Istanbul can be searched as a mystery continues over the ... of a missing Saudi journalist nothing has been heard from democracy Yogi since the end to the Saudi comes in it on Tuesday\nHammer ruins eight presidential candidates are campaigning for ...

Elvis do and he's in a hurry can fly on here\nWell I think we are all in a hurry but we have to be able to have to talk to her at the same time I don't think it's our Parker see I mean if we are going to electric cars and the industry don't deliver our demands well should we not drive an old I'm\nVery interested in your view on into connect to these cable so I saw this site where this cable they've got to go it stops and filled all in the southwest it goes all the way to the north east England and it's going to allow a new way and the u._k. to produce and store access green energy\nIs their citizens ... new ways images a bit of a green pioneer and getting away from some of the criticisms that you've level about his role as a fossil fuel producer insider\nMade me I think it's really good for us that we are connected to the rest of your biggest than we can actually develop more renewables because they have this amazing coastline would love to win and there's so many ways that you can develop also for example solar power\nAnd make as much as we can do it in Germany because it's cold and it's not polluted\nSo I kinda wanna bring attention to the way that we have been thinking about energy we haven't really seen the impact the hydro power and we haven't seen the oil platforms so I think one challenge now is that you have to think about the way the use of energy\nAnd the way we develop energy and that actually if we want to be part of the Europeans illusion\nThan actually making more renewable energy it could be one of the answers to where we could put our money instead of oil and yet\nAgain when you talk to people hear about the idea of Norway sharing that power\nPeople are worried about it they're worried about some of the environmental impact if you increase small areas just over the past they worried that the ... they're going to pay it can they go up which suggests that people in Norway adjusted worried about their own pocket has anybody anywhere else even if you're trying to save the world\nOf course they are concerned about if it's going to cost more and if it's going to cost more to use your electricity we've been blessed with a coastline has given us a lot of energy in different forms over a lot of years\nAnd that has made it possible but remember we're not really new hydro power in a way we have a lot of discussions about women parks we have a lot of discussions about every single form of energy we're putting out there so it's not that easy to just to shift and there's also another concern that's huge\nThat season to unions because of if you're export the power you don't use it for industrial production in no way and that's the discussion above your work about where you live what you go to do it's a problem there is\nI just want to come up with an example again and we have this island big island outside of your calls from now which is very beautiful and it has a lot of seafood production and it's expected to increase the two hundred percent in terms of how much power the need for all this new production and we're working there with the local uh energy company or or the regional\nAnd we're actually looking at put together with the communities and the company is how we\nDon't have to put another long cable to supply them but actually for example solar power will be beneficial and I think this kind of way so creating viable energy future is it's really the way to go if you can see how it benefits their own society and if we think more locally and regionally about the way we plan\nWith energy I don't think we will be in a situation that he's growing up with\nThat we have to pay so much more for the energy I think actually we can make really good energy futures here\nI'm interested all these solutions for rich country a country where the citizens feel comfortable and secure is there any sense in which no way can be a model for anybody else\nI should think that we should find certain area certain specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of\nBringing that new technology to the market and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical ... with creating a market for a new technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house buildings we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical boats and chips because we're a shift nation that always been so\nVery because of an I'm an engineer why would I Choose to academic thing other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because you want to be part of really creating the future and I think the future energy security is of supply will come from renewables not to develop new pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because with all this explorations that we've talked about there's only two developments and then will reach an architect to oil and gas fields\nFirst directorial effort because that's what's so amazing about Bradley Cooper is accomplishment\nWith a star is born if you have a suggestion for best first film\nBy an actor burst best first directing average you can put it on our film we page K PCC dot org you can call and pass it on to one of our call screeners at eight six six eight nine three Cape BCC that if you're listening to our live friday broadcast\nSo way do you have some good examples of a best first directorial effort by an actor\nI sure do uh Charles lot in the long haul I'm film yes I was on the classic night at a hundred and fifty five it was his ... his debut in his only film a sadly\nUh obviously Citizen Kane you know you can't go anywhere without talking about Citizen Kane a two films for that one best pictures a decade apart ordinary people Robert Redford dances with wolves Kevin Costner of love both of those\nYeah really really good example so lay out what topped your list\nOh well you know I wanted to sort of give a shout out to some of the women here as well ah Barbra Streisand I I just think ... or ... directorial debut I left I think you know the way that\nGender specific of you and and and and not wrong um you know at the end when you end up for it was there were mixed but I think it was a terrific debut and uh certainly she went on to do some I Love all ties I mean yeah\nI'm a little piano yeah example um who became a TV work horse had direct yeah yeah and was terrifically talented\nUm yeah there's I mean there's Jodie Foster little anti Joseph ... a great movie and interestingly sort of ... a bit of an uneven career as a director but I think that was a formidable data you certainly\nYeah right uh once again you can share it with our costs greater eight six six eight nine three K PCC and let us know or what your thoughts are about ... directorial effort\nBy an actor or in the first out of the gate or just as a police out critics are responding with Bradley Cooper is effort in a star is born a eight six six eight nine three K PCC if your uh\nListening to the live friday you can also posted on our film we page and uh let us know which uh initial effort you I'd I'd read for one is really interesting because ordinary people Oscar winning film you know was\nWas a huge accomplishment isn't 'cause he's had a little bit more of an up and down career as a director some outstanding work others that you know having worked quite as well so having a great film out of the gate doesn't necessarily mean everyone's going to be a hit\nGoing oh no it doesn't um that's for sure at\nYou know I think I think foster being one terrific example of that uh Peter Berg by the way as a director who was known as an actor who what was it the run down I think he's gone on to do in tremendous amount of work in television\nAnd if he finally found his grew with a certain kind of blue collar film blue collar action\nFriday night lights as well and Ben Affleck would be another one to mention on I think the town was his directorial debut if I'm not mistaken and he actually been pretty consistent as a director I Know that I say throw mama from the trained Danny alright\nYeah give Danny DeVito is at\nThat is that is one of the ... just one of the all time great titles for a movie but a what a what a great movie to have you with\nPhilip in West Hollywood wants to bring up Woody Allen's debut as a director although this is kind of a a you know right off the pick what's up tiger little yeah where where they totally re dubbed the dialogue Japanese secret agents to totally changed the meaning of what was going on on screen\nSo a lot of guilt that that's certainly hasn't cult following does and deservedly so\nWhat about actors who in their directorial debut have\nNot uh equal around him examples of ah well I mean a Jack Nicholson going south I think was was considered pretty awful and him as Wade mentioned a Kevin Spacey is Bobby Darin ... be I have to see how you said was beyond acceptable yeah\nFunny 'cause so many actors at a certain point in their career seemed to get the directing bug and I assume part of it has not just that they feel creatively they're you know something to share\nBut as an actor you have so little control and as a director you know there's got to be a longing for many actors\nTo have you know that decision making authority\nBut it's not just it's not just being in control it's also having good communication skills that I think really knowing how to channel motivation it's\nParticularly interesting to me that the big stars generally speaking big stars when they become directors do not do as well as people who work perhaps character actors are middling stars a million were talking about Peter bird I could even go to Sarah Polley\nUh-huh who was you know a a good actress ... is one of my favorites but as a director she's a force of nature and you know it's amazing that that that many of the of the the better directors are the ones who were not necessarily big stars\nYeah did you mentioned a ... Shelly that a ranger yeah yeah\nYeah so again your example of a first directorial effort\nBy an actor um we share with us what you think is particularly impressive one Bradley Cooper with this week's a star is born eight six six eight nine three key PCC if you're listening live friday you can share it also you can put it on the film we page at K. P. C. C. dot org\nYeah I just wanted to say Cooper yeah well this may be his first feature he did direct a\nAn an adaptation of the elephant man on Broadway I Believe that he also start in and was I I think that's correct and you know he was he spent a lot of time researching that he had loved to play very much in was\nParticularly passionate about it and so he he has a history of actually getting involved in all aspects of the work and Sarah Polley I just wanted to say I love her thank you for mentioning her a a films like away from her thing as stories we tell I mean such it's such a great great director\nAlright er and and and get I ... it seems like she has not been as prolific as one might think given the the creative successive or films yep\nAll right you can share your favorites first time director actor turned director and some of your ah favorite ah high plains thinker a rights as says I was the onset dresser on both dances with wolves and little man take caution there's an fosters directorial\nDebut use 'em and a high plains thinkers has missed fosters extensive career left her far more prepared for the job that's [laughter] that's\nAbout ... thank you so much for being with us for Leyland\nWeighed I'm ...
