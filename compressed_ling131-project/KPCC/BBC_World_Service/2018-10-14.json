Central American archbishop Oscar Romero is being kind of nice today at the Vatican he was showing that it's an old tour in El Salvador in Nineteen eighty\nIf the investigation shows what\nDo you believe it will show than we almost have to bring the sanctions economic sanctions visa sanctions banking sanctions and we should do it I mean if we\nIgnore ... an outrageous car does anybody going to take the United states serious again I mean this merger\nOn Saturday President Trump told us television television network CBS that they will be severe punishment for Saudi Arabia if it has proved that it was behind the disappearance of Mr casualty\nIt's being investigated it's being looked at very very strongly or we wouldn't be very upset and angry if that were the case as of this moment they deny it and then I then I vehemently couldn't be them yes\nBut when asked about whether he'd consider sanctions against the government in Riyadh Mr Trump said he didn't want to jeopardize American Jobs by counseling and I'm Still\nThey ordering military weapon everybody in the world wanted that order Russia wanted it China wanted it we wanted it we got it and we got all of it every bit of it or would you have that on why well what I don't want to do\nI don't want to hurt jobs I don't want to lose in order to like that and you know there are other ways of uh\nHow how they should they use the word that's a pretty harsh words that is true\nI'm joined in the studio by bill Browder the American British businessmen who played a key role in enacting the Magnitsky Act bill your lawyer\nSuch I saw a gate Magnitsky died while in Russian custody the events that led to the first Magnitsky Act and then the global Magnitsky Act\nHow tennis apply in this particular case\n... was was specifically them are produced to deal with the case like this ... basically I'm uh in in ... case he was an extrajudicial we um killed he was tortured before he was killed\nIn a for uncovering I'm a vast Russian government corruption scheme in and in Russia there was no chance of getting justice and so the ... act\nWas away for getting justice outside the country um by a country that that has done something terrible and so in this case um you have a similar type of thing you have an extrajudicial killing perhaps that haven't been proven yet but wise looks likely\nI'm and I'm and there is really hardly any way that you can create consequences except for this and and this will create big consequences for the Saudi rulers if it's impose\nYou though are also a businessman and with that at all and do you think the countries on companies really are willing to forego that financial interests to make it more important\n[noise] well I I'm I'm certain that that's um companies and countries will not forego their financial interest unless they unless it's just too shameful for them to do that I mean this whole situation around this Davos in the desert conference that they're having and Saudi Arabia is quite an interesting\nTest case to see 'em you know you you have you have a a leader who is credibly alleged to have been involved in a grizzly killing of chopping up a a Washington Post columnist who they didn't like\nAnd then these people are all going to go in and sat him and kiss the ring in Saudi Arabia and makes them look like a complete an absolute craven um immoral people if they chose choose to show up for this is a country which still ... people\nI mean indeed if a country that since ... that'd be heads people that that does all sorts of terrible things\nIt maybe took this particular incident to bring it to bring their conduct into the world view and and it's not a moment\nToo soon Rona many people have drawn parallels to the attempted murder of the script house in the u._k. and point out that the u._k. should take the same stand for ... as its allies took against Russia and supportive Britain do you think that's likely\nIt'll be interesting to see ... as well and and the u._k. is currently going through the breakfast processed leave the European Union\nImpulsively breakfast sport has said as the u._k. will be able to take a an independent foreign policy\nSo on this particular area it would be important to see what the UK Government really stands up for the plane to principal now that it needs to make new friends around the world whether they all Saudi Arabia or China or turkey or other countries which often have a rather bad record on human rights\nBut it's also worth remembering the country which is providing the evidence on casualty turkey is also a country which has a terrible record in terms of protecting journalist I think more journalists are in jail in Turkey per capita than\nAnd purple country in the world says ... there was a huge problem with this ... case in Saudi Arabia we should remember it's the tip of an eye Smith a much wider war against journalism and war against telling the truth and transparency\nRubs how are you comfortable president was Trump President Trump sees it whatever action it takes it should not ... American Jobs\nTo be quite honest with you I think I'm the U.S has really lost the moral compass in terms of being the the the world police um in determining whether or not some people should be held accountable for human rights abuses given that it's I think human rights abuses across the globe and even supported rogue regimes\nI'm enrolled heads of state who have you know\nCommitted huge crimes um in their countries and I think to be quite honest the U.S will uh ally itself with any nation are headed state at ... does its dating and that's I'm\nI'm In sort of financial dealings with it um and it's easy to point the finger at those rogue regimes that the U.S government hates or the U.S government has problems with but doesn't have financial dealings with and it'll be interesting to see how they respond to this particular case given that the ban in such\nUm alliance with the Saudi Government and the Saudi regime\nBuilt you will noting there and yet you did manage to get the United states to enact think label ... skate act\nWell we've got to start somewhere I mean basically we can't live in a in a Savage world where everybody is killing everybody and and this particular ... cases just so important because if this if this is uh if if the murder turns out to be correct which I which I think most people believe is is the case\nYou have a situation where um um if if if the Saudis are allowed to get away with this it would give the green light to every head of state\nUm that you can go out and you can kill you could even just member I'm a opposition journalists opposition politicians without any consequences this is a red line this is a global red line that that has been crossed and there has to be dramatic consequences otherwise similar types of things will happen round the\nWell the uh safety generals the United nations and you know terrorists has talked about what he fears what he calls as the new normal the idea of what Bill is just said which is that basically government's going round kidnapping people hiding them away and in some cases killing that we have their own you're on the story about\nYou know Chinese tax Dodgers allegedly being uh taken up by the or the Chinese government to in the same sorts away and the sort of thing has to be stopped before essentially becomes another tool of international government\nBill just in Fifteen seconds Mr Kushner gate was not a U.S citizen he was the U.S resident is that going to make a difference\nIt's not gonna make any difference at all Sergei Magnitsky was not a U.S citizen and they named a law after him to impose some\nThat'd be the sanctions and a half it freezes on corrupt Russian government officials and this makes no difference this is this is a point of of of high level of morality United States has already proven um in in the Magnitsky case that they can act on that and they will now as well bill Browder\nThank you for coming into the weekend studio\nVigils are taking place in churches across El Salvador ahead of the ... latest today of the murdered archbishop Oscar Romero he was an outspoken advocates of peace who was shot in the head in Nineteen eighty while saying mess this is the reporter\n... enough else who was an eye witness\nWas sitting at the archbishop seat with my tape recorder that healthy now and then suddenly almost at the end of the center there was the

and these were the years just before the twelve year civil war broke out here and he was he was really be loved and\nRespected because he spoke out\nVery strongly about injustices that existed here and at that time the country was under a military dictatorship so that was pretty risky thing to do and in fact it ended up costing does life he was shot to death the day after\n... says around us all the time every day we must ... people who have a connection to like an ice that gives you all want to leave your lady that just pops up and become matter\nIf we could walk around seeing all the potential ... says that surround us every day we probably think they're much less remarkable than they are but as it is really become aware of a tiny fraction of them\nAnd as a result they often make a big impression on them [noise] so I put it to David statistically things just more likely to go badly if you've had to run as a parent good luck to exactly\nNoticed regression ... let me see means or ... runs a good look bad like dumb launched a the classic one is the ... school district to their schools be repeated all tigers ... lead frequently but subsequent bumps Great Lakes or had terrible for you and this is only to assist regrets she means the fact that\nIf something is higher because it don't extremely well then it's things could have been you know\nSo it may be part of what my son is experiencing is regression to the made a pristine call is going to get scratched eventually it might have been lots of times why people complimented it and nothing bad happened the tool\nBut when those two things happen together we feel like something mysterious might be coming on the David luck is the way of describing things that have already happened but for lots of other people luck is a kind of force that can enjoy and satellites\nLet's poop outside the studio for a moment and also people in the streets of London how they feel about luck\nI mean I Can't say I love it sounds like a really hard and fight like cats I'm not going to find what I Do is I severely than if I as I say I always say morning miss the ... on this is my car\nTend to have some of the fish it we\nGrew up in

fired\nYou know you're going to have my block to block capital for the wrong road and then when\nSo quite a broad range of opinions on luck that\nThe world can science tell us about the [noise]\nBowling magician and now professor of psychology at University of ... to spend lots of time studying the beliefs and behaviors of lucky and unlucky people\nTrapped research around about twelve percent the population think extremely lucky in about eight percent I think that certainly I'm lucky and most of the city somewhere in between but we do have\nA full once when you ask people in their minds how lucky you unless we are and they start young you know you can go into the schools to young children they'll be able to identify the lucky unlucky kids in the classroom so this is something which is something to do that psychologist in Ashland keep this notion even though it's a rational or being lucky and I'm [noise]\n... is the idea of luck tied to something that we've been talking about in this program this idea of magical thinking consider yourself lucky you're on like he is a form of magical thinking because clearly crossing their fingers ... probably doesn't influence the well directly\nHowever what my research shows is it does it affect your mentality of psychology your beliefs you have to choose and they then have an impact on your life\nSo lucky people are more successful than unlucky people they do get to policies and chat with people end up getting job offers or they do their best to in life\nBecause they're far more positive and optimistic drives them forward so you know we're white it's rational to being irrational right okay so there is kind of such a thing as lucky unlucky people because lucky unlucky people behave in different ways and all that for influence I live in different ways it is that right\nYeah I mean my research I've spent a decade looking extremely lucky unlucky pizza about thousands of them and\nWe can see the lucky people were far healthier a they tend to have more long lasting relationships are they tend to earn more money or they tend to ... so in that sense yes that lucky yeah and the average that showed that they were doing things of unconscious speech Craig good luck because the way they're thinking the way they're behaving\nSo yes there is a psychology there is a science to lock ... amazing so what kinds of principles for these lucky on lucky people living their lives by some kinds of things but they doing differently to each other\nOn the key principles is there more open to opportunities so they tend to have a gold Israel will do in terms of being happy and healthy and what's happened but how they were going to get that well they're very open to different groups through certainly I met some of their party and actually I think well that's an interesting personal keep in touch with that person either they'll go it alone that routes\nWhen I'm lucky people are often stuck in a rough that go one way which they intend to be successful in relationships will help for whatever the case and they stick with that\nNo matter what happens so that kind of flexibility behavioral flexibility is very important to some extent um and that you have done a kind of showed the differences between the people who identify as white cat out from a toss based experiments so for example might have some flick through a newspaper and\nThey might be opportunities in that newspaper a big ... saying you know till the experiments you've seen this and when a hundred pounds\nAnd the lucky people tend to have ... a logical school detention spotlight afraid relaxed and so they sit literally seem over the world who spoke there's opportunities and go wow like at my money\nAnd give them money and all that lucky but still\nThe unlucky maple\nVery anxious about themselves for small spotlight literally don't see there's opportunities lucky people also optimist I think ... other like work out well for them and so because of that they're very Brazilians went bad things happen they will bounce back because there's underlying belief in the future of good things will will come about\nUnlucky people exactly the opposite pessimistic for example if you give people a scenario such as a young man he woke into a bank and ... like ...\nAnd the bullet hit you in the arm you're lucky you I'm lucky you've seen massive differences in which was which people respond to that sticks resilience the lucky people going oh my goodness we're lucky day because we might talk to my head just my um [noise]\nYou know if I Need some time off work this can be afraid lucky break\nThe unlucky people go while you even asking the question I've just been shown me all the lady and I'm lucky I cited as soon as very simple experiments often used quite profound insight into people's different mindsets\nIn some ways the ... or ... or the beginning of this program we heard how magical police or sometimes a result of our brains making fools connections\nAnd getting things from the riches reset seem to show that believing you're lucky can become self fulfilling and actually make you more lucky after hearing Richards advice maybe I Will try to adopt the mindset of the lucky person stop staring at the pavement and\nBe a bit more open to opportunity\nWhy don't chat to that person in the elevator or look on the positive side a bit more\nYou never know if it's a must sell to sign up for this\nWeek [noise] that's it for the solution of road signs on the b._b._c.

struggling to understand how Bloomberg it reached its conclusions\nSo far be it for us to sit here and pontificate as to whether the Bloomberg report\nIs true or not I mean is there anything we know about how likely it is to be true because the brain by half said they put a whole lot of evidence together of the best evidence very strongly rejected by the technology companies\nThat's right yeah I think Bloomberg said he it's been investigating for twelve months have Seventeen inside his including former spies as those people who have apple and Amazon certainly if you are a nation state than yeah and you could do something like this they should just be tough I Would because\nYou know it's a growing area video and if it was that ideal by deal with and yet absolutely you'd want to do it but equally you're on TALK to quite a lot of security companies and they say that you know there's been a big sea change in the way those nation states operate\nThe getting less and less about the big ticket to the operations and that certainly this would have been because you're talking about involving people in a factory\nYou talking about changing a production line you're talking about a lot of people it's a lot of moving parts that to coordinate and you know China may have\nA good handle on the loyalties of those people but you gotta think at some point someone some things the way I Would get out and it would be more obvious that this had happened\nAnd I and I think that the change that we've seen is that those ... those nations and how much will still fake campaigns\nAt that tend to use the kinds of techniques that you see from you know just your standard organized criminal because that makes it much easier to hide where's this is you know it's a fairly obvious what are you going to point the finger if something images from a Chinese factory with a sponsorship on it\nAnd that's why as whatever is or isn't going on in this particular story at least it's not much unity to think about vulnerabilities that could be in the supply chain and ask a space go out and vote in question ... whatever's going on here how feasible that would be any way at the level of manufacturing to\nPut a little surveillance chip in ... device ship that device and then have that chip active I when it ... put it into a server and the United states or the u._k. or wherever\nYeah but that's one of the Jewish aspects about the story is that a ... I don't think Bloomberg said that they should have been turned on I think that it was it sort of they they think they go ahead of the curve and they called it before the\nUm the sponsors of whatever activates there but I think some technical analysis that did look at the evidence we did put forward\nAnd he said if you were going to do if you if you if you pick this both from the circuit board the plane the audience for it to be a great place to do it 'cause it it seems that dates or is it flowing across you know from one possible to another so yeah it's feasible and certainly the\nUm there's
