London or early as today\nYeah that's right it's enormous by any standard in in comparison with for example London during the same time period it was a monster of a city and how many people that's an excellent question and effectively unanswerable because we simply don't have the historical fidelity to answer that but the estimates range from seven hundred and fifty thousand up to over a million\nBut again those numbers are very rubbery and it really depends he took\nTo what everyone agrees on was this open a gray area and since he was sustained by an enormous in critical network of ... miles ultimately the weak point the damn pennies has been studying\nIt's an interesting system when you look at it the water distribution network achieved several things with a multifunctional network\nIn Maine was providing irrigation water to agricultural fields of course and we'll say domestic water supply but it also played a role in mitigating flooding in the city so a large volumes of order was starting enormous reservoirs some of which were\nSixteen square kilometers an area the single reservoir on and storing many millions of cubic meters of water so these systems which fed those reservoirs and the canals which captured surface water floods\nWere designed all set to mitigate the risk of flooding in what is it very seasonal environment so this is critical infrastructure to the functioning and flows of the city when I was active\nAnd am I right but what you be looking at is the ... that infrastructure played that in the demise of there's extraordinary civilization\nYeah that's right I think we need to make an important distinction here in the sense that we're not talking about the demise of a civilized nation but rather the fragmentation of into the network certainly what we expected to some time is this very large and very complex system was severely damaged by flooding\nIn the latter part of the fourteenth century and we know that you ... did with that period of extreme climate variability during the fourteenth fifteenth centuries\nI mean we have long suspected that the functioning of the critical infrastructure that was represented by this would've distribution network was somehow interrupted and that led to the actual outcome that we say and they say the relocation at the Capitol\nI mean it's a very interesting phrase somewhere and you'll paper about cascading failure so it sounds like some parts of the system was pushed over the edge of men they bought pay it off ...\nYeah I think the cascade is critical to document and that's what we saw determine precisely whether they would be a cascading this system given certain conditions and we are all very familiar with these things as we experienced them as blackouts in various infrastructure all networks that we rely on his part of our daily lives\nAnd so effectively the argument here is that you can have a very small disruption to one component of the system which can then propagate out very rapidly to create a much larger outage that maybe network wider release tech how large parts of it were effectively compromising its core function\nSo you're saying it's a bit like when the electric power system goes down it might be just one link that goes down and then it brings the rest and you're saying but one Lincoln this canal network march of gone than others followed\nYeah to exactly right and it's precisely like a a power outages the very small disruption which might be simple as an overload are switching station somewhere can actually create a problem which may be much much much larger and more significant\nSo he said that there was an overload of some salt related to these monsoons\nYeah precisely said the ... talking about in the system is not an electrical obviously but it relates to a period of a particularly wet monsoons during the latter part of the fourteenth and early ... centuries which sits between two very large and prolonged drought so this was a period of\nQuite dramatic climatic instability so the evidence of the damage created by these floods the overloaded as you say is very clear and the landscape very easily measured what we wanted to know I was does that damage create a cascade with tech have this entire system\nAnd I'm just sort of try and work out how it would do what was the failure of one come out have in terms of the whole network of canals\nYeah it's an interesting question that relates to a feedback between erosion which you might expect in a flood situation and said imitation which you might not necessarily expect so al model estimated the dynamics of erosion instead of ... in these canals systems given a certain magnitude of flooding\nWhat we found was if you're putting more water down the canal which is not designed for\nYou will trigger incision and that's precisely what we say in the reminds of the night with a single canal I writing down into its paid several nations in doing so begins to style of flow from other parts of it with\nYou in of course ... there's a feedback between erosion and sediment passion and the concentration of flow into a single pathway through the network\nEffectively stopping most of the network of water a day by fracturing the system breaking it into small compliance which are no longer functioning\nI think it's pretty amazing this cascade of events could bring to its knees this great just sit on the climate\nAnd indeed and it's an interesting question whether this was the act that caused that shift from on cost to the cycle middle periods cities closer to modern capital of no pin\nOr whether this was simply the final event mocking the end of a city which was becoming increasingly unwieldy and increasingly irreparable so it's an interesting question with a this was the coup de gras or whether it was simply the event that broke a system there was no longer being maintained\nThen penny from the University of Sydney his analysis appeared this week

depends on access to effective antibiotics to treat the infection\nRipple from the bureau of investigative journalism says that these critical infrastructure is being undermined by ones and use of antibiotics in livestock in India\nNow it's not entirely new antibiotics have been used in finding since they were available not just to kill disease but also to promote growth\nBut health experts

stronger so they're they're getting closer to that increasing speed limit\nAnd how does Michael fits in with trends that you've said\nI think it fits in exactly what we might predict from warmer planet it is a situation where we can sustain intensification over a longer period\nAnd we can get these kind of rapid intensification events more common so the warmer ocean so I think it's perfectly consistent with what we can expect in the future\nThis week we've had President Trump saying that the scientists needs to tell him what's going on I Believe the votes you have candidates in Florida who have their doubts about global warming of any of these people ever coming off you based in Florida an expert on hurricane what was his own about\nUnfortunately they haven't so it would be nice if the politicians would communicate with us it's not like we're hard to find but unfortunately that hasn't been the case what would you tell them and show\nI Would say that Florida is a state that is going to be impacted by storms that has always in the past it will continue in the future\nBought these storms that we can expect in the future are going to be stronger they're going to produce higher

groups were excluded\nFrom what was pretending to be a universal ideal and he was saying that in order to achieve\nEquality of citizenship African Americans hatched a such that rights to civil right\nMaybe we can I mean they're literally ... you're the one who are making is making it slightly of simplified binary because you I'm describing a position which says race doesn't matter at all

the majority population and one of the ... as\nYou claim to care about universal principles you claim to care\nAbout the principles in the constitution and when you look at the American south right now you see these principles are being violated so you as an American have a reason to struggle against injustice Adrian time beyond we have something in common as Americans and that is the right way I think for the most occasions way ...\nBy off and on piled high density politics that I was given black lives matter to you from the accepts that we just listen to that black lives matter we're not saying we are different\nIdea about well the point is you have to build bridges between differences so that people can build a common life and have a meaningful democracy in an economy that is actually open to all of the points of our identity politics as vase clues of was a sense of belonging that everyone can shatter needs to redo the thing\nI smoke and I can I throw in a different elements all of this is the difference between identity politics as we're talking about it now\nFrom say at the civil rights movement to the sixties city that many more people have access to these ideas have access to claim on an identity whether it's through education whether it's through social media is that what we're grappling with Lionel Shriver\nI think we're certainly dealing with a movement that started in education that is an American campuses though it's certainly spread beyond that\nBut I'm saying it's a function of people being welfare having more access to to having a voice because they can access the media because they can have social media to spread their ideas in a way that just wasn't ...\nYourself a social media has something to do with it but I think that if you look at social media one of the things that distinguishes the character of the conversation that's being had on line from the civil rights era in the United states in the Nineteen sixties\nIs a tone of of antagonism and hostility and even a tendency toward\nPredation it's that hostility toward the majority often from other white people ironically who are in competition with each other for who can seem more virtuous and more book you'll see that that is alienating to the white majority and I think that naturally gives birth\nTo white identity politics\nIs it the ... that actually is destructive if there is a destructive force and all of this\nIf there isn't that enough it is one that has been set up by the majority [noise] this is the key points that the charges that are being made of antagonism and hostility and\nSet protests them are in fact what is being done to people um what is really interesting to me about the kind of white victim narratives that line or just a minute as to where the majority is now saying well we are the victims [noise] what was seen the ad is loss of privilege\nBeing coded as oppression and that's a real difference between actually being oppressed and actually feeling that your loss of ... which is outrageous\nSo is that rather an important point Adrian ... does it simply that the majority of finding themselves challenged by any number of minorities\nBut I think the problem is that you have on the one hand very technocratic leads but he didn't die abstract things are done resonate with a very sizeable number of people in the one hand and then you have lots of minority majority responses to that and nothing none of it is very healthy\nIt's not healthy to engage in victim and whether you are black or white or whether you're a venue in a situation you gender and sexuality whatsoever\nThat real victims those real oppression exploitation\nBut the way to get over that is to name it as an injustice die affect everyone because it violates human dignity so it's always appealing to what we have in common ... just to say I'm a victim because I happen to be ... ... what's that\nThat doesn't ah to see if you like a commonality of belief that may not exist if you think about algae Beatty writes could you have complained that you'll suffering your impression was an offense against humanity many people would have simply not recognized the vets exactly in\nFact walk to the beauty movement do they said look\nThis is love we love like everybody else so don't discriminate against us don't distinguish between us and that was actually realize that what we ultimately wanted ... exactly the same as what happened sexual swans and that's part of the reason why the movement has been so successful we agree I think all of us in this conversation\nBut that is real discrimination real injustice and that we want to fight against it\nBut I Do think that more and more it is also a distinction about how we visit with them will

listening to the real story from the b._b._c. World Service with me with a shot this week we're looking at identity politics and I'm joined by ... Adrian pots Lionel Shriver MP and by the go Paul and I mean that's a tough we talked about what lies behind the rise of our awareness of identity politics\nWhether or not it's new I think remains debatable but if we move away from that and think a bit more about the impact is fracturing will regroup paying of people and causes\nAnd its effects on traditional politics\nLet's consider the changing political landscape that the election of Donald Trump immediately comes to mind\nAnd also traditional Republican or a conservative but certainly each should end you view of politics [noise] does that view those people who backed him does that voice come at the expense of others ...\nTrump phenomenon in the United states are definitely does some of its rise to\nA identity politics and it's it into reaction against it the shrill note that I observed earlier is alienating to the majority and if I saw the statistics recently I Wish I could quote them but the\nProportion of white Americans who believe that they are the primary victims of discrimination in the United states is shockingly high\nAnd of course I look at that and I say well that's ridiculous but it's you know that's what they feel and it's partly the result of of fifty years of affirmative action so you know they feel discriminated against\nAnd um they look at what is often a a certain amount of casual racism against white people in the identity politics conversation\nAnd think that will you know someone has to stick up for us and you know I wouldn't simplified the Trump phenomena as only coming from this small campus\nMovement but it hasn't helped and this way of of talking about people and prioritizing issues has definitely infected the Democratic party and is also alienating middle of the road and independent voters who might otherwise be on board\nPre I Wonder how you view this this changing of the political landscape\nYeah well that's a couple of things to say I'm really struck by the way in which he does in fact a sudden form of white identity politics um that Brostrom to power everyone else's child should identity politics and not the majority but the majority is playing\nA is being made to play a role to identity politics what I find interesting is the ways in which although we talk all the time about how facts NASA and help the truth matters and how fake news has a problem\nSuddenly feeling the hut feelings of the majority of become the basis on which entire country is run their elections I mean what our feelings if I\nFeel that there are too many black people around which in fact does not borne out by the stats affirmative action has brought ... fairly small number of black people\nNowhere near proportional into academia for instance I feel affirmative action is obsessing but it does that have any bearing with reality are we discussing reality where the facts what is the truth\nWell on the structures I also find the ideal reverse racism really said it's just that city as river sexism\nThe point is that racism and sexism are about palace tucked us okay so you can't really punch up well do you can't you can't really say racist against white people white people don't suffer structurally yeah short races\nSo a few points you first of what unfortunately or I Would say fortunately we live in democracies and a democracy if you have to do some what about the feelings of the majority because otherwise the mood for people like Donald Trump and but as it does offer for everybody especially for the most vulnerable so what I'm concerned with is how do we actually win democratic elections\nAround ideals that are going to help us come together as a society and help us fight discrimination rather than in French and so the reason to care about the feelings of people is that in a democracy you need to win over to cause in order to be a\nPolice went to ... as a key factor we can't we talked and French law is and the name of the\nLaw I don't think I'm I'm I'm Talking about in country in life you have a thing is that I I Do find it quite striking that you describe Donald Trump is wider than to politics which I think it's up to ...\n... ended up so defined to counter that with different kinds of I didn't know what I'm saying that well actually I find it's not don't ask for miles and miles and punished are bringing about Trump precisely shows what's the problem is with the conception of politics that says we're going to fight for our group and for our side and\nWe don't care about anything else prayer\nSo we should have a son have action because that upsets white beat those are the best thing to do is to deny a disenfranchised groups fair access to writes in order that the majority and not be hooked\nOn it but I did not say anything about affirmative action but what is interesting about affirmative action is that when you look in the United states for example eighty five percent of Americans including vast majority of people of color in the United states against it so I'm not sure who's speaking on ... I wanted to move away from\nThat point and bring you in Adrian we were talking about this idea a that's a different interest groups fighting against each other in a political system is that in a sense because the establishment the establish policies actually has no convincing message new overarching message\nTo to tell people what should you not like the\n[noise] I mean it's a big uh issue today in so many different a democratic countries and indeed others where I think the elites the establishment simply a representative\nThat often very smoothly groups and yes often watching me groups within groups which actually then bring about the system is unjust most of the white people and many more so it's not the case of injustice and he lives with my allergies\nYou cannot majorities and since wide working class\nPopulations in certain countries I've simply not being the winners of globalization off you know open borders and and and all the kind of consensus that we've had for the for the last forty years in terms of the two the two main policies\nSo that come in on that place um\nI find that the W. W. see the white working to us as a very interesting construct watching off as as a whole have not done while I'm working to offer as as a whole on not white that they ... white people but\nThey're all working sauces with being at the shop in ... near liberalism of capitalism sterile pressed their ... because they're working class not because they're white\nThere is no evidence to tell us that the white looking tosses out doing disproportionately badly as compared to let us say the Latino all black working class which is an interesting\nAn important point I Want to bring it back to specific 'cause if I may if we look back Adrian at the recent German states elections in Bavaria what happened that as a last weekend you saw a traditional policy to conserve to CFC which has dominated politics in that part of Germany for decades\nFound itself hemorrhaging votes was still at the end of it the biggest policy but a much smaller but a policy than it had been hemorrhage rates the greens on one side and the anti immigrant AFDC on the other meanwhile the S. P. D. which has left a sense of ... ...\nIt seems that voters are choosing policies which have\nClear a narrow agendas ones which can they can identify with say they if the anti immigrant uh you know I'm lifetime working class I'm Jim and I do feel happy and the biggest space people pushing themselves into those\nAs well I think now because the mainstream parties offering something that's inclusive and off there still stands for you know a consensus that style people economically and culturally\nAnd I do agree period of close to where it can cause is not simply watching a lot of other components of the of the Washington has suffered an often suffer more than the white working class but saying the other people who suffered more doesn't mean that those who have suffered who happened to be wide\nAlso you know will rebel against substations quote and and who are we to tell them to somehow that I didn't see much as last semester of all the time I saw him I said I'm not saying you did what I'm saying is\nThe idea that somehow we can just say\nWe're able to be most depressed people that are the only ones that my son in yet everyone else should just you know hold back on bad feelings is is is not the wise approach in Wilson a rational utility maximizing creatures\nI'm following all the different individuals providing services\nIs to find this I mean the most biggest challenge was to find the strength to follow them\nA because when you follow the advocates you really have to become an advocate also uh understanding the walk they do and make sure that you don't break the trust that they have in that they have built with clients and uh that was the most difficult part is sometimes you come back at night\nAnd and it takes you a couple of days just to assume what you've seen in the streets\nUm I didn't feel threatened at any time or I was always very welcome by the community on the streets and the community of advocates but sometime I was driving home and and it was difficult than I had to take a couple of days\nJust the emotional than most ... factor was very difficult if you really was a transformative experience for me to do\nIs where there are times when you were documenting are the stories where are you got discouraged as you saw the challenge that are areas facing\nNo never I saw the walk when I was following Rudy um the work they do is very inspiring you see the strength of environment and they believe in what they do a and they make you believe in to what they do so I was always very very excited to go see and it was very happy to go walk\nAnd and and meet with them but it's true that some time at night I remember driving on the freeway and putting the doors and you know as a woman [laughter] but yeah I'm an an open the window and just scream\nBy what I was seeing what I've seen in the streets and and I look up a lot of times I remember when we were doing the arch which we some of 'em ... I just the walking full week and say I I I have to stop\nYou just you need a break and Rudy you can't get that break right when you're when you're working on someone's case you can't just tell them I'll get back to you in a week you got to be there for their needs\nAbsolutely this is a work that does require an instant response it requires a level of authenticity\nAnd consistency with us ah all the time there's no predicting when situation can go from bad to worse at the same time the successes and the moments of accomplishment are so fulfilling that I really do believe there is no price that you can put on it\n[noise] Mary wanted to ask you about the efforts to try and and deal with homelessness in Los Angeles\nOr the county of Los Angeles has measure age to provide services um which was passed overwhelmingly by LA county voters the city of Los Angeles measure triple age to provide for housing\nUm is that starting to make an impact\nYes of course it is and we\nNeed to ask the people of the city of Los Angeles to be a little bit patient with us because we're trying to figure out how to distribute these dollars in an appropriate way and a very effective way\nThe county of Los Angeles Los ... is the overseer for the measure eight dollars and they're figuring out what are the are if you look like what the request for proposals look like from agencies like housing works to be able to distribute these moneys\nAnd you know it just doesn't happen overnight change takes time\nAnd change is being affected is being effective and we need to be able to have a little bit of patience with each other at the same time do the work that Rudy is doing every single day and as part of this ... to say yes our our our case workers are doing this work we need we need to be able to take care of them\nWe need to be able to understand the challenges that they have and we need to also understand that in Los Angeles it's about all of this\nWhere where do you go to recruit people if you get funding let's say you put out an RSP you're going to have a program to to provide a service says this part of your housing mandate how do you find the people who are best suited\nA variety of places you might think automatically of a social work program which is great and we do reach out to those folks we help them understand that their internships available\nThe other place that's really really important for us is folks who become advocates who were folks who are chronically on the street themselves we have folks in our employment who have the experience who know what it was like\nAnd who have been able to take some steps to move forward to change their lives to become stabilized to get their issues under control to a level where they can become employed and they make the greatest employees in the world\nAnd in fact running in your film you focus on people who fit just that description yes that's correct and and I'm so with it do you see when you follow those individuals that this is a bit emotionally different for them if they in fact ... experienced what the people there working where they're going through\nThey relate to the people I mean a\n... it's unbelievable to see the friendship that they create between themselves and the people they serve a and and I've been privileged to follow it and and and to follow that relationship and the document that and actually now I have\nI consider you have a lot of friends in the streets also because I was privileged to share that relationship but the people who have the experience of the streets they know how to behave in
