{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Loneliness from from young people some so often you know they don't necessarily have to be a strange and their mom or or in a new new home or a new school but there's this this quietness sometimes\nWhen they just don't know how to you know make new friends or really feel at home in their surroundings it's really sad as an adult to watch I'm sure as a young person I went through that and it was it was you know no big deal or every big deal whatever your things where when you're Thirteen\nBut it's really hard to watch as an adult 'cause you see these beautiful little children just kind of come into this\nThe kind of turtle when they become that age\nWhen you were a kid in school did you learn about the Pentagon war's been the worst you mentioned in this in graphic novel\nI learn something about me tea history we're fortunate enough in in Winnipeg to know a lot about like ... for instance you know he's he's absolutely everywhere and I grew up the climax of the ... is the battle of southern oaks in seven oaks actually just happened down the street from where I grew up so I guess that's where\nIt's quite familiar but uh I I feel like in an especially during the research part of researching the graphic novels there's so much that I again didn't fully realized you know you don't realize how much is involved because you're only kind of taking sound vets\nEspecially in the nineties and in Canada I think we're only beginning a lot of our indigenous education or accurate indigenous historical education\nIf some of this about teaching kids what you didn't learn\nAbsolutely what I really wanted to concentrate on particularly in ... words and I think it will translate with the other books as well as not so much the events that were happening 'cause we can read the factual events of all these the battles in these skirmishes these little wars\nBut it was really about the effect it had on the people when the ... began in\nYou know the early Eighteen hundreds and the red river valley in like the northwest territory or the ... people were were free people and they worked for for either the northwest company or the or the Hudson's bay company but they\nParticipate in these large scale buffalo hunts and they really weren't roam the planes and had this whole other culture that kind of developed around that\nAnd by the end of the American wars the buffalo and buys on were\nBeing over hunted and everyone had to kind of come into more of a sedentary lifestyle so it it had like this profound effect on on my culture on my nation and I think in this area as well so it's a wise and important to get this kind of history in front of a young kids [noise]\nAgain it started with with my own research and really wanting to understand the history so I wanted to really know where these things are coming from and and how they happened and why they happen the way they did\nI think we're just expanding as much as we think we know Canadian history\nA lot of Canadian history like Ninety five Ninety six percent of it is written by settlers it's written by Canadians um who came over to the northwest territory and it's not necessarily written by me two people indigenous people themselves I think we're\nThat starting to shift because as much as we think we understand the facts of history there so set in that historical persons bias and\nTheir own limited knowledge on their own limited world view and I say that for myself as well because I I wanted to talk about this one thing there's many things you can talk about the ... there's so many things that happened over the course of like twenty odd years that\nThese things are going on I Want us to talk about this one one perspective\nYou collaborated with Scott be Henderson Scott ... who ... poetry to this book in some cases he tells your story without your words their their vote graphic panels pages of that and your words how much do you have to trust someone to hand over your work like that\nBut again like I said it felt very much like being a director because and being a director they they never really tell you this outside of film that you don't have to really know anything\nWhat do you what do you mean [laughter] well I shouldn't\nSay they're not looking at me as a as a first time director with a really involved producer and co director I felt like my cinematographer did everything she was she was wonderful and capturing my crazy ideas I Would say things like I Want to capture the river and this light and blah blah blah blah and then she would just come up with this amazing footage\nAnd he's very much the same with Scott Scott's an amazing talented graphic artist and he's done many of these novels\nSo for us it was a matter of me going I Want to talk about the ... and the big beautiful planes and they just want to see that sunset just then shadows and the big rambling um and he just comes up with something because he has that enormous talent\nWhich would you know what I mean like you have to you got to trust that whoever you're handing this story that as we talked about it's really meaningful to you have is to somewhere you'd better trust that they're going right\nYeah I really did um I wanted to to work with Scott Scott's done number of 'em they Roberts and they've been Alexander Robertson's books and a number of his own as well I wanted that detail I wanted that kind of realism it was just the perfect kind of art\nFor for this kind of kind of story so I I did absolutely I trust them and I am going forward I'm we're going to continue to work with each other for for a couple of years yet as we go through these stories\nDo you ever think what a book like this would have meant to Thirteen year old Kathryn\n... I I Do and and I come back to that quite a bit because when I think about the reasons why I started writing it was because and I think\nProbably the most influential book was in search of April Rain tree which was a phenomenal book\nSo it was a phenomenal book but it was absolutely phenomenon here in Manitoba where everyone knows reading it in the eighties and for me it was a matter of reading that book and that book was written by ... Beatrice coach and most name and and it was her story it was her life story\nAnd for me reading that is I think it was like twelve fourteen somewhere in there and just realizing that\nA story from the place where I'm from from the people I'm from could become a book you know could become art that was that was amazing to me because I thought you know you had to live in rural England and and uh and talking to a certain way in order to in order to write a book so\nI really do think about that when I put things out into the world and if it inspires people to to make their own stories than not that the that's the point\n... remember it's been a pleasure talking to you well it's been a pleasure talking to you think you have ...\nAuthor and poet get rid of her and that you just heard about the book she released last year a graphic novel called ... more as the sequels private more is called Red River resistance comes out at the end of November [noise]\nThat is it for today and tomorrow to brief the boys are going to be on the show at rock and Mike the of the beastie boys than without any music since they lost their ...

they are\nAre benefiting from legal minds and they are uh are exploiting a in a in the businesses in the areas are from the jungles illegal logging in the likes of criminal activities that they are engaged in\nA but to say that they control those areas is I think a a very big exaggeration yes they can drive fear into people in those areas they can they can get and they they will be able to kidnap and there'll be able to attack people but do they govern those areas I think that there is has to be a distinction between does\nWell guys if you're telling me is that people will still every inch of the country yes yeah is it possible to\nMan every inch of the country no do you know but no country does that but to be able to bring the ah the population centers the Afghan population central under control and provide them with security is an effort that we are a than we have that we've been working on and are\nNot working well Lance or even for the areas where there is a there is

the challenges and the challenges are real just explained to me if you can because your the\nPresident's national security advisor as over the last few months explained to me why according to the Pentagon inspector general the civilian death toll in Afghanistan\nHas reached a new record high in recent months the last year why is it that the trajectory is it in the wrong direction and the the most important function of any government that is protecting civilians your government cannot achieve\n... where we are under attack as the space for the insurgents grew smaller and they're not able to launch the kind of attacks they wanted to to take territory in two thousand fourteen after the international security forces the majority of the un to national security forces left\nAnd they try to take territory and that has been there a strategic objective but they failed they could take it could not maintain so this the tactics waged two attacks in cities in populated areas\nTo bring international pressure and of course the pressure on the Afghan government um that said we have been working at protecting policy a population centers um you hear of the news of the extraordinary of attack that happened but you don't hear of all the attacks that have been preventing\nThat we have been preventing our security institutions have been a improving their ... their service system to prevent them and prepare themselves for the changing tactics\nThat yet I Would have on you tell the guy who played by the I\nI'm so sorry to interrupt ms might have been at it it is difficult with us the lay on the line of the more you tell me about the scale of the Taliban threat the more I get completely confused about what do you own government is doing in response for example why is it\nThat you are failing to keep up the force levels that you promised\nTo actually deliver security to the Afghan people as I understand that your according to the Pentagon your force numbers both in the police and the armed forces on now at least ten percent below\nThat expected strings numbers appear to be dwindling and not only the numbers are dwindling the morale is most definitely dwindling as well\nWhen when we look at just numbers and I I think without the context\nIt obviously seems a very bad but we have been working on reforms in our institutions so some of those ... number is what it seems like we're actually inflated in the past there were there were goals soldiers\nUh that that have been reduced the number is because we put in systems in place to a um a ... can detect that\n... and number that didn't exist in were reflected our security forces continue to fight with valor and bravery and end are defending their soil do remember that the our security forces\nAre all voluntary they uh subscribe they come in there and to fight for their country and yet in the few weeks that I have been the national security adviser\nI have read reports and hurt\nFrom officials um then the stories of of the attacks and how bravely our security forces defended them just one example there was a check post in ... province that was under attack\nAll of the uh personnel that were inside

Amanda focus and a freelance journalist from Belfast in Northern Ireland\nIreland divided into two jurisdictions the republic of Ireland and then Northern Ireland which is part of the u._k. so governed by Britain within Northern Ireland are are sort of three sets of people there are people who have the British identity people have an Irish should end today and then the group in the middle that have a mixture of those identities\nSo the union is the people with the British identity one term in part of the United kingdom whereas the other side won the whole island of Ireland to be one\nNation and not to be governed by Britain so that's where the conflict came into it and that's still a cultural war still a political war so the Nineteen Ninety eight Good Friday agreement the peace process data that was signed has given Northern Ireland a degree of stability prior to that\nWas in decades of conflict ... murders and bombs and people were fair to the troubles which\nDoesn't seem adequate enough to me it's part of the good friday agreement the British Army would have been on the streets of Northern Ireland there would have been checks on roads and people being stopped in

the concern to people\nPeople took the risk of violence returning if there is able to reestablish between the Irish republican ... and it's a real threat I think\nThat it is you know when people talk about a return to the trouble is I don't think that that's realistic I don't think we're going to go back to decades of sectarian strife\nI think about a hard border would introduce would range all the way from street protests and maybe civil disobedience to physical violence from small groups of guessing and Republicans and what are most senior police officer and northern aren't the chief constable George Hamilton sad\nIs that if there was any sort of border infrastructure or people in those people that are carrying that work would become a target\nThan at the police Judy to defend

fingerprints on file you also has his palm prints on file because what was done in pursuing through his criminal record they take what's called major case prints\nAn image of the palm of your high on the exterior of the interior show there's nothing left that can't be forensic we looked at in the future undoubtedly this is what happened and how he was still able to quickly to be apprehended what I did find curious in his investigation will round this out\nIs that apparently the packaged mail to Mr George Soros Westchester County was hand delivered I'm Wondering and I'm hoping by now there's some sort of travel record whether it's on Amtrak with us on a bus\nIf he has not traveled to New York well then who's who's co conspirator that's the fear I have now but I'm hoping it was just him\nThis crime is usually just the work of one person he acted in my opinion are going to be said a simple all the packages probably from the post offices within three to five miles of his residents because in\nSome of these packages at a lot of stamps on didn't\nThey indeed and that's quite common did why is that okay what most perpetrators of these crimes do when they're going to send the bomb through the mail or anything they want to get to you\nKnow we've all done at where we have to mail it's like our passports or somebody or mail them application well just to make sure and making the right way let me put an extra step on there was twenty cents to same mentality of this individual in his room putting\nOkay I Know this package ways a pound if you will\nSo maybe ... let me put five six because they want to make sure they have they're having to go to the post stuff as well as the well it'd be shores he doesn't have to go to the post office and inevitably maybe someone will remember him and of course it insures it gets there now mail room personnel\nIf a package comes to your mail room that's over stands and also over rats like string and a lot of tape that's a warning put it to the side\nI Believe it might have been to New York times I had a picture of one of the packages I don't recollect seeing a lot of shape but there was an over abundance of stamps and that just stood out as classic and I probably would say that every single package at the same look chew it\nIn the last week or so there have been comparisons us vote may to all the Unabomber who live close to the best part of two decades to catch right I mean now is it possible to get away with a crime like this with all the sophisticated forensics and technology and\nI Would dare say that probably even the Unabomber can get away with him out because she took such precaution Theodore Kaczynski was his name and he was a man of extreme intellect but also of extreme psychosis but his extreme intellect led him to not make one mistake\nAt all he was obsessed\nAnd his mission it appears that much to say look perhaps on the spur of the moment if you will or perhaps when last maybe two to three weeks decided to do this\nAnd then acted without the demonic ... if you will and methodical work of the Unabomber who hand carved all his packages on a leave that would enable polished\nAnd there was no friends you traced whatsoever [noise] have you traveled alone is pickup truck in the mountains and he left no trace just to say Iraq had no such resources still as angry angry individual at the world\nActing irrationally and left a trail\nNow those a lot of talk wasn't that are over the last week policies I talked to be honest with some Republicans saying this could be a sort of false flag operation with a Democrat simple to posting these bombs [noise] we don't know that this guy did it but what do you make of his profile well\nFirst of all that kind of talk from Republicans or Democrats the safer if their frustrations versed is just irresponsible it is just horrible you have a potential act of terrorism and now you're going to start spreading propaganda if you will not even fake news total out garbage\nIn order to take away from the actual horror of what could have potentially happen\nWhen that happens I just have to turn it off however this gentleman apparently again I take no ugliness because I'm a Democrat or Republican or anything like that\nHe fit the profile of an angry Republican if you will apparently a van was found near his home or one that he suspected abusing\nWhich has apparently it's all plastered with these conspiratorial stickers and Trump's stickers as well Matt van has been seized by the authorities is now being processed so he fit that profile\nIt's just the way it is is nothing political doesn't is just that's him it's not the Republican Party writ large or anybody else who voted for Mr Trump or once Mr Trump or votes for the Republican Party\nHe is a horrible evil person if he is the person that actually has committed this crime and he should be punished so he just happens to be obviously a rabbit apparently Republican supporter and conspiracy theorists and there you go the evidence speaks for itself\nThat was retired FBI special agent ... only arrested the man accused of mounting a male bumped campaign in us he's
