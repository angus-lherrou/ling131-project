Hammond is the present of health check on the BBC will set us\nSo we found that forty percent of the people in the age group said that they often will very often felt lonely and then gradually as people get older that number went down but still over Seventy five twenty seven percent for saying that they are always all of them felt lonely\nNow of course these figures are quite high and it's partly it was it was on lines that people could decide themselves whether to take part so that might it might have made them a bit higher of rule but I think what is really striking is these differences between the age groups\nSo that people were telling us that they felt disconnected that they felt left out\nI'm On that they didn't feel\nComfortable in the neighborhoods necessarily that they they wasn't somebody they could um you know bar a little bit of money from in the streets in an emergency if they needed to\nThe boys that isn't because older people are more resilient to worries about loneliness\nI think that's a really good point I think one of the things is that we know that\nWhen you're very young it is a time when people feel emotions very intensely and also this may be the first time that you felt this this painful feeling of loneliness and older people may have the experience to have learned that it usually policies because we know that most loneliness is temporary and that usually people get out of it\nAnd of course if you're younger you haven't had the chance to know that\n... people who are older to look back and we all them when they were the loneliness of all they said it was also when they were young adults so I don't think it something about more life I think the main ways of being the case it was just never measured before it may be used as a time when you feel more Lindley and that's interesting because it's going to ask\nAbout social media but you said older people have felt lonely and when they were younger but Britain is the lonely loneliness capital of your why is that what does it tell us about the culture here because I'll tell you what what would it locks in in in London and the surrounding areas then there'll be make eye contact and that in itself can be quite lonely right\nYeah so we did all the the ... if it was about their neighborhoods and and whether they would talk to people and also and it was interesting looking because we have people from all over the well take pause\nAnd in in nine countries in particular we were able to do more detailed comparisons and that we found that um the the UK and then and I'm from in the U.S has kind of comparable levels of letting us and India there was a bit lower in New Zealand which was interesting\nAnd we also looked in in terms of bigger regions we looked at a which countries\nAre places where people really value that independence and northern Europe has a place that would very much be the case and they have high levels of lending us in the countries where people were very independent than in the places where people tend to depend on each other more and be happy to depend on each other\nSo being independent does not necessarily a good thing now the prime minister added to see I told you said at times to levy aid loneliness and social isolation with wanting that millions of people were suffering from a lack of regular contact with us which is what you were pointing to in being independent how'd you sold this though what's the strategy\nWell we asked people what solutions they found it was for them and the closer to something as big as this to find out what is actually what for people for people they know that it is amazing\nUm number one was finding distracting activities or oh dedicating your time to work or study all hope is next for

different times you see heat waves in the u._k. and Scandinavia in particular\nWhich saw all time record highs and the also the heat waves that march with the weather patterns across Asia and you know go from almost all the way from Europe to like Japan\nOr some of these things are happening at the same time and solve them are displaced a little bit of time but basically most of the northern hemisphere was affected by heat waves at some point this summer\nMy own experience of this dramatic some it was the prolonged heat wave in the u._k. which reminded me as the previous record some weight back in Nineteen Seventy six when he was taking exams at school [noise] twenty Eighteen just squeaked into the record books on some counts\nFor England not the case a whole we ended up having the hottest summer on record the u._k. as a whole basically tied with some of the previous years\nBut it was a very substantial heat wave and the you know if you look at not the summer as a whole but individual days there were times where you had stations setting all time records\nI did that gets a little repetitious that we look at you know it's hot and still hot and it's going to get hotter and you know you can\nCompared to previous years so for example back in Nineteen Seventy six when the u._k. was having a major heat wave and the u._k. summer that was similar to the u._k. summer this year\nBut in that year it was only the u._k. though is having this major heat event whereas this year with the heat events you know spread\nAll across the world are those broad swath of heat\nAre you know one of the concerning factors of global warming\nAnd I guess for the u._k. also have to wait for four years to see that record broken boats on the other hand there have been quite a lot of hot summers in the past decade and I'll probably won't have to wait for another forty years for it to be broken again\nIn fact that the rate we're going by twenty fifty or so you would expect about half

waves shorter ones that different times of summer and the rest of the northern hemisphere and I think that well that's kind of what we asked\nWell maybe but I haven't\nThe hottest year on record is twenty sixteen an El Nino year when the conditions in the Pacific ocean put a huge amounts of extra heat into the atmosphere there was all kinds of remarkable weather event this year started out with a ... La Nina setting and I would imagine that twenty eight team was going to be calm about\nEvery year has some extremes the world is a big place after all but so many my impressions being that this is remarkable\nThat impression is absolutely correct and that's what made some are twenty eight teams so unique and so unprecedented\nThis is Michael Mann director of the systems science center at Penn State university\nIt wasn't just that there were these regional extremes in heat waves floods\nWildfires droughts um it was sort of the large scale\nCoherence to these events where they were breaking out or around the entire northern hemisphere and there's some interesting connections there that may hint at certain aspects of climate change and how climate changes impacting extreme weather events that aren't actually well captured in the climate models yet\nMichael Mann is well known as the author of the original hockey sticks jobs a gruff tossing global average temperature is over the centuries and revealing the dramatic increases in recent decades the first version was released Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight yeah fired up by another dramatic El Nino event\nHurricane Florence which quickly developed after long quiet season in the Atlantic\nNorth Carolina is still recovering from the flooding I called Florence a climate change triple threat climatologist Michael Mann was quick to link fronts to global warming up first of all the storm intensified very rapidly within a couple of days from a moderate tropical storm to\nA major category for hurricane\nUm that happened very quickly and we understand that warmer temperatures favor this phenomenon of rapid intensification now the stronger those storms the stronger the wins the more wind damage that can be done and there was a a fair amount of wind damage even doesn't weekend doesn't made landfall but here's the other thing\nWhen it was spinning out there off the Atlantic seaboard as a ... a monster category for storm for several days that build up a huge storm surge so it didn't really matter that the storm technically weekends to only a category one hurricane on the east coast of the U.S North Carolina in particular\nFelt the storm surge of a large category for storm and that did catastrophic flooding there's a town New Bern right on the coast it was basically in and day to do was flooded the entire downtown area was flooded well less than a year ago last October actually gave a talk at a church in New Bern North Carolina\nWhere I talked about the coastal risk associated with climate change and it was just a matter of time before new burned in the Carolina coast was going to suffer the consequences and sadly was prophetic because the very church where I spoke was flooded by this storm so there was the coastal flooding due to the storm surge\nAnd let's come back to those very warmer ocean temperatures there's a relationship to climate change there in the same temperatures that intensified the storm also meant that there was much more moisture in the storm\nMore moisture that it was able to turn into unprecedented rainfall when it made landfall and here's the final ingredient because what really made it a catastrophic flooding event just like Hurricane Harvey last year\nOnce it made landfall it just stayed there for several days continuing to rain on those same inland locations and there are no studies was a study published in nature earlier this year\nShowing that climate change is in fact leading to a greater tendency for these storms to stall when they make landfall and that was really the final climate change threat that we saw play out\n[noise] the last place I Want to look\nIs the region where climate change is having the Fox is effect in the Arctic it too has been affected by the unusual weather is twenty eight teams in fact the impact that were parents first says glaciologist Judy ... from the U.S national snow and ice data center\nWell we had record Los yes conditions over the winter and we look at you know if you look at air temperatures over the winter\nCertainly December was I think the one that we've recorded in January February when maybe the second warmest months out of the winters since Nineteen eighty so I mean definitely we had very unusual winter conditions Andy's winter warm temperatures are starting to impact the ice growth\nI mean it just seems to me about this is it gets warm when the sun's shining the main thing about the ... the shining the north pole on December the twenty second\nRight but what we have seen happening and then it has to the last um three winters as we're having these storms that are tracking up into the Arctic bringing warm moist air so in the wintertime if you have ... coming up to the Arctic they're actually going to bring in warm moist air that can help ... the surface even in the middle of winter\nUm whereas in the summertime if you have a cycling coming in usually that's especially with cooler conditions you're blocking sunlight and maybe you would have less the ice melt so the ... are different depending on what time of year the coming into the Arctic\nAnd and one thing we have noticed I mean we don't necessarily see a change in cycling frequency in the wintertime necessarily with the ice loss right now\nBut we are seeing maybe an increase frequency of extreme psych ones and they're starting to track further north so the ice age and winter's pushing for North end these cycles actually tracking it further than they used to which can impact the sea ice especially like in the care and the parents the where they usually come in in the wintertime\nDespite not very poor start the Arctic ice has not milk or the ... this summer as it did in twenty twelve the a ... a big regional storm pushed melting to the current record\nIn part that's because the flip side of those heat waves in the Americas Europe in Siberia has been a cold ... system was over the north pole but that's little comfort to Judy and ... who says the strong decline in Arctic ice is still in evidence for him the trend setter since the exceptional yeah twenty seven\nI Would say that this summer circulation patterns we had in two thousand seven if that happened today we would have a new record low because it was a very unusual summer as well not in terms of a big storm coming in and you had this high pressure that persisted over the Beaufort Sea\nAll summer long and under high pressure you tend to have clear skies do you have a lot of solar radiation hitting the ice that that was that high pressure was coupled with low pressure over Siberia for example\nAnd so what that did is it created a very strong pressure gradient between high and low pressure centers which brought more than ... from the south into the Arctic Sea funneled on this one went into the Arctic he also pushed the ice away from the coast of Siberia and Alaska towards the north pole\nAnd you help flush more I set of friends straight so all of those things happened\nAnd that was able to cause at first to record low that we saw in two thousand seven which also took scientists by surprise because we didn't think you could lose that much ice that quickly\nAnd it did show that the ice has become quite vulnerable to these unusual atmospheric patterns because the ISIS than enough now that if you have\nA very strong circulation pattern that sets up that will favor ice melt you going to lose a lot of ice very quickly\nIf you have a strong come in and depending on the time of year that it comes in and where it comes in because you have a vulnerable ice pack because it's then it can create a lot of damage and so what's happened in the Arctic is if the weather is benign you're still going to have less sea ice but it won't be as dramatic\nBut if you had the dramatic weather pattern that comes in you're going to lose a lot of ice very quickly\nAnd I think that's what we're seeing is just that vulnerability has increased for having a dramatic ice loss event\nIt's definitely a matter of when not if for the melting records will be broken\nLight ended with the opposite because he's the rapidly changing conditions that many scientists suspect artist stapling whether fall away I'll be talking about that in next week's edition of discovery with the BBC and those pushing the view include climatologist Michael Mann\nWho says we should smart not to the connection between global warming and changing whether\nGlobal warming doesn't cause a meteor logical event to happen what it does is it can take that event and it can intensified in various ways\nHurricanes can become stronger they can carry more moisture with them and deal more flooding potential and or even these mid latitude storm systems can become much greater flooding threats in these high pressure centers in the summer\nAre becoming deeper and hotter and that's where we're seeing record breaking heat and drought and wildfires break out so it's intensifying these weather systems in a way\nThat is doing great damage and it's a relevant to ask did climate change you know caused this storm to form\nIt's a question we can never really answered the better question is once this storm began to form was it intensified by climate change and we now have great confidence that in many ways the answer is yes\nOne year ago a gunman opened fire on a music festival in Las Vegas guilty of the people and wounded hundreds more we'll hear from one survivor who helped others confront the aftermath today on

that risk\nQuite well do schemes like this imply for China's growing mountain of debt business daily from the BBC [noise]\nLet's begin today's program that was the latest news a bit of positive economic news as well\nThe United states and Canada have settled that trade differences for the time being at least enough to sign a revised deal a successor to the NAFTA agreement loan decried by president Donald Trump this came right at the last minute before Trump imposed deadline on Sunday\nThe deal will result in free markets ferret trade and robust economic growth in our region according\nTo integrate statement between the two countries Canada's prime minister Justin Trudeau was asked about the deal by reporters as he left his office late last night [noise]\nA good day for Canada you may just to put it that lower agree but for me ... sees me the R B the wealth management company she told the BBC's dominant Laurie ah earlier today that this came as a great relief off to say much trade disruption of\nLight it appears that we had seen some concessions on really three key contentious issue that was really sticking points in the agreement so one is around the Gary ... in Canada and the supply management is quite a protected industry that we are things that that will be open somewhat to the to other markets like the U.S and Mexico\nBut as well when we look at that

... and the fact that\nThreats on Canadian Idol have is I'm likely to be an issue so it does look to be favorable for for all parties involved\nAs you say well so dramatic wasn't it was ... sort of that and just in the last few months before the midnight deadline of last night with with trade ministers flying around the place or do you think is a bit of a template there for for what might happen between the U.S and China the much bigger trade well which is blaming\nWell I think it is positive for risk sentiment I Would say that it does signal the fact that we could see more conciliatory tone between the U.S and China emerge that I Would say that's more of a medium term issue and really near term it's going to be continued further escalation with the trade to get on those two parties\nKnow recover talking to them and make a comment well as indicated President Trump's trade war with China\nDoes show no sign of slowing down of the my last weekend which eased fresh terrorists on two hundred billion dollars worth of Chinese imports joined in return is added sixty billion\nDollars all of us products to import tariff list all of this spot by Mr Trump's accusations that China has been seeking to steal us intellectual property limited access to its marketing unfairly subsidizing state owned Chinese companies\nI'm joined now in the studio by a George magnets he's a former chief economist UPS he's got a new book red flags white Chinese why she's China is under threat\nChina on George is our big theme in today's program first off do you see any reason for optimism here that this North American deal might pave the way for Trans Pacific they\nTold a no not really because I think the um the the discussion is which the United states has been having with Mexico and Canada\nUm are really about the terms under which the country's trade with one another [noise]\nThe terrorists or the ... war the trade war that's going on between the American China is sensibly about the terms of trade but actually underneath it's really much more existential it's about uh the struggle for technological leadership\nOr for middle treat dominance and about the rules and regulations governing accepted rules and regulations governing industrial policy intellectual property and so on as you indicated just now and I ... I think\nUh this is going to go on for quite some time I mean Jack Ma recently founder of Ali Baba uh recently said he felt betrayed well would go on for Twenty years I don't know about that but it's very difficult to see an off ramp at the moment\nHow um how are they affecting China's economy do we know yet\nAh too early to say yeah well I mean it is beginning to clip 'em at the margin that the Chinese economy um be a very closely watched series of business sentiment indicators for September or who just came out actually before we were on their\nUm indicated that the economy had a we can through September and then we export sector of the economy was beginning to um contracts actually at the margin\nA so I'm obviously it's not the biggest thing in China because China is not really a kind of a such a trade dependent economy anymore but it's it's big but it has a lot of\nInfluence over your employment and ah ah conditions for companies particularly in the coastal areas\nYes and we do know that we already that China's internal 'cause he was the mom was decreasing that has been a chilling effect in recent years on on on China's own economies that have been precious they're ready for president she\nI'm I'm I think the reason for that just because at the beginning of two thousand and Seventeen\nUm China embarked on this I'm a sort of crack down on finance to try to um a kind of eliminate but certainly clamp down on the most egregious forms of risk taking and financial malpractice and it's been quite successful in some respects\nOr in the sense that um you know leverage in the economy borrowing and bad behavior by a by banks and financial companies actually has been cut tiles and so the consequences\nAnd she has been we can economic growth and and or weakening investment\nWe're gonna come back to all of that in just a moment George stay with us a China has general worries of course one of them is this debt problem and it's often brought about where it seems

following friday's earthquake Jason ... is a geophysicist who works for the consulting firm ... teaches a humble State University in California he explained why he had been surprised\nBecause the earthquake was a strike slip type of an earthquake where the crust move side by side as a geologist we did not expect slamming possibly as large as the ... that happened\nOne of the different types of earthquake then what sort of a quake would you expect to cause a scenario of this size\nSo earthquakes that are the result of compression workplace move towards each other tends to cause vertical lands motion\nAnd it is this type of vertical land motion that lifts the water column and elevates it so that there is gravitational potential in that water and that water falls down and that is what starts to ... strike slip earthquakes they move side by side and typically they don't\nGenerate very much vertical land motion however we do have examples of that in twenty sixteen there were an earthquake in the works in base in southwest of ... there was a large strike slip fault earthquake there and it cost us an army in addition in Nineteen Ninety nine the is much turkey earthquake\nCaused a tsunami however the strike slip tsunamis are much smaller in size\nThen generated by a conversion earthquakes like a along any subduction zone so it might be other factors involved in this one yes we have observed on social media and on\nPost earthquake satellite imagery that there have been extensive and large landslides\nOn land and then also landslides along the shoreline and so this is the second possible cause force nominees is that from a submarine landslide when submarine landslide happens that submarine landslide can also cause displacement of water and that\nDisplacement of the water can generate a sin army and certainly clear when you're talking about a landslide you're talking about one below sea level yes in order for a landslide to cause the nominee would it would need to be below sea level of course the landslide could start out on land\nAnd then move into the water or the landslide could be a submarine landslide entirely under water so how will you\nOr others go about verifying exactly what happened and why the soon on me was so big\nWell it will be important for people who want to investigate this to\nTake a research vessel into ... bay and the ocean north of ... bay and collect detailed bath a metric data information about the shape of the fee for to see if they can locate a landslide\nIt is possible that there were enough landslides that were small enough that would not be you know ...\nFrom a ship but that would be one way of testing the hypothesis that landslide was responsible in Nineteen Ninety eight there is a earthquake off the shore of pop in New guinea and\nThis earthquake causation army the nominee had higher than expected wave heights and run up elevations and afterwards scientists went there and

I mean if they were in the cracks location\nUnfortunately those bully that an army warning system could not have helped the people in the region of ... because the earthquake was so close to them and\nThe earthquake and the landslides being the likely source for the nominee was so close to them that we need to emphasize that people who live in earthquake country who are along the coast and exposed to potential nominee hazards they need to recognize that the earthquake is they're warning and so\nIts one thirty one I'm heady Lynn ... seniors\nThe K PCC voter game plan is our commitment to help you stay engaged and informed on the November election edits why we re launched the voter game plan page at LA is that kind of\nWill help you registered to vote you can ask our reporters election related questions will even send you text reminders about important election deadlines\nIts voter friendly and easy to use just go to L.
