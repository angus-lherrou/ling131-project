FCC decibels just cranking that out the name of jets became more Hampton [noise]\n... like you're in a hundred and twenty pounds worth of kids and scrambled to the top of the truck get your weapon mounted [noise] I was a gun or I had my head about the top just scanning scanning like a maniac when you're moving across open ground\nWall scanning\nSweating profusely\nFeminine like I I notice public radio since the knowledge you've probably never make it on air but it really is like just doing a fat rail [noise]\nTo have eight guys moving in a in a file of through a neighborhood it's the it's the point of the mission where you're most expose where you're most vulnerable\nYou have to maintain almost complete silence because aside from the sound of the wind maybe some dogs barking there is no sound\nLike so for Seventy two hours straight it's like basically like I'm being in church because any sounds could like compromise you and potentially get every body that you love killed\nAt the moment that story takes place how long have you been in country or how many of these missions you been\nSo this was probably the seventh or eighth mission that I'd been on the mission started out typically it felt completely the same as any other mission\nSo it's probably like a around midnight or one or one or two o'clock in the morning we approached the building and before I've even gotten like a chance to drop my rock\nLike my best friend comes up to me and uh he just looks really shook him up\n\nAnd he's like dude there's something wrong here there's just something bizarre so immediately and working in this place is the first thing that I noticed was this Sam [noise]\n\nDescendent no way it sounded almost like a like a broken radio in down the hall [noise]\nCompletely a tone\nAn entirely disquieting on hold from Sam [noise]\nAlmost sounded like a congregation of whispers [noise]\nLike thousands of voices trying to communicate something but in a completely nonsensical\nReally won the the point where I felt like something was really different this time [noise]\nI decided that you know is going to look around some of the upper floors\nSo as I was walking around like that the second story I came into this one room that it was\nStripped bare simple cement more\nI don't know ... some too but I turned to face the interior uh\nAnd just saw that the wall was pockmarked with bullet holes with round so I was standing there looking at these pockmarked wall it just seemed like something wasn't right that these they weren't typical\nMy squad leader and showed me this like pencil trick you can insert like a pencil and into like small arms fire against a wall it'll tell you like the direction that the fire it come from this being the second story I put the pimps are\nInto the wall and it's a very little to the ground just sticking in like\nIt meant that those shots had been fired straight across\nSoon as I said ... everything fell into place\nThis had been killed for him but they had to lined people up in here and just\nExecuted them and I just felt a little keys in my stomach standing in a kill house [noise]\nInstantly just don't like the walls just collapsed in on themselves don't really claustrophobic and I just needed to get them out of the room\nIt seemed like there was a maligned presence there [noise]\nThat was trying to get\nSomebody killed and it was totally inexplicable you have to imagine\nThat all of this is I'm under the backdrop under the soundtrack of this just this before [noise]\nJust this ever present oral presidents\nJust feeling that you were feeling well we're all the I didn't know what that like the ball and like anxiety and\nThere's like a there's an under current of tension\nIt wasn't like a we all huddled together in a circle and are trading back and forth there was people would pair off with their best friend and be like do you would not believe what just happened nobody's going to talk about that because you're showing weakness I think that if one\nPerson were to stand up and be like goes kinda scary we would have written them apart\nSo we're left with all of this downtime and so you have now like half a dozen twenty year old children and one of the number one pastimes on these as Katie's is looting someone is like hey there's a storage unit down first floor\nAnd that immediately became something that all of us jumped onto\nBecause it it gives you a chance I guess like um to prove that you're not afraid to know goes to prove that you're not scared as soon\nAs that call goes out like yeah you know what yeah yeah yeah man all\nOn route to these people that I Know business and it's almost like a an affront to whatever was there it was just like a a gated off a unit on the first floor and I walked over\nThere and they really yeah basically like a storage space I mean exactly like a storage space and there's just a very simple\nSymmetrical wrought iron gate on front [laughter]\nDoes wrought iron gates are so loud that three of us walked up and got really low to the ground and just grab the gay on the bottom and just lived a quarter inch\nAnd then quietly walk backwards so that the gates not rubbing against the ground so that it wouldn't be allowed at all\nWe left the gate like prop all the way home and [noise]\nSo I think about half a dozen of us go into this a storage unit\nOr turn the tables chairs closing decoration silverware all\nKinds of things it smells like dust\nBowl\nAnd it's pitch black\nAnd the only light\nIn the storage area is coming from or a little a little red tack light [noise] it's already like three layers of spooky like we couldn't even use our ... our night vision goggles because it's so dark there's so little\nAmbient light and not really for looting anyways because uh you know you really want to yeah needed there's there's an art to this ... ... it's\n\nOf course it's the middle of the night I I didn't know what to do\nAnd [noise]\nDidn't sleep in that room for weeks I Would sleep on the couch all the lights on for about three weeks I did that me and the cat\nAfter he saw the figure at the end of its bad side would sometimes standing sister's house for a couple of nights you felt like he just couldn't hack it staying in the apartment and so he decides to buy his own home he bought a property\nNearby and construction on a brand new house\nFinally and house was built he and the kids were delighted out at the apartment\nI'm In my room was mostly empty was the middle of the day we're getting a last loads of things into the truck [noise] uh I think there were probably just some toys throwing into a box and\nRemember [noise]\nRealizing that it felt like someone was behind me\nI didn't really look up this is kind of a familiar sensation at this point\nThings the way I see a white figure\nIt was an mistake of all [noise] um\nSpeak up all my cat ... definitely felt the apartments contests\nAnd now they are they're they felt like they could do something with that but the place\nAnd they got to the new house fads that the kids down hold him something he keeping themselves for a while\nThe person who had recommended and helped me find this apartment was a co worker myself\nAnd um this is about two months after we moved into the apartment and I actually hadn't seen them you know we talk on the phone occasionally for work and things like that and uh we're setting up our table and he just says so how's the apartment\nAnd\nI didn't know how to say it to him and I I said you know I said Philly and I think I'm Crazy\nI I feel like it's haunted and he\nLooks at me and says yeah I'm\nSure it is\nI didn't want to tell you because I Know how badly you needed the apartment it isn't nice apartment and my friends had the apartment but [noise] the previous landlady hunger and stuff in the attic\nAnd it all kinda clicked when he said that like my God I'm not crazy something is there\nTo use an addict all the owners belongings Catherine stops the kitten hanging from the bad PR one friend Mike in cat to all the pieces together [noise]\nNot really used they never went back to the house [noise] well except for one time [noise]\nI had picked up catcher and once you as a we had moved out we were living in Concord I have a new house and she was at some\nParty was a Halloween party it is following\nAnd I went to pick her up along with another friend Zoe\nAnd they were going to say she was going to stay over the house in Concord and they start talking about\nYou know Halloween and the whole thing that we went through with this apartment in Manchester and then as I'm driving they said what it'd be really fun\nTo go to the house on Halloween Night finally I was like okay All right we're going to take a quick detour and we're going to go and then we're going right back we\nAre driving toward the street and I said to the kids'\nChatter and enjoying when it'd be funny if the addict like was on and we drive up to the house\nAnd lo and behold\nThe to dorm rooms with the windows there the shades were pulled up three quarters of the way down but the addict like was on and that freaked me out [noise]\nI went to the end of the street\nTurned around to go back home and we had a drive by the house together\nAnd it's a small street you really can't go fast I drove by the how slow creepy is thing was when we drove\nBy the house the shades that previously were down three quarters of the way down had up all the way\nIt was almost as if she saw us put the blinds up and wanted a good look at us\nI I said you know what I'm just not comfortable being here and actually to this day I won't go anywhere near the house if someone said I'll give

really divided families have split couples are arguing friends are not talking anymore because of\nDifferent political views and that's because we have on one side a candidate who belongs to the work

very\nHot a highly controversial ... from the extreme right ... ... who\n... ... bodies that this whole a wave of far right has swept the world at also Brazil included\nI said some people have regarded his comments as homophobic and racist I mean there's not much mistakes treating them is that if you Google is comments that pretty shocking stuff\nWhile they are here's a far right politician he was not an outsider as Donald Trump\nBut he has been in Congress for the last twenty eight years but he was not so much well known for\nHis proposals or bills that he managed to approving Congress he wants to much more well known for these highly controversial remarks\nThat he made on such a number of topics like we're in the ... community and the military rule in Brazil he's suffering since that he would rather have a that some that are gay son he said that he would not pay the same salary to a woman as a man and he said but the biggest mistake of Brazil's dictatorship\nWhich lost it for Twenty one years in Brazil was the fact that they tortured and killed their political opponents\nThis election is weird to many outside observers and I'll tell you principally why this is this is just an opinion we've got Lula da Silva former presidents and leader of the Workers Party who is in prison if he will not in prison we know that he would almost certainly when the election\nSo the fact that so much support has gone to ... ... means that many people who are\nKeen supporters of the former president and the Workers Party have switched to the opposite end of the political spectrum almost overnight\nYeah throughout dirt on a number of things but we have to understand first of all Lula had to drop out of the race because he was buried for for running for elections this year because of because of Brazil stopped electoral court we must remember that he was arrested\nAnd then he couldn't run for re elected to the elections again so are his vice presidential candidate for a number that had to step up\n... hula remains a very popular figure in Brazil many people relate\nTo his image and government as as very booming eras of Brazil's economy so that's why he managed traumatic so many votes are in today's elections but it would be very difficult to predict what would have happened if you have to ... he was\nA he had a sizeable lead over the other front runners I

I've seen reports that Twitter ... sat messages being filled with\nWith with campaign material oversee from both sides do you think that's how the material influence on the way the campaigns played out\nDefinitely not fair I think that social media played a huge role in this year's elections specially because of the number of fake news that we've seen ... in the run up to the elections there has been a lot of that\n... ... right before a the the election day but I Would say on top of everything that we've already discussed it was saying earlier that there's this feeling of Disney parliament ah in today's society about the political system but also there is a there is no doubt that Brazil has shifted towards the rights\nAnd or in the last few years field by a number of reasons like the

response was that you know that she hadn't seen in eight years it was the first time she'd seen something and she suddenly was overwhelmed with the feeling that she might lose this again that it is it something that she's getting back but she is this\nFear of loss came over her and interestingly that I'm sensation was even more powerful a when we were able to stimulate at one point and she saw color rather than just a flash of light light\nBut getting back to your original question I think the psychological component of this type of work is extremely\nImportant and so I I think it's something um we have to be very cognizant about we need to think about psychologist needs to be involved in these types of studies but we just don't have enough experience to really know how this is going to impact\nOr these patients but it's something we are a monitoring and a assessing on an ongoing basis\nWhat NATO's touched on is that this type of pet can affect people very differently\nFor

Germany to meet the bureau to meet Hitler he had all sorts of plans about what he was going to talk about in terms of Hitler's the moms on Czechoslovakia but what happened was that\nSame morning on German radio there was this top story which was everywhere\nThe story was that a three hundred so Dayton German civilians is German species living in Czechoslovakia\nUh being murdered by check place when Hitler and Chamberlain Matt Chamberlain said what I'd like to talk about this this and this and Hitler basically said to him in the lives of this massacre we need to act\nImmediately that is essential for us to help these three million Germans in Czechoslovakia\nBecause their lives are in immediate danger and Chamberlain his on so it was very well and off to the talks which Chamberlain did agree that Britain would agree to Hitler annexing parts of Czechoslovakia\nIt turned out that there was not any truth a tool in this story but it was a story that was everywhere on the gym and media and it spreads around the world to German was propaganda\nSo this was fake news of its die you have this new at the time shiny me Jim ... and like us that it was associated with all ... and other words people tend to trust that they would like to\nBelieve it I think what's really interesting is that even if people didn't trust it even if people knew that they are being told lies\nIt changed the atmosphere it introduced elements of doubt I mean that was one of the things that was very clever about Hitler's propaganda to neighboring countries that would ... the seeds of doubt or it would introduce elements of\nAnti Semitism let's say which wasn't there in the chicken Slovak media for example the other thing was that\nThere would be these invented atrocities\nWhich even if they weren't true\nThere was this sense and yeah it didn't happen but it might have happened and it might happen and in fact a sense of unease and the sense of fear and then the sad thing is that among people who wanted to believe and who sympathized with the Nazis they could\nKnow full well that they were being told Layton lies\nBut they would think well you know a propagandist lever a than the others and and may not be true but it's going to serve this future truth which trumps the current reality\nWhat about the ... logical approaches what comparisons if any can we might between rage in

even you are and it meant that people would use that as being bombarded with global information constantly which was being constantly updated as well you know every news but it would bring a slightly different\nReality it was the beginning of a very media centered world and there's one moment when the ... government announced live on radios that he's had agreed in principle to sacrifice part of its territory to Germany\nThat was immediately a huge demonstration and the central ...\nAnd the crowd moved north towards the government building but towards the radio belly even more interestingly they actually managed to break into the radio building\nAnd one of the people actually go into the studio and sat down at the microphone and started rather in articulate the bus nonetheless with a very clear message saying we don't want to ... to what Hitler is demanding and\nThis actually went out on that and so it was an interesting example of the consumers of of radio talking back so it was

membranes are available in black or gray or town or a green or whites many cars out there\nThe simplest thing to do would be to choose the white version of the roof\nOn the other hand we know that there'll be many buildings where the roof can be seen from the streets and this will mean that the\nBuilding's owner or perhaps the buildings architect will seek a color other than whites\nWe can do that to only about half of sunlight is visible\nIf you want to have a reflective roofs that is not white but will still stay cool in the sun you can focus on reflecting the half of the sunlight that you can't see you can for example get a red roof\nThat reflects only twenty percent of the visible lights giving it it's red color but at the same time reflects about sixty percent of the invisible

political leaders that one juicy when the financial crisis happened\nWithin the rich countries the crisis fuel to power shift towards populist an anti authoritarian politicians and contributed to the rising resentments elites globally it accelerates at the LBJ shift to China and Asia\nIn this program I'm going to ask whether the lessons from the financial crisis have being lumped in with the country's in a better prepared to meet the next one will always condemned to another crisis perhaps even more severe which would provide new fuel to the fines of populism\nIn two thousand eight the world was taken by surprise will it be again\nI also Christina God the managing director of the international Monetary Fund which is the global institution responsible for financial stability what worries her most top of the list is a populist politics protectionism and attempts to wind back the regulations on banks\nNumber one it's the risk of inward looking policies where people are no longer prepared to share to trade to cooperate and all that together that's one the second is the risk that we feel suddenly that really improve the situation in the financial systems are working well the banks capitalized\nThe insurance companies are operating under more stringent rules\nAnd the risk is that suddenly there is a relaxation we begin streamlining Lee began relaxing the rules we begin lowering the threshold to begin reducing\nThe capital we begin opening up yet again the gate of creativity inventiveness applied to the financial sector which has its good but also many bad aspects to it\nFor dime coil professor of public policy at Cambridge University and a former adviser to the u._k. treasury and there's not a failure of economics which I've discussed in last week's program but rather the political failure to confront the banking system which is her biggest concern\nI'm kind of worried that that could be another financial crisis and the hasn't been enough done and I certainly think it's a problem of economists not analyzing it ... and I think it's a question is\nFinished ... will end confrontation that if I pass thanking them any kind of nice he's been saying why

but at the same time integration has brought new into dependencies and vulnerabilities [noise]\nThe financial crisis was the first big demonstration of how integration and accelerating technological change can lead to contagion spread new risk [noise]\nThat is what I call the butterfly effect of globalization which screws on the evidence from physics of how complex systems can have unpredictable and even chaotic outcomes [noise]\nRisk management to finance failed to take account of cross border flows and new technologies and for this reason was simply unfit for purpose have lessons being lumped my fear is that while the regulators have been a pains to remedy the cause of the last crash is insufficient\nAttention to news threats and particularly those that may originally from outside finance\nChristina God emphasizes the need to move beyond the conventional wisdom\nAnd to avoid a backward looking approach\nI passed on content is that the next crisis comes from nowhere in other words from the place where we have no idea that it will come from\nFrom an area that we regard as safe and secure at the moment but which will suddenly and under the radar screen for a period of time suddenly blue and threaten the stability that we have and that is something which we care about and\nWe have a lot of the ... alert system is that bring our research is and um you know members of

and\nWell yeah I Am personally you know even as a viewer and I've always myself chosen to look at it like\nThe Y. part of it so yeah but you know film like prisoners as violence right but I think that there's a sense of morality I actually think it's conflict it you know your lead character is\nResponding in a violent way and I don't think it's looked upon you know with shiny eyes um that's I think maybe it's okay you know I Hope I'm not just justifying it but I mean I Try to look at things and go with the cost of this you know twelve years a slave there's a lot of violence but this is you know a story that that has a value\nIn and also frankly like actually a little squeamish even though I've done a lot of dark material emotionally I um\nI don't respond well to to just pilots for violence
