{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Because you know now I just want to get a a a measles use these ones when they're trying to weigh female in a kind of a feed of strength contest right [noise]\nSo that's a fascinating part about the songs is that we know that they use their horns and their horns are important for fighting other males especially fighting other males away from us territory of food territory but it seems as if the females don't actually pay any attention to the horns\nThemselves so the males sing and set of uh instead of using their horns with a female courtship at all\nI'm Ira Flatow this is science friday from WNYC studio so let me get this straight to have these big long horns but through the females you know it makes sense that they sing instead and that's when that's the that's the sound that we are let's hear would listen to the sound of the song [noise]\n\nWill join I go to another beetle that's the that's love [laughter] sure as\nWhat what is what it can you decipher anything that's going on in the summers are just something that the other beetles know about\nSo right now we're trying to figure out how the song might be connected to qualities of the male itself like how big is maybe how uh\nHow much energy he has or how well fed he is because in court ships songs across the animal kingdom think about the songbirds in your backyard\nThese songs and and the complexity and their volume and all these other other little details of the songs on selves are used to communicate something about the singer to the receiver and from a male to female that might be saying hey I'm big on bad on strong\nOr something like that and so right now we're in the process of going through the recordings are like you just heard that I've\nGot in my lab to see if there's any patterns between big and small males how fast they saying a loud they saying stuff like that\nSo you actually have a little beetles recording studio\nI sure do I I made it out of 'em out of some sound absorbent materials some nice foam on the inside and I set up a\nWhole little hole will set up and had a nice little piece of bark for the Beatles to hang out on and a and a video camera and microphone so it was it was a legitimate set up\n[laughter] I'm I'm I'm fascinated about what they are doing to make that sound how's how's that sound produced\nSo I personally think it's something very similar to a cricketer grasshoppers raft and file and so I think that there is sort of a a ridge to wash board structure on the abdomen that they're moving against a hard parts of the wing covers\nUm the\nActual the lights are that you see on on the back of the Beatles I think they're moving that up and down across much like nails on a wash board um another way to insects make squeaking sounds though is by\nForcing air out through holes in the abdomen through which they breed called spirit calls if you've ever seen a hissing cockroach a they don't have a mouse they don't produce that sounded things are mouth structure that's actually from their abdomen so that's another possibility\nSo so the whole ritual goes like well you have these two male big beetles with the big warns and they fight for the right to woo the female the one who wins vantage plays her a song that basically what we're we have going here\nYeah basically and and what else would you know would you like to know about them if I could give you my sixty four dollar question and I'm I'm limited check which I don't have what would you what would you do what would you construct how would you use what would you like to know\nUm I Would like to know and this is what we're trying to figure out in the lab but right now the biggest question is what are females looking for in males and is it different than the competitive traits that we already know are important in the competition side of things\nEven in the Beatles community that's what the question is what our [laughter] our is this is a a they joined a gym is the age old question um and so how many beetles have you studied do you think\nOh gosh over the years well in our first population a and we caught at least eight hundred nails in one summer it was they were everywhere my uh my old mentor described as like a plague of needles [laughter]\nThere yeah I guess that's in good description of a group of

forty years that has restored Europe to become a global powerhouse of leading science area Ken I'm In my opinion\nIs the ease with which people can interact and move across Europe of course funding is part of it the funding allows movement that allows collaboration\nBut I think mobility of people allows exchange of ideas exchange of expertise different ways of looking at problems and that's always been important for science\nIn point I mean you clearly being very mobile and you're in Korea so one of these days the mobility brings to an individual's orange juice\nI think what village he shakes

fish there is a book called you in a fish which place on the idea is a fish with the stocks of us all four hundred and fifty million years or so ago\nBut when and how they evolved and spread has long been a puzzle Lawrence island of the University of Pennsylvania has thrown a lot of ... the boss was recalled to work out this important question\nAll our ancestors during the earliest time period or fishes so we had a backbone and these are the first things that have bone and gills which is why they start to show up in the fossil record at this time\nWhat was very apparent ... the fossil record you have from the times is incredibly patchy\nYes so one of the issues that we were actually\nTrying to look at is why it's so patchy why is it that in the earliest stages of vertebrate evolution and we only find bits and pieces of things that look like scales are looked like they might be skull and only in very restricted area as\nIt presents a problem for us because we can't really determine what these pieces are necessarily and it also brings up a question of why are there are so few of them this early on\nI mean how fish like oh the ... talking about would we recognize them very readily as being really to to try out and called\nNo so they're actually pretty different so back during this time period most of them are armored they look more or less like clams shells with tails at one end and I like headlights at the other end\nWe recognize him as fish because our concept of fish is pretty simple I mean any five year old kids raw fish but they wouldn't look anything like the kinds of rape and fishes that we're familiar with today which includes ...\nWhat you've done is even though you're saying that the fossil record is fried ... there's enough of it future for basically a lot of heavy statistics are the problem of how these things evolve\nAbsolutely so over that time period we had more than twenty seven hundred different records of different fossils found in different locations and because of the way fossils are preserved because they are preserved in the bottom in the sediment we can determine the environment those from the rock in case in the fossil itself\nAnd also the invertebrates that we find there and so that gives us a lot of information about where we're actually seeing the fossils and we do see them and we can use this to reconstruct where their ancestors should have been\nSo that they were four hundred million years ago swimming around like die the sink to the bottom of the ocean and you can recognize what kind of stretching the walls from the safe being buried and\nAbsolutely so sometimes we see corals buried along with them so we know they were at a rape sometimes we see that it's a river bottom that it has the classic river rocks and conglomerate\n... came ... this was the idea that there was some kind of environment that was more conducive to fish evolution than others\nYeah so the assumption from studies of modern fishes and studies of invertebrates is that everything sort of originates at coral reefs coral reefs are really complex they have a lot of life a lot of opportunities but in these earliest reefs we just weren't seeing anything that was recognized simply a fish that had bone\nAnd so the thought was well maybe it's just preservation of biased maybe they should be there or are they actually coming in somewhere else that explains felt this bad\nRecord and their early evolutionary history and so what conclusion did become too so what we found is that vertebrates in fact just as the ... adjusted were highly restricted to pretty much coastal waters but you would call lagoon if you went to a tropical island well ahead\nOf the reef and that they continue to originate and diversify their for something like a hundred and twenty million years so every major group all the way up through sharks or own ancestors the bony fishes\nShows up in this really restricted habitat away from the reefs and basically anything else\nSo I mean how deep when you sing in title ... to be in these things\nBasically from the actual beach to about thirty meters at the most but well above say where wave action would be occurring during a heavy storm\nThat's absolutely true they they go home ocean to ... to live and like you know they live more ocean and memories land and they all just plugging as far as you can go to these coastal regions\nExactly and it's not to clear to us why they're doing that at this point it may be that there's more nutrients there that they face less competition from the early ancestors of insects and sea scorpions which are already in resetting at that time and swimming around and maybe eating tidy fishes if they come across them\nAnd it's like at this from what you're saying that the sort of the innovation was going on in these coastal waters but they may have spread out they could have gone to other parts of the ocean as if all over new species all the new lineages seem to be born in these very interesting coastal regions\nAbsolutely so it seems that invasions of the other parts of the ocean is heavily dependent on the sort of traits the sort of forums that they take out in the shallow environments\nSo it's really only those fishes that happened to be streamlined and flexible and more active swimmers that then later on invade the reefs in the open ocean the truth of it is that fish is actually move into freshwater first which I don't think anybody would have expected\nThat's very interesting also that sort of facts that you know talking of hour and a fish the front the first round animals are thought to be fish that social just started coming up on the beach it sounds like they were ... to do that kind of expression from the beginning\nYes it does seem that way and it's another good analogy because it's the same situation where you have traits that show up in some shallow water environment like limbs in lungs or the other traits have ... which are land animals and then that's being used to move into a new environment that without any\nFurther incredible change until much later\nLawrence Arlen who study appeared today in science and if you'd

appeal\nI think he had his timing has been excellent he was quietly in Congress for twenty eight years and now he has made his move he tapped into the disc contend the frustration of voters the corruption the poor state services the economic recession the job losses\nHe manages to present this blend of social conservatism but also mixes with the economic liberal lives in in his particular vague proposals so he presents these proposals that perhaps I'll bet to reassure investors\nCapital markets both international and domestic have been very ... listening to what type of ... and worked as it's been going on\nThe simplistic solutions sometimes present it may be exactly what people feel is will the would like to hear at this moment\nAnd he is very good at talking he doesn't say much while he talks but that's the point sometimes and I think that is really life at the heart of his success cutting into the mood\nSo let's think about the background to all of this you mentioned the timing Mary talks to just give us a sense of the state of Brazil's economy\nTo the state of the economy it is just gr actually imaging out to a recession unprecedented two year recession alongside the recession job unemployment has\nReally rocketed up from about six percent before the recession started in twenty uh fourteen uh all the way up to about twelve touching percent in recent years alongside the recession the fiscal management the poor fiscal management of the previous government to beat the governments have been exposed\nBrazil's public debt is Seventy seven percent of GDP some six point two percent of that goes just to interest payments\nThe budget is is in a situation where primaries surpluses of the early years the boom years if you're like under President Lula have absolutely disappeared so that they got enough and living beyond its means really well beyond its means and with Luke Luke effort to meet\nTo well I should say the current government has made efforts to reform but it is a very fruit a weakened government I'd of very divided Congress such if I'm there you'll you'll agree I think\nIn the background I entirely and just like to it's a two or three comments one is that it's been the longest recession ever registered in Brazil in history\nAnd the recovery is the slowest ever registered in the Brazilian history so it's hard to imagine from outside the levels social frustration and Brazil\nEspecially when you consider that prior to that there has been a lot of upward social ability and Brazil from two thousand and three until two thousand and ten so that the emergence of new so called new middle class\nIn this so called middle class has been severely hit by the recession\nNo laundered that this bogus residents society who had voted for the

current military leadership Brazil lived ... minute treat it tastes\nFor more than two decades it came to an end though need in Nineteen eighty five learn to accept what do you think uh both in our government would look like would it have militaristic aspect\nCertainly he has had many military advisors or his vice presidential candidate is a ... a recently retired military general but it's worth remembering that he in fact approached sudden traditional politicians to join his ticket and they ordered refused so\nThe military was certainly have more influence in government he's\nLikely to appoint ministers who are retired military men\nBut the military in the sense of the currently operating armed forces I think at this point the off to trying to not get drawn into let's say this new adventure [laughter] if you want\nA Monica who to do think it's less sacrificing perhaps some of Brazil's democratic credentials if that ... and security by moving closer to the minute tree\nThe fact that he's a former military that in itself\nFor many people raised flags but you know I think that the military can be very helpful in many areas of ... of you need we need stronger\nThe fans are in the in our borders right I Would hope that the fight against drug trafficking will take away from the borders and not in the middle of the cities\nBut it's that ... is that Brazil's biggest problem and what is it is because a lot of the weapons we were getting a lot of the trade of weapons is it just huge and and they are the tree or it's not a role for the police or the borders for the military\nAnd I've heard from people from find a campaign that they also want to use the military for infrastructure projects in the interior of the country which the military has expertise right I'm not really don't\nKnow is that or is that usual to have the ... would it be welcomed do you think in any country to have the met at tri\n... involved in in in the interior\nWhen in Brazil I think there is a huge sensitivity about the Amazon I'm having a foreign presidents in the Amazon and such that extend the sort of nationalist\nView of Brazil security which is of course the typical view many countries will have but in this particular circumstance does imply in some way that they will be a military presence along the border\nAnd given the scale of organized crime happening on the voter\nVery often that seems to be broadly acceptable in Brazilian society I think the more important distinction however about the role of the military is on the issue of its attitude it's very nationalist and interventionist aptitude to where it's growth and development\nThe Brazilian ministry has a very strong traditionally has always had a very strong vocational most to boost Brazil's development\nAnd I didn't hear international markets have got to slightly I think or do\nThey think that both tomorrow will be very economically liberal but if he has a lot of military presence in his future cabinet uh then I don't see how they can expect to realize the sort of economic liberal version that his economic advisor to get this talks about\nCan I can name jak there I mean I understand your concern but I think they have um been very clear about is if you read their program for a governor that the one number one thing that they keep heating on it's just the need to reduce the size of the state\nMost of them are in many in many reviews acknowledge that there was a role for state involvement in the economy especially in the beginning of undecided edition of the country the Nineteen forties Nineteen fifties but nowadays a large state disassociated with corruption ... associated corruption and there are a lot of studies that support that\nHis government is clearly one that the fans the reduction of the size of the state the reduction of spending he's already has a plan to reduce the number of ministries and the people who are a leading his economic team\nThey have a very clear record of being very pro market and fraud literally forms\nOr history Monica nothing is very clear about what you\nJust read you know from from from\nWell I'm On the governor for eight years I don't know how this things worse and realize\nThis coalition has been put together hastily right and you have different groups\nThat do not necessarily see eye to eye in various issues and I think a doctor mark group is absolutely correct in pointing out that there is a lead to conflict between the nationalistic wind side of the military and\nThe lid routine which has been gathering around the economist in a previously announced finance minister Paolo gathered let's see how this plays out the proven an old programs are deliberately vague\nFor us I mean I Know people who are working closing the so called headquarters of his campaign what we have to judge if they if you read the two programs right and I think there is a stark contrast between this ... of the comic projects [noise]\nThat's what we go for the one hand I understand what you're saying that the ... wants to bring power that is really that you put them to the task whether they want to be faithful I understand that\nBut clearly that's how the business community in Brazil believes as well and you see that in just how the stock market and the other behaves when he became a including his lead and then you end up ...\nRemains it remains to be seen markets are my offered by nature\nYou know but it's a it's a it's a signal that they're giving\nOut again you know today if I can bring you and there is there is there any news\nAbout which makes it difficult for the PC well actually there was an anti globalization me not just in Brazil the old days of the wild and one which in which some many people are choosing perhaps to have a different view of the role of the state in our lives\nWe have two different very different projects with these two very different projects in one side we have a view of a sudden our himself as a liberal surrounded by ministry a\nNationalist on the other side it has a dodge who has\nKind of a developmental is approach to the economy where this stage\nOught to have a friend [noise] so what we have in Brazil now is is lawless state versus I stayed that will intervene in the economy to create jobs and to form and the economy more people have in jobs market we spend money and ... the present and economy\nProblem is that they don't start they don't know when to stop intervening right you have a development bank the largest development that has more credit than the world bank\nAnd they compete with the banking system rotting front that that's why you have caffeine with no they land they can't lend me who are the brash daughters when he called on his ... well established companies giving loans like very low interest rates\nIn images that they've found\nA they went down the copyright the images and then they should be able to use them and federal law in that area of federal copyright law tends to overcome state law in in that regard so there are a number of cases actually were actors in studios have come into conflict historically for example that the well known cheers case where George went and John ... burgers sued\nOver the licensing of the norm in ... characters for you says robots an airport bars and so we may see more of those conflicts involving a digitized actors\nUm but also there's the issue in this doesn't mean it's central to my book is that the right of publicity the state law that we talked about if it can turn people into intellectual property which means that their rights can be transferred\nSo it's supposed to be helping actors control uses of their image but his studio could have the actors transfer over their rights to the studio itself and and they would own the actor potentially forever even after death\nSo that could be in in the initial contract with the actor when she or he has hired for a particular role\nCorrect and and that's that's very concerning to me and it's it's something the Screen Actors guild is trying to promote the passage of these laws but isn't restricting their transfer ability it's actually encouraging the transfer ability\nWhich can be very dangerous for actors going forward and in fact some of these laws were initially proposed by the movie studios in the aftermath of the collapse of the star system when California law invalidated long term steel contracts that hold act held actors hostage particular studios\nWe're talking with Jennifer ... Thatcher Loyola Law school author of the book the right to publicity re imagine for a public world came out just a few months ago and Darren handler with us of a digital domain where he directs the digital humans group\nA daring wanted to ask you about the ways that you attempt to transfer the subtleties of that sense of an actor to the digitized image what are the ways you try to address that challenge\nOf students it's kind of an interesting process we go through and sort of new technologies really helping us you know sort of a this process but we were Germany work with the activism or do a whole series of different scans of them you know scans figure out because of how their skin moves you know removing do scans figure out\nHow the color of their skin is changing his blood froze moving around in their face it was sort of generate all this data that gives us a good idea of how the act of space moves how they're performing\nAnd then what we do is from their live action performances when they're on set with the other actors were able to shoot their faces from different angles different cameras and things and then recreate their facial performances right really down to the subtlety of their since suffering motions switches on their face and everything\nAnd this is the thing that's kind of been failing you write this technology evolved so far I think has really enabled us to sort of best to recreate the actors performances right so we no longer\nYou know using the performances guide or following along with it performs as we're not really sort of using their performance is their facial performances their buddy performances and then transferring it to these different characters different actors and different creatures and all sorts of things can\nCan you give us an example of where you did this in a recent film with an actor and and with one of these digitized characters\nAbsolutely so we did this a recent revenge is infinity war where we took Josh Burns performances and Josh Brennan was on onset live with all the other actors she was ... his performances he was creating the buddy performances of that loss\nAnd so we're taking his buddy performances in his facial performances from said while he's talking and interacting with the other actors\nAnd rich tracking us thousands of points on his face and how his face is moving\nAnd they were looking at his face and we're looking at that also space we look at the different than not to me is between the different characters and then transferring or the subtlety but for me out to the same time what Josh is performance which should look like on thousands face\nAnd really trying to make it his performance almost like the ... prosthetic\nAnd as you're describing a professor ... um is it clear then if if the studio wanted to use ... ... and they thought it was appropriate for another digitized character that they could we use that without Berlin's permission\nWell a lot of but that would depend on the contracts that Berlin signed as well as collective bargaining with the Screen Actors guild in that context that studio would own the copyright and the footage and so the copyright law says you can reuse it never righty of ways as the owner [noise]\nOne of the main limits as probably whether the reuse would interfere or destroy Berlin's career\nSo if it was a complete replacement for Berlin performances and other films\nAnd then I think court should be more inclined to strike it down and the one case a right of publicity case that went to the U.S Supreme Court involves such a scenario where human cannonball performer had been filmed at a local fair and the nightly news showed his entire act albeit Fifteen seconds in length\nAnd the Supreme Court said First Amendment isn't going to protect the news here because he used the entire performance and that could ruin the cannonball performers career\n... why in this case though with Roland ... let's say that the studio decided they just wanted to keep reusing cars they could make that that capture of his face almost infinite let's say I'm so they don't need to hire him for future you know going out there doing they\nMentioned just the way this is technology works is so for instance there we're going to be a of actors playing on us we would do the same type of technology to have them drive the face but it's never going to be Josh has performance the way Joshua ... performance\nIt's only really when he's playing this character and reusing his face that you're getting back to performance the way he did it on to us and everyone else maybe mimicking into trying to follow along but it's never really going to be the same performance ever again\nDuring what is going to have oh go ahead and finish your point and we really don't have the technology that would ever take Josh has performances in the way he did it and be able to recreate different alternative performance is the way he did it due this moment to you I understand the technology isn't there right now but isn't that at some point\nYou know in the realm of possibility\nIt could be in the realm of possibility you know redo lots of conversations about artificial intelligence and what this technology is going to be capable of I Would say the difficulty right now is the recount really getting artificial intelligence entity to come off as a human being never mind\nCreates this perfect Josh broaden performance again the way he did it and so while the technology may be possible in the future that fool a really really long way off\nI Want to thank you so much dads Darren handler apply this to based digital domain he directs the digital Cubans group there and has been involved with the digital effects\nCapture of actor's
