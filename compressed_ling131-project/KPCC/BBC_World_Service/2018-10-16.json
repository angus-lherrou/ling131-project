it is yeah you know it's and it's you can't put the genie back in the bottle and I also benefit from it to like I'm On Spotify dipping in dipping out of all these musical genres all these musical worlds and checking records that\nI haven't listened to or thought about listening to in years so I'm benefiting from it just like the rest of the people and I'm just as lazy I could be going out and still just buying I still unfortunately do by a lot of records but I can be buying even more records yeah and just doing it all analog\nBut I'm guilty as everyone else like like Mike said like\nI it's just as you know with kids especially like when we were kids all you have to do was resist the radio on the TV [laughter] now there's algorithms to make sure that you're coming back as often as possible and\nThey're presented to you as being resistant to the radio and TV at ... this is an awesome and they hope will record\nI Do think it's a hopeful record I think it's about learning I'm too yes except your place in except that you are okay but I really think it's about learning to relate to other people and that being a\nMore important and perhaps more pure idea of normalcy or success and unfortunately but what we've just been talking about social media and bought a fewer irons in the fire of the\nYou're homeless man during the course Scott I Know and he lives on a ... yeah yeah I I live I live pretty off grid and I didn't mean to be politically very much I I'm I'm basically that of course it constantly set entry level\nUm but uh I you know I think what those things have done which is negative\nIs Dave ... the idea that you can relate to somebody to the things that you experienced our culture of the world looking at something there's all of a sudden this really negative filter that's been put in front and it's a corporate filter its mass media filter\nThis record is kind of about removing that filter and understanding that evening when you take the glass away in the images the same there's so much there\nAnd there's so much there without having to rely on looking through the scifri decipher is the fact that you exist and you can you can consume things at your pace the way you like and you can be yourself I think it's an immensely uplifting that good and there are few moments when I was listening back to the mix is I think when I was\nAt seeing those ... and I was listening back to just the first passed within the music underneath\nI'd never really paid attention to the lyrics even when I've seen them until I heard them back\nVery moving it's like a person that I mean with all due respect the guys right in the room\nBut it's very vulnerable thing to do to say like you know I'm a bit last\nAnd to bring a listener along this journey of getting completely lost and just flat out saying I don't know what I'm doing and then at the end having the realization that you can relinquish yourself to the world and the world will still catch you with a grinding due to a pop that's optimism right\nThere you're right it Mike I I I don't mean to be cynical but I asked is to make money from us girls too is that there are also going to be people who listen to this record and just like the way it sounds ... um I I comfortable with that with the idea that people may not understand the narrative\nYeah I mean I I think I'm more of like a craft person storyteller and I think yeah our students still music and I think we are our legacy will be the way we sound and so I think that like yeah you know the record is big enough I Hope that it can be taken in many different ways\nAnd maybe one of the music runs out the feeling is still there or vice versa\nOr maybe you want to go back over it and and see what you might have missed yeah right yeah but yeah you anybody can take it away they weren't like I tell you this really feels like a new book I don't know maybe a new start first up or something like that\nHopefully like I I was going to happen a couple of years ago [laughter] because I think\nYou know we're we're a really weird band were banned but like it's kinda weird that would definitely were banned but I mean we're not we are because of this reason but we're just like we have a lot different songwriters that have a lot of strength and I think\nYou know allowing people to flex their muscles a little bit more in the band is something that hopefully this will start off you know like I think we had the David stamp compilation years ago\nWhich I think is the most collaborative record we've ever done where everyone in the band pretty much except Josh St climate used interesting I don't want you think back on and so now I'm a member okay well anyway\nI think it was like you did almost every but almost everyone you know they seem to be ready but virtually everywhere she ... everyone in a band\nYeah uh but we all wrote for it and we all kind of like even Josh did lyrics for that stuff and I I think that was a a that was that was that was really cool and I think hopefully we have a way to kind of\nLet this be a much more open than they are I really love the record and thanks for coming in thanks for having us like

and I was about to start my area and have been talking to some people ... past I can take and he was one of the person who I was talking to\nAnd what policy you inserted into suing sure\nSo I was interested in doing some TV journalism and I wasn't sure if I Want to work and Japanese media but I was interested in working outside of Japan or forty media in Japan\nOkay so you would still have your career touchy you are pursuing a Korean television what were you doing\nWell I have been working in interest payments my dear as a journalist and acts first first three years referred to thousands sixteen when they changed it and ...\nOf the company was working and producing several TV shows and ... and I talk show on comedy on TV series\nFor the biggest fill a vision in Georgia so I was quite popular at the moment so quite a prominent person in\nGeorgian TV yeah sure you allegations relate to an evening you spent with Mr Yamaguchi and twenty Fifteen and you both have different versions of what happened that night that you initially went up in a bar to discuss an internship\nYou were drinking and then you were cool feeling dizzy and tossing out and then by the end of the night he had taken you back to his hotel room where you came he raped you argue incapacitated\nWe're as Mr Yamaguchi position is that he took you back to the hotel because you a tree drunk to travel and learn and he says you will ... and you had consensual sex\n[noise] what was the response when you first took you allegations to the local police station\nWell first of all it took me a great amount of courage to even go to police because he was such and high profile journalist and\nHad a strong connection was Japanese bleach go world [noise] and when I went to a place\nPolice initially said well these things happens a lot and we can't investigate and this is about men and women issue I was quite surprised that they didn't even start or even filed a case\nSo she was this the first police officers that you spoke to\nIt was my first time to go to police and report I was asking for a female police officer and they asked me why in the waiting room so I had to tell in front of everyone what has happened so I was starting to talk with this female police woman and\nAnd then of conversation she told me while I'm Sorry but I'm from traffic department and I can't report your case so can you talk with a male place and so I did\nBut then he told me well you have to go to the different PlayStation because that means than what had happened was in a different area so I have to talk to three police men to start with [noise]\nIt was very painful experience to tell the same story over and over and I remember when I first went to a place I was just crying and I couldn't\nEven talk much us I start realizing that I have to repeat it the tell my story I have to find\nTheir way to be able to tell this painful experience over and over and the way I guess I discovered to be able to\nTell is to think I'm reporting about one case and this had happened to this girl so I Try to think as a third party third person and I think that is how I mentally Monday she did\nKnow sure his poses investigation you say you ought to act out what happened to you tell us about that\nYes so during the investigation they asked me to we enact and\nThey took me to one of the room and there were ... ... email policemen around me and they asked me to lay down on the floor\nAnd they start placing a life sized all me and stopped taking photo and asking me was it like this was it like that\nIt was someone I have to turn off my mine tried to not think about anything but it was quiet traumatic experience\nProsecutors drop your case from the grounds of insufficient evidence in July twenty sixteen even may twenty Seventeen that's ten months late to you and she decided to go public has to reveal your name and your face to the Japanese press y\nTo be honest what had happened to me was shocking but even what was more shocking was what I have to go through afterwards\nGoing through this in the ... the un knocked meant and I start questioning about how little support we have here in Japan for sex crime victims so in our parliament it was about time for them to talk about\nReformation of our rape though and I felt strongly that I Need to talk about what we need to change and also I discovered how difficult in how to boot to talk about rape itself in Japanese media and\nIt was hard to talk about my own story but um that was the only way I had left\nSure liked it comes to ... to ... Japanese society in a moment but I should say that ... she denies\nThe allegations and you filed a civil case against him and miss him a Grucci is defending the civil case\nThat's the case is very different what made you decide to find a new lawsuit against you form of both in twenty sixteen\nSewing to a thousand ... said the way I was ... very high profile project syringe our job\nSo he was making sexual advances towards you\nYeah favors yeah sexual favors\nCould you explain to us what was the working environment at the TV station ... was it like for you know working within that environment\nUntil I went to say to all the victims of sexual harassment and violence in Georgia and over the globe that it's time to speak cops they won't be alone because ... coming well\nLet's talk about the me too movement to the meat to hash tag which first emerged on social media a year ago [noise] didn't have any impact in Japan ...\nEight kick some time to be honest will I published my own like based on line ... and and my experience last October so it was about the same time when me too movement had happened but I feel like Japanese media and people do this moving us what it's going on in Hollywood\nAnd it took time because same meat you saying he had happened to me in Japan\nWas or still as dangerous\n... online harassment and backlash so it took some time for us to how this movement I'm not sure if I can say a became the movement here in Japan but it is still slowly happening starting from media\nWe start having this conversation media stop talking about me too movement so that is a huge difference I couldn't imagine that before the me too movement had happened just talking daily basis about this harassment\nAnd violence so it has changed but yet same meat you is quite a difficult thing\nIn Japan and like you said everyone has to survive they have their own job they have to survive where they are so it's their choice but just hearing voices from different parts of the world saying me too I think it has encouraged us a lot\nTouchy you describe the me too movement as a blessing how was it a blessing\nIt was very encouraging for me to\nHear that either we remain very successful women in ... and around the world had the same problem like I had\nI Do believe that to my story or presents hundreds of odds are women star race here in Georgia\nSo sometimes when I have with challenges in life I Do think that I did the right\nThing to speak cop because there are a lot of women who cannot speak up and they are to kink up to me and say you're like praying for me to become survivor\nI'm not a victim and I feel like I'm a survivor because I could fight back was so me to come pay nice trying from my perspective to bring ... back to women\n... to ... do you think things oh evil thing in Georgia oh things changing a tool yeah I Do\nActually I think because we have high profile made the eye and political discussions here in Georgia about legislation against sexual\nHarassment and family side and all these problems we have like women's issues in Georgia so I Do think that to me to campaign of was very influential\nNo time in America but also in Georgia\nAnd what would you like to see happen to test these ones that are completely changed like to see happen what would that be\nFirst of all I Would like to see the ... law against sexual harassment because I Know a lot of women has this problem in commercial sector so this is number one problem we have to solve here in Georgia and holidays\nAnd jewelry what would you like to see happen in Japan\nThere are so many things that I should change\nSex without consent and rape here in Japan so to prove it was great we have to prove how much we been violated or threatened so that still it's remained and that it didn't change last year so that's something he has to change\nYeah same here in Georgia as well\nOh wow\nOh I'd like to even talk about where you Korea's on now can touch it the fact that you knew longer working as a joined us was that a choice or was that something that happened because he couldn't find work anymore because he's spoken out\nI actually I could ... I was like openly discriminate too darn many drop interviewers and I can like feel he's hands everywhere business over ... that you're talking about yeah I'm Talking about him he's very influential men with contracts in government\nBut could you be sure that it was as a result of he influencing your ability to get a job was maybe not just because he can get a job\nI can say for sure and they seemed but this is my opinion about that\nAnd surely we're now in your career so you've written a book and you working outside of Japan for many international media what are you hoping to do what\nI'm working on right now is to tell the story of what it is like to be a victim of rape\nSo I Wish to tell the story so they can understand and I especially here in Japan there's just a little understanding of what is what can happen\nMentally psychologically there if there is enough understanding for that part I don't think police would ask survivor too we and knocked\nTia and they're you know we can use the campaign and you do movies different things but do you feel that that incident that period of your life is now behind you\nActually I don't I'm Still fighting games of cards but I'm trying to stay positive\nIf it's possible and I'm trying to tie DEA law ... we can send the so house meals so you know way to feel safe because I feel I'm\nDoing something guy mean next year and so I can say the tech shows their stories behind me is like very tough experience very ... experience\nBut I took a license from them and I'm trying to develop personnel into something not totally for my career but also for other women in Georgia you have to try to do how to Perry's is\nSaid to mess with you yeah but you do actually\nSpeaking out for both of you had considerable consequences too strict law the backlash would you do it again to to of\nCourse of course I Will do it again and again every time I don't feel like it's my ...
