{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Like I get it like I understand the mindset but like it's it's a ... zooming out of that and looking at from a different perspective it's like it's kind of it's kind of weird any kind of nuts but yeah I totally understand what every person thinking and so like I I empathize with that for sure\nI think people who are listening to this can understand maybe where we're going but I Want to play another clip spectacles into that\nYou guys know who knows if she is someone who I think is pushing the boundaries of you to\nMove there\nIs no when I was on how it always feels it's only well let's just see so much a minority persons who can worsen when he's sort of getting ... scary I'm literally just waiting for me to hit my breaking point\nThat's all meals are from a video called burnt out in Nineteen ... tell me about what prompted you to make that video\n[noise] um so uh the pressure\nFrom you know it's coming on video so since then like it was like slowly building up and I think my my schedule just got busier and busier 'cause the numbers are growing really fast and my popularity is growing really fast so April was a very hectic months for me I was barely home I was on tour I was\nAt what shows I was a convention see meet and greets and\nOn making the each of it is on top of that um and I think it all just kind of\nFinally hit my breaking point I had a very public breakdown on line yeah yeah so I posted the video on Twitter and I I was nine okay I was having a mental breakdown and I\nFlipped and I posted it and I had to you know everyone is very concerned so we had to take that video down and I had to cancel two shows like I had to take a break I I just said I Need time off and so I felt like making that video was like to explain myself because I just came out of\nNowhere I was I was happy huh I don't know like I was the ... for so long and all of a sudden out of\nNowhere I was I was saying I'm I'm so happy so I felt like I owe my audience or an escalation even my friends and family that's how I explained it to my friends and family as well\nSee this video premieres of you to festival with an audience in front of ... but I can only imagine the loophole\nNo that was weird it was just like I had ... had committed to that festival um beforehand so I knew I had and you need to make the video\nAnd so I decided to permit that video 'cause that's usually make videos about what's going on my life currently and that was the only thing going on in my life I was going to pretend that goes I was like happy\nSo I I did premier it and it was a yeah it was a lot it was not what people expected for me and so you know yeah have they had to be the reactor and general\nEveryone's super supportive here like in terms of my viewers um everyone was like take your time to take a break um and I think with um ... graders it it got a lot of\nPeople being like same this is what we need to talk about when you start talking about you to burn out and how do you like the mental health and how it's affecting people and everything\nEverywhere you know I'm a lot better from April and may you know a lot better um but definitely I still have my moments like to work in progress ... it's like you're constantly working on getting better as like a great support system friends and family my managers really great as well so I'm just being open with others in\nWorking through that is has been really helpful\nWhen you talk about these vulnerabilities when you talk about ... mental illness when you talk about anxiety when you talk about panic people wanna come up to you until you their stories\nToo right yeah yeah that's that's been\nThat's been hard to adjust to my opinion just because I'm very bad converting people I'm very bad and emotions like\nUm my friends and like with my friends have a problem I'm not the friend that you go to to talk about this problem so having to have complete strangers just completely cry in front of you know not court for that\nI'm not but I've been I've been learning I've just been trying to figure out what I like when I'm like like in that state yeah and trying to like do that for that for other person but you know\nIt comes with the job really like I made that public I yeah people are just trying to tell me tell me how my video affected them\nYour duty with such a brave new world ... you know of that that YouTube is right now and I know that's a good source of a joke that I make that you know oh yeah well I'm you know I'm so I'm thirty I'm just kind of the last generation but didn't have you two birds and their lives\nBut we don't really know what to do to people I mean in in show business I Want them in we're in unions ... we have rules about how much we can work mhm you know we have rules around what people can do we have rules remember how much people get paid at least at the CBC we do you know yeah that everywhere\nTo try and stop burn out and trying to stop people from from losing it you know do you think it's sustainable the expectation that are put on YouTube or is right now\n[noise] [noise] I don't know it's that's a whole at the top of that a lot of teachers are like kind of try to discuss\nUm it's I don't think it's very sustainable to be honest now it just deteriorates people's mental health\nSo badly um and I ... I I honestly don't know how to fix that I Wish I but I think having starting conversations and try and talk it out figure out that\nThat's definitely needed for shade so what what changes are you making taking time in between videos not like pressure and myself we often try to cap um meet and greets so I don't meet like sometimes meat if you can go on for four hours straight so ... so we had a cat that um\nAnd if I feel we try to spread out meetings and stuff but like if I\nFeel like too much pressure and all that we we I'm I'm able to cancel it and\nNo problem yeah so like just and also being more open with everyone I Know in ...\nIn a in a in the in the brave it will be open with everyone is the point I Want to make it a ... like I said this is a brave new world is going to the wild\nWest of the Internet were still in the wild west of Internet and personal contact people extra people expect the vulnerability from your people expect your ... people expect you know your deepest secrets in some ways and we don't necessarily always talk about what that means to the people who are sharing them it's\nSo incredibly brave\nAnd it's an overused word but it's incredibly brave you're talking about oh well thank you yeah I I don't know ... people say that I don't even think of it like that I don't expect it to but it is yeah\nOh thank you very sure that you know what I mean like someone finally needs to sit up and go I don't know I don't know if this is ultimately healthy yeah have you feel about being that person because I have this platform I Know when I speak out on stuff that is what comes with it yeah but I honestly think\nIf I'm the person I said you know start talking about it if I'm gonna be the conversation\nStarted I guess I'll own up and I'll I'll do it you know just just to it shaped [noise]\nL. mills is\nOn you to like more than a million drivers big if you want to see why ... her channel and the the awesome hilarious beautiful vulnerability of el mills her YouTube channel is called el\nOf some bills that is it for very tomorrow you're going to hear from a voice there may be very familiar to you Sir David Attenborough\nWill be on the show live\n\nOn Sunday Brazilians vote for their next president and poll suggest they're not happy with the choices that\nWomen are protesting the leading candidate with the hash tag ... not him that story on the next all things considered from NPR News we dated for an eighty nine point three key PCC\n\nWhen you look at actual harassment I have to ask a question complicity meaning to pick up the lemon protected hardy\nIn how the news should\nThe biggest stories of our time\nPowered by the journal of the New York times\nI'm Michael Barbaro [noise] this is the day a\nWeek at nine thirty on eighty nine point three Cape you see\nThis is eighty nine point three K PCC Pasadena Los Angeles or community service of Pasadena City College\nRobert two hundred programs offered students the ability to dream pro do\nLearn more Pasadena dot edu\nAlthough land welcome to news from the b._b._c.
