A. B. E. Johnny Kauffman is here to talk about this he reported the story along with reveal and eight PM reports\nEither Johnny hey they're so tell us why this is significant well\nThis is a really close historic race for governor here right now there's lots of national attention on it and it's kind of seen as this sort of test for the twenty twenty presidential contest and Brian Kemp is running against Democrat Stacey Abrams who would be the first black female governor and the country and her strategy is all about\nBoosting turnout among people of color right Democrats and civil rights groups say to these voters or they don't show up at the polls as regularly as Republicans and so they say to use it or lose it purges disproportionately affect those voters and that really this is a new voter suppression tactic that Republicans are using to help them when is this an issue that\nSeems to be capturing the attention of voters this election gets closer\nYeah this has become a big campaign issue and uh we went to a small town in southwest Georgia called Moultrie um most people there I ... in the town or black or Latino and turnout is really low\nAnd we spoke to this man and Reverend Cornelius ponder who's on the city council there and he says part of that low turnout is because of all these obstacles devoting including the purchase oh here's a clip of ponder from our story that aired on the podcast reveal\nIt almost give people the the um the mindset that that this is a privilege not a right and so now anything that is a privilege has to get permission and so if you don't do our way we will give you permission to use his privilege\nIs so when it comes to purchase a hunters and actually with someone who was removed for not voting she didn't know at her nephew didn't know it\nAnd uh her story is kind of that she voted for Obama in two thousand eight she hasn't voted since then and she's thinking about voting off or Abrams but unless she registered before the deadline earlier this month she may go to the polls and and won't be able to vote and Georgia doesn't have same day voter registration unlike some other states\nNow you actually spoke to secretary camp the Republican candidate who actually carried out this policy right I mean what's his argument here yeah\nKemp says he's just following the law and this is legal the Supreme Court actually approved a policy like this earlier this year or that he says the state sends out multiple notifications before ... people and that this is in part way of combating voter fraud\nAnd camp says he has not been more aggressive and purging voters than previous secretaries of state but the numbers show a big jump and people were move we found one point six million had been removed since he took over okay\nW.

focusing fresh attention on the flow of people from Central America\nThey've been labeled a caravan we're talking about upwards of five thousand people many fleeing violence in Honduras they're moving north and many hope to reach the United states now Mexican authorities spoke of stopping them but then let them pass into southern Mexico over the weekend President Trump delivered a stern message\nThese are hard and you can see people and I don't want them to\nKnow as you say the president made these claims about these migrants without offering any evidence and we want to turn now to reporter James Frederick who was on the ground and has been following them Hi there James\nI didn't so where exactly are you and and talk to me about the conditions of of the people in this caravan\nSo I Am in Tampa to Mexico right now it's about twenty miles north of Mexico Guatemala border I'm and I'm here in the central square where the care of and uh ended yesterday\nUm people here are just sleeping on the street um I mean right now I'm looking I'm you know at a little girl who is tucked under a blanket with her mom right next to them is a little boys is probably three or four years old or with his parents\nThere's a there's a guy just sleeping under a little plastic bag here um these people walk more than twenty miles yesterday to get here temperatures got about Ninety degrees um season just tell they're absolutely exhausted\nYeah I can imagine um so I mean in addition to sleeping on sidewalks and walking is long distances and exhaustion or I mean it's I guess a lot of uncertainty about whether the Mexican government whether the U.S government is actually going to let them continue this journey [noise] yeah\nAnd it's been very confusing to try to figure out exactly what the Mexican Government strategy is here\nUm because yesterday I was walking with the caravan do we heard there was a blockade being set up by Mexican police that we went to check it out\nThey had like two hundred riot police ready to stop the caravan and then a couple of minutes later they just took this blockade away all the police left and the caravan kept marching so they don't know if the Mexican government is really going to put police there to try to stop them or if they're going to be able to continue north it's it's just not clear yet\nSo we've been obviously reporting on migrants from Central America making their way to the United states for a long time now that this group correct me if I'm wrong seems particularly large um\nDoes that tell us anything [noise]\nSo ... you're right we we\nHave been saying for years people playing countries like Honduras and El Salvador and Guatemala there's you know lots and lots of crime gang crime is very bad there you know poverty is also really bad um you know talking to people about why they're in this chair bound why so many of them have come together\nThey just said they saw the caravan as an opportunity to be safer because this migrant route is so dangerous for migrants and especially if you're traveling with kids\nTravelling alone puts you at risk of so many things\nAre cartels and gangs attacking you which is very common here in Mexico\nSo they saw this as the safest way to get out of their country and they think the United states is is the safest the best place they can be\nNo kind of course President Trump now saying though that they're not going to be allowed into the country is a lot of uncertainty for the group you're falling reporter James Frederick speaking to us about this caravan of migrants moving northward you speaking to us from Mexico James thanks a lot\nThank you\nAmerican voters are choosing more than the U.S Congress this fall they also choose state legislatures\nAnd

which peaks on Black Friday and that experience informs the short story collection he calls friday black\n... book makes its point by exaggerating race and class divisions and consumer culture or\nIs it really exaggeration he spoke with no okay\nYou write in this field of of speculative fiction or dystopian fiction whatever you want to call it but one thing that separates you from other authors I've read in in that genre is that you were writing seems to be explicitly political\nAnd I wonder um as a black writer do you feel that that is partially a responsibility to to have a political take on things\nI don't want to if I could suggest to any black writer has any particular thing they have to do with that said I myself do feel compelled to write about certain things um it's pretty much unavoidable that my work um engages subjects that are highly politicized I think that\nMost identities or where they intersect with the culture that they come out of 'em there's this there's politics involved sometimes just existing in space and proudly loudly is somehow political so I think\nUm if you write fiction and anything that's not a vacuum on some level I think it's political and so because no one who writes in a vacuum and no one comes out of a vacuum you're kind of doing some of the political and if you and I think it's a great privilege to think you are not\nMany of your stories are are filled with brutality but there is also a wide vein of dark humor running through some of them which I think might surprise people the story that gives you a book it's title friday black\nThis short story takes place in what we assume is a department store and it's a it's a Black Friday it's the Friday after Thanksgiving which we all know is is kind of a nightmare of consumerism your protagonist as a young man working in the stores selling fleece jackets\nYou have these just vicious scenes where people consumers shoppers storm\nThe entrance of the store and there are so overwhelmed at the idea of getting a deal that they trample each other they ... when they trample each other to the point of death they they show bodies out of the way that is a heck of a way to look at at Black Friday what were you saying there\nTo talk about the humor in it for me it's important to\nTry to laugh when you can because I think it's healthy but also I think for me it's a way to help me say exactly what I wanted to say because if I don't add some Lebanese um humor I probably won't get through on some level for the reader I think it's like the sugar it's health and medicine go down sometimes\nUm you kinda get to a story but it's like ... the main of humor and sometimes I think the punch line is it actually wasn't a joke after all but with on that story friday black\nI did work in retail I really have seen a like a woman step on another woman's like cash for genes um we all know for a fact that pretty much a newly someone gets killed because people in one way of trying to get TVs in my mind the first thing that happened everyone the country the world to the ... will\nYou know maybe we've I'm taking this thing too far but it's that's a scary thing for me to think about what's scary to think how how we can know that happens so regularly still sort of casually participate\nIn the main character in that story in friday black as a young man who wants to get the sales record because he will win a prize and the prize is a code that he intends to give to his mother\nAnd at one point of a colleague it in the unmanned confront them and says you know seeing seeing the body stern about hearing the yelling and screaming he says this this is just not worth it your mother knows that you love her she doesn't need a coat\nAnd you know it's what's funny about that moment and I didn't have that moment and if you can believe that originally and I really like the original draft and I'm surprised I\nYeah and actually I'm prior to the book being caught fire back in the previous title and after I made that editorial change after a buys it and made that moment I was\nFinally like okay this this can be the title of the book because you absolutely need that moment the moment of self implication in which the somebody said like you know you think you're not in this but you are and to just the same line of logic I'm going to participate in this craziness\nBecause I'm going to get my mother a thing and the ... and again for me is important because like I said I really didn't work in retail there was a contest is my story through and giving us more money or something whoever's made the most sales we get um a north face jacket\nAnd I got it from my mom I really did well I really did do that and um\nYou know I don't know that she wears it any more\nYou are the the sign of of immigrants from Africa Africa yes both my parents are from China how how do you think that informs the way you see race in the United states and in particular racial tension which makes it so much of of your book in in the United states\nI'm sure it informs me and a lot of ways I Can't even really perceive you know my parents are they're very decided we um their Africa and they got me in and they would sometimes even ... I had a built in thing that I had to work doing sort of just about\nEven my distinction from black Americans which they were like you know you're not from here and I don't think you can act like these people here\nAnd because of the way I started again in Queens New York I was I I understood you know block is different and all you know but because of the way like the sort of pride associated with\nWhere my parents come from and I didn't have to default to a feeling of\nWhite is the best which I think is really hard to escape and America and you mentioned something before like some of my characters [noise]\nA lot of them it's explicit or by some of them they're not but in my mind they're all black you know I don't accept the sort of white ... in in the literary world are you almost like if you don't say they're black or white\nI definitely like sort of tried to resist that and especially because in ... there was some often the way they're racist revealed his do some type of traumatic instance happening because of the reason I don't want that to be the case where I'm readers are only feeding characters that of our of color\nHaving that matter of fact in some kind of pain or trauma for them [noise]\nNone of climbing Ajay ... thank you so much for coming in to talk today we really appreciate it appreciate it thank you so much [noise]\nIs short story collection is called friday block [noise]\nAnd this is MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep\n\nWhen big news is breaking the vote ended weeks of sharp partisan battles over the fifty three year olds Kavanaugh Saudi\nArabia's says it would retaliate strongly keep your radio right here one incumbent councilman and victims will poses criminal justice reforms as a legal record of his own so ... most of its customers lose power\nAllowed the wrong way home as we get into office things change\nNPR the b._b._c. and eighty nine point three K.

E. along with eight PM reports and reveal they found that more than one hundred thousand of those voters were removed from the roles for so called use it\nOr lose it that's a policy in Georgia and at least nine other states that eliminates voters who chose not to vote in primary elections now the Georgia secretary of state who oversees voting is Brian Kemp and camp is also the Republican candidate for governor W. A. B. is Johnny Kauffman is with me either Johnny\nHey David so if this happened in twenty Seventeen um why is it significant now why are we focusing on this today\nWell right now we're in the midst of a really close historic race for governor here and there's lots of national attention on it and camp is running against Democrat Stacey Abrams and she would be the first black female governor and the country her strategy to win this year is all about boosting turnout amongst people of color and\nDemocrats and civil rights groups say that these voters don't show up at the polls as regularly as Republicans so to use it or lose it purges disproportionately affect those voters and they say they really this is a new voter suppression tactic Republicans are using to help them win and so what reaction has there\nBeen from voters I mean this is becoming a campaign issue and he's found a way\nYeah voting has really become a central issue in the campaign here and we went to a rural southwest Georgia and then visited a small town called Moultrie which is mostly black and Latino\nAnd voter turnout has really low there and we spoke to Reverend Cornelius ponder who's a community leader and he explains that low turnout is because of these obstacles devoting liked to purchase on here's a clip of ponder from our story that aired on the podcast reveal\nIt almost give people to read my say that this is a privilege not a right and so now anything that is a privilege has to get permission and so if you don't do our way we will give you permission to use his privilege\nAnd so when it comes to the purchase a punter ... was actually someone that was root for not voting she voted for Obama in two thousand eight she hasn't voted since then and she's thinking about voting for Abrams but unless she registered before the deadline earlier this month she may go to the polls and she won't be able to vote Georgia doesn't have same day voter registration like some states so the idea that\nThis is creating a mindset that voting is a privilege to the idea that there's voter suppression I mean those are incredibly serious I'm Serious charges um\nWhat is secretary Kemp said in response to all of that\nWell Kemp points out that he's following the last year the Supreme Court has approved this use it or lose that policy they did that this year\nAnd he says you know the state sends out multiple notifications before moving these people he says he hasn't been more aggressive and purging voters and other secretaries of state\nBut the numbers show a big jump and people were moved a one point six million people since he took over that includes all rule so people who have moved our died and these people who have been removed for not voting\nAnd you've been following a lot of issues like this as as his voice and gets close right\nYeah there have been at least I I think for lawsuits filed in the last week over voting or the big one is over this policy that's disproportionately holding up the voter registration applications of people of color\nThose people can still vote but civil rights advocates are worried about confusion and people getting discouraged um there's some ... alive absentee ballots that have been rejected in one county specifically\nAnd I you know this is a really close race there a few undecided voters both candidates are really trying to motivate their bases and they found that criticizing the other candidate over voting seems like a way to do that\nJohnny Kauffman from member station WBUR a B.

general it's sort of an idea of the contract when you buy a piece of technology and the expectation is it will be safe and all that but with autonomous and intelligence systems there's this new things that people have to understand her trustworthy\nSo for instance as engineers work on autonomous vehicles self driving cars and trucks\nThey have to program in different preferences of his self driving car has a choice of saving the occupants of the car in an impending crash but at the expense of killing pedestrians would the certification program demand that we know about that particular choice\nThe logic is to write out all the potential scenarios that could happen but right now a lot of times those conversations happen outside the context of how many humans unfortunately are killed with cars is they are right now\nBut the way the technology answers that question is that something that the sort of a Geisha process wants to know more about or wants to the end user to know more about\nIn the sense I'll give you an example it's more of a cultural thing recently autonomous vehicles were tested in Australia\nAnd the lidar the technology that's used to sense surroundings hadn't been programmed to recognize kangaroos [laughter] so the big kind of like bouncing jumping around motions weren't recognized whereas like squirrel dark emotions were recognized\nBut the point is is that you have to ask even more questions than you had before when you have these new types of technologies and that actually goes back to safety it's just a different type of safety question then some people may have asked before\nAs the technology advances it requires human beings to decide what are our values and what our values in different countries you have to actually define them and be aware of them\nEthics questions oftentimes especially in western media is coming from a Greek\nBackground of ethics whereas when we have the other side of the planet and the global south\nHas things called Confucian ethics or a boon to ethics and it's a reframing of the paradigm this how we come to these questions and so it's when you ask those questions that much more this is where the word safety or

the flow of people from Central America\nThey have been labeled a caravan we're talking about up words the seven thousand people many of them fleeing violence in Honduras they're moving northward and many hope to reach the United states now Mexican authorities spoke of stopping them but then let them pass into southern Mexico over the weekend President Trump delivered a stern message\nThese are hardened things tough for people and I don't want them and\nNow we should say the president made these claims about these migrants without offering any evidence and we want to turn now to reporter James Frederick who was on the ground and has been following them either James identity so where exactly are you and and talk to me about the conditions of of the people in this caravan\nSo I Am in Tampa to Mexico right now it's about twenty miles north of Mexico Guatemala border I'm and I'm hearing the central square where the care of and uh ended yesterday um people here are just sleeping on the street um I mean right now I'm looking I'm\nYou know at a little girl who is tucked under a blanket with her mom right next to them is a little boys you'd probably three or four years old\nOr with his parents there's a there's a guy just sleeping under a little plastic bag here um these people walk more than twenty miles yesterday to get here temperatures got above Ninety degrees um so you can just tell they're absolutely exhausted\nYeah I can imagine um so I mean in addition to sleeping on sidewalks and walking is long distances and exhaustion or I mean it's I guess a lot of uncertainty about whether the Mexican government whether the U.S government is actually going to let them continue this journey\n[noise] yeah and it's been very confusing to try to figure out exactly what the Mexican Government strategy is here\nUm because yesterday I was walking with the care of and then we heard there was a blockade being set up by Mexican police so we went to check it out they had like two hundred riot police ready to stop the caravan and then a couple of minutes later they just took this blockade away all the police left\nAnd the caravan kept marching so they don't know if the Mexican government is really going to put police there to try to stop them or if they're going to be able to continue north it's it's just not clear yet so we've\nBeen obviously reporting on migrants from Central America making their way to the United states for a long time now that this group and correct me if I'm wrong seems particularly large um\nDoes that tell us anything [noise] so ... you're right we we have been seeing for years people fleeing countries like Honduras and El Salvador in Guatemala there's you know lots and lots of crime gang crime is very bad there you know poverty is also really bad\nUm you know talking to people about why during this caravan of why so many of them have come together\nThey just said they saw the caravan as an opportunity to be safer because\nThis migrant route is so dangerous for migrants and especially if you're traveling with kids\nTravelling alone put you at risk of so many things of cartels and gangs attacking you which is very common here in Mexico so they saw this as the safest way to get out of their countries and they think the United states is is the safest and best place they can be\nOkay then of course president I'm not saying though that they are not going to be allowed into the country is a lot of uncertainty for the group you're following this reporter James Frederick speaking to us about this caravan of migrants moving northward you speaking to us from Mexico James thanks a lot\nThank you American\nVoters are choosing more than the U.S Congress this fall they also choose state legislatures and many governors Democrats have a chance\nTo gain back some of the governorships they have lost to Republicans only sixteen fifty governors right now are Democrats Republicans are working to defend their games including into very red state of Kansas\nHere's Jim McLean of the Kansas news service\nLaura Kelly is a veteran member of the Kansas Senate and the twenty Eighteen democratic nominee for governor\nShe's doing their best to keep the memory of former Republican governor Sam Brownback fresh in the minds of Kansas voters particularly the memory of how the income tax cuts that Brownback champion crashed the budget and forced to cut funding for schools highways and healthcare\nAnd repeat the last eight years from\n[noise]\nKelly isn't running against from back who moved on to the Trump Administration but in debates like this one at the Kansas State fair she misses no opportunity to talk her Republican opponent Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach to the former governor and his policies\nKris Kobach is making it very clear where he will take us as a state he will take us back to the devastation that we had just lived through\nKelly is getting help from some unexpected sources some big name Republicans at least the kids are jumping party lines to support\nLaura Kelly is the only Democrat in office or moderate\nRepublicans do raised was governor of Kansas from Nineteen Ninety five to two thousand two\nWars to me has all all of these old have abilities were looking to leave the state during this difficult time\nFor a week after graves endorsed Kelly so did GOP stalwart Nancy Kass a ball she represented Kansas for Seventeen years in the U.S Senate as co box promise to restore the comeback tax cuts convinced her go public\n\nA lot of things she saw\nA spokesperson for the Obama campaign dismissed the endorsements calling graves and catch up on quote tired has been in Port into this as the endorsement that matters\nI Want to introduce the next governor of Kansas Chris go back [noise]\nFootball says President Trump's initial with delivered on Twitter the day before the primary might've been the difference maker and his razor thin victory over the incumbent governor and he's counting on the president's recent visit to Kansas to energize his base in the final weeks of a general election campaign that's coming down to the wire\nTo put it

supportive of its efforts but a United Nations fund to tackle the effects of climate change has announced what it's going to spend money on\nThis includes more efficient cities in Europe and the harvesting of geothermal energy in Indonesia the BBC's environment correspondent Matt ... is following this from London met\nYeah they've they've been looking at a number of projects for a number of months they've just mentioned the last few days and they decided on Nineteen projects they're going to spend about a billion dollars of Dutch\nHelping people in the coast of India to cope with the impacts of climate change the most controversial though has been money spent on the kingdom of Bahrain or the island to Bahrain or oil rich states which applied to the green climate fund for money and has been given some money in this cause some controversy as you can imagine amongst the people who support the fund\nGiven the link between oil producing and carbon dioxide and climate change\nYes I think a lot of people are feeling that this green climate fund is there to support the least developing countries in they're developing it'd be for structure that can cope with climate change in the future help them to move to new energy use in the future as well\nAnd clearly the green climate fund in spending mode now but they'll have to replenish the money and with the Trump Administration backing away from contributing where might that fund turn to to topple the coffers\n... really good question they had about a three billion dollars have been committed by the United states under President Obama\nA about a billion was paid on two billion is not being held back by President Trump\nSo the green climate fund is known backing on a new round of replenishment says they called us to try and make up that shortfall but as you say it's to prove difficult and with the elections in Brazil coming up they may find the Brazilians are not necessarily willing to help so it could be a tough

changing the rules used to assess whether a country is playing games with its currency to its advantage\nMarketplaces Nancy Marshall ... on the line from Washington so what was mission talking about\nWell last week treasury said China was not gaining its currency\nBecause he didn't need a series of tests treasury uses the tests are mandated by Congress and they can't change it treasury looks at whether a country has a significant trade surplus with us\nOr if it intervenes repeatedly to drive down the value of the currency knew she didn't tell Bloomberg how he would change these tests but treasury does have some discretion in setting the threshold of protest\nArt but why would the U.S treasury want to change those thresholds in a way that could cause China to now fail the test\nThe thinking maybe this would give us some leverage and its trade war with China but keep in mind the u._s. hasn't slap this label on any nation since the Nineteen nineties and China has

driving car has to decide whether to protect occupants or bystanders in some crashes an artificial intelligence could discriminate against women job applicants a story we covered the other day\nA powerful trait and tech organization the Institute of electrical and electronics engineers that just come up with a new ethics certification process it's designed to help engineers make technology that on balance helps rather than hurts and it's transparent about the assumptions built in\nJohn Havens is executive director of this artificial intelligence and robot ethics project thanks for joining us my pleasure to be here\nThis is about what a putting human needs first when it comes to\nAutonomous robots self driving technology\nWasn't in general it's sort of an idea of a contract when you buy a piece of technology and the expectation is it will be safe and all that but with autonomous and intelligence systems there's just new things that people have to understand are trustworthy\nSo for instance as engineers work on autonomous vehicles self driving cars and trucks\nThey have to program in different preferences of a self driving car has a choice of saving the occupants of the car in an impending crash but at the expense of killing pedestrians would the certification program demand that we know about that particular choice\nThe logic is to write out all the potential scenarios that could happen but right now a lot of times those conversations happen outside the context of how many humans unfortunately are killed with cars is they are right now\nBut the way the technology answers that question is that something that the sort of a Geisha process wants to know more about or wants to the end user to know more about\nIn the sense I'll give you an example it's more of a cultural thing recently autonomous vehicles were tested in Australia\nAnd the lidar the technology that's used to sense surroundings hadn't been programmed to recognize kangaroos so the big kind of like bouncing jumping around motions weren't recognized whereas like squirrel dirt emotions were recognized but\nThe point is is that you have to ask even more questions than you had before when you have these new types of technologies and that actually goes back to safety it's just a different type of safety question than some people may have asked before\nAs the technology advances it requires human beings to decide what are our values and what our values in different countries you have to actually define them and be aware of them all\nEthics questions oftentimes especially in western media is coming from a Greek\nBackground of ethics whereas when we have the other side of the planet\nAnd the global south has things called confusion ethics or a boon to ethics and it's a reframing of the paradigm that's how we come to these questions and so it's when you ask those questions that much more this is where the word safety your trust can really be elevated to more global levels and that's what I tripped leaves about consensus building globally\nIs to say we don't know we don't know yet but we have to ask\nJohn Havens is one of the architects of the ethics certification program for autonomous and intelligence systems\nThe eye Tripoli John had been thank you my pleasure\nYou also wrote a book called artificial intelligence that new ethics certification also addresses wider economic effects from New technology and pushes for openness about potential economic winners and losers more of that interview was posted it marketplace dot org I'm David

it was uh the work of off from it all the cod and people around him maybe sour dough Khatami\nOr and so this was days in advance and it's hard to believe that in fact there was a result of a any kind of an investigation on the part of the Saudi authorities as opposed to simply a story that they concocted to try to protect the crown prince well\nIf that is the case I mean if the Saudi Government was scrambling to come up with kind of an explanation um and and this is not coming from any serious investigation what are the options here for for the United states and for the government of

Washington DC\nAnd I'm David Greene in New York City a group of migrants is focusing fresh attention on the flow of people from Central America\nThey have been labeled a caravan we're talking about upwards of seven thousand people many of them fleeing violence in Honduras they're moving northward and many hope to reach the United states now Mexican authorities spoke of stopping them but then let them pass into southern Mexico over the weekend President Trump delivered a stern message\nThese are hard and it's easy for people and I don't want them you\nKnow as you say the president made these claims about these migrants without offering any evidence and we want to turn now to reporter James Frederick who was on the ground and has been following them either James ... so where exactly are you and and talk to me about the conditions of of the people in this caravan\nSo I Am in Tampa to Mexico right now it's about twenty miles north of Mexico Guatemala border I'm and I'm hearing the central square where the care of and uh ended yesterday um people here are just sleeping on the street um I mean right now I'm looking I'm\nYou know at a little girl who is tucked under a blanket with her mom right next to them is a little boys is probably three or four years old or with his parents there's a there's a guy just sleeping under a little plastic bag here\nUm these people walk more than twenty miles yesterday to hear temperatures got above Ninety degrees um so you can just tell they're absolutely exhausted\nYeah I can imagine um so I mean in addition to sleeping on sidewalks and walking is long distances and exhaustion or I mean it's I guess a lot of uncertainty about whether the Mexican government whether the U.S government is actually going to let them continue this journey\n[noise] yeah and it's been very confusing to try to figure out exactly what the Mexican Government strategy is here um because\nYesterday I was walking with the care of and then we heard there was a blockade being set up by Mexican police so we went to check it out they had like two hundred riot police ready to stop the caravan and then a couple of minutes later they just took this blockade away all the police left\nAnd the caravan kept marching so they don't know if the Mexican government is really going to put police there to try to stop them or if they're going to be able to continue north it's it's just not clear yet so\nWe've been obviously reporting on migrants from Central America making their way to the United states for a long time now that this group and correct me if I'm wrong seems particularly large um\nDoes that tell us anything [noise] so ... you're right we we have been seeing for years people fleeing countries like Honduras and El Salvador in Guatemala there's lots and lots of crime gang crime is very bad there you know poverty is also really bad um\nYou know talking to people about why they're in this caravan of why so many of them have come together they just said they saw the caravan as an opportunity to be safer because\nThis migrant route is so dangerous for migrants and especially if you're traveling with kids\nTravelling alone put you at risk of so many things of cartels and gangs attacking you which is very common here in Mexico so they saw this as the safest way to get out of their countries and they think the United states is is the safest the best place they can be\nOkay in of course president from now saying though that they're not going to be allowed into the country is a lot of uncertainty for the group you're following this reporter James Frederick speaking to us about this caravan of migrants moving northward you speaking to us from Mexico James thanks a lot\nThank you American\nVoters are choosing more

number of projects for a number of months they've just mentioned the last few days and they've decided on Nineteen projects and they're going to spend about a billion dollars of Dutch\nHelping people in the coast of India to cope with the impacts of climate change the most controversial though has been money spent on the kingdom of Bahrain or the island to Bahrain or oil rich states which applied to the green climate fund for money and has been given some money in this cause some controversy as you can imagine amongst the people who support the fund\nGiven the link between oil producing and carbon dioxide and climate change\nYes I think a lot of people are feeling that this green climate fund is there to support the least developing countries in they're developing of infrastructure that can cope with climate change in the future help them to move to renewable energies in the future as well\nAnd clearly the green climate fund in spending mode now but they'll have to replenish the money and with the Trump Administration backing away from contributing where might that fund turn to to topple the coffers\nThat's a really good question they had about a three billion dollars have been committed by the United states under President Obama\nA about a billion was paid on two billion is not being held back by President Trump\nSo the green climate fund is now in boxing on a new round of replenishment says they called us to try and make up that shortfall but as you say it's pretty difficult and with the elections in Brazil coming up they may find the Brazilians are not necessarily willing to help so it could be a tough us go over the next few months to help poor countries cope with climate change in the U.S to come\n... in London thank you so much thank you us stock

bystanders in some crashes and artificial intelligence could discriminate against women job applicants a story be covered the other day\nThe powerful trait in tech organization the Institute of electrical and electronics engineers has just come up with a new ethics certification process it's designed to help engineers make technology that on balance helps rather than hertz in his transparent about the assumptions built in John Havens is executive director of this artificial intelligence and robot\nEthics project thanks for joining us my pleasure to be here this is about what a putting human needs first when it comes to autonomous robots self driving technology\nWasn't in general is sort of an idea of a contract when you buy a piece of technology and the expectation is it will be safe and all that but with autonomous and intelligence systems there's just new things that people have to understand her trustworthy\nSo for instance as engineers work on autonomous vehicles self driving cars and trucks\nThey have to program in different preferences of self driving car has a choice of saving the occupants of the car in an impending crash but at the expense of killing pedestrians would the certification program demand that we know about that particular choice\nThe logic is to write out all the potential scenarios that could happen but right now a lot of times those conversations happen outside the context of how many humans unfortunately are killed with cars is they are right now\nBut the way the technology answers that question is that something that the sort of a Geisha process wants to know more about or wants to the end user to know more about\nIn the sense I'll give you an example it's more of a cultural thing recently autonomous vehicles were tested in Australia\nAnd the lidar the technology that's used to sense surroundings hadn't been programmed to recognize kangaroos [laughter] so the big kind of like bouncing jumping around motions weren't recognized whereas like squirrel dirt emotions were recognized\nBut the point is is that you have to ask even more questions than you had before when you have these new types of technologies and that actually goes back to safety it's just a different type of safety question than some people may have asked before\nAs the technology advances it requires human beings to decide what are our values and what our values in different countries you have to ask you define them and be aware of them\nAll ethics questions oftentimes especially in western media is coming from a Greek\nBackground of ethics whereas when we have the other side of the planet\nAnd the global south has things called confusion ethics or a boon to ethics and it's a reframing of the paradigm that how we come to these questions and so it's when you ask those questions that much more this is where the word safety or trust can really be elevated to more global levels and that's what a trip believes about consensus building globally\nIs to say we don't know we don't know yet but we have to ask\nJohn Havens is one of the architects of the ethics certification program for a time\nAnd this and intelligence systems at the Tripoli John had been thank you my pleasure\nIt's interesting that new ethics certification also addresses wider economic effects from New technology and pushes for openness about potential economic

of a any kind of an investigation on the part of the Saudi authorities as opposed to simply a story that they concocted to try to protect the crown prince well\nIf that is the case I mean if the Saudi

in this caravan\nSo I Am in Tampa to Mexico right now it's about twenty miles north of Mexico Guatemala border I'm and I'm hearing the central square where the care of and uh ended yesterday um people here are just sleeping on the street um I mean right now I'm looking I'm\nYou know at a little girl who is tucked under a blanket with her mom right next to them is a little boy he's probably three or four years old\nOr with his parents there's a there's a guy just sleeping under a little plastic bag here um these people walk more than twenty miles yesterday to get here temperatures got above Ninety degrees and so you can just tell they're absolutely exhausted\nYeah I can imagine um so I mean in addition to sleeping on sidewalks and walking is long distances and exhaustion or I mean it's I guess a lot of uncertainty about whether the Mexican government whether the U.S government is actually going to let them continue this journey\n[noise] yeah and it's been very confusing to try to figure out exactly what the Mexican Government strategy is here\nUm because yesterday I was walking with the care of and then we heard there was a blockade being set up by Mexican police so we went to check it out they had like two hundred riot police ready to stop the caravan and then a couple of minutes later they just took this blockade away all the police left\nAnd the caravan kept marching so they don't know if the Mexican government is really going to put police there to try to stop them or if they're going to be able to continue north it's it's just not clear yet so we've\nBeen obviously reporting on migrants from Central America making their way to the United states for a long time now that this group and correct me if I'm wrong seems particularly large um does that tell us anything\n[noise] so ... you're right we we have been seeing for years people fleeing countries like Honduras and El Salvador in Guatemala there's you know lots and lots of crime gang crime is very bad there you know poverty is also really bad\nUm you know talking to people about why during this caravan of why so many of them have come together they just said they saw the caravan as an opportunity to be safer because\nThis migrant route is so dangerous for migrants and especially if you're traveling with kids travelling alone put you at risk of so many things of cartels and gangs attacking you which is very common here in Mexico\nSo they saw this as the safest way to get out of their countries and they think the United states is is the safest and best place they can be\nOkay
