EDITION from\nThe New York times reports that Trump's father slipped him a few hundred million dollars in taxes and according to Forbes magazine the president has tried and failed to profit residency

seriously for very long damn Alexandra Forbes thanks very much thank you [noise]\nOh\nNow where the president talks he's sometimes slurs his words and his words about public policy are often disjointed\nBut in a speech last night President Trump sounded a theme he seemed more comfortable with defending people he believes are falsely accused accused of sexual misconduct\nHe took the opportunity to mock a woman who says she was sexually assaulted the president was speaking Christine Blasey Ford who said Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh attacked or during a party when they're both in high school but Ford has not recalled every detail Trump described her testimony this way\nI had one right I Want to be\nWell you think it was it was what I'll do it\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many [noise]\nThe president himself had described forward as credible just days ago as outburst to a cheering crowd in Mississippi comes as the Senate prepares to vote on Kavanaugh's\nConfirmation and the fight over that vote has in some ways been changing the United States Senate to development with long term implications NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell has been watching it happen and she's in our studios in mourning mourning what's different about the Senate\nThings are testy things are we're watching senators fight with each other basically on the Senate floor which is not something they typically do they keep their fight to the hallways or you know to sniping in private but this has become\nAn intensely political fight and it's not just about whether or not ... you know bloody for his memory was exactly what she said it would be it was also in some ways about the treatment and the conversation around sexual assault\nAnd the idea that it could be becoming more political conversation it's something that Senator Bob Corker mentioned to me when I caught up with him yesterday with listen\nI Know a lot about sexual\nThe thought that we don't care about that is ridiculous but and that's the way it's being portrayed and and\nYou know it's a shame now Corker is retiring and he's had his very public clashes with the president in the past but it does bring up this idea that comment like company making make it harder\nFor Republicans to keep this out of the political around and keep this focus on moving Kavanaugh forward as a conservative judge that they support for his judicial record\nI guess the application of someone like Corker is they really rather sexual assault not be something that we have to political debate something we could all agree as as a bad thing about it should be prosecuted or should be dealt with and some very direct way and instead it's become this matter of intense political debate you said people are tense\nI Want I Want to underline that for people who don't follow the Senate every day I'm sure these guys have never really liked each other just as early bought something different now\nYeah I mean they they get into arguments but at the Senate has kind of it and its title is the world's greatest deliberative body and part of that is that they like to get into debates they talk to each other they work out in the gym together but I'm hearing stories about staff meetings that are becoming public griping sessions where people are complaining about each other\nAnd it's also getting a little bit tense for senators who are worried about their safety\nNow I I Walk around the Capitol almost every day and it's very rare to see somebody who isn't a top leader with a police escort but members Republican members of the Senate Judiciary committee are walking around public spaces with police officers at their side and people are being confronted an airport it's become quite it's it's a big change\nThe fact that matter though is that the president sees this as a political winner for this message she was asked by a reporter Peter Alexander of NBC yesterday do you have a message for young men in this moment the president responded it's a very scary time for young men in America that is not something I imagine that senators ahead of a mid term want to double down on no because\nRepublicans in particular are fighting for the vote of women and we talked about that in ... very often but that is coming up yet again\nKelsey thanks for your reporting really appreciate thank you That's NPR's Kelsey Snell\nOr at the embattled prime minister of the United kingdom Theresa May is giving a speech this morning at the annual meeting of her conservative party\nThis week her rivals have attacked her plan for breakfast with what many also see as an idle replacing her as prime minister meanwhile they're just two weeks left before may as opposed to meet with the European Union and come up with yet another new plan that they might accept\nNPR's Frank Langfitt has been at the party's meeting in Burma do they say Birmingham in Birmingham yeah arming um Birmingham Birmingham, England this week and he's now back in London or what do we expect from this speech right\nWell I think the context is is part of the most important thing in the sense that breakfast is the biggest challenge we talked about this before the u._k. stays probably since the end of World War two\nIs tremendous uncertainty here a question about the leadership in the direction of the country and people are expecting her to strike an optimistic note but they're going to be I think more focused on her presence or confidence or delivery\nCan she convince people at this very difficult time that she can pull off a Brexit deal when he was against it which he's pitched as well as many members of her own party\nUm and last month you know when the huge rejected her breakfast planned people here saw that as a public humiliation states come out and appear strong especially as you were pointing out their rivals who are clearly eyeing the water's year and maybe looking for an opening in of course\nA Steve you remember from last year was going to be a lot better than last year speech because she got into a terrible coughing fit and that was deemed disaster there should be better\nOkay so hopefully she's got some water up they're going to be a Boris Johnson just name one rival uh not not too happy with her at the moment\nNo not at all he actually came out yesterday ... what's called the fringe event away from the main venue\nAnd he told a party to just get your plan which her plan calls for a closer relationship with you a he called it a cheat an outrage these are very strong words at a at a party meeting and not what people voted for back in two thousand and sixteen um she wants a short break and more independent of Britain and here's some of what do you have to say\nIf we get it wrong army proceed with these undemocratic knew if you made the offer we will ... these talks tedious business\nFor track for real for track the toxic you it was classic bars that's classic bars\nAre although you know um I mean it's just it has been pretty toxic and pretty tedious at the same story over and over again how history is responding to this\nWell she kind of put him down she said uh you know ... always puts on a good show but she said his plan doesn't do anything to avoid a hard border a new border on the island of Ireland which is a big issue and people are very concerned about [noise]\nUh Johnson is known to be very ambitious but many in the conference actually that I talked to a job at the meeting up in Birmingham don't think he's necessarily the right person for the job at this time he's charismatic he's entertaining sometimes will soon as we don't really detailed guy and trade negotiations are pulled out details\nDelicate I Want to make sure that I understand the bottom line here Frank Langfitt it sounds like Britain's conservatives continue to argue among themselves among variations on a plan you have all of which are totally unacceptable to the Europeans anyway\nI mean at this point most of it bars the splint could be but it creates other protect potentially some very big economic problems for the United kingdom the fear of kind of walking away um so that's that's the big concern here is can they get a plan that doesn't damage the economy and that the un parliament will agree to\nNPR's Frank Langfitt thanks so much happy to do it Steve and you're hearing Frank right here on MORNING EDITION from NPR News\nMix them on the world

destroyed on both sides of the road and then as you move into Paul do you see a a long debate\nJust nothing but you know houses that have been snapped like twigs UC\nCement homes that are leaning and

did and I of course you ask them what was that like where were you um how how is it that you're still standing here um and generally you knew they look at you and they say we were just panicked and there was no time to act\nIn fact one man said I you know my my sense is just went blank and I turned and I I felt the quake and I turned and almost immediately he said he saw a wall of water\nAnd he said you may think we sound selfish I sound selfish to say this but all I could think of was to run I didn't even think of how I was going to see my father in this disaster and his father indeed has

the FBI was trying to corroborate those charges of possible the agency has been given no more than a week to look into the allegation about the Nineteen eighties how is it possible to do NPR's Martin Kaste reports on what this FBI background check use and it's not\nIf you're following the breathless coverage on cable news you get the impression this investigation is\nPretty serious happening now breaking news comprehensive pro but listen carefully to how it's being described president\nUs with the just the sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nTo catch that this is an investigation\nInto sexual assault allegations what it's not as a criminal sexual assault investigation and that's pretty parents are the people who usually do those the local police\nWere falling at a little bit uh some more than others that Steve\nCooper commander of the criminal investigation division for the police department in ... Texas outside Dallas he's done a lot of sex crime investigations but he's glad that he's not doing the Kavanaugh case\nWe wouldn't want to have any part of that given the the nature of how public that investigation is because anybody with any social me or who's watched it on TV has turned his arms or any potential witness for victim is um let's say ten\nIf Cooper did have this case you'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing\nThat is because in recent years police have been moving toward a model called trauma informed interviewing Rebecca Campbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State who's helped to promote the new standard which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong\nWhat trauma informed interviewing a saying just because they might have difficulty answering a question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in the case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slow non confrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like background checks focus on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone is lying or compromise or hiding something\nThe FBI is just gathering information for prospective employer and the standard of proof is lower still Tom ... says you could do an actual criminal investigation and the case of just Kavanaugh's assuming the state statute of limitations allowed it\nNews and all things considered I really

penalty called unnecessary roughness but the NFL has come to realize it must redefine its governing body of acceptable violence player health is no longer something to be taken lightly at the same time the NFL has rightly come to believe that for football to remain high scoring entertainment\nThose gun slinging quarterbacks need to be special we cared for clay Matthews which they coddled and successive weeks\nThe Green Bay Packers delivered hits on quarterbacks that wouldve earned a player praised from pop Warner level to the pros instead Matthews hits were met with appropriate um the NFL said that Matthews tackles were violations because he had put quote most if not all of his body weight on the opponent\nWhich is to say the NFL seems to have to find an illegal tackled by defining

societal acceptance of violence changes and as our knowledge of head trauma expands sports obviously must change to\nThis change might come in fits and false starts in the NFL but there must be

prior\nI don't know if the true with turkey or the thirty four was jerky but it's an indication that the NFL is trying to get the balance right\nNFL tough guys of course like seeing fewer flags for

McDonald testified yesterday\nJason Van Dyke is accused of shooting the Seventeen year old sixteen times in what he says was self defense\nStringent forceful towards me [noise] the weeds and noise from lower right side of words crosses party horse my shoulder and when he was the last ...\nSome of the testimony yesterday from Jason Van Dyke Patrick Smith of member station WBEZ in Chicago has been\nFollowing the story Patrick good morning It's MORNING okay so I just now I went back and watched\nThis dashcam video again and again ... not doing what the police are but he's walking along the street has gotten out of his vehicle he's walking past the officers he's a distance of about a traffic Wayne away from the nearest one and then suddenly spins and goes down\nAs he's shop that's what a shock to people but it sounds like this officer describes those very events are very differently\nYes he does and and on the stand insisted that that that can video which which seems to show the shooting very clearly um ... you know officer Van Dyke says that that does not accurately represent what happened it doesn't show what happened from his perspective\nUm that was an understanding yesterday he talked a lot of things that that he said the dash cam video can't see like McDonald's face in his you know he describes his huge eyes and and his\nAnd you know no expression on his face he was looking through Van Dyke and then he talked about that action that you heard there in the intro of of McDonald turning toward him with and waving a night forcing him to shoot 'em as you said none of those things are on the desk and the bill\nAnd is this critical to his defense to try to describe his own state of mind and suggest that whatever you believe from looking at the video I believed I was in danger\nIt's absolutely critical to his defense I mean even if he wasn't an officer acting in self defense requires that that the person who does it feels afraid for for his or her life as a police officer the bar for conviction is even higher you know it has to be what a\nReasonable officer would have done in that moment and so what Van Dyke even before he testified what he needed to convince the jury of\nHis that he was reasonably in fear for his license so he's trying to bring in all sorts of other considerations besides that desk and video to show why he would reasonably be in fear for his life like that look on his face or the turn that that you can't see on the desk and video\nI guess the [noise] excuse me I guess that would explain why he took the risk of taking the stay on which defendants don't have to do\nIs right and this is not something I expected a you know it's something that we\nIt's been asking um attorneys in court Russia watchers through the first two weeks of trial or do you think that and I just can't take the stand or what we heard were mixed answers we heard from a lot of attorneys who said um where you really have to testify cop or not you really have to testify if you're claiming self defense that's what's gonna\nBring it home from the jury we'd all sorts of other people who said oh no that's a huge risk to be to subject yourself to cross examination when there is that dash cam video\nWell how's the cross examination go\nWell um when lobster Van Dyke was giving his testimony when he was questioned by his own attorney he's very emotional he cried when he describes shooting when he was being cross examine that emotion and sadness went away\nThe prosecutor pushed him on the fact that his testimony was contradicted by the video and that it doesn't fit what a Van Dyke set in police reports\nAnd I could not have good answers for that he said he didn't remember what he said right after the shooting because he was in shock and couldn't explain discrepancies that video he was he was combat and prosecutors he seemed almost annoyed that he was being questioned\nDid his initial reports say anything about that look on the suspect's face or the the turn or anything else\nIt didn't say anything about the look but it did actually described in great detail alleged movements five on McDonald's the wave of the night raising the knife and and it described officer Van Dyke backpedaling from McDonald none of those things are on his asked him video\nPatrick Smith of member station WBFO easy in Chicago is covering

party are meeting today prime minister Theresa May gives a speech and just as at last year's version of the same meeting she is trying to get her party behind some plan for Brexit in just two weeks she is supposed to meet with the European Union leaders and find a new plan that they will accept\nNPR's Frank Langfitt is covering all of this either Frank ... is this moment any more desperate than all the other times the conservatives have got the failed to agree\nWell the time is running out as you point out I think that's what he's creating a lot of tension here is there's not a lot of time left on an incredibly difficult and intricate negotiation and the problem for the prime minister has been\nShe can't get the European Union to agree to replant and many people in her own party up there in Birmingham they don't agree with the plan either ... can have a speech today a lot of it's going to be about domestic policy but she's she needs to appear strong and confident\nAs the country goes into what many stories would say is the biggest challenge making them has faced since World War two ah so that's she's going to be coming on actually very soon and we'll be hearing what she has a say what half her critics said well she has a lot of critics but the probably the most prominent ones and many Boris Johnson he's the former foreign minister\nHe's frankly seen as widely gunning for a ... job and he gave a big speech yesterday where he trashed her plan to leave the European Union she calls for one for more closer relationship with the you still be able to trade goods seamlessly he\nCalled this a cheat an outrage not what people voted for back in two thousand and sixteen he'd like to see a sharp break with the European Union a more independent independent Britain and and here's what he said yesterday\nIf we did it wrong army proceed with these on democratic solution if you made the offer we will protect these\nTalks tedious business toxic tedious business it certainly is toxic how does the prime minister responded well\nShe put him down gently uh yesterday on the on the TV he she said ... and that's not how everybody refers to him he's a major figure here always puts on a good show one of her criticisms is that the plan that uh Mr Johnson's putting out there\nUh she says doesn't really address the need to avoid a new heart border on the island of Ireland this is a huge issue we've been talking about right now as as you know Steve the borders seamless you can't even see it people and goods flow freely across in the Irish people in Ireland they they want it that way\nUm there's a real concerned that it could change and she one of the reasons she's trying to continue to have good going back and forth with the EU is to avoid a border of an economy\nBehind these details I have an image Frank Langfitt of an ocean liner I don't know maybe the Titanic had imported iceberg and you've got several people jostling for control of the wheels Boris Johnson being one of them what what are the rank and file conservative thinking this well\nI I think that for the moment I think they're going to stick with prime minister may it's it's sort of hard to imagine given the stakes here that they would switch horses in midstream\nAnd wall Mr Johnson is a very good performer in terms of speeches there there are concerns that he's not the right guy for such a delicate time I was talking to a man named Anthony Martin he's the chairman of east Hampshire conservative association and here's how he put it yesterday in Birmingham\nHe would be great to have the big picture great inspiring people but he would need people on the envelope and deal with the ...\nWould you want to see him as a future hands\nYes and no I'm undecided\nI Am a supporter of or is he he's a law my character\nYou either love him on the um ... character\nAnd some of it's it's an expression here in the United kingdom Martin ... is this sticky dark brown foods bread and it's probably Britain's most divisive food\nProduct well suppose\nThey get on the same page and come up with a plan is there any chance that the Europeans are going to accept them are might [noise]\nWell that's that's a very good question and we what was interesting because we haven't seen a new plan they sent her back to the drawing board the leaders in Brussels and we're waiting to see what she's going to come up with negotiations right now seems stalled\nUm and we just got to meeting two weeks to go um and the concern is if they don't come up with the deal they could you take a crash out of the you could do a lot of damage to the economy here\nNPR's Frank Langfitt always a pleasure talking with you sir happy to do it Steve\nThis afternoon at exactly to Eighteen eastern time you can expect to get a presidential alert on your cell phone it's not exactly from President Trump rather it's a test avenue nationwide warning system that a president could use in case of an attack by another country or a cyber attack or a widespread natural disaster\nStill some worry President Trump could abuse the system NPR's Brian Naylor reports\nBack in the days of the Cold War was pretty common to hear this announcement on TV or radio you know the one this station is conducting a test of the emergency broadcasting system things\nHave gotten a little more sophisticated now but basically the same minute long emergency alert system test is conducted every month or so and broadcast cable and satellite TV and radio there'll be one of those this afternoon to but today you'll also be getting an alert on your cell phone\nHas some of us receive alerts already amber alerts for missing children or flash flood or tornado warnings but this is the first time that you'll be getting a national presidential alert from FEMA\nRuin red letter is director of the national Center for disaster preparedness at Columbia University he says testing the system makes sense\nI carrying the testing of this new wireless emergency alert system is a good idea you can think about a variety of scenarios where it would be good for the president will speak directly to the war\nBut this is where Dr redlin or has some qualms especially says when it comes to this president\nWe share a good thing that the president might be using so just just for clinical purposes or can create a diversion it felt the presidency was under threat\nFor whatever reason so I think there are real concerns ... it'd be so long to about it but these are not ours that many Americans would want to give to Donald\nRed letter is not alone last week three people filed suit in New York to block the testing of a system known as wireless emergency alerts or W E s the suit states the plaintiffs are Americans who do not wish to receive text messages of any kind on any topic or subject from President Trump\nI Would open up the Cape you see out wherever we are and tune in because that's the easy even when you're far flung\nTo become a

section that we're talking about but non market economies are non market here means we're at refers to economies where the government controls are manages things that the market would determine and other economies so maybe a setting more heavily subsidizing certain commodity prices for example\nThe new NAFTA says that if one of the three member countries wants to pursue a free trade agreement with the non market economy it has to notify the other two countries and if it does complete a trade deal with a non market economy\nThe other two countries can leave NAFTA within six months and form their own bilateral deal to they're they're talking about China though exactly\nUm China likes to think that it's a market economy and it's actually battling to be recognized as one it's at the world Trade Organization that the U.S Europe other countries are fighting that saying China's government still has a really heavy hand in at the company\nAnd this is a non market language was not in the old enough to\nKnow that countries could always give six months' notice and leave the agreement as President Trump has threatened to do numerous times but this writing in this explicit language for for leaving this explicit reason for leaving that's now why\nIs this a a big deal I mean of countries could always leave NAFTA if they want to\nWell critics think that this amounts to giving us veto power over deals that Canada and Mexico might want to pursue what China I'm a ... a member of ... of Canada's parliament called it a severe restriction of Canada's independence\nBut Canadian Prime minister Justin Trudeau he said yesterday that Canada will continue to deep and its trade relationship with China and this clause isn't gonna hold it back\nMarketplaces ... thank you [noise] Amazon Amazon as

finances how here's wired much of his money from his father and how his wealth has changed\nTo go to\nNew York times reports Trump's father funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in various ways to avoid some taxes had according to Forbes the president has tried and failed to profit from his presidency and I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin the death toll\nContinues to buy some\nWeight and

chemistry one half of the prize those two American Francis Arnold she will share the other half of the prize with American George Pete Smith\n[noise] yeah it does it does a ring a bell you know in Nineteen eighty two was the first year that we put together the for four hundred was of the richest people in America Donald Trump and his father were on it each of them was a two hundred million dollar fortune\nThe next year they called us up and said well now it's actually all Donald's it's four hundred million dollars to Donald if you take that two hundred million dollar difference in Nineteen eighty three adjusted for inflation up to today that's about five hundred million dollars to the times looking at the actual documents\nFound that he inherited four hundred and something million dollars from his father so it does seem consistent with what we've seen over the years\nThat Alexander was Forbes thank you thank you\nSupreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh faces questions not only over accusations about his past but about the way he has defended himself\nThis whole week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political heck\nIn sworn testimony Kavanaugh spun out of conspiracy theory with no evidence saying among other things that the Clinton family was up to get it Jeff Flake one of the very few undecided senators told the Atlantic festival this week but he's troubled\nAnd I don't know if you give a little leeway because of what he's been through but on the other hand we can't have this on the court we simply can't\nHow important is this question Joe dashes vice president for Strategic engagement at the American Constitution Society which is a liberal legalized advocacy group mourning\nMourning can you really conclude that Kavanaugh would be unfair on the bench just because he says people are out together\nI think there's a real concern there you know he spent the first week of his uh hearing for the Supreme Court nomination talking a lot about how judges should be neutral arbiters and calling balls and strikes and he went to great lengths to explain the importance of that\nAnd then he ended up on a this past Thursday a ending with a phrase what ... what goes around comes around so I ...\nFor the future if there was a time when he says Democrats are up to get him he may have been hyperbolic but some Democrats are up together and they really don't want her to be on the Supreme Court\nWell I think that's not really inappropriate role for a Supreme Court justice a candidate let alone a sitting judge to talk like that we expect judges in this country to be above the fray it's why they wear black robes and they sit behind\nA lectern that literally sit above the fray in a courtroom we don't expect judges to get down and dirty where politicians are I think it's bad enough to have senators yelling at each other we really don't expect judges to be politicians\nIf we except for the moment for the purposes of this question his assertion that he's innocent he says he didn't do anything or he doesn't remember doing anything [noise] what is the manner in which you could have defended himself that would have left him on tainted\nI think it would be fine for him to be impassioned I understand it some basic level the defense it if you feel like you're being wrongly accused of something of course you're going to have passionate about it\nBut he's behavior on Thursday was frankly shocking in an era where not very much a shocking anymore he interrupted senators he answered questions with questions\nUh it it was it was unprofessional and it was a very surprising to hear a judge speaking like that I don't think a judge would tolerate that from a lead again in the courtroom\nThe judge would be shocked um so I think uh you know there was a way for him to make his case and in fact I think Dr\nChristine Blasey Ford made her case in a way that was passionate but not overly emotional and that somebody who was talking about how she had been sexually assaulted so\nSo if a Kavanaugh gets on to the Supreme Court what would you want to happen in cases involving Democrats what do you have to be recusing himself all the time and could somebody making\nA no one can make him which is a real concern um there's nothing that forces Supreme Court justices recused themselves of course parties would filed motions to recuse where they feel like it's appropriate\nI think if you have an issue that concerns women um or liberal politics or even voting cases I think there's a real concern as to whether he can be fair\nConcerning women you're saying that you would be making an argument if you were a lawyer before the court that he's\nAnd be judging anything concerning women I mean I\nThat I Do know that I Would make that argument that far but I was like I think there are certain issues look there were already issues about whether he could fairly judge issues on presidential power and there were lots of discussions about whether he needed to recuse at the beginning of this process\nBecause President Trump might conceivably have some case before the court involving him right\nGo I think there are numerous cases that could come before the court involving President Trump and a judge Kavanaugh has made lots of comments about the extent of a presidential power so that was a concern already and I think his demeanor last week um shows that there are a lot more concerns about his temperament\nJob at the American Constitution Society thanks so much\nAnd get a new State Department visa policy declared that starting this month diplomats who want to bring their same sex partners to the U.S will have to be married Here's NPR's Michele kill them in\nA State Department official says marriage

political speech last night in Mississippi the president shifted to mocking Christine Blasey Ford who accused Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault but didn't recall every detail\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many I don't want\nA mockery came at the same time at the FBI was trying to corroborate those charges of possible the agency has been given no more than a week to look into the allegation about the Nineteen eighties how is it possible to do NPR's Martin Kaste reports on what the FBI background check use and it's not\nIf you're following the breathless coverage on cable news you get the impression this investigation is pretty serious\nHappening now breaking news comprehensive pro but listen carefully to how it's being described president\nBus with the sexual assault allegations within the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nTo catch that this is an investigation into sexual assault allegations\nWhat it's not as a criminal sexual assault investigation and that's pretty parents are the people who usually do those the local police were falling at a little bit uh some more than others that Steven Cooper commander of the criminal investigation division for the police department in ... Texas outside Dallas\nHe's done a lot of sex crime investigations but he's glad that he's not doing the Kavanaugh case\nWe wouldn't want to have any part of that given the the nature of how public that investigation is because anybody with any social me or who's watched it on TV has turned his sons or any potential witness for victim is um let's say tainted\nIf Cooper did have this case you'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing\nThat because in recent years police have been moving toward a model called trauma informed interviewing Rebecca Campbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State who's helped to promote the new standard which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong\nWhat trauma informed interviewing as saying just because they might have difficulty answering a question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in the case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slow non confrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like background checks focus on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone is lying or compromised or hiding something\nThe FBI is just gathering information for prospective employer and the standard of proof is

following the story Patrick good morning the morning okay so I I just now I went back and watched this dashcam video again and again ... not doing what the police said but\nHe's walking along the street has gotten out of his vehicle he's walking past the officers he's a distance of about a traffic lane away from the nearest one and then suddenly spins and goes down as he's shot that's what a shock to people but it sounds like this officer describes goes very events are very differently\nYes she does and and on the stand insisted that that dash cam video which which seems to show the shooting very\nClearly um you know officer Van Dyke says that that does not accurately represent what happened it doesn't show what happened from his perspective\nUm that was an understanding yesterday he talked a lot about things that that he said the dash cam video can't see like McDonald's face and his and he describes his huge eyes and and as\nAnd you know no expression on his face he was looking through Van Dyke and then he talked about that action that you heard there in the intro of of McDonalds turning toward him with and waving and not forcing him to shoot 'em as you said none of those things are on the dash cam video\nAnd is this critical to his defense to try to describe his own state of mind and suggest that whatever you believe from looking at the video I believed I was in danger\nIt's absolutely critical to his defense I mean even if he wasn't an officer acting in self defense or requires that that the person who does it feels afraid for for his or her life\nAs a police officer the bar or for conviction is even higher you know it has to be what a reasonable officer would have done in that moment and so what Van Dyke even before he testified what he needed to convince the jury of\nIs that he was reasonably in fear for his life and so he's trying to bring in all sorts of other considerations besides that dash cam video to show why he would reasonably be here for his wife likes that look on his face or the turn that that you can't see on the dash cam video\nI guess that would explain why he took the risk of taking the stand which defendants don't have to do\nThat is right and and this is not something I expected a you know it's something that we've been asking um attorneys in court Ross boxers or the first two weeks of trial or do you think and I was going to take the stand or what we heard were mixed answers we heard\nFrom a lot of attorneys who said um well you really have to testify top or not you really have to testify if you're claiming self defense that's what's going to\nBring it home from the jury we all sorts of other people who said oh no that's a huge risk to reach a subject yourself to cross examination when there is that dash cam video\nWell how's the cross examination go well\nUm when boxer Van Dyke was giving his testimony when he was questioned by his own attorney he was very emotional he cried when he describes shooting when he was being cross examined that emotion and sadness went away the prosecutor pushed him on the fact that his testimony was contradicted by the video and that it doesn't fit what a Van Dyke set in police reports\nVan Dyke did not have good answers for that he said he didn't remember what he said right after the shooting because he was in shock and couldn't explain discrepancies with a video and he was he was combative with prosecutors he seemed almost annoyed that he was being questioned\nIt as initial reports say anything about that look on the suspect space or the the turn or anything else\nIt didn't say anything about the look what he did actually described in great detail alleged movements by requirements on all the waving of the knife raising the knife and and it

Downing Street and that's something they absolutely don't want to see\nFrank thanks very much happy to do it Steve NPR's Frank Langfitt\nThis afternoon at exactly to Eighteen eastern time you can expect to get a presidential alert on your cell phone it's not exactly from President Trump rather it's a test of a new nationwide warning system that a president could use in case of an attack by another country or a cyber attack or a widespread natural disaster\nStill some worry President Trump could abuse the system NPR's Brian Naylor reports\nBack in the days of the Cold War was pretty common to hear this announcement on TV or radio you know the one the station is conducting attest to the emergency broadcasting system\nThings have gotten a little more sophisticated now but basically the same minute long emergency alert system test is conducted every month or so and broadcast cable and satellite TV and radio\nThere'll be one of those this afternoon to but today you'll also be getting an alert on your cell phone has some of us receive alerts already amber alerts for missing children or flash flood or tornado warnings but this was the first time that you'll be getting a national presidential alert from FEMA\nRuin red letter is director of the national Center for disaster preparedness at Columbia University he says testing the system makes sense\nCarrying the testing of this new wireless emergency oh this is a good idea you can think about a variety of scenarios where it would be good for the president will speak directly to the war\nBut this is where Dr redlin or has some qualms especially says when it comes to this president\nWe show defeating the president might be using such as just there for clinical purposes or get free version of the presidency were voted\nFor whatever reason so I think there are real concerns it'd be so one thing about it but these are not ours that many Americans would want to give to Donald Trump\nRed letter is not alone last week three people filed suit in New York to block the testing of the system\nKnown as wireless emergency alerts or W E s the suit states the plaintiffs are Americans who do not wish to receive text messages of any kind on any topic or subject from President Trump\nFrom before surgery through recovery the orthopedic team at Huntington Hospital makes it their priority to keep patients moving and enjoying life to learn more visit Huntington Hospital dot org slash or so [noise]\nNow after two point oh has some barbs in it's aimed at China\nMarketplace morning report is supported by pay pal business financing pay pal has helped business has access more than five billion dollars in loans globally if you need access to a business financing pay pal can do that\nLearn more pay pal dot com slash marketplace hand by his Cox insurance providing customized insurance for small and medium businesses so they can do more and be more more his Cox dot com or from an agent Hitchcock's insurance encourage courage\nIn New York I'm to prevent a short infer David Brancaccio the new and negotiated us MCAA trade agreement between the U.S Canada and Mexico is thousands of pages long and buried in it is a provision clearly targeting China marketplaces ... Samuelson covers trade and is here to explain\nA tricky so why and how is China getting shot out in this updated version of NAFTA\nSo China is an explicit renamed in the section that we're talking about but non market economies are and that is referring to the economy is where the government controls are manages things that\nMarket forces would determine and other economies so for example maybe setting or heavily subsidizing certain commodity prices then you have to says that if one of the three member countries wants to pursue a free trade deal with the non market economy it has to notify the other two\nAnd if it does complete a free trade agreement with that now market economy the other two countries can leave NAFTA or the new NAFTA in six months and form their own bilateral deal\nWas this seems pretty clearly about excluding China\nExactly um sign up for the record wants to be marked a recognized as a market economy but the U.S Europe other countries still think China has a really heavy hand NS economy and that that's not fair\nAnd this non market language was not in the old\nIt was not but countries could always give six months' notice and leave the agreement as President Trump has threatened to do many times writing in this explicit justification is Neal and critics think it amounts to giving us veto power over deals that Canada and Mexico might want to pursue what China\nMarketplaces treasures Tracey Samuelson thank you\nAmazon as we've heard will pay three hundred and fifty thousand of its workers at least Fifteen dollars an hour large companies and Amazon is

part of his political identity as a leader is challenged on multiple times\nI'm Suzanne widely major media investigations probed Trump's wealth and business sense Brett Kavanaugh's harsh criticism of the political left raises questions\nHis tirade his fury will cause great doubt about the objectivity of decisions he makes\nProgress is down to the Supreme Court nominees ability to remain impartial on the bench among some Korean immigrants there is a strong taboo against talking about your child's autism days to believe that because you know they did something wrong these moms Floyd [noise] or you brought that lack this hour here\nAbout parents shaking off superstition to better understand their autistic children It's Wednesday October third now the news [noise]\nLive from NPR News in Washington on core of the Coleman at a political rally in Mississippi last night President Trump mocked the research psychology professor who was accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulting her when they were in high school\nNPR's Miles parks reports the crowd laughed and cheered when Trump pretended to act out Christine Blasey Ford's testimony\n[noise] yeah it does it does a ring a bell you know in Nineteen eighty two was the first year that we put together the for four hundred lists of the richest people in America Donald Trump and his father were on it each of them was a two hundred million dollar fortune\nThe next year they called us up and said well now it's actually all Donald since four hundred million dollars to Donald if you take that two hundred million dollar difference in Nineteen eighty three adjusted for inflation up to today that's about five hundred million dollars to the times looking at the actual documents\nFound that he inherited four hundred and something million dollars from his father so it does seem consistent with what we've seen over the years\nThat Alexander was ... thank you thank you\nSupreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh faces questions not only over accusations about his past but about the way he has defended himself\nThis whole week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit\nYou in sworn testimony Kavanaugh spun out a conspiracy theory with no evidence saying among other things that the Clinton family was out to get it Jeff Flake one of the very few undecided senators told the Atlantic festival this week that he's troubled\nAnd I don't know if you give a little leeway because of what he's done through but on the other hand we can't have this on the court we simply can't\nHow important is this question Jill dashes vice president for Strategic engagement at the American Constitution Society which is a liberal legalized advocacy group mourning\nMourning can you really conclude that Kavanaugh would be unfair on the bench just because he says people are out to get him\nI think there's a real concern there you know he spent the first week of his uh hearing for the Supreme Court nomination talking a lot about how judges should be neutral arbiters and calling balls and strikes and he went to great lengths to explain the importance of that\nAnd then he ended up on a this past Thursday a ending with that phrase what ... what goes around comes around so I\nI ... for the future if there's a time when he says Democrats are up to get him he may have been hyperbolic but some Democrats are out together and they really don't want it to be on the Supreme Court\nWell I think that's not really inappropriate roles\nFor a Supreme Court justice a candidate let alone a sitting judge to talk like that we expect judges in this country to be above the fray\nIt's why they were black robes and they sit behind a left turns that literally sit above the fray in a courtroom we don't expect judges to get down and dirty where politicians are I think it's bad enough to have senators yelling at each other we really don't expect judges to be politicians\nIf we except for the moment for the purposes of this question his assertion that he's innocent he says he didn't do anything or does remember doing everything\nWhat is the manner in which you could have defended himself that would have left him on tainted\nI think it would be fine for him to be impassioned I understand it some basic level the defense it if you feel like you're being wrongly accused of something of course you're going to have passion about it\nBut his behavior on Thursday was frankly shocking in an era we are not very much a shocking anymore he interrupted senators he answered questions with questions\nUh it was it was unprofessional and it was a very surprising to hear a judge speaking like that I don't think a judge would tolerate that from a lead again in the courtroom the judge would be shocked\nUm so I think um you know there was a way for him to make his case and in fact I think Dr Christine Blasey Ford made her case in a way that was passionate but not overly emotional and that somebody who was talking about how she had been sexually assaulted so\nSo if Kavanaugh gets on to the Supreme Court what would you want to happen in cases involving Democrats what do you have to be refusing himself all the time and put somebody make him\nA no one can make him which is a real concern um there's nothing that forces Supreme Court justices to recuse themselves of course parties would file a motion to recuse where they feel like it's appropriate\nI think if you have an issue that concerns women um or liberal politics or even voting cases I think there's a real concern as to whether he can be fair\nIssues concerning women you're saying that you would be making an argument if you were a lawyer before the court that he shouldn't be judging anything concerning women\nI mean I ... I don't know that I Would make that argument that far but I was like I think there are certain issues look there were already issues about whether he could fairly judge issues on presidential power and there were lots of discussions about whether he needed to recuse at the beginning of this process\nBecause President Trump might conceivably have some case before the court and vote again what\nDo I think there are numerous cases that could come before the court involving President Trump and a judge Kavanaugh has made lots of comments about the extent of a presidential power so that was a concern already and I think his demeanor last week um shows that there are a lot more concerns about his temperament\nJob at the American Constitution Society effect so much and\nKeep a new State Department visa policy declared that starting this month of diplomats who wants to bring their same sex partners to the U.S will have to be married Here's NPR's Michele kill them in\nA State Department official says marriage equality is the love the land here in the U.

right side of words crosses towards my shoulder and when he did what diseases or shut off\nSome of the testimony yesterday from Jason Van Dyke Patrick Smith of member station WBEZ in Chicago\nHas been following the story Patrick good morning the morning okay so I just now I went back and watched this dashcam video again and again ... not doing what the police are but\nHe's walking along the street has gotten out of his vehicle he's walking past the officers he's a distance of about a traffic lane away from the nearest one and then suddenly spins and goes down as he's shot that's what a shock to people but it sounds like this officer describes those very events are very differently\nYes she does and and on the stand insisted that that dash cam video which which seems to show the shooting very\nClearly um you know officer Van Dyke says that that does not accurately represent what happened it doesn't show what happened from his perspective\nUm that was an understanding yesterday he talked a lot about things that that he said the dashcam video can't see like McDonald's face and his and he describes his huge eyes and and his\nAnd you know no expression on his face he was looking through Van Dyke and then he talked about that action that you heard there in the intro of of McDonalds turning toward him with and waving and not forcing him to shoot 'em as you said none of those things are on the dash cam video\nAnd is this critical to his defense to try to describe his own state of mind and suggest that whatever you believe from looking at the video I believed I was in danger\nIt's absolutely critical to jazz defense I mean even if he wasn't an officer acting in self defense or requires that that the person who does it feels afraid for for his or her life\nAs a police officer the bar or for conviction is even higher you know it has to be what a reasonable officer would have done in that moment and so what Van Dyke even before he testified what he needed to convince the jury of\nIs that he was reasonably in fear for his life and so he's trying to bring in all sorts of other considerations besides that dash cam video to show why he would reasonably be here for his wife like that look on his face or the turn that that you can't see on the dash cam video\nI guess that would explain why he took the risk of taking the stand which defendants don't have to do\nThat's right and and this is not something I expected a you know it's something that we've been asking um attorneys in court Russia watchers are the first two weeks of trial or do you think the end I was going to take the stand or what we heard were mixed answers we heard\nFrom a lot of attorneys who said um well you really have to testify top or not you really have to testify if you're claiming self defense that's what's going to\nBring it home from the jury we also heard from a lot of other people who said oh no that's a huge risk to to subject yourself to cross examination when there is that dash cam video\nWell how's the cross examination go\nWell um when boxer Van Dyke was giving his testimony when he was questioned by his own attorney he was very emotional he cried when he describes the shooting\nWhen he was being cross examined that emotion and sadness went away the prosecutor pushed him on the fact that his testimony was contradicted by the video and that it doesn't fit what of and I said in police reports\nVan Dyke to not have good answers for that he said he didn't remember what he said right after the shooting 'cause he was in shock and couldn't explain discrepancies with the video and he was he was combative with prosecutors he seemed almost annoyed that he was being questioned\nIt as an initial reports say anything about that look on the suspect's face or the the turn or anything else\nIt didn't say anything about the look but it did actually described in great detail alleged movements by requirement Donald the wave of the knife

very challenging the ... but if we stick together and hold on I Know we can get a deal that the ... the British and\nNPR's Frank Langfitt always hold his nerve and is on the line from London either Frank hey good morning how would you say the prime minister did she actually did\nPretty well Steve you know usually she is a stiff performer she came out actually in the hall dancing to have is dancing queen she was only yeah which is not a typical I'm Theresa May move\nBut she was making fun of these awkward robotic dance moves that she put on at the school at a recent trip in South Africa that became a huge name here so for her to poke fun of yourself probably a very good way to start off on the political front as you're saying she's under pressure from both sides but she remains defiant and she basically doubled down on this compromise deal\nThat would allow tower free trade on good with the EU which of course the giant market over five hundred million consumers but would stop the free flow of ... workers coming here and no longer would you be subject to laws made in Brussels is this is the way that she put it\nBack control of all who has no money good job good for the union it keeps face with the British people if he's in the national in drank\nA Frank I suppose it must seem to be in Britain's national interest since she's demanding such good terms that there's no indication she can get them hasn't the European Union already said it won't accept this deal\nWell they have and that's why I think domestically this sounds good but it doesn't seem to fully recognize what the European Union has said and the other challenges you face as ears that\nShe may have trouble getting a deal like this through parliament given the there's a lot of people in her own party who are against it now she got a couple more weeks these uh before there's this other meeting in Brussels to hammer out an agreement\n'em and you've got to wonder if there might be a compromise down the line although that would be embarrassing given the kind of speech that she just gave the he was adamant that you can have the free movement of goods without accepting you workers that would break the rules of the club and eventually people ... think it would lead to this integration of the union\nFrank and I just tell you something that I hear from people here as we talk to your periodically you tell us essentially the same story that the British are proposing unrealistic terms that they can get and they go back to square one again and somebody will be listening to that story and say to me have they thought of maybe just voting again on whether they really want to do breakfast\nYeah that that comes up here as well and that is in the newspapers in the conversation there are some polls that have shown a small change\nBut also if you look at the polls actually people are more entrenched in some ways than they were back in two thousand and sixteen I was out in Liverpool last week talk to more than ... people I found only one person who has shifted their opinions\nAnd today is before a prime minister may she was adamant that there's going to be no re runs of two thousand and sixteen this is what she said\nI second referendum would be a politician and politicians handing people getting on the fifth time and should try again no one would do just say in all of\nIt is really interesting the conservative party leaders including the likes of may have said all along they are not total fans of this Brexit thing but they want to respect the will of the people and that's what I guess you said again what else did she say in the speech\nWell it's interesting rex who was actually the smallest part of the speech it mostly was focusing on his domestic agenda jobs the confidence of the conservative party which previously it's definitely been known for as well just even the diversity of her own cabinet\nAnd that's because breakfast has been really divisive for the party it's been a mill stone around the neck of conservatives in last week I was the Labour Party conference up in Liverpool and they were very they seem pretty United they felt like a government party and waiting and may and the other conservative I think they know they need to stick together\nTheir worst nightmare is being forced into a general election and losing to the Labour Party and that would

hyperbolic but some Democrats are not together and they really don't want her to be on the Supreme Court\nWell I think that's not really inappropriate role for a Supreme Court justice a candidate let alone is sitting judge to talk like that we expect judges in this country to be above the fray it's why they wear black robes and they sit behind\nA lectern said literally sit above the fray in a courtroom we don't expect judges to get down and dirty where politicians are I think it's bad enough to have senators yelling at each other we really don't expect judges to be politicians\nIf we except for the moment for the purposes of this question his assertion that he's innocent he says he didn't do anything or he doesn't remember doing anything [noise] what is the manner in which you could have defended himself that would have left him on tainted\nI think it would be fine for him to be impassioned I understand it some basic level the defense it if you feel like you're being wrongly accused of something of course you're going to have passion about it\nBut he's behavior on Thursday was frankly shocking in an era where not very much is shocking anymore he interrupted senators he answered questions with questions\nUh it it was it was unprofessional and it was a very surprising to hear a judge speaking like that I don't think a judge would tolerate that from a lead again in the courtroom the judge would be shocked\nUm so I think uh you know there was a way for him to make his case and in fact I think Dr Christine Blasey Ford made her case in a way that was passionate but not overly emotional and now it's somebody who was talking about how she had been sexually assaulted so\nSo if a Kavanaugh gets on to the Supreme Court what would you want to happen in cases involving Democrats what do you have to be recusing himself all the time and could somebody making\nA no one can make him which is a real concern um there's nothing that forces Supreme Court justices to recuse themselves of course parties would filed motions to recuse where they feel like it's appropriate\nI think if you have an issue that concerns women um or liberal politics or even voting cases I think there's a real concern as to whether he can be fair\nConcerning women you're saying that you would be making an argument if you were a lawyer before the court that he should\nJudging anything concerning women I mean I\nThat I Do know that I Would make that argument that far better than I was like I think there are certain issues look there were already issues about whether he could fairly judge issues on presidential power and there were lots of discussions about whether he needed to recuse at the beginning of this process\nBecause President Trump might conceivably have some case before the court involving him right\nGo I think there are numerous cases that could come before the court involving President Trump and a judge Kavanaugh has made lots of comments about the extent of a presidential power so that was a concern already and I think his demeanor last week um shows that there are a lot more concerns about his temperament\nJob at the
