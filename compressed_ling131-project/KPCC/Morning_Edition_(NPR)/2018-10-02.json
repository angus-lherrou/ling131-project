NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith thanks so much You're welcome\n[noise]\nAlright another chapter opens and the standoff between the state of California and the Trump Administration the California state government is wrangling with the federal government on a whole range of issues including immigration and climate change and now net neutrality\nYou know the Justice Department filed suit this week against or California law new law that regulates Internet service providers that's set up a high stakes legal battle who give to control this question\nCalifornia's law requires carriers to treat all Web traffic equally rather than giving a leg up to some companies over others in other words the law requires not neutrality which\nWas federal policy under the Obama administration but the Obama version of that was rolled back after President Trump took office\nOkay Toni Rom of the Washington Post covers all things like this is an expert on net neutrality no pressure Tony going to ask you explain these issues um again so first off let's talk about the suit why is this a priority for the Justice Department strikes me as sort of an odd thing for them to take interest in\nYeah the Trump Administration wants the final word on net neutrality here and you have to really rewind the clock to win the FCC killed these open Internet protections that were put in place under former president ... as part of that order the FCC said that states couldn't pass\nTheir own that you follow the rules that explicitly preempted those states from doing so now states that it any way California put its law into place it adopted it I just this past weekend and two hours later the Justice Department filed a lawsuit saying if our decision here it's something that belongs to the federal government\nAnd sort of inherent in all of this is a belief that the Internet crosses state lines\nIt will be very difficult in the eyes of the Justice Department to have\nFifty states that have fifty different sets of rules on net neutrality throughout the state say we have to do it because the federal government has decided that it's not going to do it\nIs interesting though that the Republican Party has been the party of states' rights in recent generations of loose but here they are pushing for federal power on an issue where this administration has a point of view\nIt just seemed like a little bit of a twist doesn't it but the Trump Administration says that this is something that has to be controlled by the federal government and once again it's not the only time that the Justice Department has gone after California for taking it one step too far from policies that that the Trump Administration hasn't acted as what you've seen cases on things like immigration and carbon emissions and so forth\nSo what does this mean I mean in the interim can ... does the state law hold can keep doing what it wants to and what are the national implications for the soup yeah right now it doesn't mean a whole lot because even if the Justice Department hadn't run a case this little wouldn't have taken effect until next year\nAnd it isn't even the only piece of litigation that we see right now in ...\nCalifornia is one of about twenty two states that sue the federal government immediately after it procured it's repeal is saying that the repeal shouldn't have happened it was arbitrary and capricious in the eyes of the states\nAnd they have the support of tech companies like Facebook and Google as they proceed with that lawsuit so both of these things have to play out the case between the Justice Department in California over what states can do\nAnd the keys over whether the repeal should have happened in the first place\nCan I just asked if California were to prevail would they actually supplant the federal government would they control the country because they're just so big so influential there the home of Silicon Valley their rules are going to be what the Internet firms would follow everywhere\nYeah that's the potential here that we could see California setting the standard nationally and this has happened in many other cases it's not just net neutrality California just recently adopted a privacy law for example that controls the ways that companies like Facebook and Google collected monetize information\nThe federal government doesn't have a federal consumer privacy law so what happens there is ultimately going to set the standard for how tech companies are in this case Internet service providers act nationally or Washington\nPost tax policy reporter Tony ...

she's in Indonesia's capital Jakarta and she's on the line welcome to the program thank you how does the geography of that island to sue the way the effect the effort to get aid to that city ...\nWell the earthquake and tsunami a at a huge effect on the island's roads are blocks are covered in mud\nAnd rebel so it's very difficult\nTo reach the affected areas or a areas where aid workers haven't been yet\nUh for example ah we have a field a clinic in ... and ah we haven't been able to ah to reach defensive Figi with our ambulance which is necessary but it's not possible at the moment\nSo you can't even get into some neighborhoods now from the stories that she heard I'm looking at a map here of the city of ... that that shows areas that are destroyed entire neighborhoods along the shore or destroyed as you would expect\nBut it does seem from looking at the map that perhaps people can walk a few blocks and being a relatively on damaged area is that correct that the that that that some safety is not very far away\n[noise] well uh you can't say that it's it's it's\n... the the damage is huge\nEarned it of course uh [noise] um people are sleeping outside they're still off the shocks so ah people are afraid to go into to have to if they still have because most of them all our collapse\nA or a covered in mud so people\nAre sleeping outside and uh I I think um yeah ... there's a huge need of help\nThank you for reminding us that their buildings that may not have been washed over by water but may well have been damaged by the earthquake or the earthquake itself is their basic law and order from what you've heard\nWell from what I've had um we have we have teeth underground that unfortunately it it's\nA quite difficult to uh have contact with them as a communication lines I fail\nNot fairy ... uh that's where we're focusing on a search and rescue a medical care for justify first and are providing a clean drinking water which what attracts and from what I've had it thinks outgoing I I'm going well [noise] um but I\nI ...\nI think you know regarding law and order I understand so it's it's a little bit hard to hard to say but at least things are functioning in the few

with the red cross in Jakarta, Indonesia one of the many nonprofit and government agencies trying to get aid to areas affected by an earthquake and tsunami in the last few days\nOkay we're going to shift gears now and talk about how the Trump Administration and views international organizations in particular\nThe world Trade Organization President Trump often complains that these international groups take advantage of America and he is often targeted the WTO which sets in enforces global trading rules\nIn fact the administration is so unhappy with the WTO it's been blocking the appointment of new judges threatening to cripple the organization NPR's Frank Langfitt has the story from Geneva\nPresident Trump can't stand the world Trade Organization theories in two thousand and Seventeen\nI get a headache thinking about who made these views\nOne after another WG I'm In the White House in July\nWTO's street in the United states very badly\nAnd into Bloomberg News interview in August\nI Wish you the WTO was shingle worst trade deal ever and if they don't shave up I Would withdraw from the WTO\nFor one thing the U.S government complains the judges of the global trading organization which oversees disputes overstep their bounds here's Robert Lighthizer us trade representative speaking last year at the center for Strategic and International Studies a Washington think tank\nThere have been all a lot of cases that were uh in my opinion the decisions are really indefensible\nFor instance in response to a complete from Mexico WTO ruled the U.S had to use the same standards for dolphins they've tuna in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans even though the conditions in animals are different marriages Crowley is a professor of international economics at the University of Cambridge\nLike the United states the oh this is a little bit of an infringement on our right to regulate our own\nThat's Dick consumer markets and so there's been a a small a series of chipping away at these tight says domestic discretionary policy [noise]\nThe world Trade Organization sits on the banks of Lake Geneva and today it's a beautiful beautiful day uh hardly a cloud in the sky is in the eighties people are out in boats paddle boarding even swimming in Lake Placid um but inside the WTO are right now the mood is really different\nIt's without any question the case that this is a crisis\n... spokesman for the WTO says the organization is running out of the judges deer appeals on trade dispute in the past two years the WTO is gone from seven judges to three by the end of next year it'll be down to one and unable to hear appeals\nWhich observers say could encourage more countries to violate trade rules and that rock well says could hurt the global economy\nIf the rules of the game are not being adhered to and enforced it creates uncertainty and that affects investment decisions sourcing decisions\nAnd businesses could become more cautious about investing a new projects which good her jobs and growth us insisted just wants to reform the WTO but many observers are skeptical of Trump's intentions\nNow in order to make them better which you cannot do you like to see them on completely ignore it and that's what the Trump unrestricted he's doing today\nBut what you can do is help support the station the way that mom did the way that we're trying to do in our own

Rachel Martin nursing is one of the fastest growing jobs fields in this country according to the bureau of Labor Statistics it's also a job though that is played by stereotypes gender stereotypes in particular nearly Ninety percent of all nurses today are women\nSocial science correspondent Shankar Vedantam wanted to figure out why they are that why there aren't more male nurses\nWas Robert long walks into a hospital room people often think he's the doctor once they realized sees the nurse some patients get uncomfortable\nAnd you just go\nOh it's good if you don't want to mail I can talk to the chargers will make a note that ah you prefer females to have only\nWho blew\nThe male nurse has long been an easy punch line you've heard the jokes and movies like meet the parents that many major professional you know Jack not traditionally an MTV Shows like friends\nThere's not a doctor and\nFound a girl isn't it [noise] the underlying\nMessage of these stereotypes there's something weird about a man who's ... lawn says this might be why some patients get uneasy I'd\nFind it somewhat hypocritical when you have a the doctor is a male then that's very intimate but somehow as a nurse I'm male\nAnd that's the problem is that it doesn't make any sense to me you could wait a minute the doctors mail to somehow you have no issue with him as a male nurse you have an issue it's contradictory\nThere's a lot of things that are off limits for men\nUniversity of South Florida psychologist Jennifer Boston has studied why men are often reluctant to engage in activities traditionally dominated by women in one revealing experiment a team gathered a group of nearly two hundred men and women and sat them in front of computers\nWe just kind of let them right for you know a few minutes about a time when they violated their gender role in in public\nSome women talked about being a tomboy others mentioned walking in male dominated fields and feeling harassed by co workers but men\nMen say things like ... I wore a pink shirt to work or I I held my girlfriend's per se while she ran into the bank\nOr I ordered a drink at a restaurant and when it came out to me it had a little cocktail umbrella in it and my you know my friends tease me so it's like it's just mundane things like women don't say oh I wore the wrong shirt\n[noise]\nWhy would men make such a big deal over trivial thing the familiar explanation is massage any or homophobia that is what Boston talked to she began to think about the different messages that boys received from a very young age are you a real man or they came in\nBoston built on us inside and conducted a series of research experiments into why men behave the way they do a conclusion\nMy collaborators and I argue that the male gender role itself is kind of conceptualize as a more precarious status so manhood it's something that hard hit or an easy to lose relative to womanhood\n\nManhood is something that's hard to earn an easy to\nMany fewer pink shirts and pushes because the defending something fragile\nIn terms of why this would be the case or why would you have one sex essentially have a more limited repertoire we'll have more policing around us boundaries a lie to women take that femininity for granted in ways that men did not take their mascot handy for granted\nThat's really hard question to answer but I think it has to do with um [noise] how men their social status is more hierarchy Akeley organized than women's is so men are kind of more interested in or motivated to attain social status and that\nKind of then translates into what we propose is kind of a chronic anxiety about their status and that translates into a concern about whether once seen as a real man or not\nMen worry about what other men will think what women was saying well they themselves might think Boston has some ideas on how to get more men into nursing she argues that the way to do it is to come up with a new set of stereotypes\nYou could spin nursing as a very masculine occupation it's dangerous to physically grueling our stereotype of the nurse you know you could modify that stereotype and turn nursing into a profession that does seem masculine or male appropriate [noise]\nSomething along these lines happened to Robert blonde when he was considering whether to become a nurse at twenty three he just finished for years in the navy\nHe wanted to go back to school his wife's dad had a suggestion my father\nIn law who's a respiratory therapist said hey you know you should really look into nursing\nVon didn't immediately take his father in law's advice\nLike a lot of guys I think the first thing that went through my head was well that's a a woman's job\nBut one did get a job at a hospital working as a security guard and one day something happened\nThat uptown has stereotypes about nursing\nWe had a couple guys who came in to the emergency room and they were just very belligerent fighting there was blood all over the place and the nurses in us in the sheriffs were holding them down and it's a dating and and restraining and all the man is is this is pretty cool [laughter] the action that nurses are saying was pretty exciting for me\nKnow you think of nursing do you think of someone sitting at a [noise]\nLet me hold your hand and and you see what it is realistically there today\nAnd for me it was\nWhen it comes to fighting stereotypes we often imagined that the right approach is to explain why stereotypes are wrong\nBut Robin Williams live and Jennifer Boston's experiments suggest a different solution that perhaps a more effective one [noise]\nAnd stereotypes are powerful because the stories we tell about ourselves are powerful the shape how we see the world and how the world sees us but in the end

Jerry Brown declared that rich and poor alike will be treated fairly he has long argued the bail system favors the wealthy and punishes the poor turns out that the story is more complicated now many of those who pushed hardest for bail reform saying the new system may be making the problem worse NPR's Eric Westervelt reports\nIn the downtown San Francisco public defender's office you might think attorney chase Abou dean would be excited about the recently signed California's Senate bill or sb ten which abolish is money bailing America's most populous state after all blue dean and fellow public service lawyers have long called money bailing unconstitutional pillar of biased system\nI saw your bank account often determines who gets out of pre trial custody and the poor and people of color often end up on the losing end but this deputy\nIs not in a celebratory mood\nI was disappointed and I felt betrayed the newest be ten doesn't actually change the race is system of mass incarceration just expand\nThe new law was in response to a state court decision declaring that the cash bail system unconstitutionally denied people due process now under the new law takes effect next year instead of setting bail a judge will use a computer program\nAs part of his or her determination whether a suspect is a low medium or high risk for flight or to public safety\nWho didn't believe this will dramatically expand the number of people who will be detained pre trial\nHe points to one section in particular deep in the bill section Thirteen twenty that Eighteen a sub section five that section so broadly worded routine argues including compass anyone for any offense that he says will to power ever more into the hands of prosecutors police and judges\nUnder a speech and now prosecutors can seek detention for virtually any crime regardless of whether it's violent or involves weapons or whether the person accused as your prior history under this law\nProsecutors have the discretion to seek preemptive detention of a person with no criminal record charged with a low level misdemeanor\nAnd then there's its impact on the deals currently across the U.S more than Ninety percent of criminal cases are settled in a plea deal that could include dismissal or a diversion program not a trial\nJohn ... with human rights watch says he's deeply concerned this bill simply replaces one course of tactic for another bail for pre trial detention that if he says to use the tension to pressure people of color and the poor to plead guilty to lesser crimes often regardless of their actual guilt\nIs pervasive in the criminal justice system this happens every single day the new Dell reform law in California does not address that problem now you're just giving them a whole other mechanism to keep people in\nThe ACLU and more than a dozen other legal groups have race similar concerns the bill also mandates the use of pre trial assessment tools essentially it's computer program that aims to measure risk after putting in a raft and conviction history and other data\nThat algorithm gives the bill of veneer of objective science attorney ... says but in fact becomes a kind of feedback loop merely reflecting social biases\nIt's a pretty well documented fact the police stopped search detain arrest black people more than white people poor people more than wealthy people\nAnd that the courts treat people of color trip poor people worse or the various factors that these risk assessment tools are looking at to judge who's higher risk\nAnd it's not yet clear just what data would actually go into the algorithm the bill doesn't say\nSharif's fan over dean CEO of a nonprofit pre trial justice Institute admits the new law is far from perfect but she says some of these concerns are a bit alarmist fan or the notes that discretion to detain or release pre trial has always reside with judges\nThis new law she thinks will simply help judges get it right more consistently\nOh how to make it should also right that's right and I was like it shouldn't even where people needlessly incarcerated ending trial\nMeantime the bail industry which would be put out of business under the new law hopes to overturn it at the ballot box an industry coalition is currently collecting signatures to try for a statewide ballot initiative\nThat may put bail bondsmen in an

California is on track to find out just how much control one state can have over giant Internet service providers this weekend California passed a law making Internet providers like Comcast Time Warner\nTreat all websites the same no speeding up or slowing down access to certain sites within hours the Trump Administration announced that its suing California earlier this year the administration removed those standards at the federal level Tim Wu is with us now he's a Columbia Law professor\nThey actually coined the term net neutrality Tim welcome to the show\nOr good morning why is this a priority for the department of justice net neutrality\nYou know I I think that they uh of decided they really want to have a a a environment where are you know it's open for business I guess as their argument and they're concerned that California's meddling with a federal policy\nWell how effective is California's a position I mean the federal government argues this is an issue of interstate commerce so federal laws are more effective than state laws I mean don't they have a point the Internet doesn't exactly recognized state boundaries\nAre I think that well first of all California's law I think would be very effective in the sense that uh the the uh the broadband providers and California would have to listen to it and you know California is very large state of about how if you're asking their legal position I think it's a little bit of an open question what California is going to say\nIs listen they're not trying to regulate the whole Internet they're regulating how it's delivered and\nIt's always delivered locally when you think about it um you know just between it's just that thing in your home and the word the local state that's all they care about they're not trying to control everything and so I think that's a but California's argument will be\nWhat does the president this kid says and dozens of other states are considering that mentality laws right\nIn fact dozens of other states have a new net neutrality laws you know it gets it gets to a really fundamental policy question which is one of the states are sort of free to the experiment economically filling up the federal government has abandoned the neutrality for reasons\nKnown to themselves and they want that to be the rule for the whole union in other words we want there to be no rules for any Internet providers and other states feel differently Internet's a sort of California where where much of the Internet was invented and so I think that that's what's at stake here is really the question the fundamental question of federalism and who gets to decide\nHow do you think this plays out in this particular skirmish in California we should note his is battling with the Trump Administration on a lot of fronts on immigration uh on on climate change this is the latest\nSo one thing I think that makes it hard for the Trump Administration is a California is legislating to a vacuum you know the Trump Administration says we don't want to have any rules in this area in California says we do you know we think this is a dangerous\nSo it's not a case where the Trump or the federal government is directly preempting that's the word the California law on the other hand it's a question of the California law goes so far that it really does regulate interstate commerce of phrase goes and so it's all a question of whether the Internet at some level\nIs really local or really national or international and I think that is a very complicated technical question depends on how you see the delivery of Internet services\nWhere do you see the big Silicon Valley firms lining up on us\nI mean I I think almost all of them on the they've also they they like and that new show the law they don't like the idea that you know Comcast are already TNT will try to charge them extra block their content know most people vast majority Americans one child who loves it sort of the uh\nIt's a it's an audience of to the floor of the the broadband lobby and the Trump Administration like this law and so I'm not surprised how many states are are trying to fill the gaps\nTim will professor at Columbia Law school things so much for your time it's been a pleasure\nHow much besides the title is really changing in the north American free trade agreement\nOnce you prove this will be a new dawn for the American auto industry and for the American auto worker\nThat as President Trump's few experts say the new NAFTA resembles the old one although with some improvements NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports\nAmong other things the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement would encourage regional auto parts production open up Canadian dairy markets and set new rules for digital an intellectual property Celeste Drake analyzes trade and globalization for the AFL CIO the largest union in the U.S\nIn her view it could also address one big problem with NAFTA it would require Mexico to allow its workers to unionize\nThat would make a meaningful difference for workers in Mexico and their ability to organize and get their wages up which by the way how positive benefit on American workers that Canadian workers because now they're in such a huge wage differential\nThis is a departure for unions which have historically opposed trade deals in the past they argued globalized trade hurt their members interest by off shoring jobs so it's unusual to hear unions praising some facets of this new deal\nBut to be clear the AFL CIA oh Teamsters and others say they remain undecided about whether to support the deal mainly Drake says because it's not clear how the U.S would be able to enforce the new labor provisions with Mexico\nBecause if you don't have real effective enforcement and you don't have anything changing\nLori Wallach agrees she's director of global trade watch a consumer advocacy group she says ultimately support the deal will depend a lot on details that have yet to be decided\nAnd in less strong labor and environmental standards are subject to swift in certain enforcement the outsourcing and raised in the bottom and wages isn't going to stop\nShe likes the fact that this deal would eliminate rules permitting companies operating in foreign countries to sue the host government which Wallack says allows them to circumvent local labor and environmental laws\nThere are elements of the proposal Wallach cries for example the new deal allows a longer term on pharmaceutical patents delaying the introduction\nOf cheaper generic drugs that could undermine the changes needed in our country to make medicine more affordable here\nBut it's the industry that would be the most affected by the deal it would require automakers to boost the percentage of parts made in North America to Seventy five percent in order to avoid carrots\nEight eight eight five seven to two or three to keep the seat that or and I say\nThe U.S Canada and Mexico have a new trade

would that be at this moment for the FBI when it's been under so much political pressure already\nUh it it it complicates things I mean for one thing that not to be be make a political statement but the delay cause some complications because\nIf the complaint come in six weeks ago the FBI could've discreetly interviewed witnesses and been assured that they weren't getting details from the press and we're we're using their own independent recall\nAs opposed to finding details in the press or having details are embedded in in reporters' questions or you're\nYou're you're you're you're noting that Dianne Feinstein of California senator along with another lawmaker had a letter from Christine Blasey Ford back in July we think um but did not reveal it at first because of concerns

that\nThat event did or did not happen in the early Nineteen eighties or in the end is it more likely that senators are just going to have to look at a little better information and make a good judgment\nI think it's that they're going to get a little better information maybe a lot better information but no conclusions will come out of it they they don't make conclusions and these reports in that sense Joe Biden was correct they report the information they record any corroborating information that they have obtained or any contradicting information\nAnd then they provide the report to the

question\nOkay Chris sweater former assistant director of the FBI thanks very much\nThank you Steve [noise]\nRight there was some big news out of one of the world's biggest companies today the Seattle based company Amazon announced that it plans to raise wages to Fifteen dollars an hour and that is for all fulltime part-time and seasonal workers they're going to start this next month\nTo bold move for a company that's been in the spotlight lately and not in a good way necessarily NPR's Alina Selyukh is here in the studio to talk through what this change means I mean I get money and just to note here Amazon is one of interest in the actual supporters so lean on what\nOther details can you share right so they should press release in here if he takes away from that or take away from that you mentioned that uh the Fifteen dollar minimum wage will apply to fulltime part time and seasonal workers also importantly temporary workers contract workers which is where a lot of the scrutiny has been for Amazon specifically\nIssued a number as few months ago saying that the median wage at Amazon was less than twenty nine thousand dollars a year which is a very uh\nInteresting contrast to the fact that the company also this year I'm a topped one trillion dollars in ways and so for the contract workers that Fifteen dollar minimum wage will mean a lot um ... the number of employees that will be affected by this is pretty sagging it's more than two hundred and fifty thousand\nYou haven't done it well I mean I I Know that it you just talked about the Amazon has been under a lot of very public scrutiny for how it treats its employees not just the the median\nWhich you outlined but just the conditions of workers is is this change a result of of that public scrutiny well it's clear you know if you follow Amazon if you wait kind of long enough there will inevitably be some kind of a story in the news about um a specific it's usually specific warehouse in a specific location where some\nI'm a criticism comes up about though the way that the employees were being monitored or how much money making in general Amazon usually comes back to that to say well actually all of our full time workers in warehouses well do you make Fifteen dollars to begin with if you're counting all the benefits and and things like that\nUm but the interesting thing is that this has become kind of a rallying cry Senator Bernie Sanders has gone after Amazon for this ... those are CEO Jeff basis came to speak in Washington a few weeks ago when I went to that and outside the hotel there was a small group of protesters\nUm they describe themselves as socialist and mainly what they did talk about what specifically that optical\nKind of contrast of just these are not just the wealthiest man or in the world but the wealthiest man in history ... running a company where the employees were uh I'm not making a huge amount of money um and they had a little science talking specifically about that\nI'm In the other thing to remember is just how ... how vast Amazon has become and a few months recently right I mean the larger business contacts for this Amazon clearly is doing well in this moment so they're feeling like they can afford this change\nIt's I think that's part of it and you know Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos gets asked a lot about you know do you think your companies too big and they did buy a whole seeds recently they have a variety of businesses getting into cloud services getting into deliveries I mean we're talking ...\nOther large employers to fall off and increase their

much control one state can have over a giant Internet service providers this weekend California passed a law making Internet providers like Comcast Time Warner\nTreat all websites the same no speeding up or slowing down access to certain sites within hours the Trump Administration announced that its suing California earlier this year the administration removed those standards at the federal level Tim will is with us now he's at Columbia Law professor\nAnd they actually coined the term net neutrality Tim welcome to the show or good morning why is this a priority for the department of justice net neutrality\nYou know I I think that that they uh uh I've decided they really want to have a a a environment where are you know it's it's open for business I guess is their argument and uh they're concerned that California's meddling with a federal policies\nWell how effective is California's a position I mean the federal government argues this is an issue of interstate commerce so federal laws are more effective than state laws I mean don't they have a point the Internet doesn't exactly recognize state boundaries\nAre I think that well first of all California's law I think would be very effective in the sense that uh the the uh the broadband providers in California would have to listen to it and you know California is very large state\nIn about how if you're asking their legal position I think it's a little bit of an open question what California is going to say is listen they're not trying to regulate the whole Internet they're regulating how it's delivered and it's always delivered locally when you think about it um you know just between it's just that thing in your home and the word the local state that's all they care about they're not trying to\nControl everything and so I think that's the what California's argument will be\nWhat is the precedent this could set and dozens of other states are considering net neutrality laws right\nIn fact dozens of other states have a new net neutrality laws you know it it gets to a really fundamental policy question which is one of the states are sort of free to the experiment economically filling gaps the federal government has abandoned the neutrality\nFor reasons known to themselves and they want that to be the rule for the whole union in other words we want there to be no rules or for any Internet providers and other states feel differently Internet's a sort of California where where much of the Internet was invented\nAnd so I think that that's what's at stake here is really the question the fundamental question of federalism and who gets to decide\nHow do you think this plays out in this particular skirmish in California we should note has is battling with the Trump Administration on a lot of fronts on immigration uh on on climate change this is the latest\nSo one thing I think that makes it hard for the Trump Administration is a California is legislating to a vacuum\nYou know the Trump Administration says we don't want to have any rules in this area in California says we do you know we think this is is dangerous so it's not a case where the Trump or or the federal government is directly preempting that's the word\nThe California law on the other hand it's a question of the California law goes so far that it really does regulate interstate commerce as the phrase goes\nAnd so it's all a question of whether the Internet at some level is really local or really national or international and I think that is a very complicated technical question depends on how you see the delivery of Internet services\nWhere do you see the big Silicon Valley firms lining up on us\nI mean I I think almost all of them on the they've all said they they like and that new show the law they don't like the idea that you know Comcast or or AT and T. we'll we'll try to charge them extra block their content know most people vast majority Americans wanting to troll the laws that sort of the uh\nIt's a it's an audience of to the slow the it's the broadband lobby and the Trump Administration like this law and so I'm not surprised so many states are are trying to fill the gaps\nTim will professor at Columbia Law school thanks so much for your time\nIt's been a pleasure how much besides the title is really changing of the north American free trade agreement\nOnce you prove this will be a new dawn for the American auto industry and for the American auto worker\nBut as President Trump's few experts say the new NAFTA resembles the old one although with some improvements NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports\nAmong other things the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement would encourage regional auto parts production open up Canadian dairy markets and set new rules for digital an intellectual property Celeste Drake analyzes trade and globalization for the AFL CIO the largest union in the U.S [noise]\nAnd her view it could also address one big problem with NAFTA it would require Mexico to allow its workers to unionize\nThat would make a meaningful difference for workers in Mexico and their ability to organize and get their wages which by the way have a positive benefit on American workers that Canadian workers because now they're in such a huge wage differential\nThis is a departure for unions which have historically opposed trade deals in the past they argued globalized trade hurt their members interest by off shoring jobs so it's unusual to hear unions praising some facets of this new deal\nBut to be clear the AFL CIA oh Teamsters and others say they remain undecided about whether to support the deal mainly Drake says because it's not clear how the U.S will be able to enforce the new labor provisions with Mexico\nBecause if you don't have real effective enforcement and you don't have anything changing\nLori Wallach agrees she's director of global trade watch a consumer advocacy group she says ultimately support the deal will depend a lot on details that have yet to be decided\nAnd in less strong labor and environmental standards are subject to swift and certain enforcement the outsourcing and race to the bottom and wages isn't going to stop\nShe likes the fact that this deal would eliminate rules permitting companies operating in foreign countries to sue the host government which Wallack says allows them to circumvent local labor and environmental laws\nThere are elements of the proposal Wallach cries for example the new deal allows a longer term and pharmaceutical patents delaying the introduction of cheaper generic drugs\nThat could undermine the changes needed in our country to make medicine more affordable here\nBut it's the auto industry that would be the most affected by the deal it would require automakers to boost the

was a foreign policy advisor to Canadian Prime minister Justin Trudeau Harris says these trade disagreements have\nReinforced the importance of uh of trying to uh in a lockdown rules with the United

will mean a lot I'm also the number of employees that will be affected by this is pretty staggering it's more than two hundred and fifty thousand is on it well\nI mean I I noticed that you just talked about an Amazon has been under a lot of very public scrutiny for how it treats its employees not just the the median wage which you outline but just the conditions of workers is is this change a result of of that public scrutiny\nWell it's clear you know if you follow Amazon if you wait kind of long enough there will inevitably be some kind of a story in the news about um is a specific it's usually specific warehouse in a specific location where some\nI'm a criticism comes up about the the way that the employees were being monitored or how much money they're making and general Amazon usually comes back to that to say well actually all of our full time workers um in warehouses well do you make Fifteen dollars to begin with if you're counting all the benefits and and things like that um but the\nInteresting thing is that this has become kind of a rallying cry Senator Bernie Sanders has gone after Amazon for this base those a CEO Jeff Bass us came to speak in Washington a few weeks ago when I went to that and outside of the hotel there was a small group of protesters\nUm they describe themselves as socialist and mainly what they did talk about what specifically that optical\nKind of contrast of Jeff Bezos not just the wealthiest man or in the world but the wealthiest man in history ... running a company where the employees were uh I'm not making a huge amount of money um and they had a little science talking specifically about that\nI'm In the other thing to remember is just how ... how vast Amazon has become an a few months recently right I mean the larger business contacts for this Amazon clearly is doing well in this moment so they're feeling like they can afford this change\nIt's I think that's part of it and you know ... Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos gets asked a lot about you know do you think your companies too big\nAnd they did buy a whole foods recently they have a variety of businesses getting into cloud services getting into deliveries I mean we're talking\nTruck fleets of truck drivers fleets of warehouse workers fleets of um you know call service people and he often turns it into a bit of a philosophical conversation about you know large institutions should be scrutinized you know it's not personal large institutions anywhere she'd be scrutinized\nUm but the fact that they now do you have sort of this interesting span of workers in retail on and on the business side kind of does make it an interesting development that that that they're raising minimum wage\nI mean lawmakers on Capitol Hill you mentioned Bernie Sanders but others have been pushing for a federal minimum wage uh Fifteen dollars an hour how is this move now by Amazon such an important company how's that going to affect that effort\nBut there is a really big thing in that press release that Amazon issued which is they're saying they are going to quote working to gain congressional support for an increase in the federal minimum wage which could be huge if you have one of the\nMost valuable American companies now lobbying for a Fifteen dollar a minimum wage federally that could be really huge it's important to note that other companies have been moving toward this a lot of the state have been moving toward this target as one example I can offer of a company that is going for Fifteen dollars by twenty twenty\nAnd also importantly in this moment the timing of this is interesting we're about to go into the holiday season and Amazon says it will pay it seasonal workers Fifteen dollars um is is perfectly time for that that creates a lot of pressure on a lot of the other retailers that are battling in this really tight labor market for the exact same types of\nPeople who might be looking for employment\nRight

Inskeep\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin California is on track to find out just how much control one state can have over a giant Internet service providers this weekend California passed a law making Internet providers\nTreat all websites the same no speeding up or slowing down access to certain sites within hours the Trump Administration announced that its suing California earlier this year the administration removed those standards at the federal level Tim Wu is with us now he's at Columbia Law professor\nThey actually coined the term net neutrality Tim welcome to the show or good morning why is this a priority for the department of justice net neutrality\nYou know I think that that they ah of decided they really want to have a a a environment where are you know it's open for business I guess as their argument and the other concern that California's meddling with a federal policies\nWell how effective is California's a position I mean the federal government argues this is an issue of interstate commerce so federal laws are more effective than state laws I mean don't they have a point the Internet doesn't exactly recognize state boundaries\nAre I think that well first of all California's law I think would be very effective in the sense that uh the the er the broadband providers and California would have to listen to it and you know California is very large state\nOf you know about how if you're asking their legal position I think it's a little bit of an open question what California is going to say is listen they're not trying to regulate the whole Internet they're regulating how it's delivered and it's always delivered locally when you think about it um you know just between it's just that thing in your home and the word the local state that's all they care about they're not trying to\nControl everything and so I think that's what a California's argument will be\nWhat does the president this kid says I mean dozens of other states are considering net neutrality laws right\nIn fact dozens of other states have a new neutrality laws you know it ... it gets to a really fundamental policy question which is one of the states are sort of free to the experiment economically a feeling gaps the federal government has abandoned the neutrality um\nFor reasons known to themselves and they want that to be the rule for the whole union\nNo there was we want there to be no rules or for any Internet providers\nAnd other states feel differently Internet's a sort of California where it's where much of the Internet was invented and so I think that that's what's at stake here is a really the question the fundamental question of federalism and who gets to decide\nHow do you think this plays out in this particular skirmish in California we should note has is battling with the Trump Administration on a lot of fronts on immigration uh on on climate change this is the latest\nSo one thing I think that makes it hard for the Trump Administration is a California is legislating to a vacuum\nYou know the Trump Administration says we don't want to have any rules in this area in California says we do we know we think this is is dangerous so it's not a case where the Trump or or the federal government is directly preempting that's the word\nCalifornia law on the other hand it's a question of the California law goes so far that it really does regulate interstate commerce as the phrase goes\nAnd so it's all a question of whether the Internet at some level is really local or really national or international and I think that is a very complicated technical question depends on how you see the delivery of Internet services\nWhere do you see uh the big Silicon Valley firms lining up on us\nI mean I I think almost all the one that they've also they they like in the intro the law they don't like the idea that you know Comcast are already TNT will try to charge them extra block their content know most people have vast majority Americans wanting to throw the laws that sort of the uh\nIt's a it's an audience of to this law the it's the broadband lobby and the Trump Administration like this law and so I'm not surprised how many states are are trying to fill the gaps\n[noise] Tim will professor at Columbia Law school thanks so much for your time\nIt's been a pleasure [noise] how much besides the title is really changing of the north American free trade agreement\nOnce you're prove this will be a new dawn for the American auto industry and for the American auto worker\nThat as President Trump's few experts say the new NAFTA resembles the old one although with some improvements NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports\nAmong other things the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement would encourage regional auto parts production open up Canadian dairy markets and set new rules for digital an intellectual property Celeste Drake analyzes trade and globalization for the AFL CIO the largest union in the U.S\nAnd her view it could also address one big problem with NAFTA it would require Mexico to allow its workers to unionize\nThat would make a meaningful difference for workers in Mexico and their ability to organize and get their wages up which by the way have a positive benefit on American workers that Canadian workers because now they're in such a huge wage differential\nThis is a departure for unions which have historically opposed trade deals in the past they argued globalized trade hurt their members interest by off shoring jobs so it's unusual to hear unions praising some facets of this new deal\nBut to be clear the AFL CIA oh Teamsters and others say they remain undecided about whether to support the deal mainly Drake says because it's not clear how the U.S will be able to enforce the new labor provisions with Mexico\nBecause if you don't have real effective enforcement and you don't have anything changing\nLori Wallach agrees she's director of global trade watch a consumer advocacy group she says ultimately support the deal will depend a lot on details that have yet to be decided\nAnd in less strong labor and environmental standards are subject to swift and certain enforcements the outsourcing and race to the bottom and wages isn't going to stop\nShe likes the fact that this deal would eliminate rules permitting companies operating in foreign countries to sue the host government which Wallack says allows them to circumvent local labor and environmental laws\nThere are elements of the proposal Wallach cries for example the new deal allows a longer term on pharmaceutical patents delaying the introduction of cheaper generic drugs\nThat could undermine the changes needed in our country to make medicine more affordable here\nBut it's the industry that would be the most affected by the deal it would require automakers to boost the percentage of parts made in North America to Seventy five percent in order to avoid carrots had bound is a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute
