Republican congressmen won reelection for years so what happened to this fall Democrats trying to retake the house It's MORNING edition\nThe California father and daughter in different generations and radically different politics I'm David Greene in Laguna Beach California\nAnd I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington we also hear a critique of the influence of Saudi Arabia and money executives in Silicon valley well\nThe questions after the suspected murder of\nAlso this hour Israel brains in America was detained at an airport for more than we did this Friday or however Nineteen Michael Steele the former chairman of the\nCommittee is six years on\nThe news is next\n\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Dave ... parliamentary elections in Afghanistan will go ahead as planned tomorrow but not in the southern province of Kandahar\nVoting there is being delayed for a week following yesterday's deadly insider attack at a high level us Afghan security meeting ... police commander was killed along with a regional intelligence chief when an elite Afghan guard opened fire at the conclusion of the meeting\nThat shared sense of unease and they want even if there are political divisions to be able to talk to one another again and we heard a lot of people who want to elect people to Congress who are also willing to talk to one another\nOK David thanks for the reporting really appreciate it yeah and we'll go on her ...\nIn the race for Congress that decision belongs to millions of voters like some of the people that David Was just speaking with hundreds of candidates are on the ballot but much of the attention day to day goes to one single person\nThat's right and at one person is President Trump who held the latest of his campaign rallies last night he was in Montana firing up the crowd with a joke about violence against a journalist\nBut I had heard that he body slammed the reporter\nThe heat there is the man Trump was stumping for Thursday night GOP house candidate grade do you enforce a last year he assaulted a reporter he was a candidate at the time who went on to win a special election the following day\nAnd I said oh this is terrible elections and I said well wait a minute I Know Montana pretty well I think it might help him [noise]\nIn forte we should say pleaded guilty and was convicted of misdemeanor assault\nThat is only one of the ways that journalists are in news stories this morning with the president of the United states as well here with NPR's Scott Horsley Scott good morning Steve any surprise at all the president would take a verbal shot so to speak at the media\nNo uh you know attacking the news media has been a staple a fixture of Trump rallies for a long time now reporters have been a convenient foil for this president even though Donald Trump ... much of a success to the saturation news coverage she gets from the media\nUh he acknowledged early on in the mystery over the disappearance of ... that he was a little bit out of character for him to be expressing concern about the state of a journalist but you know we've had violent attacks on journalists in this country and that has not stopped the president from using\nTough language to describe the news media and I don't guess this will either\nWell ... that would be another way that the president is in the news with a member of the news media because the president himself has drawn his administration have ever closer to Saudi Arabia and of course Saudi Arabia\nIt's a close ally of the United states in of any us administration really but the president faces questions about the Saudi role in the disappearance and reported killing of democracy oh gee the dissident journalist who had left to Saudi Arabia was in Turkey went into a Saturday consulate\nNever a is known to have come out how is the president's response evolved if at all over the last several days\nI think he is feeling some pressure to respond if only a ... is treating this was kind of a public relations problem he told the New York times yesterday\nThis one has caught the imagination of the world unfortunately he does seem to recognize that the allegations of this grisly murder at the hands of Saturday operatives has galvanized criticism of the Saudi Arabian government\nIn a way that may be earlier episodes of the war in Yemen or the mass execution of dissidents has not\nAnd the president has been done to acknowledge that he and his administration may have to respond to that however reluctantly we saw the first response yesterday was treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin announcing that he would pull out of a big investment conference the so called Davos in the desert next week in Riyadh\nHe took that step toward a belatedly a lot of business in journalistic leaders had already pulled out of that conference and it was only announced with a tweet there wasn't a lot of fanfare at the same time you had secretary of state Mike Pompeo just back from visiting Saudi Arabia and turkey\nAre asking for patients and saying you know we ought to give us how he's a few more days to complete their investigation Scott Saudi Arabia\nIs you know is not terribly popular in the United states and here's the president defending a defending its leaders does this feel at all like voting issue in this election season\nIs not something he's been talking about a campaign rallies and that's where the president spending a lot of his time these days he is feeling some pressure from fellow Republicans here in Washington but this doesn't seem like something that's necessarily going to move the needle with the voting public Scott Horsley thanks very much You're welcome\n[noise]\nOne more election now Saturday was supposed to be election day in Kandahar Province Afghanistan but now those elections are postpone for a week\nYou know this is after campaign related violence that has left ten candidates and many more supporters did in one case a bomb was planted under a candidate sofa and then yesterday Afghanistan's national police chief was assassinated\nTaliban insurgents who want to disrupt the election have claimed responsibility but rival politicians are also suspected to be behind some of the violence\nLet's turn now to Pamela constable who has covered Afghanistan for years and she's on the line welcome back\nWith you I Want to understand where these elections stand some of them have been postponed is that right\nYes at this point they're still going to be held and most of the country although it cause I can crack\nA number of polls were already going to be close so it's not a nationwide election already but they're closing a delaying the polling at all throughout the province and Kandahar which is an enormous problem in\nAfrica laying about oh five one week at greatly to the to the to the number of places that people will not be voting for now what\nDo parliamentary elections looked like in two thousand Eighteen in Afghanistan are people able to get out and campaign and hold rallies or is that not even safe\nIt's I'm not sure I mean ... and ... and the one hand it's very exciting because they've got this enormous\nEnormous fail the candidate you know more than two thousand five hundred candidates a mall high this description for a ride in\nA way to draft a ages you got a mixture of you know ... the elder you've got young women in style is quoting you've got\nAll sorts of you know young educated people men you know very short or no beard glasses pies and then you have this\nUh unusual phenomenon of the sons of former warlord ah nothing like their father and look very modern and clean cut and in fact I have on their big campaign posters shadowy how does that their of their uh less less factory elders we could put it that way so that was it\nThat I met a guy positive on that\nFence the negative of course is that there has been as you just described a great deal of violence\nJust in a few seconds does it feel like however these elections turnout the will of the people might actually be expressed in some legitimate way\n\nI think so I guess I'm so there are allegations of fraud there's an allegation of a pre election tampering voter ID card a last minute efforts to fat by introducing biometric technology but it remains to be seen whether in fact this will be a reasonably successful and fair election\nWill will

Saudi Arabia suspected role in the disappearance of a journalist is thrown a shadow over Saudi money\nAmerican businesses have enjoyed Saudi investments for years only now are executives facing real questions about Saudi Arabia is absolute monarchy it's brutal war in Yemen and above all about the reported murder of journalist ... ...\nMuch Saudi money is going to Silicon Valley and those some tech CEOs have backed out of a forthcoming Saudi investment conference the investments themselves remain writer ... has just been talking with audiences this week in Silicon valley and he's been telling them to Saudi money is tainted\nIn recent years this Saturday sovereign wealth fund has become one of the biggest swinging checkbooks in Silicon valley through a kind of open secret of a front which is soft bank a big Japanese fund that launched a hundred billion dollar vision fund\nForty five billion dollars of that first hundred billion dollar fund with the Saudi Government money and recently they announced the second vision fund to Saudi Arabia if you have a start up and big dreams of changing the world making it a better place empowering women and others [noise]\nA lot of those people with a lot of those idealistic pretensions have been very happy to open up to Saturday investors\nLet me just ask how big this really is you just use huge numbers like a hundred billion dollars but you are referring to spreading that money among multiple companies in Silicon valley where sometimes now a company can be worth a trillion dollars are they just buying you know I don't know five percent of the stock of some company\nIt's very but I'll tell you an ... for example softbank is now the largest single shareholder in ... with Saudi having half of that steak and I want to make a really important point about what this gets the Saudis\nIf you're the young crown prince you have a problem which is that the reality of your country is\nThat it's a fairly barbaric medieval kingdom that runs itself in a way that is inconsistent with the un human rights declaration that is based on the degradation of women\nThat bear heads people and that might well have murdered ... and the consulate ... that's a big image problem\nIn these investments in Silicon valley and then getting to go to Silicon Valley earlier this year and meet Mark Zuckerberg and meet Jeff Bass us and others he got exactly what he paid for he got the illusory glow of being part of the future and he got some graduates columnists to call him a reformer\nSo on and you have given one way that the Saudis seem to benefit from this connection with Silicon Valley the crown prince can go there and get a photo op but do you have any evidence that when the Saudis invest in a company there are some kinds of strings attached\nNo and that's not my claim my concern is that Silicon Valley is not who it says it is when you spend time out there is I just did you hear an endless parade of platitudes about changing the world empowering people creating community giving voice\nAnd it's almost a parody of the fall city of those pretensions to raise money from one of the worst regimes on earth\nThat is absolutely in violation of every value here thrown around in Silicon valley and I want to be clear this financial investment is not the only thing that's happened you know as many of your listeners will remember there was this Davos in the desert conference\nThen you've got this new five hundred billion dollar mega city that the Saudis are creating called Neal and Neal again had all these Silicon Valley people in other corporate people on the board and so these folks in Silicon valley and make a lot of very important decisions about what kind of world we live in if these people are basically no\nBetter than chemical magnates who'd dumped pollutants into rivers except the digital version of that I think that's important for Americans to understand\nWhat was it like in the last several days as you are traveling and the Silicon Valley area and speaking with audiences and this place that relies on the very industry are criticizing and said you people are showing yourself to be a moral or immoral\nYou know like you Steve I have two kinds of conversations with a journalist I have public ones and I have private ones\nEven in the public ones there is a growing sense\nThat they are standing on top of an indefensible mountain\nThat America has been led by plutocrats who are fundamentally motivated by the bottom line but who have spun us all a tale of how they're trying to transform civilization and the things need to change but in the private conversation Steve I Will tell you deep in the bowels of these institutions\nThere is a generation of younger people who frankly do not believe the stories\nThat their elders and their elders are like in their thirties and forties and the case of Silicon Valley do not believe their stories a bunch of people coming up in the valley frankly have a much more sophisticated understanding of power the very power they wield and the privileged they wield that some of the people who founded these companies have been catastrophic

she was held at the airport while she fought in court for the right to enter Israel\nHer story caught international attention following several other cases of Israel detaining left wing critics at the

no cost them it was not very successful she said Israel should reconsider how it applies to read them when it turns into an international issue we lose more than we when she said\nBut Israeli

C. Saudi Arabia suspected role in the disappearance of a journalist has thrown a shadow over Saudi money\nAmerican businesses have enjoyed Saturday investments for years only now are executives facing real questions about Saudi Arabia's absolute monarchy it's brutal war in Yemen and above all about the reported murder of journalist Jamal ...\nMuch Saudi money has gone to Silicon Valley and do some tax CEOs have backed out of a forthcoming Saudi investment conference the investments themselves remain writer ... says just been talking with audiences this week in Silicon valley and he's been telling them the Saudi money is tainted\nIn recent years the Saudi sovereign wealth fund has become one of the biggest swinging checkbooks in Silicon valley through a kind of open secret of a front which is soft bank a big Japanese fund that launched a hundred billion dollar vision fund\nForty five billion dollars of that first hundred billion dollar fund was the Saudi Government money and recently they announced the second vision fun so Saudi Arabia if you have a start up and big dreams of changing the world making it a better place empowering women and others\nA lot of those people with a lot of those idealistic pretensions have been very happy to open up to Saudi investors\nLet me just ask how big this really is just huge huge numbers like a hundred billion dollars but you are referring to spreading that money among multiple companies in Silicon valley where sometimes now a company can be worth a trillion dollars are they just buying you know I don't know five percent of the stock of some company\nIt's varying but I'll tell you an ... for example softbank is now the largest single shareholder in ... with Saudi having half of that steak and I want to make a really important point about what this gets the Saudis\nIf you're the young crown prince you have a problem which is that the reality of your country is that it's a fairly barbaric medieval kingdom that runs itself in a way that is inconsistent with\nThe un human rights declaration that is based on the degradation of women that ... heads people and that might well have murdered Jamal ... in the consulate ... that's a big image problem\nIn these investments in Silicon valley and then getting to go to Silicon Valley earlier this year and meet Mark Zuckerberg and meet Jeff ... and others\nHe got exactly what he paid for he got the illusory glow of being part of the future and he got so graduates columnists to call him a reformer\nSo on and you have given one way that the Saudis seem to benefit from this connection with Silicon Valley the crown prince can go there and get a photo op but do you have any evidence that when the Saudis invest in a company there are some kinds of strings attached\nNo and that's not my claim my concern is that Silicon Valley is not who it says it is when you spend time out there is I just did you hear an endless parade of platitudes about changing the world empowering people creating community giving voice\nAnd it's almost a parody of the fall city of those pretensions to raise money from one of the worst regimes on earth that is absolutely in violation of every value here thrown around in Silicon valley\nAnd I want to be clear this financial investment is not the only thing that's happened you know as many of your listeners will remember there was this Davos in the desert conference\nThen you've got this new five hundred billion dollar mega city that the Saudis are creating called Neal and Neal again had all these Silicon Valley people in other corporate people on the board and so these folks in Silicon valley and make a lot of very important decisions about what kind of world we live in\nIf these people are basically no better than chemical magnates would dump pollutants into rivers except the digital version of that I think that's important for Americans to understand\nWhat was it like in the last several days as you are traveling and the Silicon Valley area and speaking with audiences and this place that relies on the very industry are criticizing and said you people are showing yourself to be a moral or immoral\nYou know like you Steve I have two kinds of conversations with a journalist I have public ones and I have private ones\nEven in the public ones there is a growing sense\nThat they are standing on top of an indefensible mountain\nThat America has been led by plutocrats who are fundamentally motivated by the bottom line but who have spun us all a tale of how they're trying to transform civilization and the things need to change but in the private conversation Steve I Will tell you deep in the bowels of these institutions\nThere is a generation of younger people who frankly do not believe the stories\nThat their elders and their elders are like in their thirties and forties when the case of Silicon Valley do not believe their stories a bunch of people coming up in the valley frankly have a much more sophisticated understanding of power the very power they wheeled in the privileged they wield that some of the people who founded these companies have been catastrophic Lee blind to\n[noise] on a

of those idealistic pretensions have been very happy to open up to Saudi investors\nLet me just ask how big this really is you just use huge numbers like a hundred billion dollars but you are referring to spreading that money among multiple companies in Silicon valley where sometimes now a company can be worth a trillion dollars are they just buying you know I don't know five percent of

referring to spreading that money among multiple companies in Silicon valley where sometimes now a company can be worth a trillion dollars are they just buying you know I don't know five percent of the stock of some company\nIt's very but I'll tell you an ... for example softbank is now the largest single shareholder in ... with Saudi having half of that steak and I want to make a really important point about what this gets the Saudis\nIf you're the young crown prince you have a problem which is that the reality of your country is that it's a fairly barbaric medieval kingdom that runs itself in a way that is inconsistent with\nThe un human rights declaration that is based on the degradation of women that bear heads people and that might well have murdered ... and the consulate ... that's a big image problem\nIn these investments in Silicon valley and then getting to go to Silicon Valley earlier this year\nAnd meet Mark Zuckerberg and meet Jeff Bass us and others he got exactly what he paid for he got the illusory glow of being part of the future and he got so graduates columnists to call him a reformer\nSo on and you have given one way that the Saudis seem to benefit from this connection with Silicon Valley the crown prince can go there and get a photo op but do you have any evidence that when the Saudis invest in a company there are some kinds of strings attached\nNo and that's not my claim my concern is that Silicon Valley is not who it says it is when you spent time out there as I just did you hear an endless parade of platitudes about changing the world empowering people creating community giving voice\nAnd it's almost a parody of the fall city of those pretensions to raise money from one of the worst regimes on earth that is absolutely in violation of every value here thrown around in Silicon valley and I want to be clear this financial investment is not the only thing that's happened you know as\nMany of your listeners will remember there was this Davos in the desert conference\nThen you've got this new five hundred billion dollar mega city that the Saudis are creating called Neal and Neal again had all these Silicon Valley people other corporate people on the board and so these folks in Silicon valley and make a lot of very important decisions about what kind of world we live in if these people are basically no\nBetter than chemical magnates who'd dumped pollutants into rivers except the digital version of that I think that's important for Americans to understand\nWhat was it like in the last several days as you are traveling and the Silicon Valley area and speaking with audiences and this place that relies on the very industry are criticizing and said you people are showing yourself to be a moral or immoral\nYou know like you Steve I have two kinds of conversations with a journalist I have public ones and I have private ones\nEven in the public ones there is a growing sense\nThat they are standing on top of an indefensible mountain\nThat America has been led by plutocrats who are fundamentally motivated by the bottom line but who have spun us all a tale of how they're trying to transform civilization and the things need to change but in the private conversations Steve I Will tell you deep in the bowels of these institutions\nThere is a generation of younger people who frankly do not believe the stories\nThat their elders and their elders are like in their thirties and forties the case of Silicon Valley do not believe their stories a bunch of people coming up in the valley frankly have a much more sophisticated understanding of power the very power they wield and the privileged they wield that some of the people who founded these companies have been catastrophic Lee blind to\nOn a bearded us is the author of the book winners take all thanks very much for coming by\nThank you Steve are you an American graduate student has been released from the airport in Tel Aviv after being detained for more than two weeks we're more from NPR's Daniel Estrin in Jerusalem lower\nCost them is twenty two years old and a recent graduate of the University of Florida\nShe landed in Israel at the beginning of the month for a master's program and human rights at an Israeli university but authorities at the airport denied her entry under twenty Seventeen law banning activists affiliated with the pro Palestinian campaign to boycott Israel\nAll costs I'm used to ... to small chapter of a pro boycott student group but now she says she no longer supports the boycott she was held at the airport while she fought in court for the right to enter Israel\nHer story caught international attention following several other cases of Israel detaining left wing critics at the airport and border and it caused some embarrassment in Israel\nAnd then I asked them about what's the other than that\nDeputy foreign minister see peaceful to belly told Israeli radio last week that Israel's ban or no cost them was not very successful she said Israel should reconsider how it applies at century band when it turns into an international issue we lose more than we when she said\nBut Israeli strategic affairs minister
