the middle where you prove whether these promising treatments insurers are really going to cure or something and this bill create something called I bonds you y e bonds to test this idea\nOn the upside is an interesting upside for an investor who kicks in some money to help research blindness and let's say it turns out it was a great idea and it starts to take off they don't just get their money back what what happens\nMost importantly they do get their money back there'll be a package of projects in each bond\nSo that even if a few failed the taxpayers protected and the investor is
