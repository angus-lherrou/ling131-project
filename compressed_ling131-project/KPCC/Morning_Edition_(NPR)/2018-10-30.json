President Trump travels to Pennsylvania today to show support to those grieving over Saturday's deadly shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh it left eleven people dead and six wounded including for police officers who responded to the gunfire\nI Want to find other ways to commit myself to change both both in terms of my volunteer commitments since I'm retired and in terms of changing our national leadership\nOkay one of the voices we've heard in Pittsburgh through NPR's Brakkton Booker Brakkton thanks so much really appreciate it ... ... what\nEffect narratives and conspiracy theories make it from the far corners of the Internet to mainstream conversation or even the president's Twitter feed\nMothers question carries new urgency after the events of recent days one man allegedly sent multiple pipe bombs too political and media figures and then another killed\nEleven people in the Pittsburgh synagogue both were involved in social media conversations that featured explicit racist diatribe before they've ventured into terrorism\nWell how to conspiracy theories persist and spread wealth summer has spent a lot of time thinking about this he reports on fringe right wing media for the Daily Beast demonic sir I Wonder if their products for coming by what's an example of how this works the way that a conspiracy theory would start and and and go go national go go ...\nSure absolutely so really the most obvious example right now is uh is the so called caravan coming up from endorse we've seen the president sent troops down to the border are basically to respond to that is actually a fiction ... in terms of the actual danger posed the United states\nThis is something that bubbled up really on you know fringe Youtube videos Twitter red threads and now we see the president reacting to it\nOh wait a minute you're saying that this ... you can trace this back and some time before the president a became exercised about this it was a big deal on various sites\nExactly as so there's been some analysis that looks really the first mentions of this and and the various ah you know it's sort of fake news is actually use to promote as you know people will take a picture of someone with boils and then they'll say oh you know this is only the Caribbean has completely unrelated but it kind of ramps up the hype about it\nAnd you end up with someone on Fox News which I Believe happened yesterday saying gosh these people might be bringing any number of diseases there ... or what have you and the president the United states talks about this since this happened a lot with the president\nAbsolute is far from the first time a you know I I think the most obvious example is when the president claimed after the twenty six you know a lecture and the three million illegal votes were cast and causing them the popular vote that was an idea he clearly got a it's a through various channels from for wars and he sort of use that to them create the presidential voter fraud commission\nWhat are some of the influential sites hear the word gab I think is new to some people\nBecause the suspect in the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting had been active I'm making anti Semitic remarks on gab ... what are some of the other ones that are Q\nA shirt so so there's various ah there's ... it's almost like a mirror world for all these various sites so you know YouTube would obviously be the main videos I Will if you're kicked off YouTube you might go to a website called like bitch shoot or something and so there's various versions of Facebook and Twitter and so on\nAnd they don't say where racist we're here to be racist rice\n... you know it's interesting some of them do actively court the alt right some of them have positioned themselves more as a broader free speech platform in the case of gab I think they definitely did a lot of outreach to the right and I was sort of part of their business model um\nOther becoming more influential\nOr you know it's interesting I think they're very prominent within their niche I mean these sites are still like fractions of a fraction of what a a mainstream social media site without\n'em and did they get directly to policymakers or is there some intermediate or\nWell you know we've seen the president's a campaign manager Brad par scale mentioned gab before you joined if there was some technical issues so so there are some links to the mainstream Republican Party\nWill summer thanks for coming by really appreciate things rather than a reports for the Daily Beast\nAnd let's get an update now on one of the news stories that can be driven by conspiracy theories the U.S will deploy more than five thousand troops to the border with Mexico in an effort to stop a caravan of migrants some of whom say they eventually want to reach asylum in the United states\nLast night in an interview with learning from the president said there are quote a lot of bad people and the care of and and he called it an invasion\nThousands and thousands of people in the bridge when you looked at that bridge loaded up with people that's called an invasion of our country\nAnd in a tweet President Trump said quote our military is waiting for you and quote Mexican authorities estimate that the caravan has about three to five thousand travel\nLet's check that out with freelance journalist David ... who has been traveling with the caravan he's now back in Mexico city he was with them just days ago welcome to the program\nA good morning I'm a first I Want to get a sense of how far away this caravan is from the border we're told that us troops will be at the U.S border Mexico border within days um is the caravan within days of the United states\nNo not at all which killed a probably close to a thousand miles away from the closest us port of entry and also many in in the caravan are saying that their destination T wanna which obviously across from San Diego\nAnd that's a quite a bit more distant or with any luck they would make it to Mexico City probably around ... uh the first ... the end of the first week of November and that still quite a ways to go\nUnless checked the size of this because um yesterday we heard on NPR News from the Mexican a bastard the United states who said that Mexican authorities are trying to keep tabs on this group and edited a declined in size considerably and he thought it was about thirty five hundred people do you have any way to to to estimate that yourself\nNobody knows for sure the obviously the official number a that was given at the time the last week was thirty six hundred with a and just yesterday the cheering minister said about Eighteen hundred Eighteen hundred and five people\nHad applied for found another five hundred to go home of voluntarily\nMirrors along the route had put the number it closer to sixty thousand or not what your age because on the number of people but they were serving a because you're obviously providing a lot of food and uh obviously assistance for the migrants so nobody knows for sure but it would probably be hired enough\nOkay so it may be higher than thirty five hundred of according to the best information that you have I guess the next question is how many of them are determined to reach the United states as opposed to accepting this Mexican offer of asylum or taking some other course well\nThe ... the migrants themselves at a a nightly then it can have a nightly assembly were they when they live in a in a in a village what they'll do is deal they'll\nSet up camp and they'll they'll be in the town square and uh [noise] they will have an assembly\nWhich they will vote on proposals usually that meaning when they will leave\nThe next morning what will they will take and the proposal was read to them and they voted to not except that I spoke with migrants who just simply said their goal is to reach the United states felt that we still both of them will be their best to get to\nThe United states okay so some of them some of them are coming to the border could be here could be on the other states eventually\nEventually yes I mean there's no nobody's really sure how how quickly do get to you'll get that they're probably they're moving about forty miles a day some days more somebody's\nLeft uh but that still putting them uh probably late November at the earliest that they would get to the border you wanna\nI'll tell you David Akron reporter has been traveling with the caravan thanks so much oh you're very welcome\n\nThis is NPR News I'm Mark a woman an

David Greene in Culver City California how'd you fake narratives and conspiracy theories make it from the far right corners of the Internet to mainstream conversation or even the president's Twitter feed\nThis question carries new urgency after the events in recent days including after a gunman killed eleven people in Pittsburgh synagogue over the weekend\nThe suspect posted explicit racist comments to social media and extremist conspiracy theories can also ended up driving official policy will summer thinks about all of this a lot he reports on friends right wing media for the Daily Beast and he's with us this morning either will there haven't been so what's a good example of how this works a shirt so for example I mean\n... the most obvious example right now is the the care of and the so called Caribbean coming out of Honduras or this is a the idea that this was some big men as a you know invading hoard a it is something that really sort of bubbled up ah on on sort of the dark as a edges of the right wing Internet\nOr with a lot of sort of hoaxes behind that and uh you know they've been pushing this idea for a couple of months now and it's only really this month it's caught on so much so that the president is now sending troops to fight off that sort of non existent invasion\nNow I mean of course the president with they sending the military somewhere is a very important decision but but you're you're saying that you've been able to actually track this that the idea that this so called caravan is a menace was on some of these fringe sites and you could watch it work its way into the conversation and and sort of mainstream politics absolutely\nPeople don't a analyses of this that show sort of like a you know starting on various Facebook pages read it accounts for channel ... which is a pro Trump Internet forum all these places and it it kind of hit the hit the mean enough and the message and then just in in the past week or two it really has caught on\nA you know a a representative Matt gates from Florida it was one of the big promoters of it and then from there it really took off\nAre there other examples where you've actually seen these sort of there's work their way is as high as you know top officials even the White House yeah I\nI think some of the most fascinating stuff happens when these weird hoaxes and conspiracy theories effect actual policy so ah the president claimed after twenty six the election that he had lost the popular vote because three million illegal votes were cast\nAnd you can draw a pretty direct line to that from that too and infowars article that had originally made that claim and then that claim then goes on to his part of the president to create the presidential voter fraud commission\n[noise] what what what who does something about this if if anyone I mean if if these conspiracy theories are not true if if some or all or many of them are not based on fact to rains as soon as the job of of the press to knock these things down should fall the social media platforms to regulate what's being shared their you know I I I think\nIt's an incredibly thorny issue I mean we've seen in the past when at a press rise to fact check things you often end up amplifying the hoaxes and spreading them around and you aren't really convincing the people who believe in them already a you know at this point I think people are kind of decided the balls and the court of the social media companies\nBut you know they've been very reluctant to step in understandably into adjudicating political controversies so it it I think it's very sticky issue I think the companies right now are airing more on the side of a uh banning people and stuff like that than they were in the past\nAre we seeing a lot more than than we used to or has has always been going I mean it seems like something that is\nReally accelerated obviously we've had conspiracy theories for decades and a and even before that a but it is really exhilarating to social media and also I think ah the Internet and social media allows people to connect and reinforce wanted others believe in a way they couldn't really in real life\nWill summer reports on fringe right wing media for the Daily Beast joining us this morning in our studios in Washington where we really appreciate it ethics rather\nPolitical odds makers

really hope that key PCC continue this amazing programming in the future joined me by becoming a member a key PCC dot org thank you\n[noise]\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm David Greene and I'm Steve Inskeep something is changing on American television and online streaming services there are more Muslim characters and more nuanced portrayals of Muslim communities and pure laid off all starts the story on set in Los Angeles\nIt's one of the last days of taping for a new Web series called the size of a brand new and why\nIt's a show about being in your twenties and figuring out life and it's talked to two main characters roommates who are Muslim but that's not the entirety of their storylines ... the creator of the show it's about\nPaying rent you know having a dead end job I'm having issues with um you know your your family life going to\n... it's the first project from powder keg the company founded by director writer and actor Paul feeding known for films like bridesmaids and the recent Ghostbusters east of la Brett follows the friendship of two women a black Muslim and a Bangladeshi American Muslim in gentrifying Los Angeles or days he says it's one American story\nThere's so many different versions of my hope would be that everyone gets a shock to tell their version of a Muslim American store it so it doesn't feel like oh this is the one of them showed them used to make it all goes all that\nWe had to the next location for taping in LA mosque the scene deals with racism black from sometimes face within for communities that character ... played by Geoffrey Maya is praying when her phone started ringing with a song like this\nGuy was a game that you guys when you go to games\nThe director tells the other actors how to react and ladies look at her little shady in the next scene a woman school tests and assuming she's everything convert and tells her her prayer doesn't count is it that\nWe have lessons every Thursday wanting how Congress was the law\nIf something happens an immigrant and from assuming she knows better and it's one way to show explores identity\nAnd Easter break creators America daisy says he's glad there are more projects involving the funds but he says there isn't going to be one breakout moment but hopefully there will be many moments and the more stuff that's out there even the bad stuff the better\nDot dot is the flexibility under privileged but I think I'm white community thought is that they're allowed to fail in Hollywood and no one really ... it's like okay it's okay you can you can jump back up and throw millions of dollars a gallon for you to do next project so that's the point but we have to go after\nIt's a struggle a lot of communities of color and minorities face in Hollywood\nThe two thousand Eighteen Hollywood diversity report from UCLA found that despite progress minorities are still under represented in key jobs from lead actors to directors to writers right now there's an appetite for shows about Muslims in part it's because no some writers like our daisy who's written on Modern Family in outsourced or creating their own content\nAnd their support for it he got a grant from pop culture collaborative to create the series and some of the interest is Hollywood reacting to answer I'm from an anti immigrant sentiment from Donald Trump after he announced his candidacy in two thousand Fifteen\nThe Hollywood barrel of them for public affairs council got a lot more popular the phones were ringing off the hook\nThat ... she leads to bureau in consults with studios in production companies on creating more authentic more from characters were\nUp against decades of storytelling that is inaccurate many times that is racist often and very stereotypical\nAmong the tropes women are chattel and don't have identities or Muslim only portrayed as the gas station owner or the taxi driver a lady says it's an uphill battle but today the list of characters on mainstream television is longer than she's ever seen\nA Muslim surgeon on Grey's Anatomy a superhero on D.C legends of tomorrow a DVD cute jabbing Muslim on on the boat type a pork loving alcohol drinking Muslim on master of none\nWhen writers come to her for advice oh baby reminds them that different from characters might be the only Muslim some people ever meet she tries to help them get the language right like scripts that use the term ... which means God is great\nSo you've seen many TV and film projects that have lots to talk about being used in very violent scenes\nOr they didn't negotiates the studios to try to get them to change it translated or offset it with happy scenes like saying God is great at a wedding or a dinner party because for Muslims it's a beautiful phrase portrayed as ugly\nYou know so someone's hears a lot about it when they're dining out and all of a sudden you know they're calling nine one one because they think of family is doing something bad when all they're saying is God that was a damn good meal and ...\nAnd our babies excited by many of the projects now being written by and about ... for large audiences there's ... to Palestinian American comic with cerebral palsy writing an autobiographical sitcom for ABC Milan or a comic with the recent Netflix special and Romney Yusef who I met on a night he's headlining at the Hollywood in Prague he\nJokes

that's not what represented when people try and put them on television they go out of their way to make them look amazing and look perfect his show won't do that\nI just was really excited about the idea of making Muslims look imperfect and not create something that was like some you know PR thing but create something that was you know really just a realistic portrayal of what we go through how we are\nHe says that people connect with others when they see their flights now in their hero a villain or exactly like everyone else ...

I Love in a building ...\nIs with my family and you can't work for a better voice in our winter rough patch where I couldn't pay my bills ... actually went five days without electricity for it and send me during or ask for help as I was sharing\nI was like five hundred dollars behind them I ... jumping impaired and got my electric\nTurned back on for ... or Walmart never did the um construction never knew about\nAfter everything that has happened to the factory all three of them have strong emotions towards the president Michel supports them more than ever she feels like she's making the sacrifice he called on her to make the why would you turn against him\nYou know it's hard right now in a lot of times when\nThings are hard to get harder until they start getting better that's just the fact of life\nThat I think it is ultimate goal is to\nBring everything here so that labor not happening day shipped overseas\nI get it and understand\nRemember we've been fighting fighting and fighting and it's like he didn't care for sure I wouldn't vote for me and\nI just like your style I just like the way you know ... ... ... not going to shoot to anything on the same way you know a job either don't like living in a little\nBird migrant change and this is a big part of Trump's appeal we heard people talk about how when they're rooting for the president there really rooting for themselves\nHim being just as human as us the fact that he he failed how many times before he finally succeeded you know and I guess one of those tries finally worked out for him and he worked his way up\nThat is the voice of Alex Collins he's twenty four years old and he works the overnight shift at the male factory he and his fiance page Spencer\nThey're living a life you know so many Americans really clear they're almost never together\nOn a Tuesday night recently they were huddled on the couch together watching TV this is the only our of the day when they get the hang out then it's out the door page drives Alex To where\nWe allow them\nThen it's on to her personal routine drop him off and I love you\nAnd I come home sit down and watch TV at a couple of beers and how the house let's say cleaning or doing laundry and then I usually end in bed anytime between like ten thirty and wine\nAt five AM for pages off to work at the restaurant she leaves Alex a list of chores there honeydew list he walks in the door around seven AM and it gets to work on\nThe honeydew list and then once I get through all that it's just time to wind down I mean watch a little TV messed around my phone come right around noon one o'clock it's time for bed I lay down semi alarms God I Wish I slept more\nWhen he wakes up he gets that magical hour with page and then the cycle starts again as for politics Alex and page don't always agree she voted for Bernie Sanders last time Alix went for Donald Trump\nHe is always lean conservative partly because of his face he's been a foster child homeless he fought a heroin addiction and in a way religion found him\nDidn't really believe in it too much up until the sixth or seventh foster home I ended up in one of my foster brothers actually stopped me one\nAnd he asked me some questions you know what I thought about God and he worked with me from their own and eventually down to the point where you know I was going to church every Sunday\nBut his vote for Trump wasn't about religion or party again it was about this deep personal belief that Trump could make everything right for him this young man making ten twenty five an hour and trying to build a life with his partner two years later he is starting to feel some doubts\n[noise] accounting question myself a little bit on on that decision that I made on voting for him I mean I'm not really seeing the results yet things started getting a little bit more expensive I mean I'm\nSurprised how much milk went up that was a big one for me I God I Love milk I like chocolate milk I drink and all the time and prices on things started going up and it's like why is that happening\nIn fact milk prices have largely gone down in Missouri since Trump became president but if Alex is paying more at his store and he uses that as a measure of this president it goes to show the kind of expectations he has\nYou know this man was supposed to be able to fix everything make everything better make prices go down you know quantity go up quality to go out and we're not really seeing results from that\nAnd the tariffs decision that that hit your workplace did that affect what you think of him\nYeah it kind of did whatever his reasoning for trying it than the timing was bad I feel like it ended up doing more damage to the economy and to America has a whole than it did for anything I mean two hundred people lost their jobs\nThat's a big blow to a small town like this\nYou sound like you're open minded like you're giving him these two more years to kind of see what happens\nI mean if he can show results and make things happen then he'll have my support again [noise]\nBut until then I mean it's yet to be seen\nA small Missouri town were Donald Trump is absolutely getting his wish this political moment is very much about him one way or another\nSo David given how important Missouri used in the mid terms what does the president's support their means for people who were actually on the ballot this fall\nI mean he's looming large everywhere Steve I think we're all hearing that as we traveled the country there's voters out there who are paying attention to specific local issues but they bring up the president\nSo quickly and I think candidates know that there's this tight Senate race in Missouri you've got democratic Senator Claire McCaskill really vulnerable fighting for her job and I want you to just listen to this at because it highlights her support from the national border patrol council which is a labor union\nWe endorsed President Trump can Claire McCaskill because of the records on border security taken from us no senator is tougher on securing the border of and Claire McCaskill\nTo the Democrat Steve trying to appeal to voters by saying what my record on border security a strong limb like President Trump says I mean that's that's one of the political realities here with the president so much and focus so where does your series take us next David\nWhere we're going to Texas a tomorrow you know the president's role in the larger culture war in our country we're going to hear about that and how that war has drawn in residents of the

MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm David Greene in Culver City California\nAnd I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC a group of migrants is still weeks away from the U.S border and moving slowly through Mexico\nBut within days President Trump plans to move roughly five thousand us troops to the border at rallies for Republican candidates this fall the president has explicitly port the distant caravan at the center of the election campaign an election seemed to be continued last night on Fox\nThousands and thousands of people and the bridge when you looked at that wage loaded up with people that's called an invasion of our country the\nPresident was apparently referring to a bridge more than one thousand miles away from the United states with that said there is a group of several thousand migrants with varying descriptions of its size and purpose to check the latest facts we called journalist David ... who was recently with that group and we asked first if it is getting near the U.S\n[noise] no not at all it's it's still a\nProbably close to a thousand miles away from the closest us port of entry and also many in in the caravan are saying that their destination is cheap one of which obviously across from San Diego\nAnd that's a quite a bit a more distant or with any luck they would make it to Mexico City probably around ... of the first ... the end of the first week of November and that still quite a ways to go\nI must check the size of this because um yesterday we heard on NPR News from the Mexican ambassador to the United states\nWho said that Mexican authorities are trying to keep tabs on this group and edited a declined in size considerably and he thought it was about thirty five hundred people do you have any way to to to estimate that yourself\n... nobody knows for sure the obviously the official number a that was given at the time or the last week was thirty six hundred with a and just yesterday the interior minister said about Eighteen hundred Eighteen hundred Ninety five people\nHad applied for asylum another five hundred us to go home of voluntarily mayors along the route had put the number it closer to six thousand a that was just based because on the number of people that they were serving a because they're obviously providing a lot of food and uh\nObviously assistance for the migrants so nobody knows for sure but it would probably be higher than\nUh okay so it may be higher than thirty five hundred of according to the best information that you have I guess the next question is how many of them are determined to reach the United states as opposed to accepting this Mexican offer of asylum or taking some other course\nWell the ... the migrants themselves how to they tend to have a nightly assembly were they when they arrive in a in a in a village what they'll do is they'll\nThey'll set up camp and they'll be in the town square and they will have an assembly one which they will vote on proposals usually that meaning when they will leave the next morning what route they will take\nAnd the proposal was read to them and they voted to not except that I spoke with migrants who just simply said their goal is to reach the United states so that was so both of them will do their best to get to the United states\nOkay so some of them some of them are coming to the border could be here could be on the other states eventually\nEventually yes I mean there is no nobody's really sure how how quickly they'll get they'll get that they're probably moved their moving about forty miles a day some days more some days left\nEveryone at a I spoke with was determined to reach the United states of all the people I spoke with only two said they were interested in staying in Mexico one person couldn't cross the border and just wanted to be closer to the U.S children or the others were ... were wanting to work in northern Mexico reporter David Ira and thanks so much you're very welcome\nBoth\nServices for the

we're we're not supposed to leave the body alone and we have people who come in and guards them and be with them while they're there they pray they say songs and so it's just somebody shouldn't pass from this world by themselves at an it's an honor someone for everybody who's who's involved in it\nDiamond says a ritual washing up the body is also part of the Jewish tradition to prepare for burial\nAnd that's what we call the great myths of great commandment to great good thing that we do it's very difficult thing to\nBurial traditionally takes place quickly in Judaism ideally within a

the wake of Saturday's deadly shooting at a synagogue a rabbi at the tree of life synagogue says the president is welcome but a group of Pittsburgh Jewish leaders has written an open letter asking the president not to come unless he first denounces white nationalism\nPresident Trump has lowered the number and emphasized that the United states doesn't want the expense of refugees\nThat is correct which we know how to be false we know that refugees contribute to our economy they pay taxes they really benefit our country we are a country of course founded by immigrants and refugees\nSo so what have you thought about rabbi Myer uh as you have learned not only this man walked into a synagogue and killed eleven people uh but seemed to have conducted himself to conspiracy theories involving your group\nThe first thing I'll say is that we are just heartbroken\nWe are absolutely in mourning with a Pittsburgh Jewish community and with the whole American Jewish community\nAnd really what I feel is just confounded how a person could so twist a narrative and collect a narrative ... what happened a\n... you know was very close to national refugee about which was an initiative of highest which was meant to highlight American Jewish support for refugees because this is so quintessentially Jewish\nAnd for this man to have twisted that narrative at you expresses hatred for Jews to express his hatred for refugees and to use that hatred of fuel such violence is just so ... to Jewish values to American values and so we are both heartbroken and confounded but\nWe what we are also is really doubling down on our mission because there is no better way to respond to this hatred we believe I than than to support refugees how you're going to double down\nWe will continue helping our

F. L. dot edu\nIt's\nMORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington\nAnd I'm David Greene in Culver City California so how do fake narratives and conspiracy theories make it from the far right corners of the Internet to mainstream conversation or even the president's Twitter feed\nThis question carries new urgency after the events of recent days after a gunman killed eleven people in Pittsburgh synagogue over the weekend\nThe suspect was an active user of the social media sites gap where he posted his anti Semitic thoughts gab bills itself as a free speech alternative to Facebook and Twitter and is hardly the first place on the Internet where anti Semitism white nationalism and other extreme ideology spread\nWe spoke earlier this morning to will summer who thinks about all this a lot he reports on fringe right wing media for the Daily Beast and he's actually tracked how conspiracy theories gain traction either well thanks for having me so what's a good example of how this works a shirt so for example I mean ...\nThe most obvious example right now is the the care of and the so called caravan coming out of Honduras or this is a the idea that this was some big men as a you know an invading hoard a it is something that really sort of bubbled up ah on on the sort of the darkest uh the edges of the right wing Internet\nOr with a lot of sort of hoaxes behind that and uh you know they've been pushing this idea for a couple of months now and it's only really this month it's caught on so much so that the president is now sending troops to fight off that sort of non existent invasion\nNow I mean of course the president would they sending the military somewhere is a very important decision but but you're you're saying that you've been able to actually track this that the idea that this caravan is a menace was on some of these fringe sites and you could watch it work its way into the conversation and and sort of mainstream politics absolutely\nPeople don't a analyses of this that show sort of like a you know starting on various Facebook pages read it accounts for channel ... which is a pro Trump Internet forum all these places and it it kind of hit the hit the me up and the message and then just in in the past week or two it really has caught on\nA you know a a representative Matt gates from Florida it was one of the big promoters of it and then from there it really took off\nAre there are other examples where you've actually seen these sort of there's work their way as as high as you know top officials even the White House yeah I\nI I think some of the most fascinating stuff happens when these weird hoaxes and conspiracy theories affect the actual policy so ah the president claimed after twenty sixteen election that he had lost the popular vote because three million illegal votes were cast\nAnd you can draw a pretty direct line to that from that too and infowars article that had originally made that claim and then that claim then goes on to his part of the president to create the presidential voter fraud commission\nWill will what who does something about this if if anyone I mean if if these conspiracy theories are not true if if some or all or many of them are not based on fact to rains as soon as the job of of the press to knock these things down should it fall to social media platforms to regulate what's being shared their you\nKnow I I think it's an incredibly thorny issue I mean we've seen in the past when at a press rise to fact check things you often end up ... amplifying the hoaxes and spreading them around and you aren't really convincing the people who believe in them already a you know at this point I think people are kind of decided the ball is in the court of the social media companies but\nYou know they've been very reluctant to step in understandably into adjudicating political controversies so it it I think it's very sticky issue I think the companies right now are airing more on the side of a uh banning people and stuff like that and they were in the past\nAre we seeing a lot more than than we used to or has has always been going on and it seems like something that is\nReally accelerated obviously we've had conspiracy theories for decades and a and even before that a but it is really accelerated with social media and also I think uh the Internet and social media allows people to connect and reinforced one another's belief in a way they couldn't really in real life\nWill summer reports on fringe right wing media for the Daily Beast joining us this morning in our studios in Washington where we really appreciate it effects rather\nPolitical odds makers identified dozens of congressional districts that are in play as it said could go either way and will determine which party wins the house this fall one of those seats is the second district of Maine it's voters supported President Trump in two thousand sixteen\nBut supported President Obama just four

rural it's not just the main of lobsters and light houses but more hard Scrabble with shuttered mills and one of the worst opioid problems in the nation\nDemocrats think it could swing blue again one afternoon last week their candidate Jared Golden greeted workers at the afternoon shift change at the ... paper mill in Jay\n... is a thirty six year old former marine who signed up after nine eleven and served two tours in Afghanistan and Iraq in an interview at a nearby hospital golden said his top issue is health care\nIf you go back to May of two thousand Seventeen with the Republican effort to repeal the AC a very deep cuts to Medicaid contained in that House bill and then consider the fact that there's talk and voted for that bill\nGolden wants to extend Medicare coverage to people age fifty five and believes there should eventually be universal coverage that position has been attacked by Republican income and Bruce pollock when in TV ads like this one\nRadical gold ... government control your health care ending Medicare as we know it still blink taxes\nWe reached out to public ... campaign repeatedly for an interview but got no response\nThe sixty four year old is running for his third term as the only remaining Republican in the house from New England in a debate earlier this month he cited his votes to lower taxes and cut regulations well accusing golden being in the pocket of democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and others\nI'll tell you what I really object you is all of this on a state money by Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters all these dark money groups that are pouring money in here are trying to convince the people in Maine a and attacked me and say I'm some you know not\nGolden has repeatedly asserted he will not vote for ... for speaker saying it's time for new leadership in that same debate public when whom Trump endorsed for reelection in ... refused to state whether he voted for Trump in twenty sixteen\nThat's my business I work with everybody Republicans and Democrats as a business professional but I Do not tell anybody ...\nI asked golden if he thinks Democrats should serve as a check on Trump if they win the majority I don't\nView my role as resistance I like to say I'm a marine no better friend no worst enemy if the president does something helps Maine I'm with him if he does something hurts Maine I'm going to stick up for our

he asked me some questions you know what I thought about God and he worked at me from their own and eventually down to the point where you know I was going to church every Sunday\nBut his vote for Trump wasn't about religion or party again it was about this deep personal belief that Trump could make everything right for him this young man making ten twenty five an hour and trying to build a life with his partner two years later he is starting to feel some doubts\n[noise] accounting question myself a little bit on on that decision that I made on voting for him I mean\nI'm not really seeing the results yet things started getting a little bit more expensive I mean I'm surprised how much milk went up that was a big one for me I got I Love milk I like chocolate milk I drink and all the time and prices on things started going up and it's like why is that happening\nIn fact milk prices have largely gone down in Missouri since Trump became president but if Alex is paying more at his store and he uses that as a measure of this president it goes to show the kind of expectations he has\nYou know this man was supposed to be able to fix everything make everything better make prices go down you know quantity go up quality to go up and we're not really seeing results from that\nAnd the tariffs decision that that hit your workplace did that affect what you think of him\nYeah it kind of dead whenever his reasoning for trying it than the timing was bad I feel like it ended up doing more damage to the economy and to America has a whole than it did for anything I mean two hundred people lost their jobs\nThat's a big blow to a small town like this [noise]\nYou sound like you're open minded like you're giving him these two more years to kind of see what happens\nI mean

United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to Nicholas is ridiculous and it has to end\nA NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley joins us next morning Scott\nGood morning Steve why is the president focused on this\nWell ah it seems to be conveniently time for the midterm elections which are just a week away today\nThis was an idea that was floated by Donald Trump and and some other candidates during the twenty sixteen a campaign and here we are in late twenty eight team and we have seen a zero public activity towards actually acting on something like this\nUntil now we are all week out from the mid term elections the White House counsel who would presumably play a role in\nDrafting an order like this as just left his post the new White House counsel hasn't taken over\nA there's an acting person in that slot so it it seems suspicious that something like this is actually going to serve as it may be a little bit of paper where like the president's ten percent middle class tax cuts that conveniently rises before the midterm and that has never seen or heard\nFrom again I I guess we should fact checking a little bit of what we just heard the president say there and it is something he said during the campaign complaining that someone who was known as an anchor baby would come here and be born on us soil and therefore get eighty five years of benefits uh the reality is in many cases of course that person grows up and goes to work and work the job and creates a value for the economy correct\n[noise] well that's right and we're talking real that sort of two phenomenon one is a\nBabies born to people who are living in the U.S illegally and then secondly there's a a a nation\nA phenomenon known as birth tourism where you have wealthy immigrants coming to the U.S specifically for the purpose of of having children\nWe should say the fourteenth amendment is very explicit all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens or whether you can challenge that through an executive order as it is a pretty constitutionally dubious\nRevolution that's what I Want to ask about Scott Horsley the president says there on the video he says okay so it's in the constitution but some people think you can do it with Congress so I'm going to try and executive order that seems to me like he was saying\nUm you need a plane to cross the Pacific ocean but some people think you can do it in a row boats so I'm going to try a scooter\nHe may try it and this certainly face a a quick a constitutional challenge\nAlthough as you point out he hasn't done it yet is the thing he's raising his discussing days before an election\nAnd this is cutting it to the anti immigrant faction within

California so how do fake narratives and conspiracy theories make it from the far right corners of the Internet to mainstream conversation or even the president's Twitter feed\nThis question carries new urgency after the events of recent days after a gunman killed eleven people in a Pittsburgh synagogue over the weekend\nThe suspect was an active users of social media sites gap where he posted his anti Semitic thoughts gab bills itself as a free speech alternative to Facebook and Twitter and is hardly the first place on the Internet where anti Semitism white nationalism and other extreme ideology spread\nWe spoke earlier this morning to will summer who thinks about all this a lot he reports on fringe right wing media for the Daily Beast and he's actually tracked how conspiracy theories gained traction\nEither will they haven't been so what's a good example of how this works a sure so for example I mean ...\nThe most obvious example right now is the the care of and the so called caravan coming out of Honduras or this is a the idea that this was some big men as a you know invading hoard a it is something that really sort of bubbled up ah on on the dark as a edges of the right wing Internet\nOr with a lot of sort of hoaxes behind that and I you know they've been pushing this idea for a couple of months now and it's only really this month it's caught on so much so that the president is now sending troops to fight off that sort of non existent invasion\nNow I mean of course the president would say sending the military somewhere is a very important decision but but you you are saying that you've been able to actually track this that the idea that this caravan is a menace was on some of these fringe sites and you could watch it work its way into the conversation and and sort of mainstream politics\nAbsolutely people don't a analyses of this that show sort of like a you know starting on various Facebook pages read it accounts for channel ... which is a pro Trump Internet forum all these places and they kind of hit the hit the me enough and the message and then just in in the past week or two it really has caught on\nA you know a a representative Matt gates from Florida was one of the big promoters of it and then from there it really took off\nAre there other examples where you've actually seen these sort of there's work their way is as high as you know top officials even the White House yeah\nI I think some of the most fascinating stuff happens when these weird hoaxes and conspiracy theories effect actual policy so ah the president claimed after twenty sixteen election that he had lost the popular vote because three million illegal votes were cast\nAnd you can draw a pretty direct line to that from that too and infowars article that had originally made that claim and then that claim then goes on to have part of the president to create the presidential voter fraud commission\n[noise] what what what who does something about this if if anyone I mean if if these conspiracy theories are not true if it's some or all or many of them are not based on fact to raise the standards of the job of of the press to knock these things down should at fault of social media platforms to regulate what's being shared their you\nKnow I think it's an incredibly thorny issue I mean we've seen in the past when the press rise to fact check things you often end up ... amplifying the hoaxes and spreading them around and you aren't really convincing the people who believe in them already a you know at this point I think people are kind of decided the balls and a quarter of the social media companies but\nYou know they've been very reluctant to step in and understandably into adjudicating political controversies so it it I think it's very sticky issue I think the companies right now are airing more on the side of a uh banning people and stuff like that than they were in the past\nAre we seeing a lot more than than we used to or has always been going I mean it seems like something that is\nReally accelerated obviously we've had conspiracy theories for decades and and even before that uh but as it is really exhilarating with social media and also I think ah the Internet and social media allows people to connect and reinforce wanted others believe in a way they couldn't really in real life\nWill summer reports on fringe right wing

C. days before an election in which he wants to immigration to be a major issue President Trump has a new way to talk about immigration\nHe gave an interview to actually goes in which he said that he is interested in the idea of ending birthright citizenship that still legal concept that someone born in the United states or to a U.S citizen is also entitled to be assessed and\nIt was always told me that you needed a constitutional of member guessing line and you don't need a number one number one you don't need that number to lessons you learned lessons well you can definitely do with it an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nNow how ridiculous we're the only country in the world\nWhere a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to Nicholas is ridiculous and it has to end\nThere was a lot in that bit of video including a number of statements that are false notably the president is wrong to say that the United states alone grants birthright citizenship many countries around the world do including Canada now let's talk about this with NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley Scott\nGood morning Steve why is the president focused on this\nWell uh it seems to be conveniently time for the midterm elections which are just a week away today\nThis was an idea that was floated by Donald Trump and and some other candidates during the twenty sixteen a campaign and here we are in late twenty eight team and we have seen a zero public activity towards actually acting on something like this\nUntil now we are all week out from the mid term elections the White House counsel who would presumably play a role in\nDrafting an order like this as just left his post the new White House counsel hasn't taken over\nThere is an acting person in that slot so it it seems suspicious that something like this is actually going to serve as it may be a little bit of vapor where like the president's ten percent middle class tax cuts oh a conveniently arises before the midterm and that has never seen or heard\nFrom again I I guess we should fact check a little bit of what we just heard the president say there and it is something he said during the campaign complaining that someone who was known as an anchor baby would come here and be born on us soil and therefore get eighty five years of benefits uh the reality is in many cases of course that person grows up and goes to work and worked a job and creates a value for the economy correct\nWell that's right and we're talking about sort of two phenomenon one is a\nBabies born to people who are living in the U.S illegally and then secondly there's a a a nation\nA phenomenon known as birth tourism where you have wealthy immigrants coming to us specifically for the purpose of having children we should say the fourteenth amendment is very explicit all persons born or naturalized in the United states\nAnd subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens or whether you can challenge that through an executive orders of is a pretty constitutionally dubious\nLucian that's what I Want to ask about Scott Horsley the president says there on the video he says okay so it's in the constitution but some people think you can do it with Congress so I'm going to try and executive order that seems to me like he was saying\nUm you need a plane to cross the Pacific ocean but some people think you can do it in a rowboat so I'm going to try scooter\n[laughter] he may try it and this certainly face a quick a\nConstitutional challenge although as you point out he hasn't done it yet is the thing he's raising his discussing days before an election\nAnd this is cutting it to the anti immigrant faction within the GOP\nAll right Scott thanks so much really appreciate it You're welcome to That's NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley ...\nServices are the victims of the mass

this\nRabbi Chuck diamond who once led a congregation that tree of life says rabbis has been going to them more to be with the bodies in the days since the shooting\nWas so we're we're not supposed to leave a body alone and we have people who come in and guards them to be with them while they're there they per se songs and so it was just somebody should pass from the world by themselves and it's an honor someone for everybody who's who's involved in it\nDiamond says a ritual washing up the body is also part of the Jewish tradition to prepare for burial\nAnd that's what we call the great myths a grave commandments of great good thing that we do it's very difficult thing to\nA burial traditionally takes place quickly in Judaism ideally within a day or two that timeline has been pushed back slightly because of the criminal investigations surrounding the shooting\nThere was a real desire to return to a sense of a routine and normalcy\nRabbi Aron business is the senior rabbi at congregation rodents alone which is hosting the Rosenthal funeral today he explains the thinking behind a quick burial which is traditionally followed by a week of intense morning\nEven this that won't be immediate you want to get that under way that process so they're not wallowing in our grief or we're not stuck in suspended animation as we anticipated burial that's at some later date\nThe

thank you many worry that Republicans have gone soft on deficits and the quest to cut taxes are you going soft on if it's\nIf you don't get the economy growing faster than one half to two percent sure not gonna bring down the trade deficit you're not going to get new jobs get businesses growing and a lot of these other problems are much easier to solve\nBut that's the answer to people who are particularly focused on the deficit is give it some time the editor oath will bring it out yet\nBut Trump has given us a lot higher growth already know what Republicans have done a terrible job at controlling stomach and I'm the first one to point the finger is that Republicans for that end Democrats\nYou know historically as if this thing from Goldman Sachs a chart showing that except for the Korean and Vietnam wars low unemployment like we have now often is associated goes hand in hand with lower deficits but now we have lower unemployment but the deficit is going on\nLet me ask you a question and your listeners a question would you rather have a lower budget deficit right now\nAnd less economic growth and fewer jobs or would you rather have a higher budget deficit and a lot more jobs and a lot more growth I fall into the latter category or maybe some of my conservative friends don't I Know where Donald Trump falls on this Donald Trump believes that the number one priority is

fake narratives and conspiracy theories make it from the far right corners of the Internet to mainstream conversation or even the president's Twitter feed\nThis question carries new urgency after the events of recent days after a gunman killed eleven people in the Pittsburgh synagogue over the weekend\nThe suspect wasn't active user of the social media sites gap where he posted his anti Semitic thoughts gab bills itself as a free speech alternative to Facebook and Twitter and is hardly the first place on the Internet where anti Semitism white nationalism and other extreme ideology spread\nWe spoke earlier this morning to will summer who thinks about all this a lot he reports on fringe right wing media for the Daily Beast and he's actually tracked how conspiracy theories gain traction\nEither will there haven't been so what's a good example of how this works a shirt so for example I mean ...\nThe most obvious example right now is the the care of and the so called caravan coming out of Honduras or this is a the idea that this was some big men as a you know an invading hoard a it is something that really sort of bubbled up ah on on the dark as a edges of the right wing Internet\nOr with a lot of sort of hoaxes behind that and I you know they've been pushing this idea for a couple of months now and it's only really this month it's caught on so much so that the president is now sending troops to fight off that sort of non existent invasion\nNow I mean of course the president with they sending the military somewhere is a very important decision but but you're you're saying that you've been able to actually track this that the idea that this caravan is a menace was on some of these fringe sites and you could watch at work its way into the conversation and and sort of mainstream politics absolutely\nPeople don't a analyses of this that show sort of like a you know starting on various Facebook pages read it accounts for Chad with which is a pro Trump Internet forum all these places and it it kind of hit the hit the me up and the message\nAnd then just in in the past week or two it really has caught on a you know a a representative Matt gates from Florida was one of the big promoters of it and then from there it really took off\nAre there are other examples where you've actually seen these sort of there's work their way as as high as you know top officials even the White House yeah\nI I think some of the most fascinating stuff happens when these weird hoaxes and conspiracy theories affect the actual policy so ah the president or claimed after twenty sixteen election that he had lost the popular vote because three million illegal votes were cast\nAnd you can draw a pretty direct line to that from that too and infowars article that had originally made that claim and then that claim then goes on to his part of the president to create the presidential voter fraud commission [noise] what\nWhat what who does something about this if if anyone I mean if if these conspiracy theories are not true if if some or all or many of them are not based on fact to rains as soon as the job of of the press to knock these things down should fall the social media platforms to regulate what's being shared their\nYou know I I think it's an incredibly thorny issue I mean we've seen in the past when at a press rise to fact check things you often end up amplifying the hoaxes and spreading them around and you aren't really convincing the people who believe in them already a you know at this point I think people are kind of decided the ball is in the court of the social media companies\nBut you know they've been very reluctant to step in understandably into adjudicating political controversies so it it I think it's very sticky issue I think the companies right now are airing more on the side of a uh banning people and stuff like that and they were in the past\nAre we seeing a lot more than than we used to or has has always been going I mean it seems like something that is\nReally accelerated obviously we've had conspiracy theories for decades and ... and even before that a but it it is really accelerated with social media and also I think ah the Internet and social media allows people to connect and reinforced one another's belief in a way they couldn't really in real life\nWill summer reports on fringe right wing media for the Daily Beast joining us this morning in our studios in Washington where we really appreciate it ethics rather than\nPolitical odds makers identified dozens of congressional districts that are in play as it's said could go either way and will determine which party wins the house this fall\nOne of those seats is the second district of Maine it's voters supported President Trump in two thousand sixteen but supported President Obama just four years before that let's travel there with NPR's Brian Naylor\nThe second district of Maine stretches across a vast swaths of the state with deeply wooded forests and small fishing villages mostly rural it's not just the main of lobsters and light houses but more hard Scrabble with shuttered mills and one of the worst opioid problems in the nation Democrats think it could swing blue again\nOne afternoon last week their candidate Jared Golden greeted workers at the afternoon shift change at the ... paper mill in Jay\n... is a thirty six year old former marine who signed up after nine eleven and served two tours in Afghanistan and Iraq in an interview at a nearby hospital golden said his top issue is health care\nIf you go back to May of two thousand Seventeen with the Republican effort to repeal the SEA a very deep cuts to Medicaid contained in that House bill and then consider the fact that there's talk when voted for that though\nGolden wants to extend Medicare coverage to people age fifty five and believes there should eventually be universal coverage\nThat position has been attacked by Republican income and Bruce pollock when in TV ads like this one radical gold medal of government control your health care ending Medicare as we know it still blink taxes we reached out to public ... campaign repeatedly for an interview but got no response\nThe sixty four year old is running for his third term as the only remaining Republican in the house from New England in a debate earlier this month he cited his votes to lower taxes and cut regulations well accusing golden of being in the pocket of democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and others\nI'll tell you what I really object you is all of this on a state money by Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters and all these dark money groups that are pouring money in here are trying to convince the people in Maine and attacked me and say I'm some you know not\nGolden has repeatedly asserted he will not vote for below sea for speaker saying it's time for new leadership in that same debate public when whom Trump endorsed for reelection in ... refused to state whether he voted for Trump in twenty sixteen\nThat's my business I work with everybody Republicans and Democrats as a business professional but I Do not tell anybody way before\nI ask golden if he thinks Democrats should serve as a check on Trump if they win the majority I don't\nView my role as resistance I like to say I'm a marine no better friend no worst enemy if the president does something helps Maine I'm with him if he does something her main I'm going to stick up for our state", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "30"}
