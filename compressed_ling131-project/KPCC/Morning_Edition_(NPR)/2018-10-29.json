don't want to bring in NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson are either Mario Hi there David so talk me through how Donald Trump is responding I'm In the wake of of you know yet another mass shooting\nWhile you heard some of his words he\nMade a lot of unifying comments he called the act evil he read some very powerful statements and a couple of events he had over the weekend and then he went back to business as usual which in this case one week before election day means partisan political attacks and trying to energize his base he\nEven complained that\nThe focus at least on the pipe bomb or which was the incident that the assassination attempt of many democratic official former Democratic officials that he's attacked that preceded the Pittsburgh shooting\nRight in a way I could just being right to complain\nThat the focus on that had taken away from them and men Tim that Republicans were getting in the election he literally said inflamed\nThat was losing political momentum yeah some of these things\nYes because of the pipe bomb or the the the focus of the media on the pipe bomber\nWhat I mean this this is not a president who really seems to embrace the role of consoling achieved so maybe some of what you're saying is is not that surprising what what do we see from from that decision of his\nIt's not surprising he doesn't see his role\nAs previous presidents have as a moral leader he doesn't seem to think his role is just sues and he'll after a violent incident like this and this really isn't in his political repertoire you know words really matter a president's words matter more than anyone else's because he has the biggest\nMegaphone and he has the most moral authority if he chooses to embrace it but\nThese are the moments when the president has in the past done them worst with the public at large\nDropped after Charlottesville in his famous comments about how both ... they were good people on both sides and the division is the kind of scorched earth political rhetoric\nThe belittling in demonizing of his opponents that really works with his base and he even asked his supporters at a rally over the weekend do you want me to tone it down is that okay and they all said no\n... well I mean the midterms are now eight days away you say that he maybe he is his base likes what he's saying but I mean ... has have these events changed or the campaign and then the whole political context here\nWe don't know this election has been very steady in that the trend lines have been\nConstant house seems to be leaning towards the Democrats the Senate seems to be leaning towards some Republican pickups but now you've got a whole bunch of new things injected into the debate gun control the president said that maybe there should have been armed guards in the synagogue the mayor of Pittsburgh the governor of Pennsylvania said no\nMaybe it will make more people wanting a check and balance on the president it also increases the sense of chaos people don't feel safe\nOr what does that do to the election\nAll right NPR's Mara Liasson with Richard Muller thank you ... what\nAre Brazil has elected a new president ... an hour ago and he is from the far right [noise]\nFireworks celebrations outside the president elect's home in Rio de Janeiro and those celebrations continued deep into the night after the retired army captain sailed the victory of yesterday's runoff election he takes office on the first of January\nAnd this can be a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy and NPR's Philip Reeves joins us from Rio either Phil Hi so you have reported among many things that the bows and arrows or an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled this country for just over two decades ... what\nWhat conclusions can we draw from from this moment in this victory\nI think David we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that ... could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party\nWho govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption the sickest crime and the un for the restoration of national pride and I took that you know helps explain why both NATO defeated the workers' party candidate Fernando ... so comprehensively\nI should say though that both NATO himself insists the survival of democracy is not an issue here last night again he promised to defend the constitution but he has said a lot of alarm bells ringing I mean the level of Atkinson was clear yesterday when the president Brazil's Supreme Court said\nEnough to his he read how puff of the constitution to report is about the need for the future president to respect democracy and the rule of law yeah it's unusual\nThere's another thing ... this record of making sexist and racist homophobic remarks and you know you'd think that would have been seriously damaging for him but\nHis supporters tend to dismiss these jokes as as a joke so oh they blame it on fake news all they just say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a a leader who is competent ... corrupt\nFor example here's Kevin ... without a lawyer aged forty two who I spoke to outside both not as ...\nHe's rainy on that he's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any racism I don't believe that I think he really puts dye\nOkay so so there is a supporter of both in our oh um I mean you say that many people are overlooking the potential threat to democracy that some of his critics see he is saying that he's going to fight corruption is going to fight violent crime a lot of Brazilians really care about those things does have a plan\nWhat he wants to know how the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use lethal force against suspects and that's already extremely common here especially in the poor mostly black neighborhoods weather's a war over the narcotics trade\nLast year there were six sixty four thousand homicides in Brazil and there's an epidemic of robberies and against people against banks trucks and Brazilians of sick of it and I think that's a big reason why so many voted for both NATO\nLast night I visited Brazil's largest for that I could see now people that are very worried as I found out when I spoke to Luis Fernando to power a managed twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worried about it most of the people are especially the poor people than men are the\nOne thing we can

C. President Trump is thrust a caravan of migrants to the center of the Republican election campaign though it is still far from the U.S border\nThe care of Amazon Mexican soil and our next guest represents the country with responsibility for just now Iran will go to the artist is Mexico's ambassador to the United states ambassador good morning\nGood morning Steve I I Want to begin with the facts here seven thousand or so people which is a lot of people looks like a lot on TV but I Do know it's part of this much larger somewhat ordinary flow of migrants so how serious situation is this and the view of your government\nWell what we're facing cures devious re jak humanitarian crisis the Mexican government response has been basically two things urging people to enter in compliance with immigration law to Mexico and then F offering refugee status to all those people from Central America to request that including\nHeld out services education and an identification what the Mexican Government wants to assure is that movement and whatever migrations takes place it's legal it's safe and it sort of\nThe impression from here was that the migrants did not in the end followed Mexicans Mexico's immigration laws there was an effort to stop them at the border with Guatemala and and the and the government more or less let the man is that right\nWe have a meeting trying to avoid at all costs violence in the border unfortunately some of the people in the ... have been very violent against authority even though that they have offered the possibility of entering in compliance with immigration and refugee status or police there seem to uphold our laws\nThere's for essence of the human rights commission on ... of Mexico and also several NGOs that can testify to the fact that the police has acted appropriately but nevertheless we want to make sure that our laws are enforced you\nOffered them refugee status I Believe you said and yeah the leader of this group seemed from terrorists Without Borders that is involved in organizing this caravan\nSeemed dubious of that offer and indicated their suspicion that the majority of people who are invited to apply for asylum but ultimately be rejected and deported is that actually what tends to happen with a sign of\nOut of ah the the number that we have is our on three thousand five hundred people\nAre out of those um we have one thousand eight hundred and Ninety five people that have requested a ... percent that a request for refugees that those\nOne thousand four hundred and thirty five of them are being processed and about a four hundred and twenty two have actually been repatriated to the states so right now it's unclear I think that a lot of them will in fact end up requesting to stop those because it's a very generous offer on the part of a Mexican ...\nI'm just going through those numbers first you said thirty five hundred you believe this caravan to be about thirty five hundred people\nYes it's smaller that some of the numbers that have been a a thrown out there that the official number for us it's the old around three thousand of them are in the states of Japanese language factor\nThe carbon was a little bit bigger but I'm Around two thousand us I mention of foreign original pro through five thousand have already a percent that their requests for refugee status\nOr this has important in front of us perspective investor because you're saying the caravan of smaller than reported and it's getting smaller over time as some of them except refugee status there aren't actually that many people heading for the U.S anymore\nWell as some of them are cheerleading tend to get to the U.S and we have close corporation where you are so far these two kinds of this in the best possible way but I Do have to say that the official figures of the people that are still in the car and such is around three thousand five hundred a little bit less perhaps\nAnd around two thousand of the original group have already requested a refugee status in Mexico and these these situation continues to evolve and uh obviously being monitored by Mexican authorities and asks appropriate in coordination with U.S authorities again we want to assure\nWe have a humanitarian crisis in our hands but we want to assure that uh these these can vote that migration is scandal legally safe in order to be\nThe best ... thanks very much for the time really appreciate it on the contrary Steve thank you for this space around them over the years as Mexico's ambassador to the United states\nThe

after taking off from Jakarta on a domestic flight authorities say there are one hundred eighty nine people on board there is no word yet on their fate among the passengers were about twenty Indonesian officials who are returning from a conference in Jakarta\nOr who are really struggling with a how to make sense of what had happened\nUm and I think the message to them was to double down on our commitment to love and to a as Dr King said or not try and drive out hate with hate only love can do that\nAnd you know David want you to remember that this massacre was perpetrated by a person who's not only anti Semitic and hated Jews but he targeted this synagogue because they had had refugee ship but they were working with highest which is a historic Jewish Agency that are resettled refugees from all over the world not just Jewish refugees Muslim refugees Christian refugees\nAnd it was a commitment that the synagogue had made to welcome asylum seekers and migrants and so I think the message is we as Jews look outward and welcome all people with love and open arms and we're going to continue to fight for the widow and a stranger and the orphan and all those who are suffering in our midst\nI just think about this I mean it's been more than a year now since Charlottesville and the unite the Right rally in and there were people infamously chanting Jews will not replace us I'm now we have this uh what what are you learning in these moments about anti Semitism in the United states of America\nAnd let's not forget David that in Charlottesville\nAre not many people don't remember that that same morning three of those white nationalist neo Nazi thugs stood outside the local synagogue in Charlottesville with assault rifles threatening so what we saw as threatening of gun violence a year ago has now become a massacre with gun violence\nSo the two conclusions I draw our that words matter and rhetoric and kind of this climate of bigoted rhetoric matters and when the right and the kind of a a ice into the right wing extremists on all sides getting Bolden when white supremacists get involved and then they turn to action\nAnd the plague of gun violence in our country this is what the students were outraged about these are the same students who after the Parkland shooting a mobilized and the march for our lives and have been working on this upcoming election\nAnd they in tears said to me rabbi has nothing changed since Parkland and I had to reassure them that the arc of history as long as Dr King taught that bends towards justice\nAre you optimistic that we can grow from this I Believe deeply in the power of this country to overcome all of the evil forces that would bring us down my grandma Fannie came here when she was sixteen years old from Russia\nOr as a sixteen year old migrant a refugee with nothing and she came here because she knew that America would be the land of opportunity for all people and I I Do believe that that

California's Central valley it's an agricultural region the source of half the fruit nuts and vegetables eating in America\nAnd also home to congressman Devin Nunes us but ac policy is not what drives his national profile the Republican who was seeking reelection is chairman of the house intelligence committee known for his defense of President Trump and criticism of special counsel Robert Mueller NPR's Tim Mak has more\nIn twenty sixteen Devin Nunes has won reelection by thirty five percentage points now the East German Republican is in for the tightest race of his political life polls taken in the last few months suggests it could be a single digit race\nHe made a decision that you can pretty much what he wants and ignore local concerns if he just nationalize this whole race\nThat's Liz ... a Republican who runs the swamp Accountability Project and his opposing unit as part of her organizations effort to protect Mueller's Russia investigation the big question in this race is whether a congressman can run primarily on national stature all paying little attention to local issues\nHe's national profile is a double edged sword though he's raised a tremendous amount of money Nunez\nHis unwavering supportive Trump has put a spotlight on him that he's never had before in the district constituents care deeply about agriculture immigration and water but ... has spent much of his time focused on criticizing Muller and blocking additional investigations into potential Trump Russia ties\nTo Russia issue is relevant in so far as uh it takes away the political capital that he has known to Washington to focus on what people care about here\nThat's known as his opponent Andrew Janz who says he's the one who can give local representation to the district\nI think that this rate is about taking back the Central Valley\nJams has received about twenty percent of his campaign funds from outside his state according to open secrets newness has received more than half of his money from outside California mayor who lives in Virginia received a fundraising appeals from noon as California congressional campaign and provided NPR a copy it\nIs your general contribution from Virginia is exactly what I Need right now to push back on the constant attacks in the radical left\nMeanwhile newness has also been hard to reach for ordinary constituents he is not held a town hall since before the last election even Michael demand you will junior a prominent Nunez supporter and a local business leader told NPR that he disagreed with this\nI think public officials should be should be accessible to their constituents um I Know he doesn't ... personally doesn't enjoy that environment much um I think though the hostility directed him from around the country has made it a lot easier for them to say no to do in these\nNeither Nunez his campaign nor his congressional office responded to an interview request and when NPR tried to visit his taxpayer funded office in the most populated region of his district it was closed and an staffed at two pm on a weekday\nPhone calls to that office go straight to voice mail the only other office in that district is a forty five minute drive away\nAnd so one of the criticisms of constituents than he is not accessible\nThat's Lisa Brian and professor at Fresno state which is in the district\nI think if you are at loyal constituent and or a donor to his campaign that he ... he does you know fundraiser dinners and things like that however if as a regular constituent you want to go to his office and speak to somebody a staffer in his office um it's very difficult\nWell he's not holding public events he's blanketing the airwaves with attack ads and even producing alternative\nUnder the newness will do my very first bond Nunez\nEven picked a fight with his local newspaper the Fresno Bee\nThe bees editorial board declined to endorse him for the first time in sixteen years after he refused to meet with them\nIn an unprecedented move Nunez produced a forty page high end glossy magazine that suggests that the newspaper is after him because of their suppose it communists sympathies his supporters are with him on this here's your manual again\nI mean I was in the valley my whole life except for six years ago I stopped taking the paper that shows\nIs a unique strategy in this contentious mid term cycle so well

afternoon for Robert Ballard accused of opening fire on um Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday killing eleven people officials say he frequently posted anti Semitic comments and means on the social networking site and gab\nOr who are really struggling with a how to make sense of what had happened um and I think the message to them was to double down on our commitment to love and to a as Dr King said or not try and drive out hate with hate only love can do that\nThat you know David once you'd remember that this massacre was perpetrated by a person who's not only anti Semitic and hated Jews but he targeted this synagogue because they had had refugee ship but they were working with highest which is a historic Jewish Agency that are resettled refugees from all over the world not just Jewish refugees Muslim refugees Christian refugees\nAnd it was a commitment that the synagogue had made to welcome asylum seekers and migrants and so I think the message is we as Jews look outward and welcome all people with love and open arms and we're going to continue to fight for the widow and a stranger and the orphan and all those who are suffering in our midst I just think about\nThis I mean it's been more than a year now since Charlottesville and the unite the Right rally in and there were people infamously chanting Jews will not replace us I'm now we have this uh what what are you learning in these moments about anti Semitism in the United states of America\nLet's not forget David that in Charlottesville\nAre not many people don't remember that that same morning three of those white nationalist neo Nazi thugs stood outside the local synagogue in Charlottesville with assault rifles threatening so what we saw as threatening of gun violence a year ago has now become a massacre with gun violence\nSo that to conclusions I draw our that words matter and rhetoric and kind of this climate of bigoted rhetoric matters and when the right and the kind of a a I should say the right wing extremists on all sides get embolden when white supremacists get embolden then they turn to action\nAnd the plague of gun violence in our country this is what the students were outraged about these are the same students who after the Parkland shooting a mobilized on the march for our lives and they've been working on this upcoming election\nAnd they in tears said to me rabbi has nothing changed since Parkland and I had to reassure them that the arc of history as long as Dr King taught but bans towards justice\nAre you optimistic that we can grow from this I Believe deeply in the

Project and his opposing Nunez as part of her organizations effort to protect Mueller's Russia investigation the big question in this race is whether a congressman can run primarily on national stature all paying little attention to local issues\nHe's national profile is a double edged sword though he's raised a tremendous amount of money Nunez his unwavering support of Trump has put a spotlight on him that he's never had before\nIn the district constituents care deeply about agriculture immigration and water but ... spent much of his time focused on criticizing Muller and blocking additional investigations into potential Trump Russia ties\nWith Russia issue is relevant in so far as uh it takes away the political capital that he has known Washington to focus on what people care

Moore manual junior a prominent Nunez supporter and a local business leader told NPR that he disagreed with this\nI think public officials should be should be accessible to their constituents um I Know he doesn't he personally doesn't enjoy that environment much um I think though the hostility directed him from around the country has made it a lot easier for them to say no to do in these\nNeither known as his campaign nor his congressional office responded to an interview request and when NPR tried to visit his taxpayer funded office in the most populated region of his district

America has announced that she will not seek another term as chancellor and also not seek reelection as head of\nHer Christian Democratic party that as opposed to you held for Eighteen years and the decision to step aside signals the beginning of the end of Merkel's political career and tenure as the most powerful woman in European politics NPR surprised or hunting Nelson as one of our correspondents based in Europe she has covered much of Merkel's political career and joins me now has ...\nGood morning David so significant moment here medical speaking of the nation about her decision what what is your saying\nShe she sounded very steady and she looked a little sad but she said that she said before she was not born chancellor\nA that it has been a daily honor but also a daily challenge to serve as a chancellor for the past Thirteen Years and as head of her party for the last Eighteen but then it was time to to move aside to listen to what citizens had to say uh and and that is that they have a lack of faith in her government on and so she's stepping aside to make room for the next generation\nY feel like I'm you and I have talked um countless times about miracle on some of the challenges and calling her times embattled I mean she and her government have been in trouble since she was welcoming refugees to Germany in large numbers back in twenty Fifteen rights away the evil wise why we arrived at this moment now with different\nWell there's been a steady chipping away at her support uh basically on a national level but also in regional elections is this really dogged her and her party and her allies ah especially ah the the most recent ones we can talk about last night's election or or yesterday's election I should say and has\nA which is where Frank for is the big financial center\nAnd also two weeks before of area some serious losses where in last night's or the count basically her party barely is hanging on to power with a coalition of greens\nAre and in the area they I mean it's it's also really shaken up the the the variant allies of Mrs ... which are uh the the Christian social union members have been Marian ... conservatives if you will\nSimon she's been so central to European politics it's hard to imagine European politics without her I mean what what is the reaction so far this this is\nWell the ah the stocks have gone down I mean this is something that's definitely going to send a very strong ripple effect across Europe people or are they knew this was coming but again she had never announced that until today so this is going to make it very difficult for Brussels for example to push through a its plans to try to integrate the union more\nUh this is probably not going to help the the breakfast situation those negotiating that are going on I mean she is the strongest leader there and she's also been someone who's helped forge consensus and she's an incredibly we can position now even though technically what she's saying is this isn't going to happen until twenty Twenty one you know she's not going to seek re election until ... in twenty Twenty one and that she's\nBasically going to remain in power until uh until then but it and she's a lame duck at this point\nAny talk of who are likely successor might be\nWell even though she hasn't really said who she wants on what what political insiders have told various media a is a hurt the city you general secretary unemployed come ... she's a fifty six year old\nWho's who's someone who many would like to see take her place but they're also other people like the health minister was much more conservative and actually a good friend of the U.S ambassador to Berlin\nA and also a an an a political opponent of her as the least match who has not been in in

synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday is due in court this afternoon Robert ... murder and hate crime charges that could carry the death penalty NPR's Brian Mann reports\nUh who are really struggling with a how to make sense of what had happened um and I think the message to them was to double down on our commitment on to love and to a as Dr King said not try and drive out hate with hate only love can do that\nAnd you know David want you to remember that this massacre was perpetrated by a person who's not only anti Semitic and hated Jews but he targeted this synagogue because they had had refugee about they were working with highest which is a historic Jewish Agency that are resettled refugees from all over the world not just Jewish refugees Muslim refugees Christian refugees\nAnd it was a commitment that the synagogue had made to welcome asylum seekers and migrants and so I think the message is we as Jews look outward and welcome all people with love and open arms and we're going to continue to fight for the widow and a stranger and the orphan and all of those who are suffering in our midst\nI just think about this I mean it's been more than a year now since Charlottesville and the unite the Right rally in and there were people infamously chanting Jews will not replace us I'm now we have this uh what what are you learning in these moments about anti Semitism in the United states of America\nAnd let's not forget David that in Charlottesville\nAre not many people don't remember that that same morning three of those white nationalist neo Nazi thugs stood outside the local synagogue in Charlottesville with assault rifles threatening so what we saw as threatening of gun violence a year ago has now become a massacre with gun violence\nSo the two conclusions I draw our that words matter and rhetoric and kind of this climate of bigoted rhetoric matters and when the right and the kind of a a I should say the right wing extremists on all sides get embolden when white supremacists get emboldened then they turn to action\nAnd the plague of gun violence in our country this is what the students were outraged about these are the same students who after the Parkland shooting a mobilized on the march for our lives and have been working on this upcoming election\nAnd they in tears said to me rabbi has nothing changed since Parkland and I had to reassure them that the arc of history as long as Dr King taught but bands towards justice\nAre you optimistic that we can grow from this I Believe deeply in the power of this country to overcome all of the evil forces that would bring us down my grandma Fannie came here when she was sixteen years old from Russia\nOr as a sixteen year old migrant and refugee with nothing and she came here because she knew that America would be the land of opportunity for all people and I I Do believe that that statue of liberty meant something to her and is inspirational to us today\nRabbi joined up has no director of the religious action center of reform Judaism um thank you so much\n...\nWe go next to California's Central valley it's an agricultural region the source of half the fruit nuts and vegetables eaten in America\nAnd also home to congressman Devin Nunes but act policy is not what drives us national profile the Republican who was seeking reelection is chairman of the house intelligence committee known for his defense of President Trump and criticism of special counsel Robert Mueller NPR's Tim Mak has more\nIn twenty sixteen Devin Nunes has won reelection by thirty five percentage points now the East German Republican is in for the tightest race of his political life pulse taken in the last few months suggest it could be a single digit race\nHe made a decision that he can pretty much what he wants and ignore local concerns if he just nationalized whole race\nThat's live near a Republican who runs the swamp Accountability Project and his opposing Nunez as part of her organizations effort to protect Mueller's Russia investigation the big question in this race is whether a congressman can run primarily on national stature all paying little attention to local issues\nHe's national profile is a double edged sword though he's raised a tremendous amount of money Nunez his unwavering support of Trump has put a spotlight on him that he's never had before\nIn the district constituents care deeply about agriculture immigration and water but ... has spent much of his time focused on criticizing Muller and blocking additional investigations into potential Trump Russia ties\nWith Russia issue is relevant in so far as uh it takes away the political capital that he has known Washington to focus on what people care about here\nThat's known as his opponent Andrew Janz who says he's the one who can give local representation to the district\nI think that this rate is about taking\nAt the Central Valley well Jim says received about twenty percent of his campaign funds from outside his state according to open secrets newness has received more than half of his money from outside California\nMare who lives in Virginia received a fundraising appeal from Nunez is California congressional campaign and provided NPR a copy\nIt reads your generous contribution from Virginia is exactly what I Need right now and push back on the constant attacks and the radical left\nMeanwhile newness has also been hard to reach for ordinary constituents he is not held a town hall since before the last election even Michael Moore manual junior a prominent new supporter and a local business leader told NPR that he disagreed with this\nI think public officials should be should be accessible to their constituents um I Know he doesn't ... personally doesn't enjoy that environment much um I think those of hostility directed him from around the country has made it a lot easier for them to say no to do in these\nNeither known as his campaign nor his congressional office responded to an interview request and when NPR tried to visit his taxpayer funded office in the most populated region of his district it was closed an staffed at two pm on a weekday\nPhone calls that office go straight to voice mail the only other office in that district is a forty five minute drive away\nAnd so one of the criticisms of constituents has been he is not acceptable\nThat's Lisa Bryan that professor at Fresno state which is in the district\nI think if you are it loyal constituent and or a donor to his campaign that he'd accessible he does you know fundraiser dinners and things like that however if as a regular constituent you want to go to his office and speak to somebody staffer in his office um it's very difficult\nWell he's not holding public events he's blanketing the airwaves with attack ads and even producing alternative\nUnder the new to move into my very first bond Nunez\nEven picked a fight with his local newspaper the Fresno Bee\nThe bees editorial board declined to endorse him for the first time in sixteen years after he refused to meet with them\nIn an unprecedented move newness produced the forty page high end glossy magazine that suggests that the newspaper is after him because of their suppose it communists sympathies his supporters are with him on this here's your manual again\nI mean a lot with them as valley my whole life except for six years there are stopped taking the regime\nIs a unique strategy in this contentious mid term cycle so well known as has traditionally posted to victory his views on Russia
