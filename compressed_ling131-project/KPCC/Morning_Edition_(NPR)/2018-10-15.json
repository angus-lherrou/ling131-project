Jackie Northam\n[noise]\nHarvard University faces a lawsuit this morning\nRight this is a high stakes legal action it could affect the future of affirmative action in university admissions and this case is different than other lawsuits that challenge preferences for underrepresented minorities this lawsuit is on behalf of Asian Americans and the charge that Harvard gave preferences to white Kirk\nCarapezza in Boston member station WBUR GBH is here either Kurt hey good morning to sue to bound and who's filing up\nThe suit was filed by students for fair admissions it and it claims Harvard capped the number of qualified Asian American applicants by using personal ratings and in court over the next two to three weeks the group will need to prove that Harvard is intentionally rejecting applicants because their Asian because of their race\nI just want to solve it was like a nuisance yes students for fair admissions who could possibly be against that but this is a group with a particular point of view on the world right\nYes this group is led by conservative legal strategist Edward Blum you've filed previous a lawsuit against the University of Texas University of North Carolina I spoke with attorney we'd Chang he's with the Asian American legal foundation which is supporting the philosophy of change is Chinese American and he's also a Harvard graduate\nHarvard systematically saying that Asian candidates are not like a bull in our and don't have good personalities by orders of magnitude less than candidates of any other ethnic group which is really nothing but racist it perpetuates and feeds and create stereotypes\nI guess we should explain this kept saying that candidates are not likeable what they're referring to here is a kind of personal characteristics test or a evaluation that people are given when they apply that has affected the number of agents whites or anybody else who goes in hottest Harvard respond to that\nHarvard says there's been no discrimination against Asian American applicants points out Asian Americans now account for twenty three percent of all the students at a higher an event in Detroit last month I caught up with the Harvard's new president Larry back out and he defended the colleges admissions process\nNobody wants to be judged on their numbers alone\nHe will understand and recognize that we learn from our differences\nThat creating a diverse learning environment enriches the learning experience for every student on Capitol\nAnd feedback out told me that what's at stake here is Harvard and higher educations ability to create that diverse environment which he says the central to its mission\nAnd Harvard is defending this how I rely on understand there's just a little bit when we say that that twenty three percent of the student\nBody is Asian the accusation is that Asians would\nBe an even higher percentage if it were not for this personal characteristics test is that right\nRight if you just focus on academics in test scores alone Asian Americans would would would be significant larger proportion of the number of students at at Harvard\nAnd how significant is it correct that the Trump Administration has weighed in in favor of the plaintiffs here\nRight the Justice Department filed a brief in support of the lawsuit saying Harvard's admissions process quote may be infected with racial bias there in Boston judge Alison boroughs who presided over the case she was nominated by President Obama a she's the same judge who blocked President Trump's executive order designed to ban refugees and immigrants from seven predominantly\nMuslim countries she's really known for her independence streak so I don't think she'll be swayed by the Justice Department or the Trump Administration or any other political agenda\nNevertheless a pretty dramatic case Kirk thanks very much thank you Steve Kirk Carapezza double your GBH and Boston\n[noise]\nOkay it's Monday which means we are two days from a big Brexit summit and talks between the United kingdom and the European Union are stalled\nThey are the prime minister of the ... is holding a cabinet meeting tomorrow there is the threat that some of the members might resign over this the political party that's propping up her fragile government at this point says walking away from the European Union with out a deal is quote probably inevitable\nNPR's Frank Langfitt will never walk away from the story is on the line from London once again either fried absolutely nuts is already so how is this how does go over the weekend\nWell the big problem is we've talked about many times the is is you know how does the u._k. leave the EU without creating a hard border on the island of Ireland and this is so contentious ... working solution is actually just to postpone a solution to kick the can down the road that's her best idea at this point\nAnd have the you can continue to operate inside the use customs area\nSo wouldn't eat customs checks between Northern Ireland and the republic of Ireland which is of of the Northern Ireland of course as a part of the u._k. but do you and you can't can't agree on how long this customs arrangement would expire and that's one of the main reasons that talks collapse of this weekend\nA I guess we should just remember so Britain is still for the moment is part of the European Union which means there are open borders people can travel from place to place they can live\nFrom one place to another and the latest idea is that for at least a little while if the British can get the Europeans to go along they would continue to lead goods move across those borders\nExactly well well at least across the island of Ireland yes and in fact yeah the u._k. would actually stay in the customs union the problem with that though is for breakfast ears they say you know they're afraid that this is going to go on forever and this is actually a way that could undermine the whole idea of ... that would never happen\nI'm also they want to be able to get out of the soon as possible because one of their big pitches back in two thousand and a sixteen during the referendum is they would uh cut new trade deals with other countries and this would actually reinvigorate a help the economy here I'm In the United kingdom\nThe bottom line is that um analysts they may just can't get an open ended customs arrangement through her own parliament so she's basically having problems in the un problems back here\nWhile so we're still in a place where Britain's Theresa May does not have enough of her own conservative party on the same page that she can go to the Europeans and say we're committed to whatever proposal were just brought you\nYeah and that's and that's part of the problem and and and I think particularly the idea of this open ended customs arrangement\nIs just not flying here David Davis he's a former Brexit secretary he resigned earlier not too long ago in row test he's calling for cabinet rebellion against May's plan Northern Ireland democratic union party\nThere propping up a prime minister May's government they're also against this plan and if they pull out they could cripple the government by refusing to vote on any big bills you wouldn't be able to get anything done\nAnd and as the ... the prime minister getting consensus on this so far is proving nearly impossible what happens over the next couple of days that\nWell I think what we're going to see is a see how the cap that response tomorrow I mean is there are open dissent to people threatened to resign I think that the next step\nMay will fly to Brussels on Wednesday um but there are no talks plan between now and then so it seems like it would be much harder to get an agreement there still

Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin Neil Armstrong was meticulous calculated any Apollo eleven mission where everything could go wrong Armstrong thought of every contingency plan but the one thing he didn't prepare for was sitting at the kitchen table to tell his boys he might not make it home\nTo me like even when you get down to me\n[noise]\nWhen we're not sure we're going to get on to them on a\nLot of things have to go right before that happens they think they're coming back we as a real confidence in the mission and are\nWe have every intention of coming back but you know\nRyan Gosling plays the stoic Neil Armstrong and the new film first man it's directed by Damien ... out you also did la la land and whiplash\nAnd first man she has held brings new words right inside the loud claustrophobic spacecraft that carried a crew to the moon seemingly impossible journey that birds on reckless\nI think it was one thing that struck me the most when I saw some of these aircrafts in space capsules in person was how\nSmall and rickety they looked they looked like a sardine cans you know and and um the technology is so crude looking and so analog I'm so there is a beauty in that and there's also something terrifying and that and I think it actually a ... by honing in on that uh we really wanted to\nHopefully remind audiences are you know that this was in the sort of gilded easy sleek high tech space travel that um they might have been sold to the public this was a really a\nHard and dangerous a labor and if the insanely risky yeah I mean you know they said we're going to go to the moon before they had the technology to do it and they just had faith that they would catch up in time\nAnd the film makes you realize how little the public actually knows about Neil Armstrong demand and this particular loss that you learn about early in the film his infant daughter died of cancer years before he ever went to the man\nI mean it it's the unfathomable tragedy uh but but but in some ways what's even more striking about it is how many people to Neal worked with didn't even though he had ever had a daughter I mean that's how close to the best he\nHe kept that event he and Janet were fiercely private and um I think in many ways the movie especially as we did more and more research the movie kind of shifted in in my mind and I think in Ryan's mine all of our minds from\nFrom a you know sort of mission movie about the race to the moon to a movie about grief and and hoping and Neal's case a man who suffer such a profound loss that\nIn some ways you understand that his thoughts wind up just going to space go into the broader universe and and uh and maybe searching for answers that he just can't find here on earth\nShe Neil Armstrong in almost portrayed as a man pretty typical of his generation in his ability to compartmentalize his emotions was that true of him [noise]\nI I think it was and and um we had to really rely on on people who knew him behind those closed doors people who knew the non public Neal because the public Neal yeah it was pretty reticent in pretty or even seemed reclusive um of course once you get to the private Neal\nUh he was a actually a immensely complicated you know he was capable of\nGoofing off you had a really sly sense of humor and a dry wit he was also capable of a of a real you know almost sort of a scary intensity when it came to the passion with which he attacked his work in his passion for aviation I think we wanted to try to get out of that vulnerability that human qualities so that you you know because\nI think he's become and the collective imagination such a\nPoker face to almost marble statues hero but um\nTo people like his kids he was just that you know and people in the neighborhood he was you know he's the guy down the street\n[noise] because you know the movie has gotten some criticism from some on the conservative side of the political spectrum who have taken issue with the fact that the film doesn't show Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin planting the American flag on a man\nSo let me ask you about that was that an intentional omissions\nA well you know we we don't um at the American flag on the moon you see it clearly in several shots and I think this conversation about the sort of a mission has been happening or exclusively among people who haven't seen the film so I'm just really excited that the movie is opening and\nIn that people can start seeing it and see for themselves what um the tribute I guess that we we tried to to pay in the movie to what was undeniably in American Enterprise and a a group of uh just American heroes I'm\nThe one other thing I'll say though is is that it's it was really important to us to try also to wherever possible focus on the untold story and and things that people didn't see and didn't know and take a very personal subjective angle on these sort of big historical events\nAre in between the things that you read about in the history books and you were actually seen the sort of stuff uh that again hopefully helps tell the human story and help show that you know these are human beings and not a\nMythological figures these were a\nA ordinary people doing the heap as\nWe've been talking I became a hero and an icon but you stop the story before we see that happen in the chronology why did you make that choice to and from where it ends with him kind of that but we don't see him emerged to like the throngs of cheering crowds [noise]\nIt's a um we we know about the sort of a tickertape parades and what not um I was really surprised to learn about this time in quarantine that the astronaut spent right after coming back from\nFrom the moon to get to actually visit back more tendency how small and on glamorous bedrooms word that they stayed and and and uh you know the government buildings and you come back from the moon\nAnd suddenly you're thrust right into the the epitome of the mundane um and I just found that fascinating and it was this tremendous moment of hope that the entire world was given by the moon landing\nBut also just a reminder of the loss that it took to get there it didn't actually feel appropriate maybe is the word to end the movie with just nothing but cheering crowds and and people getting their pictures taken it felt that there had to be some acknowledgement in a way of um just the men's sacrifice and at\nA loss that will never go away but\nWithout which you know we wouldn't have had this tremendous game but the whole world got to benefit from\nAnd he never went up into

NPR News I'm Rachel Martin\nAnd I'm Steve Inskeep when Britain voted on Brexit in two thousand sixteen advocates for that change said there was no downside\nThe u._k. would withdraw from the European Union but the British economy was so big so vital the Europeans would easily negotiate great terms of trade with the British that's what breakfast advocates said that\nNow is prime minister Theresa May prepares to meet European leaders this week was time running out there is a risk of no trade deal at all NPR's Frank Langfitt is covering this story in London either Frank good morning to the how has this story evolving\nWhat's that going very well you know uh basically there were talks over the weekend a dominant ... he's the breakfast actor he flew to Brussels\nAnd couldn't come up with a deal and they're supposed to the premise you may supposed to fly to Brussels on Wednesday with the hope of kind of working this out but it's not going very well and as you're not discussed many times before the big sticking point which was never discussed during that referendum you mentioned\nIs the future of a a border across an eye on the island of Ireland and neither side wants to see a new border um but there's a great concern that that could happen and they can't agree on how to work it out\nBasically with prime minister may would like to do is stay in a customs union with the United kingdom I mean with the ... for a limited time the he doesn't want that they're afraid they want to guarantee there'll be no border and basically the talks are a stalemate\nUs so what they've gotten to is some way to somewhat extend the free trade between Britain and the European\nUnion exactly what they're really doing Steve is frankly honestly kicking the can down the road because this is such a difficult\nProblem to solve all though you also noted that even that proposal or is not something the Europeans are eagle too eager to grab onto no they're not in actually\nHere's the big problem for prime minister may even many members of her party don't like the idea either if you go back to what you're talking about earlier breakfast ears they sold this to people in the United kingdom\nAs it was going to be a brave new trading future for the United kingdom they were going to cut all these new deals with new with other countries like the United states\nIn fact if they stay inside a customs arrangement for a long time that actually would tie their hands they say are they would be still tethered to the European Union and they wouldn't be able to cut these new deals that they say and they insist would be really good for the u._k. economy\nWell are there Brexit fears then saying okay fine great let's just walk away from the European Union with no agreement at all which means we end up with a hard border in Ireland and no real relationship with the Europeans everything has to be started over from scratch\nTheir our breakfast years who say that uh and and even prime minister may has said in the past uh no ... no deal is better than a bad deal and what's happening is we're running out of time here it is possible that there could be other negotiations in November and December but I think the European Union's patience is running\nA and the difficulty for prime minister may is even if she can get a deal with the European Union could you get it through her own parliament ... there's going to be a cabinet meeting tomorrow where it's going to be probably pretty fractious\nAnd there's a there's a rising risk if there would be no ... no deal between the two um and what that would mean certainly the u._k. economy many economists say would be very bad walking away from this enormous markets across the English Channel\nOkay so prime minister may meet tomorrow with her cabinet and then what happens the next day\nWell now we have to see if she'll even fly to Brussels she supposed to fly to Brussels but if they haven't if there haven't been any further talks\nNo further negotiations no progress what's the point of her going she actually flew to Salzburg this was about a month ago and and actually she felt was humiliated by the European Union they didn't like the deal she was offering and kind of center on her way she's not going to risk that again\nSo we're just they'll mate and time is running out remember at the end of march the United kingdom is set to leave the European Union of and there's not a lot of time left to work this out\nFrank always a pleasure talking with your facts happy to do it Steve That's NPR's Frank Langfitt in London\nBoth political parties in this country have a lot at stake this November some Democrats say they're very survival is on the line for President Trump and his Republican allies in Congress the prize on election night is not just to stay in power but to stay relevant NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson reports\nIf Republicans hang onto their majorities in the house and Senate their approach to governing will be validated they can continue to confirm judges take another whacking Obamacare help President Trump shut down the mother investigation on the other hand says former Republican majority leader Eric Cantor\nIf the Republicans are unable to maintain their majority in the house democratic rule no matter who the speaker is will be very much in opposition to a Trump White house\nJust the way the Democrats in Congress President Obama's legislative agenda die the minute canter and his fellow Republicans took over when they won the house in twenty ten\nLike it's no fun to be in perpetual minority I can tell you that and especially in the house where a\nSimple majority gives you almost absolute power to infect the agenda and get bills across for that will greatly affect the ruins of for some who had been at it for a long time and make the decision whether maybe they should retire or not\nCancer things more Republicans will head for the exits if they lose but Karl Rove former top advisor to President George W. Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and embolden there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be emboldened because what if the Democrats taken by narrow margins it will be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts that opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere'll be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could lead congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says that high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November\nOr their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump being base of the party's\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nCommunity actually if you spend a lot of time in your car in Los Angeles you know it's not like Chicago with public transit you're not around people as much though it's nice to hear local issues

that the kingdom is the world's largest oil exporter and they've already talked about if there were any sort of sanctions or any sort of a punishment for Saudi Arabia that they will respond with even bigger ones not oil would most likely be some kind of part of that\nAnd that was this editorial that a lot of people have picked up on it came from the general manager of the official Saudi news channel Al Arabiya\nAnd in it he says that we are just looking at all kinds of measures that would put pressure on the U.S if the U.S was to think about sanctions these could include an oil production cut and that could drive prices up from\nAround eighty dollars a barrel to more than four hundred dollars a barrel now there's no indication that any of this is going to happen but you can imagine that kind of talk is giving the market jitters and it's worrying a lot of people about you know where this might go if it becomes more of a confrontation\nRight and that four hundred dollars a barrel is the in the editorial it's not necessarily what independent analysts are talking about\n[noise] yeah that's right but it points to the kind of rhetoric that Saudi Arabia is already and playing saying look you know first of all we had nothing to do with this but equally if you target us we have the clout to target you\nRemember though that Saudi Arabia messing with its own oil production is also a bit of an angle the kingdom does rely a huge amount\nOn that oil wealth it's trying to also attract foreign money to diversify its economy so it also has a lot to lose both by cutting production\nAnd by upsetting a lot of international investors who it's been trying to lure in the last few months as part of its new reformed more open economy\nThe BBC's ... also my marketplace

looking great which is an economic indicator in itself marketplaces senior economics contributor Chris Farrell is here this morning to you\nGood morning David what do we learn about the state of the economy when we see these housing numbers turn a little bit south\nLet me just give you a couple of quick readings you know the Case Shiller index is is the main home price index has followed by Wall Street home prices are rising less than expected number existing home sales that's declined\nThe exchange traded fund that attracts the home building industry it's down by almost twenty two percent this year so it's not that surprising that the mortgage finance giant Freddie Mac they came out and they predicted that home sales are goons has declined this year\nAnd this is what our central bankers are engineering they're raising interest rates to tap the brakes on a little bit near the brakes criminal\n... we have mortgage rates are nearing five percent so to one extent you would say well okay this is the pause that that refreshes and the central bank is kind of raising these rates for the overall good of the economy but here's the question David and this is a question that's going around Wall Street a lot more these days\nWe have a strong economy it typically in the strongest economy housing market stay strong so is this weakness in the housing market signaling something bigger about the overall economy and less about the fed raising interest rates\nOr can be signaling something about us we consumers I mean many of us have debt and maybe we can't take on more debt we've\nBeen taking on a lot of auto loans we've been taking a lot of credit cards\nStudent loan debt is now one point five trillion dollars so that means to lungs are now the second largest component of household debt after mortgages I mean that's really a striking figure so that's one half of what I think this decline in home prices is telling us people got a lot of debt right now\nAll right so dead but what's the other half of the equation as you see it as\nWell it's low income growth and I think what we're seeing in the housing market is that investors are recognizing that the games in the housing market has simply out ran the income growth and\nInvestors are saying I don't think it's going to change that much I think what this what's happening in the home\nLet's talk about that because the Saudis have wanted to have this narrative of economic opening and reform\nAnd alongside that they wanted to have the appearance of greater openness it's still going to be an absolute monarchy are still going to have certain controls but they wanted women to be driving and wanted to appear to be a little more in line with the way that people have freedom in in other countries\nThat use the royal family no longer thinking that we're well\nTo be honest I think that assessment was perhaps one that was coming out of the U.S over the past year but it's not necessarily accurate that you know conference I haven't been on in his own words never called himself a reformer\nAnd what he does want is economic openness and he is talking about listening social restrictions what he's never talked about is loosening up political restrictions or you know offering any kind of you know more free speech or more political openness and so there has been a crackdown simultaneously on people who have been critical of the kingdom\nAnd some Saudis who are brought in critical of kingdom see this as in line with that\nAnd of course the skillings alleged killing wouldn't be in line with that as well

learn about the state of the economy when we see these housing numbers turn a little bit south\nLet me just give you a couple of quick readings you know the Case Shiller index is is the main home price index has followed by Wall Street home prices are rising less than expected number existing home sales that's declined\nThe exchange traded fund that attracts the home building industry it's down by almost twenty two percent this year so it's not that surprising that the mortgage finance giant Freddie Mac they came out and they predicted that home sales are going to decline this year\nAnd this is what our central bankers are engineering they're raising interest rates to tap the brakes on a little bit near the brakes coming\nRight we have mortgage rates are nearing five percent so to one extent you would say well okay this is the pause that that refreshes and the central bank is kind of raising these rates for the overall good of the economy but here's the question David and this is a question that's going around Wall Street a lot more these days\nWe have a strong economy and typically in the strong economy housing market stay strong so is this weakness in the housing market signaling something bigger about the overall economy and less about the fed raising interest rates\nOr can be signaling something about us we consumers of I mean many of us have debt and maybe we can't take on more debt we've\nBeen taking on a lot of auto loans we've been taking a lot of credit cards student loan debt is now one point five trillion dollars so that means student loans are now the second largest component of household debt after mortgages I mean that's really striking figure so that's one half\nOf what I think this decline in home prices is telling us people got a lot of debt right now\nAll right so dead but what's the other half of the equation as you see it as\nWell it's low income growth and I think what we're seeing in the housing market is that investors are recognizing that the games in the housing market has simply out ran the income growth and\nInvestors are sort of saying I don't think it's going to change that much I think what this what's happening
