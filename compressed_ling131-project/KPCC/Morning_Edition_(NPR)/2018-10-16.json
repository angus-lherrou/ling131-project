state Mike Pompeo was in Saudi Arabia for talks with king selmont in Riyadh\nAt issue the disappearance of Saudi journalist ... he was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in is temple two weeks ago Turkish officials say they fear could show gee was killed in later dismembered inside the consulate\nAnd and as you mentioned earlier this comment about real killers suggest that some kind of effort could be made to find an explanation that doesn't implicate the crown prince\n... trip also emphasizes how very much is at stake here this is a very deep and long lasting and broad relationship between two countries would fundamentally different ideas of human rights in our country\nShould be run the disappearance of this journalist has highlighted that and yet if you are President Trump or who's clearly been leaning toward the Saudis or really any us administration you would have to ask how do you manage the situation given the billions of dollars of investment on long standing military ties and other kinds of ties that are at stake\nRight so let's bring in on that note White House correspondent Tamara Keith who was looking at this from a different view of um a\nTown or why send Mike Pompeo right now\nWell President Trump I didn't have good answers to what happened and uh sending Mike Pompeo is a is a very big signal a that he's taking it seriously a President Trump is under a lot of pressure about this and and sending the secretary of state says\n... you know the president of the United states as he says wants to get to the bottom of it wants to get to the bottom but it's also now a reaffirming and basically out for the Saudi regime giving them an out by suggesting it could be these quote unquote rogue killers\nYet so this is actually a hits on a few things that President Trump does a lot when confronted with difficult or uncomfortable information um if there is an ally or as someone who he is predisposed to light\n'em he will believe their denial or at least he will say he believes they're denial um there are numerous examples of this and and including a most notably a that denials that have come from Latham you're prudent about election interference\nPresident Trump will repeat the denial 'em and often he he'll say he wants to get to the bottom of it it's sort of a catch phrase his and one other thing that he does he throws out wild ideas that are supported by the fact\nThat fits with the course of action that he's hoping to take the outcome that he wants to for instance the four hundred pound man in the basement a hacking the election or\nThe idea that climate change\nCould be real but it could also just fix itself um so you mentioned that\nThe president is under pressure from from Congress on this particular issue but ... I mean does that even matter to him and what kind of pressure we're talking about\nWell it does matter to him because Congress could take action and they could also forced action uh the last late last week or some high level a bipartisan members of the Senate put in a an official request for the global making the Magnitsky Act\nWhich sets a at a clock in motion a for the administration to look into what happened and if it's found that ah that there was a torture or other uh\nOther possible for his desk and yeah if if they will have to put sanctions on those who are deemed to be responsible\nThat also matters to the president because Saudi Arabia while it was a vital ally and important ally is also an extremely unpopular ally the United states and that unpopularity is reflected in\nCongress which can on foreign policy issues from time to time go a different way and the president would like even though Congress has been broadly supportive of whatever the president wants to do\nWell as others have pointed out this is awkward to say the least this was the first is it that the president made as the new uh uh executive in the White House going to visit react NPR's White House correspondent Tamara Keith we also heard from NPR's correspondent based in Istanbul Peter Kenyon thanks to you both You're welcome thank you\n[noise]\nAll right there is this sense among a lot of people that there's a deep divide between rural and urban America that rural America is poor and in declined bald cities in this country in the suburbs are thriving NPR's\nOwn reporting doesn't really bear that out and neither does a new poll from NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation at Harvard's th Chan School of public health\nOppose up today and it finds that rural America looks like a patchwork of economic and social issues better in some places worse than others some areas are struggling others are booming small town of Americans face real challenges according to the study but also have optimism for their future\nNPR south into jak is in the studio with us this morning to talk about this poll thanks for being here\nThanks for having me All right what does the survey find\nSo the thing was that the biggest two issues among rural Americans which might not come as a huge surprise are opioid addiction and the economic situation but what was interesting was that they were on equal footing now we asked people if they personally know someone who struggled with addiction and almost half forty nine percent said yes\nSo we call around and I talked to a woman named Brenda who answered our poll she lives in this tiny Virginia town right on the board of Kentucky and Tennessee\nAnd she says addictions everywhere in her community including in her ... immediate family so here she is\nMy daughter and her has um got Keith on and he walked off color because they couldn't give up his truck\nBernard told me her niece had died of an addiction her nephew that ended in diction its really hit her heart so brand new lives in coal country where the economy's really in distress and there are just aren't there any job opportunities there\nIf you come out of college with a degree or more than likely going to leave this area to find work\nSo she sit by the opioid crisis she's hit by a bad economic situation there but the poll interesting enough despite those issues found that a lot of people are actually optimistic\nYeah and that was that was interesting about half the people we surveyed said they are doing better than their parents were economically at that at their ... their age and even more surprising they expect their kids to be better off financially than they are\nAnd so why why do they believe that well that right I think that's what we found is as Steve mentioned earlier it's a patchwork so despite the problems in coal country a lot of rural areas in this country is actually doing really well the agricultural zones in the Central Valley of California\nIn Iowa the unemployment rates really low the oil patch in North Dakota\nSo I talked to Chris ... and he's an economic forecasts are in Los Angeles and he says rural areas are really tied to one single industry so the industry is doing well the communities probably doing well who\nMight have a coal town and an oil town\nOr the whole town is doing terrible because coal can't compete in this era of cheap natural gas on the other hand because of fracking these rural community sitting on ... are booming and incomes are up dramatically as a result of all that new money flowing into the region for oil exploration and drilling\nSo your outlook when you're in rural America which is just not one thing right going to depend on the ... right yeah exactly so it's pretty complicated\nAll America is made up a lot of different people of different situations NPR's Alison Kojak given us the latest on this new NPR poll thank you so much we appreciate it thanks\nThis is NPR

I made a big announcement as well and they said hey we're going to do a voluntary measure where we ask our companies to um help educate you about your price and we will help\nYou know direct you on our website to information about the benefits and costs of our drug and they're going to put together a Web portal that you can go and look and look at your insurance options and so forth okay so that was a kind of the pharma industry on the offensive during the press call for that um somebody asked hey\nIs there is a possibility for litigation here and the industry didn't say no and I think it's a legitimate question and several law scholars that I spoke with yesterday um did note that this is just asking for litigation\nSo um even if the rules comes into being which you've outlined is kind of a long shot of because of litigation what tools does the Trump Administration is administration how to enforce that\nSo they don't have much at all not really anything in there they say that they're going to put together a list of companies that don't meet the standards and shame um and then they're going to expect the other companies to sue each other or consumers to sue the company so\nNo ... more political than substantive I'm Sarah Jane Tribble senior correspondent with Kaiser Health news thank you so much thank you\n[noise] there is no firm indication that the United states will act against Saudi Arabia for the suspected murder of a journalist but the Saudis may already be paying a price NPR's John Ydstie reports on what it means the businesses are backing away\nTwenty sixteen crown prince Mohammed bin showman Saudi Arabia's affective ruler invited us and global businesses to a conference he unveiled a plan called vision twenty thirty\nHad called for a transition of the Saudi economy away from oil and toward a more diverse market based model and the crown prince invited the companies to participate\nJacob Kirkegaard of the Peterson Institute for international economics says the ... year fair is undermining the crown princes vision mainly that the\nWorld's most advanced than competitive companies come and establish themselves in Saudi Arabia that scenario is fading as the CEOs of large us and global companies one after another announced they will not attend the second vision twenty thirty conference schedule\nBill for next week Jamie diamonds C. E. O. J. P. Morgan Chase has said he won't attend again Jacob Kierkegaard\nI think the fact that as CEO as prominent as you know J. P. Morgan Jamie ... not going to the summit and saying so publicly and linking it to the show the disappearance means that many other CEOs will probably pull out\nTo other prominent Wall Street CEOs Larry fink of black rock and Steve Schwartzman of the Blackstone group also say they won't be attending\nAccording to New York times the trio of CEOs tried but failed to get the Saudis to postpone the conference the CEOs also reportedly failed to convince treasury secretary Steven mission to stay home\nThe ... the allegations along with previous behavior of the crown prince are making companies nervous says Kirkegaard\nHe said remember that back in twenty Seventeen the crown prince rounded up four hundred Saudi princes and business people detained them it's a rich Carlton in Riyadh on corruption charges and force them to pay the government as much as a hundred billion dollars\nI mean he basically sends the signal that the root of law in Saudi Arabia is amiss when you're trying to lure foreign investors into your country that is about the worst signal you could possibly send them\nLike It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep prominent authors meet for dinner in London Tonight they learn which of them received the man Booker Prize for fiction those off for the award include Canadian se a do jog whose novel is Washington Black\nYou know when you're starting a novel you really playing with character and and you're letting them interact and you're seeing what comes of it and at least for me as a writer I really have no idea where my story is going at the outset of it\nAs her novel starts it seems the narrator is not going anywhere it's the Eighteen thirties and he is a boy and slave on the British controlled violent to Barbados he seems likely to be worked to death and sugar cane fields then Washington Black has made an assistant a visiting white male who becomes his friend in a way\nAny true friendship between them is impossible because of a power imbalance in the relationship but it's just too great\nYou have to white Englishman teaches Washington Black to read and draw he's revealed to be an almost super naturally talented artist soaking up knowledge that he was denied as a slave the novelist says she didn't plan for the store to turn out that way\nPart of what I was wanting to explore with this idea of I guess black genius\nAs being something that obviously would have existed back then than you would have people with great gifts but that this is something that would have been snuffed out a very brutally in without much thought\nA friend of mine said that you know we tend to think of slavery in terms of the loss of black bodies\nBut you know we don't really stop so much to think about the loss of of ah [noise]\nOf potential of blacks greatness of black genius\nI have to ask because I'm hearing you saying that you start the novel and don't exactly know where it's going I don't think it's giving away too much to note that\nThis young enslaved man and his older white companion are going to skate Barbados they're going to get out of their uh did you need to get out of there get out of it slave situation as a novelist for your on Saturday\n[noise] it wasn't so much that is that I felt that with this novel when it really wanted to explore was his life posts slavery and to show how [noise]\nYou know by being physically see we think of that as being kind of the end of sleeping well he's not in chains he's gotten away as ugly free but I really think that you know there has to be a huge psychological ramifications to having been a slave\nEven while you are free and body that obviously you're carrying with you a great trauma\nAnd probably a great sense of the will to him into your place in the world and I really wanted to express that\nI'm thinking of two ways that comes across one of the young man is constantly thinking he's going to be recaptured her church down a another one there's a there's an observation late in the book when it becomes apparent that\nIn a way he resents being freed he resents the white man of freedom a obviously you gave him so many opportunities but also took away from everything that he knew and dislocated I'm In a way\n[noise] yeah but I also think I think the main thing that he represents is the feeling that the men who freed him did not\nRespect him as an equal and this is really the crux of what what starts to eat at him is that this man made this great gesture of of helping him be free\nAnd yet he really has the sense that do this man thought of himself as an illusionist and and your great crusader for good in the world that he didn't actually recognize the humanity of of Washington [noise]\nWhy does this feel like a irrelevant story to you and two thousand I think\nI think we're still dealing with a obviously a lot of the themes and concerned that come up in the book [laughter] things like racial injustice racial inequality the idea that some lives are are more worthy than other lines but also this idea of um people\nKind of being galvanized to do something in the world if you think of the abolitionists and um and how they [noise] they really had to\nNot only is sort of changed their own thinking about slavery which would have been just a very sort of ... an everyday thing I mean the sugar arrived on your table\nIn the mornings you put it in your oatmeal you understood that this was the product of slave labor but it was going on in a part of the world that you would probably never and you're like see a you know done by people who you really had nothing in common with\nSo to be able to change their own thinking about that and then to galvanize a whole society to change public thinking that this is something huge and an amazing\nSo I was interviewing American voters or the other day in the state of Kentucky and there were a couple of folks and heavily wide areas\nWho brought up black people a couple of times and expressed baffled by the central I said I don't understand what it is that black people are complaining about I don't see prejudice in my own life\nAnd they're they're saying I don't I just don't get it I don't get this black lives matter thing what would you say to somebody who here's a little bit of the history that you're laying out and find that to be old news [noise]\n[laughter] that's very disheartening to say that but of course I knew I knew that a U.S exist [laughter]\nUm to me that's it's quite shocking because I mean how can one watch say videos of um police officers gunning down unarmed citizens have anybody watch those videos and\nStill contend that there's not a problem and and um that we have racial equality and in fairness\nThat this is baffling to me [noise] uh feel that there's been regression that there's been steps backwards in\nTerms of people wanting to understand each other's experience and really being open to it and I think one of the things that novels can do is\nTo bring a reader into the characters experience\nEspecially a character who was nothing like um you know we're dealing here with a boy in Eighteen thirties Barbados a who's a sleigh but if you can read that and start to see maybe how you're like him a similarities ah and and also\nTo feel for him if he's going through these hardship if you can do that or perhaps that can be the beginnings of some kind of empathy Bessie\nOr do drugs is the author of Washington Black a novel that's been short listed for the Booker Prize which we find out about today

President Trump brought them up after the Saudi Government was suspected of having a journalist killed the president said he would look into that accusation but he wasn't willing to halt us weapons deals over it\nJennifer ... is an expert in the international arms transfers and is at the University of Oklahoma from which he joined us ...\nGood morning thanks for having major ... what does the U.S sell the Saudis exactly\nTo the U.S sells a lot of different weapons to Saudi Arabia um precision guided munitions helicopters missiles jets a wide range of weapons that we've sold to the Saudis in the\nPast you know we were recovering the Saudi involvement of the war in Yemen someone put us at one point on the sea one thirty transport\nPlane which that American transport planes right so it's American stuff all the way through does this make the Saudis dependent on the United states or is it the other way around\nYou know I think that there's a little bit of both Saudi Arabia definitely gets both military power and the degree of political support from being able to receive arms in the United states and equally I think the U.S in the past has been hesitant to stop arms sales for fear of angering Saudi Arabia and having that effect other U.S foreign policy goals in the region\nYou know they're not the world's biggest country but they're one of the world's richest countries does that make them are really lucrative market for weapons\nYou know you might think so but in general what we've seen is that arms sales are up pretty inefficient employment mechanism\nPart of that because sometimes weapons are given on grant or unfavorable credit terms um but you know in general this isn't like selling oranges are chairs or some other good there's a very different logic of both trade and politics that means that arms sales aren't from this lucrative big deal for the United\nOh if you're talking about jobs which is what the president says he's concerned about you're saying there aren't actually that many jobs at stake\nThat's what we've seen in the past you know in a previously Saudi Arabia and signed a six billion dollar deal for Lockheed Martin helicopters and and that was supposed to support four hundred jobs\nSo there isn't quite the direct correlation between the amount of money that we're told that these arms deals um amount to and the number of jobs that we see at home\nFor for ... important to those four hundred people but not not world changing for the U.S economy so so is it possible if the president wanted if he thought it was in us interest is it possible to halt arms sales to even to an ally like Saudi Arabia\nYou know I think it absolutely would be possible and thinking about the broader political contacts that can be really important signal for the United states to send\nYou know that the abduction and murder of cars showed gee is not acceptable that Saudi a human rights violations in Yemen with continued aerial operations are are not something that the U.S supports and there's actually precedent for the U.S doing that to friendly states and allies\nI'm under President Obama and August twenty fourteen the U.S actually stopped the transfer hellfire missiles\nPrecisely because of Israeli operations in the Gaza Strip that stoppage was supposed to signal us displeasure and that Israel doesn't have a sort of blank check to keep asking for us weapons\nAlthough President Trump has said hey wait a minute if I stop us arms sales because of concern about your mouth ... uh the Saudis will just buy them from the Russians or somebody else's that really possible\nI'm fairly skeptical that that could be feasible um opportunity for Saudi Arabia in arms sales you know us and Russian or Chinese systems don't talk to one another which means that would be really costly and time intensive for Saudi Arabia to buy and then learn new weapons systems these things aren't interchangeable\nOh because they've already got so many of us weapons systems they would have trouble backing out of us weapons systems at this point exactly so the dependence works both ways they're Jennifer ... thanks so much thanks for having me she is an expert on weapons transfers and is at the University of Oklahoma\nPresident Trump talks about slashing regulations as one of his greatest achievements a lot of those regulations are

[noise]\n[noise]\nNow that more on has taken a test the president is trying to back out of paying the million dollars on a technicality\nAnother response came from the Cherokee Nation\nElizabeth Warren has noted her Cherokee ancestry through relatives in Oklahoma where Cherokees about their government since the Eighteen thirties\nThat drew criticism from Chuck Hoskins secretary of state of the Cherokee Nation who joins us now from ... to Oklahoma could warnings or good morning Steve I Walk in the program I just want to note for people who maybe don't follow this everyday remind people that the Cherokee Nation as a sovereign\nNation that it's been around since before the United states and you have people who live within of course the United states\nHow do you determine today who use and using the Cherokee well\nFirst of all we DNA is completely irrelevant to the process but our process is essentially that a a person living today would need to trace back to a turn of the twentieth century senses of Cherokee living in what was to become northeast Oklahoma\nThat's known as the dogs ... um that role exist a person can trace back to it if you trace back to that and document that proved through things like birth certificates death records\nAre then you can establish yourself as a Cherokee citizen and we now have three hundred and sixty five thousand citizens and the country most of them live in our territory in northeast Oklahoma and the surrounding area but we have citizens all over the country for the largest traveling the country we have a very rigorous process uh and it's about documentation and\nDriving back to that ... genealogy and let's get back to people who were legally part of the Cherokee Nation at one time why is irrelevant to that\nWell DNA at best will tell you if there are markers and your genetic code that tray shoe to native peoples\nIn North America and South America it's not going to tie you to a particular group of native peoples to particular tribe keep in mind you noted uh Indian tribes in this country are sovereign nation we existed before the United states\nUh was was exist in existence and so\nAs a sovereign nation we can determine our own citizenship rules and laws course those are tied or in parts of federal treaties but this is a legal status a political ad is not a genetic status and that is very important for folks in this country to understand but one of the reasons we're concerned about\nBut let's talk about what it was with Warren said she specifically said I'm not enrolled in a tribe she says I have native ancestry and she's one of a lot of people who will say well ah family stories as I have some Indian blood and people who are barely can take a DNA test\nOr does it bother you when someone like Elizabeth Warren says I'm not a member of a dry but I have Indian ancestry\nIt does me first of all it it I don't begrudge anybody for having family stories are being curious about their their DNA but you have to take Senator Warren statements in the larger context I mean she has told stories about being a Cherokee hearing those stories growing up\nAh and then she is in a back and forth with the president United States of course is taking taking some personal shots at her for her family story\nUm and then we're now at the point where she's taken a DNA test and this I think muddy the waters for a lot of Americans on a subject that they don't know a great deal about so that's what the concern is is that we're a sovereign nation we have a very specific means by which you are a turkey citizen that's true of all Indian nations\nAnd for senator in this context of this ongoing back and forth political a fight or to talk about DNA a really undermines tribal interest frankly because we're sovereign nation\nWell there's a couple of couple of questions that are raised by that one of the general one of them specific in the general question is just about the really large number of people that\nMany of us have encountered in everyday life who say they have some some native ancestry or they are they taking advantage of you in some way by not being members of the Cherokee Nation or whatever nation but saying that they have this this background\nWill often it is about a appropriating our identity and our culture um you know we thought long and hard for the status it's illegal status that was nearly extinguished by the government United States it's illegal\nIs that we used to fight for the rights of native children to protect our lands and when someone comes in and boast that they took a DNA test so there Indian\nWe think that our roads what it means to be a Native American in this country even if they don't claim a specific tribal nations citizenship\nThen there's the specific question of Elizabeth Warren you mentioned that she has been criticized by President Trump who's referred to her as poker hottest to Pocahontas who challenged her to take some kind of DNA test should she not be able to respond to that at all\nI don't think she should go down to the level of that kind of name calling and that kind of attack what we want from leaders of this country as people to advocate and fight for Indian country to understand our issues\nShe's in a great position to have a positive impact on the Indian country that's where her focus should be the president United States should not be calling her Pocahontas he should be looking at what the needs of Indian country or because the needs are there we need folks in Washington to listen to that and to stand up for us\nOkay so what's wrong with the president of the United states calling her Pocahontas them\nWell we think that it's a Pocahontas first of all was he was a real person that had a real identity with a real tribesmen in if you listen to the tone it to the very drifts of tone\nA it's a very critical tone I think it's a political back and forth that has little to do with the interest of Native Americans in this country has more to do with the political spat\nSo I don't think he does what he ought to do is the president to raise the level of discourse in this country maybe\nTo take the opportunity to to talk about Indian country instead of just attacking senator\nWhile this was an opportunity to raise another issue that I think hardly has gotten talked about at all because there's so much news around the country uh there are a lot of Indian nations in this country you have close relations with the federal government dependent on the federal government and and in many ways how has the Trump Administration done for a for the Cherokee Nation last couple\nOf well in in some ways it's been positive we've made a lot of strides in healthcare um but there's a lot of uncertainty for example in the bureau of Indian affairs\nAnd whether the United states is going to consult with us over changes to that agency that's so critical it concerns is a\nTime when there's proposed budget that reduce things that are important to us things to protect the environment that uh go to job creation\nOr education and things of that matter so um we need to we need a federal government that will listen to tribes will consult with tribes that will live up to its end of the bargain these are treaties these are trust obligations\nUh and so we think the federal government could be doing better but it certainly doesn't help when the rest of the United states attacks US Senator or if a senator gets bogged down in DNA a DNA results\nWell ms Ross Kim thanks very much really appreciate it thanks very

Rachel Martin the Trump Administration announced plans Monday that would require drug makers to reveal the list price of their medicines and TV commercials the move effectively sets the stage for months or even years of battle with the drug industry\nKaiser Health news senior correspondent Sarah Jane Tribble covers drug pricing and she's here to walk us through what this means morning good morning what\nIs this new proposal what exactly will it mean\nSo what secretary aides are as a health and Human Services and to the Trump Administration he took the stage yesterday and he announced that any drug that costs more than thirty five dollars a month we need to have advertising on TV ads and the rule is rather specific it says they advertise needs to be on a contracting background and needs to be easy to read\nUp so there are a lot of questions embedded in that um what what price are they going to list in the TV commercials because based on how much people paying insurance the prices are different for different people right\nRight exactly so when you go to pharmacy counter and I go to a pharmacy counter our co pays maybe different depending on our insurance and\nUm we may have a detectable we have to have ... so the question is what price will be up there um the secretary did note that they want less price up there which is\nI'm also a good question what does it mean um he clarified later and said it would be wholesale acquisition cost which is a an industry term where\nUm nobody really pays that often ... out days are made a point of saying that the price does matter and he did this big analogy with the auto industry on cars and so forth\nAnd it does matter because it's a base for a lot of negotiation and it can be a base for what people who are uninsured pay but would it matter to consumers though it can be off often confusing consumers right so if I'm told that my drug it's five thousand dollars a month just for example\nBut I'm only going to pay a couple of thousand dollars a month or might adoptable covered that are my my health plan covers and only paying fifty dollar co pay it could scary away from getting a drug\nRight so um even though it's it's kind of confusing it's still demanding a level of transparency that I imagine the pharmaceutical industry isn't so Keener\nYeah and um and it is getting a lot of attention it's something that is kind of a populist thing that people can grasp on to\nAnd is just a few weeks before the midterms um I Want to point out for the November elections so the timing is a very exciting because people really care about prescription drug prices right now recent polling shows that a ... price friends' parents and prescription drug prices polls well with American voters\nJust the idea of it for you when you start companies to be more a forthcoming I'm so is it what's the likelihood that it actually is going to go into effect\nSo let me back up to the minute and say in the farm it from school industries response because I think that helped lead us to the likelihood of that going into effect so yesterday morning before um the secretary took to the stage and made this big announcement\nThe pharma industry through their trade group pharma and made a big announcement as well and they said hey we're going to do a voluntary measure where we ask our companies to um help educate you about your price and we will help\nYou know direct you on our website to information about the benefits and costs of our drugs and they're going to put together a Web portal that you can go and look and look at your insurance options and so forth okay so that was a kind of the pharma industry on the offensive\nDuring the press call for that um somebody asked hey is there is a possibility for litigation here in the industry didn't say no and I think it's a legitimate question and several law scholars that I spoke with yesterday\nUm did note that this is just asking for litigation\nSo um even if the world comes into being which you've outlined is kind of a long shot of because of litigation what tools does the Trump Administration as administration how to enforce it\nSo they don't have much at all not really anything in there they say that they're going to put together a list of companies that don't meet the standards and shame them and then they're going to expect the other companies to sue each other or consumers to sue the company so\nNo real hurdles is more political than substantive I'm Sarah Jane Tribble senior correspondent with Kaiser Health news thank you so much

given the Trump administration's approach to trade and other world affairs the other night Leslie stall of CBS sixty minutes asked President Trump about using tariffs on allies\nI watch ally we have wonderful relationships are a lot of people but then when we don't teach us much worse than the European Union the European Union but why is formed in order to take advantage of us on trade and that's what they've done\nWell Obama era treasury secretary Jack Lew just co wrote a piece in foreign affairs about using America's economic\nPower thanks for joining us good to be with you today David now in the title of the piece you assert that Washington is no abusing its financial might I mean what are we doing burning bridges\nWell I think that you know first of all a using your economic power is an effective tool is extremely important as a as a ability to project influence it needs to be protected\nAnd what the piece argues is that we have to be careful and not treat the use of economic power is if it's limitless\nAnd that if we act too much unilaterally if we violate rules that we helped to design if we don't build an international support for our actions there can be a backlash even if it works in the short term can reduce us influence uh overtime\nYou write about what you call\nSecondary sanctions if I can explain that's a bit when the U.S not only bars its own citizens are are companies from doing business with say Iran but the secondary ones kicking barring Americans from doing business with anyone else that does business\nWith the target nation and you think that's particularly the morning when you drill down to that new level\nWhat I'm arguing what we're arguing in the piece is that if somebody has to be carefully because if you do it when you're\nIn the case of withdrawing from the Iran deal breaking a commitment the United states made in spite of the fact that by all evidence Iran complied with the nuclear deal\nOr that raises many questions one will the rest of the world cooperate with you and to will the country you're sanctioning change its behavior because of the sanctions\nWhich is not say that Iran doesn't do a lot of terrible things uh it's it was a nuclear deal and the secondary sanctions that are going to be reimposed in a few days um are being done or not withstanding the fact that all the other signatories to the agreement oppose that action\nBut if you hearken back to an earlier era when perhaps the notion of steak craft and respecting these international relationships was more front and center\nThere were some problems with the international trading community we ended up with what many on the left many on the right argue is a broken trading system with China maybe the playing according to the rules and making more nice ... wasn't working for people\nWe may well have problems with China I spent a lot of time as secretary taking these issues directly to the Chinese but the way to deal with that is by\nMaking the point that you need to have structural changes in China and you need to do with the the moral leadership of having been both the creator of the rules and complying with the rules of international engagement\nI think that the current tariff policy is not an effective way to do it it's hurting us businesses is hurting us jobs and it's making for the world the impression that the United states is disregarding the rules that we helped to write\nJacob Lew was U.S Treasury secretary for twenty Thirteen to twenty Seventeen is now a visiting professor of international and public affairs at Columbia

they're stuck they're stuck in their houses they can't get to a a zones that where people can get relief are is the salvation army addressing that or are you are you seeing other organizations try to meet that need\nWell the the nice thing is when it comes to a disaster of this scale one organization alone can and can't do it and we're very thankful that there are such great other partner agencies a NGOs a mogul\nUh folks who are who are also picking up a big me up the slack in essence or to try to bring a relief and a basic needs to to those in those areas you know I think there's\nThere's always that group of folks that\nDon't end up leaving they don't heed the call to evacuate or for whatever reason in fact I talked to jail and yesterday a who have been in this area for years surviving you know several other hurricanes that have come through general one category too even a three\nAnd ... you know what we came to that just fine uh I think with the realization was as this thing ramped up coming in and came in almost as a five and they realized too late that they made a huge mistake and they were ... who escaped with their lives but\nYou know that then this is now they've got to be able to eat not to be able to get water\nOr not just for drinking but to be able to\nPotentially flush the toilet and in fact we're all dealing with that including the salvation army personnel that are that are here in Panama City where we're living with them\nHow does this compare to other hurricane disasters that you've been a part of ...\nSure uh I was here in Florida last year as part of the hurricane Irma relief I was in a sea brings Florida\nAnd the issue there was more just widespread power outages didn't see a ton of damage or so the books obviously powers out you can't cook you know there's no food to buy so that's where the salvation army comes in and provide that that need that food and hydration but here\nI initially came into Tallahassee last Thursday spend a day and a half there and as I moved west and then further south to come here\nThat's when you saw the tremendous destruction was running along interstate ten west you know you have those swat along

he spoke of severe punishment for the suspected murder of a journalist by Saudi Arabia but here's a question when you're listening closely what is the president really say\nHis language showed this was not really a threat he spoke of punishment if the Saudis were responsible and by Monday he leaned into the raising doubts about Saudi involvement and blurring the issue NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports this is how the president often handles awkward news\nStanding on the south lawn of the White House President Trump described the conversation he had with Saudi king selmont about what happened to showcase\nBecame firmly denied any knowledge of it he didn't really know maybe I don't want to get ... but it sounded to me like maybe they should it be wrong he's jailers for getting to the bottom of it very soon but it was a flat denial\nIn just twenty seconds Trump hit a trifecta phrasing and logic he comes back to frequently first when an ally or someone he's inclined to believe denies something he first did the denial\nI've asked study firmly denies that while he denied does that mean Roy Moore denies\nWay he gives a total denial\nI Will tell you

was suspected of having a journalist killed the president said he would look into that accusation but he wasn't willing to hold us weapons deals over it\nJennifer spindle is an expert in the international arms transfers and is at the University of Oklahoma from which he joined us ...\nGood morning thanks for having me or ... what does the U.S sell the Saudis exactly\nTo the U.S sells a lot of different weapons to Saudi Arabia um precision guided munitions helicopters missiles jets a wide range of weapons that we've sold to the Saudis in the\nPast you know we were recovering the Saudi involvement of the war in Yemen someone put us at one point honestly one thirty transport plane which that American transport but right so it's American stuff all the way through does this make the Saudis dependent on the United states or is it the other way around\nYou know I think that there's a little bit of both Saudi Arabia definitely gets both military power and the degree of political support from being able to receive arms in the United states and equally I think the U.S in the past has been hesitant to stop arms sales for fear of angering Saudi Arabia and having that effect other U.S foreign policy goals in the region\nYou know they're not the world's biggest country but they're one of the world's richest countries does that make them are really lucrative market for weapons\nYou know you might think so but in general what we've seen is that arms sales are pretty inefficient employment mechanism\nPart of that because sometimes weapons are given on grant or unfavorable credit terms um but you know in general this isn't like selling oranges are chairs or some other good there's a very different logic of both trade and politics that means that arms sales aren't from this lucrative big deal for the United\nOh if you're talking about jobs which is what the president says he's concerned about you're saying there aren't actually that many jobs at stake\nThat's what we've seen in the past you know in a previously Saudi Arabia and signed a six billion dollar deals for Lockheed Martin helicopters and and that was supposed to support four hundred jobs\nSo there isn't quite the direct correlation between the amount of money that we're told that these arms deals um amount to and the number of jobs that we see at home for\nFor important to those four hundred people but not not world changing for the U.S economy so so is it possible if the president wanted if he thought it was in us interest is it possible to halt arms sales even to an ally like Saudi Arabia\nYou know I think it absolutely would be possible and thinking about the broader political context that could be really important signal for the United states to send\nYou know that the abduction and murder of a show gee is not acceptable that Saudi or human rights violations in Yemen with continued aerial operations are are not something that the U.S supports and there's actually precedent for the U.S doing that to a friendly states and allies\nI'm under President Obama and August twenty fourteen the U.S actually stopped the transfer of hellfire missiles\nPrecisely because of Israeli operations in the Gaza Strip that stoppage was supposed to signal us displeasure and that Israel didn't have a sort of blank check to keep asking for us weapons\nAlthough President Trump has said hey wait a minute if I stop us arms sales because of concern about ... ... ah the Saudis will just buy them from the Russians or somebody else is that really possible\nI'm fairly skeptical that that could be feasible um opportunity for Saudi Arabia in arms sales you know us and Russian or Chinese systems don't talk to one another which means that would be really costly and time intensive for Saudi Arabia to buy and then learn new weapons systems these things aren't interchangeable\nOh because they've already got so many of us weapons systems they would have trouble backing out of us weapons systems at this point\nExactly so the dependence works both ways they're\nJennifer ... thanks so much thanks for having me she is an expert on weapons transfers and is at the University of Oklahoma\nPresident Trump talks about slashing regulations as one of his greatest achievements a lot of those regulations are connected to the environment Congress has largely gone along

people but as NPR's Quil Lawrence reports the number of missing is believed to be much higher hundreds\nOf people who said they were going to ride out the storm may have actually fled inland as the warnings suddenly got worse last week and since then cell phone service and access to Internet has been so bad that family members haven't been able to reconnect\nAnd that prompted a celebratory statement from the president this morning who took the opportunity to call Warren Pocahontas again\nSo what did the Cherokees themselves\nReally think earlier we reached Chuck Hoskins junior a secretary of state of the Cherokee Nation who called in from ... to Oklahoma I just want to note for people who maybe don't follow this everyday remind people that the Cherokee Nation as a sovereign nation it's been around since before the United states or do you have people who live within of course the United states\nHow do you determine today who use and using the Cherokee\nWell first of all we DNA is completely irrelevant to the process but our process is essentially that a a person living today would need to trace back to a turn of the twentieth century senses of Cherokee living in what was to become northeast Oklahoma\nThat's known as the dogs ... um that role exist a person can trace back to it if you trace back to that and document that proved through things like birth certificates death records\nThen you can establish yourself as a turkey citizen and we now have three hundred and sixty five thousand citizens and the country most of them live in our territory in northeast Oklahoma and the surrounding area but we have citizens all over the country for the largest traveling the country we have a very rigorous process uh and it's about documentation and\nDrives me back to that those rules you Amy genealogy on a subject to people who were legally part of the Cherokee Nation at one time why is irrelevant to that\nWill DNA at best will tell you if there are markers and your genetic code that trace you to native peoples\nIn North America and South America it's not going to tie you to a particular group of native peoples to particular tribe keep in mind you noted uh Indian tribes in this country are sovereign nations we existed before the United states\nUh was was exist in existence and so\nAs a sovereign nation we can determine our own citizenship rules and laws course those are tied in parts of federal treaties but this is a legal status a political ad is not a genetic status and that is very important for folks in this country to understand it was one of the reasons we're concerned about\nLet's talk about what it was before and said she specifically said I'm not enrolled in a tribe she says I have native ancestry and she's one of a lot of people who will say well a family stories as I have some Indian blood and people who barely can take a DNA test or does it bother you when someone like Elizabeth Warren says\nUp a member of a dry but I have Indian ancestry\nIt does me first of all it it I don't begrudge anybody for having family stories are being curious about their their DNA but you have to take Senator Warren statements in the larger context I mean she has told stories about being a Cherokee hearing those stories growing up\nAh and then she is in a back and forth with the president United States of course is taking taking some personal shots at her for her family story\nUm and then we're now at the point where she's taken a DNA test and this I think muddy the waters for a lot of Americans on a subject that they don't know a great deal about so that's what the concern is is that we're a sovereign nation we have a very specific\nMeans by which you are a turkey citizen that's true of all Indian nations and for senator in this context of this ongoing back and forth political a fight to talk about DNA really undermines tribal interest frankly because we're sovereign nation\nWell there's there's a couple of questions that are raised by that one of the general one of them specific and the general question is just about the really large number of people that\nMany of us have encountered in everyday life who say they have some some native ancestry or they are they taking advantage of you in some way by not being members of the Cherokee Nation or whatever nation but saying that they have this this background\nWill often it is about a appropriating our identity and our culture hum you know we thought long and hard for the status it's illegal status that was nearly\nExtinguished by the government the United states it's a legal status that we used to fight for the rights of native children to protect our lands and when someone comes in and boast that they took a DNA test so there Indian\nWe think that our roads what it means to be a Native American in this country even if they don't claim a specific tribal nations citizenship\nThen there's the specific question of Elizabeth Warren you mentioned that she has been criticized by President Trump who's referred to her as Pocahontas to Pocahontas who challenged her to take some kind of DNA test should should not be able to respond to that at all\nI don't think she should go down to the level of that kind of name calling in that kind of attack what we want from leaders of this country is people to advocate and fight for Indian country to understand our issues\nShe's in a great position to have a positive impact on the Indian country that's where her focus should be the president United States should not be calling her Pocahontas he should be looking at what the needs of Indian country or because the needs are there we need folks in Washington to listen to that and to stand up for us\nOkay so what's wrong with the president of the United states calling her Pocahontas them\nWell we think that it's a Pocahontas first of all was he was a real person that had a real identity with a real tribesmen in if you listen to the tone it to the very ... of tone I think it's a political back and forth that has little to do with the interest of Native Americans in this country has more to do with the political spat so I don't think he does what he ought to do is the\nPresident to take the opportunity to to talk about Indian country instead of just attacking senator\nWell ms Ross Kim thanks very much really appreciate

medicines and TV commercials the move effectively sets the stage for months or even years of battle with the drug industry\nKaiser Health news senior correspondent Sarah Jane Tribble covers drug pricing and she's here to walk us through what this means morning good morning\nWhat is this new proposal what exactly will it mean\nSo what secretary aides are as a health and Human Services and to the Trump Administration he took the stage yesterday and he announced that any drug that costs more than thirty five dollars a month we'd need to have advertising on TV ads and the rule is rather specific it says the advertising needs to be on a contracting background and needs to be easy to read\nUp so there are a lot of questions embedded in that um what what price are they going to list in the TV commercials because based on how much people paying insurance the prices are different for different people right right\nExactly so when you go to the pharmacy counter and I go to a pharmacy counter our co pay maybe different be depending on our insurance and\nUm we may have a detectable we have to ... so the question is what price will be up there um the secretary did note that they want less price up there which is I'm also a good question what does it mean um he clarified later and said it would be wholesale acquisition cost which is a an industry term where\nUm nobody really pays that often um out days are made a point of saying that the list price does matter and he did this big analogy with the auto industry on cars and so forth\nAnd it does matter because it's a base for a lot of negotiation and it can be a base for what people who are uninsured pay but would it matter to consumers though it can be off often confusing right consumers right so if I'm told that my drug is five thousand dollars a month just for example\nBut I'm only going to pay a couple of thousand dollars a month or might adoptable covers it are my my health plan covers and only paying fifty dollar co pay it could scary away from getting a drug\nRight so um even though it's it's kind of confusing it's still demanding a level of transparency that I imagine the pharmaceutical industry isn't so keen on\nYeah and um and it is getting a lot of attention it's something that is kind of a populist thing that people can grasp on to\nAnd it is just a few weeks before the midterms um I Want to point out um for the November election so the timing is a very exciting because people really care about prescription drug prices right now recent polling shows that a ... price transparent San Fran scripts and drug prices polls well with American voters\n... just the idea of it for you and we start companies to be more of a forthcoming I'm so is it what's the likelihood that it actually is going to go into effect\nSo let me back up just a minute and say in the form it from single industries response because I think that helps lead us to the likelihood of that going into effect so yesterday morning before um the secretary took to the stage and made this big announcement\nThe pharma industry through their trade group format and made a big announcement as well and they said hey we're going to do a voluntary measure where we ask our companies to um help educate you about your price and we will help\nYou know direct you on our website to information about the benefits and costs of our drugs and they're going to put together a Web portal that you can go and look and look at your insurance options and so forth okay so that was a kind of the pharma industry on the offensive\nDuring the press call for that um somebody asked me ... is there is a possibility for litigation here and the industry didn't say no and I think it's a legitimate question and several law scholars that I spoke with yesterday\nUm did note that this is just asking for litigation\nSo um even if the rule comes into being which you've outlined is kind of a long shot of because of litigation what tools does the Trump Administration is administration how to enforce that\nSo they don't have much at all not really anything in there they say that they're going to put together a list of companies that don't meet the standards and shame um and then they're going to expect the other companies to sue each other or consumers to sue the company so\nNo ... is more political than substantive I'm Sarah Jane Tribble senior correspondent with Kaiser Health news thank you so much thank you [noise]\nThere is no firm indication that the United states will act against Saudi Arabia for the suspected murder of a

that's what they've done\nWell Obama era treasury secretary Jack Lew just co wrote a piece in foreign affairs about using America's economic\nPower thanks for joining us good to be with you today to know in the title of the piece you assert that Washington is not abusing its financial might I mean what are we doing burning bridges well I think that\nYou know first of all a using your economic power is an effective tool is extremely important as a as a ability to project influence it needs to be protected\nOr what the piece argues is that we have to be careful and not treat the use of economic power is if it's limitless\nAnd that if we act too much unilaterally if we violated rules that we helped to design if we don't build a international support for actions there can be a backlash even if it works in the short term can reduce us influence uh overtime\nYou write about what you call secondary sanctions if I can explain that's a bit when the U.S not only bars its own citizens are are companies from doing business with say Iran\nBut the secondary ones kicking barring Americans from doing business with anyone else that does business with the target nation and you think that's particularly the morning when you drill down to that new level what I'm arguing\nWhat we're arguing in the piece is that if somebody has to be as carefully because if you do it when you're\nIn the case of withdrawing from the Iran deal breaking your commitment the United states made in spite of the fact that by all evidence Iran complied with the nuclear deal\nOr that raises many questions one will the rest of the world cooperate with you and to will the country you're sanctioning change its behavior because of the sanctions\nWhich is not to say that Iran doesn't do a lot of terrible things uh it's it was a nuclear deal and the secondary sanctions that are going to be re imposing a few days um are being done not withstanding the fact that all the other signatories to the agreement oppose that action\nIf you hearken back to an earlier era when perhaps\nThe notion of state craft and respecting these international relationships was more front and center\nThere were some problems with the international trading community we ended up with what many on the left of money on the right argue is a broken trading system with China maybe the playing according to the rules and making more nice wasn't working for people\nWe may well have problems with China I spend a lotta time as secretary taking these issues directly to the Chinese but the way to deal with that is by\nMaking the point that you need to have structural changes in China and you need to do with the the moral leadership of having been both the creator of the rules and complying with the rules of international engagement\nI think that the current tariff policy is not an effective way to do it it's hurting us businesses is hurting us jobs and it's making for the world the impression that the United states is disregarding the rules that we helped to write Jacob Lew\nWas U.S Treasury secretary for twenty Thirteen to twenty Seventeen is now a visiting professor of international public

I go to the bottom of it very clear on what is really a flat denial\nIn just twenty seconds Trump hit a trifecta phrasing in logic he comes back to frequently first when an ally or someone he's inclined to believe denies something he first did the denial\nI've asked other firmly denies us while he's in I mean Roy Moore denies you\nBecause they don't all denial\nI Will tell you the president booting was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today\nThat was President Trump referring to the denials of king ...

MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep wire us arms sales to Saudi Arabia such a big deal President Trump brought them up after the Saudi Government was suspected of having a journalist killed the president said he would look into that accusation but he wasn't willing to hold us weapons deals over it\nJennifer ... is an expert in the international arms transfers and is at the University of Oklahoma from which he joined us come on it\nTo morning thanks for having major ... what is the U.S sell the Saudis exactly\nTo the U.S sells a lot of different weapons to Saudi Arabia um precision guided munitions helicopters missiles jets ... a wide range of weapons that we've sold to the Saudis in the\nPast you know we were recovering the Saudi involvement of the war in Yemen someone put us at one point honestly one thirty transport plane which that American transport but right so it's American stuff all the way through does this make the Saudis dependent on the United states or is it the other way around\nYou know I think that there's a little bit of both Saudi Arabia definitely gets both military power and the degree of political support from being able to receive arms in the United states and equally I think the U.S in the past has been hesitant to stop arms sales for fear of angering Saudi Arabia and having that effect other U.S foreign policy goals in the region\nYou know they're not the world's biggest country but they're one of the world's richest countries does that make them are really lucrative market for weapons\nYou know you might think so but in general what we've seen is that arms sales are pretty inefficient employment mechanism\nPart of that because sometimes weapons are given on grant or unfavorable credit terms um but you know in general this isn't like selling oranges are chairs or some other good there's a very different logic of both trade and politics that means that arms sales aren't from this lucrative big deal for the United\nOh if you're talking about jobs which is what the president says he's concerned about you're saying there aren't actually that many jobs at stake\nThat's what we've seen in the past you know in a previously Saudi Arabia and signed a six billion dollar deal for Lockheed Martin helicopters and and that was supposed to support four hundred jobs\nSo there isn't quite the direct correlation between the amount of money that we're told that these arms deals amount to and the number of jobs that we see at home\nFor for ... important to those four hundred people but not not world changing for the U.S economy so so is it possible if the president wanted if he thought it was in us interest is it possible to halt arms sales to even to an ally like Saudi Arabia\nYou know I think it absolutely would be possible and and thinking about the broader political contacts that could be really important signal for the United states to send\nYou know that the abduction and murder of I showed gee is not acceptable that Saudi a human rights violations in Yemen with continued aerial operations are are not something that the U.S supports and there's actually precedent for the U.S doing that to friendly states and allies\nI'm under President Obama in August twenty fourteen the U.S actually stopped the transfer hellfire missiles\nPrecisely because of Israeli operations in the Gaza Strip that stoppage was supposed to signal us displeasure and that Israel doesn't have a sort of blank check to keep asking for us weapons\nAlthough President Trump has said hey wait a minute if I stop us arms sales because of concern about ... ... ah the Saudis will just buy them from the Russians or somebody else is that really possible\nUnfairly skeptical that that could be feasible um opportunity for Saudi Arabia in arms sales you know us and Russian or Chinese systems don't talk to one another which means that would be really costly and time intensive for Saudi Arabia to buy and then learn new weapons systems these things aren't interchangeable\nOh because they've already got so many of us weapons systems they would have trouble backing out of us weapons systems at this point\nExactly so the dependence works both ways they're\nJennifer's bendel thanks so much thanks for having me she is an expert on weapons transfers and is at the University of Oklahoma\nPresident

celebrate or a statement from the president this morning who took the opportunity to Cold War and Pocahontas again\nSo what did the Cherokees themselves\nReally think earlier we reached Chuck ... junior a secretary of state of the Cherokee Nation\nWho called in from ... to Oklahoma I just want to note for people who maybe don't follow this every day remind people that the Cherokee Nation as a sovereign nation it's been around since before the United states and you have people who live within of course the United states how do you determine today who use and using the Cherokee\nWell first of all we DNA is completely irrelevant to the process but our process is essentially that a a person living today would need to trace back to a turn of the twentieth century senses of Cherokee living in what was to become northeast Oklahoma\nThat's known as the ... um that role exists a person can trace back to it if you trace back to that and document that proved through things like birth certificates death records\nUh then you can establish yourself as a Cherokee citizen and we now have three hundred and sixty five thousand citizens in the country most of them live in our territory in northeast Oklahoma and the surrounding area but we have citizens all over the country for the largest traveling the country and we have a very rigorous process uh and it's a about documentation and\nDriving back to that ... genealogy and getting back to people who are legally part of the Cherokee Nation at one time why is irrelevant to that\nWell DNA at best will tell you if there are markers and your genetic code that trace you to native peoples\nIn North America and South America it's not going to tie you to a particular group of native peoples to particular tribe keep in mind you noted uh Indian tribes in this country are sovereign nation we existed before the United states\nUh was was exist in existence and so\nAs a sovereign nation we can determine our own\nCitizenship rules and laws course those are tied up\nIn part to federal treaties but this is a legal\nStatus a political ad is not a genetic status and that is a very important for folks in this country to understand it was one of the reasons we're concerned about\nBut let's talk about what it was before and said she specifically said I'm not enrolled in a tribe she says I have native ancestry and she's one of a lot of people that will say well ah family stories as I have some Indian blood and people who apparently can take a DNA test or does it bother you or when someone like Elizabeth Warren says I'm not a member of a drive but I have Indian ancestry\nIt does let me first of all it it I don't begrudge anybody for having family stories are being curious about their their DNA but you have to take Senator Warren statements in the larger context I mean she has told stories about being a Cherokee hearing those stories growing up\nAh and then she is in a back and forth with the president United States of course is taking taking some personal shots at her for her family story\nUm and then we're now at the point where she's taken a DNA test and this I think muddy the waters for a lot of Americans on a subject that they don't know a great deal about so that's what the concern is is that we're a sovereign nation we have a very specific\nMeans by which you are a turkey citizen that's true of all Indian nations and for senator in this context of this ongoing back and forth political a fight to talk about DNA really undermines tribal interest frankly because we're sovereign nation\nWell there's there's a couple of questions that are raised by that one of the general one of them specific in the general question is just about the really large number of people that\nMany of us have encountered in everyday life who say they have some some native ancestry or they are they taking advantage of you in some way by not being members of the Cherokee Nation or whatever nation but saying that they have this this background\nWill often it is about a appropriating our identity and our culture um you know we thought long and hard for this status at the legal status that was nearly a\nExtinguished by the government the United states it's a legal status that we used to fight for the rights of native children to protect our lands and when someone comes in and boast that they took a DNA test so there Indian\nWe think that our roads what it means to be a Native American in this country even if they don't claim a specific tribal nations citizenship\nThen there's the specific question of Elizabeth Warren you mentioned that she has been criticized by President Trump has referred to her as Pocahontas to Pocahontas challenged her to take some kind of DNA test should she not be able to respond to that at all\nI don't think she should go down to the level of that kind of name calling and that kind of attack what we want from leaders of this country has people to advocate and fight for Indian country to understand or issues she's in a great position to have a positive impact on the Indian country that's where her focus should be the president United States should\nAnd be calling her Pocahontas he should be looking at what the needs of Indian country or because the needs are there and we need folks in Washington to listen to that and to stand up for us\nOkay so what's wrong with the president of the United states calling her Pocahontas them\nWell we think that it's a Pocahontas first of all was he was a real person that had a real identity with a real tribesmen in if you listen to the tone it to the very drifts of tone I think it's a political back and forth that has little to do with the interest of Native Americans in this country has more to do with the political spat so I don't think\nHe does what he ought to do is the president\nYou take the opportunity to to talk about Indian country instead of just attacking senator\nWill miss Roskam

from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin the Trump Administration announced plans Monday that would require drug makers\nTo reveal the list price of their medicines and TV commercials the move effectively sets the stage for months or even years of battle with the drug industry Kaiser Health news senior correspondent Sarah Jane Tribble covers drug pricing and she's here to walk us through what this means that morning good morning\nWhat is this new proposal what exactly will it mean\nSo what secretary aides are as a health and Human Services and to the Trump Administration he took the stage yesterday and he announced that any drug that costs more than thirty five dollars a month we need to have advertising on TV ads and the rule is rather specific it says the advertising needs to be on a contracting background and needs to be easy to read\nUp so there are a lot of questions embedded in that um what what price are they going to list in the TV commercials because based on how much people paying insurance the prices are different for different people right right\nExactly so when you go to pharmacy counter and I go to a pharmacy counter our co pays maybe different depending on our insurance and\nUm we may have a detectable we have to fail so the question is what price will be up there um the secretary did note that they want less price up there which is\nI'm also a good question what does it mean um he clarified later and said it would be wholesale acquisition cost which is a an industry term where um nobody really pays that often ... out days are made a point of saying that the list price does matter and he did this big analogy with the auto industry on cars and so forth\nAnd it does matter because it's a base for a lot of negotiation and it can be a base for what people who are uninsured pay but would it matter to consumers though it can be off often confusing consumers right so if I'm told that my drug it's five thousand dollars a month just for example\nBut I'm only going to pay a couple of thousand dollars a month or might adoptable coverage that are my my health plan covers it and only paying fifty dollar co pay it could scare you away from getting a drug\nRight so um even though it's it's kind of confusing it's still demanding a level of transparency that I imagine the pharmaceutical industry isn't so Keener\nYeah and um and it is getting a lot of attention it's something that and it's kind of a populist thing that people can grasp on to\nAnd it is just a few weeks before the midterms um I Want to point out for the November elections so the timing is a very exciting because people really care about prescription drug prices right now recent polling shows that ... price friends' parents have prescription drug prices polls well with American\nVoters ... just the idea of it for you and you start companies to be more a forthcoming I'm so is it what's the likelihood that it actually is going to go into effect\nSo let me back up just a minute and say in the form it from the oil industry's response because I think that helped lead us to the likelihood of that going into effect so yesterday morning before um the secretary took to the stage and made this big announcement\nThe pharma industry through their trade group pharma and made a big announcement as well and they said hey we're going to do a voluntary measure where we ask our companies to um help educate you about your price and we will help\nYou know direct you on our website to information about the benefits and costs of our drugs and they're going to put together a Web portal that you can go and look and look at your insurance options and so forth okay so that was a kind of the pharma industry on the offensive during the press call for that um somebody asked hey\nIs there a possibility for litigation here in the industry didn't say no and I think it's a legitimate question and several last callers that I spoke with yesterday\nUm did note that this is just asking for litigation\nSo um even if the world comes into being which you've outlined is kind of a long shot of because of litigation what tools does the Trump Administration as administration how to enforce it\nSo they don't have much at all not really anything in there they say that they're going to put together a list of companies that don't meet the standards and shame and then they're going to expect the other companies to sue each other or consumers to sue the company so\nNo real hurdles those more political than substantive I'm Sarah Jane Tribble senior correspondent with Kaiser Health news thank you so much thank you\n[noise] there is no firm indication that the United states will act against Saudi Arabia for the suspected murder of a journalist but the Saudis may already be paying a price NPR's John Ydstie reports on what it means the businesses are backing away\nIn twenty sixteen crown prince Mohammed bin Solomon Saudi Arabia's affective ruler invited us and global businesses to a conference he unveiled a plan called vision twenty thirty\nHad called for a transition of the Saudi economy away from oil and toward a more diverse market based model and the crown prince invited the companies to participate\nJacob Kirkegaard of the Peterson Institute for international economics says the ... G of fair is undermining the crown princes vision\nNamely that the world's most advanced than competitive companies come and establish themselves in Saudi Arabia\nThat scenario is fading as the CEOs of large us and global companies one after another announced they will not attend the second vision twenty thirty conference scheduled for next week Jamie diamonds C. E. O. J. P. Morgan Chase has said he wanted to end again Jacob Kierkegaard\nI think the fact that as CEO as prominent as you know J. P. Morgan Jamie diamond not going to the summit and saying so publicly and linking it to the ... disappearance means that many other CEOs will probably pull out\nTo other prominent Wall Street CEOs Larry fink of black rock and Steve Schwartzman of the Blackstone group also say they won't be attending\nAccording to the New York times the trio of CEOs tried but failed to get the Saudis to postpone the conference the CEOs also reportedly failed to convince treasury secretary Steven mission to stay home\nBecause show gee allegations along with previous behavior of the crown prince or making companies nervous says Kirkegaard\nSays remember that back in twenty Seventeen the crown prince rounded up four hundred Saudi princes and businesspeople detained them as a rich Carlton in Riyadh on corruption charges and force them to pay the government as much as a hundred billion dollars\nI mean he basically sends the signal that the rule of law in Saudi Arabia is amiss when you're trying to lure foreign investors into your country that is about the worst signal you could possibly send them", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "16"}
