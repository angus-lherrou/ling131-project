George Younger was spending somebody else's money he was just of state funds\nIt can be wrong inappropriate she had no authority to commit this money he liked to say that it wasn't a commitment it was

was capable of producing significant amounts of electricity the problem with this\nProject was it wasn't going to be enough water to allow the hydro to operate more than two or three hours a day and that meant that they couldn't produce that much of interest and that's why I became extremely costly\nWhy did the Malaysian prime minister want this bill\nHe wanted you to be built because an opposition policy was in power in ... cousin town he thought that by building the stem and creating jobs would improve his political position in there he also wanted a Malaysian to become less

start to to weasel around with that has to be guilty in Malaysia and if you have to actually reach your face\nSome Lancaster whose job made him accountable for public eye spending felt the need to distance himself from Mr huts decision\nAt that point as accounting of ah I wrote to him and I said to him a this is such a wasteful use of taxpayers' money if you wish to go ahead\nI Will require a written direction or this is something which is quite unusual but I felt that this was a such a waste of money that I was not prepared to take personal responsibility for\nIt was another couple of

at home in the U.S interest in politics or at least in political revenge is expected to push midterm turn out to levels that we haven't seen in decades\nRight early voting is underway and twenty states yesterday was the first day for voters in Tennessee to cast early ballots county election commission offices reported that lines were long in Georgia absentee voting has roughly doubled compared with this point in the twenty fourteen mid term elections\nNPR's lead political editor Domenico Montanaro has been following all this morning ... good morning or he's all lines out the door at polling places voter turnout at numbers not seen in decades what's going on here\nWell look actually I I spoke with a turnout expert yesterday Michael McDonald at the University of Florida and he's forecasting that this year turnout is expected to jump to between forty five and fifty percent\nAnd that is remarkable for mid term generally midterms are pretty low turnout affairs only about foreign ten people who are eligible to vote cast ballots we'd a record low for Seventy years found in twenty fourteen\nAnd I you know that kind of turnout has not been seen since the mid Nineteen sixties if it gets to forty five fifty percent and of course that was another time of social and cultural upheaval yeah that's a really interesting point what does that Mr McDonnell base his predictions on\nHe said he bases on essentially for things one that there was high turnout in primaries there was high turnout in special elections high self reported interest in the election and that these high levels of early voting that we've been talking about that they're taking place at all of those things\nAll those indicators are pointing in the same direction McDonald told me quote it's probably going to be a turnout rate that most people have never experienced in their lives for mid\nTerm elections pretty excited [laughter] President Trump is headed to Montana today which is the start of a three day campaign trip to rally Republican voters so what seems is he going to be hammering on as we get closer to election day\nWell he's all about what you've dubbed the liberal angry mob or just last night he tweeted a head of his Montana trip about democratic incumbent Senator Jon tester and how he's quote worse than the Democrat mob and he's talking about because when testers office released information\nThat a doctor Ronny Jackson in the White House had fostered a hostile work environment that Jackson wound up a withdrawing his nomination as VA secretary\nA and despite his withdraw now Trump is digging in saying that\nYou know tester behaved worse than the than the Democrat mob did with justice K that being justice Kavanaugh look this is pretty transparent Noel this this really has to do with Trump's trying to keep the GOP based fired up heading into November we know what the cabinet or a confirmation battle did to Republican enthusiasm and spiking that\nTesters favored to win in one of these states Trump won in and twenty sixteen and they are competitive races in Nevada and Arizona as well where Trump is also having\nThem in the last question for you real quick how does a high early\nVoting numbers affect turnout on the actual election day Tuesday November six\nWell you know if you have something like a third of people turning out to vote early in this election it could lessen lines and make it easier to vote on election day itself but overall it'll bring the floor way up a which is what a lot of people\nAre predicting now NPR's Domenico Montanaro thanks to

definitely characterize at the make or break of whether there would be a brags that deal a but instead everybody backpedaled a in in fact uh some of the the leaders of the ... went out for beer and and French fries to sort of underscore how relaxed they were at this point and how they had no expectations anything was going to happen\nWow that is some telegraphing fair so what went wrong exactly\nWell it's the same issue that's been holding up this deal for for many months now and that is what happens between\nUh the republic of Ireland which is part of the emu and Northern Ireland which is a province in a United Kingdom you know do you put a hard border there and do you not uh people are very concerned if there is a hard border there that it would threaten to peace deal so they don't want that\nBut they just can't come to an agreement where they should put the boarder who should run that border how the customs union would work and it just they don't seem to be getting any closer on that point\nWell then you had explicitly asked Theresa May to come to Brussels and give them some new ideas that would help and all of this did you bring anything\nUh she did not um uh but uh what's really interesting is that there seems to be a lot of sympathy for her even though she didn't uh for example to lug simmered prime minister ... said he realizes that prime minister May's in

that look like\nWell it would be absolute chaos because you're talking about having to create new customs unions knew or knew customs borders basically you know have security people to\nTo vet people

would incur um if if breaks at work to happen in terms of increased taxes and that sort of thing\nUh so it's it's just something that nobody wants on either side of this equation\nWell how likely is that cast to happen at this point\n[noise] well everyone is still saying that they are cautiously optimistic that won't happen that they come to a deal or possibly in December or so it's something that they're going to work towards at this point the negotiators have to come back to the table and try to hammer out something that everyone can live with\nSo still a lot to be done NPR psoriasis are

of the program when the da says there at least five hundred thousand veterans with other than honorable discharges Christopher Goldsmith is an Iraq vet who works with the Vietnam veterans of America\nIt's not possible that that the number of people who need it's a failure to contact them to fully on them and some great stigma\nVietnam veterans of America lobbied the VA to help veterans

says as long as their mental health issues are related to their service\nIf you have the TST man because of that pie DSD you act couch you should not lose eligibility for your veterans' benefits eh that's what's been happening\nThe new law also ends the Ninety de camp which some veterans advocates say made the program even harder to navigate and it requires the da to seek out people who

casualty of the topic he wrote about in that piece and an free press in the Arab world\nTo show the G wrote about Arab governments suppressing a free press without consequences are going to read part of that ... to you know quote\nThese actions no longer carry the consequence of a backlash from the international community instead these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence as a result the Arab governments have been given free rein to continue silencing the media at an increasing rate\nHe goes on there was a time when journalists believe the Internet would liberate information from the censorship and control associated with print media\nBut these governments who's very existence relies on the control of information have aggressively blocked the Internet they've also arrested local reporters and pressured advertisers to harm the revenue of specific publications\nNow earlier I spoke to ... an editor at the Washington Post carrying a tia\nThank you so much for having me\nIn a new to readers above the column you wrote that cause show jeeze translator sent you this piece a day after he was reported missing when did you realize that that it was the time to

struggling with that beyond just beyond writing about it what other steps did he want to take\nVery often I mean this last comic standing very often in his pieces that he wrote for the post he would call attention to 'em reformers and activists who are also being detained and and jailed um so\nI think for him um it was keeping a awareness on on these these people and these are just the people that we know about you know there are hundreds if not thousands of others\nWho have been detained or or disappeared under under crown prince Mohammed bin ... so I think he he's definitely saw that um\nThis is something he he didn't agree with any he always used to say Saudi Arabia it was not always like that\nYou ever talk to you know a man who spent most of his life in Saudi Arabia did he ever talk about having friends or colleagues who still supported the regime and and how difficult that that must have been [noise]\nSure and I again I mean Jamal himself even was not this this revolutionary and and none of us pieces that he call for\nYou know overthrow or anything um he was somebody who who even in his his\nWork and his long career believe 'em and in a way working within the system and so you know as far as our conversations about anything pain to people who support that he he wasn't really ... in our conversation a joint relieve\nPain so much about that he was just sort of and\nAnd and pain in general about the direction Saudi Arabia was taking and the I think he really struggled to understand why people who even supported a public supported um crown prince Mohammed bin someone's reforms were still finding themselves\nSurveilled and I'm intimidated and even um detained\nWill will you remember about your friendship with democracy show\nYou that um [noise]

the economy than the president's Congress or workers Molly Wood is the host of marketplace Chuck\nI'm only ... debris so this was a big majority Seventy eight percent of Americans say financial institutions and to tech companies have a great or good deal of influence over the economy\nDoes this make sense to you or are Americans over estimating the power of talking big finance\nYeah I mean I think there's a couple of things that are interesting about this one is that it was a very unified result it crossed all the demographic lines it was male or female that was Republican and democratic or the people at Edison point out though that it's not unusual for\nPeople in America to think that companies have a great deal of power what's notable is that it was only about sixty eight percent wasn't majority but sixty percent of Americans said the president and Congress have similar amounts of influence on the U.S economy so it does speak to the sort of\nThe mix of perception and reality about the power of these companies\nWe ascribe a lot of power to these large companies and we put a lot of pressure on these companies for example a Bernie Sanders a press Amazon to raise wages eventually did are they leading or are they having a lot of attention drawn to themselves\nI think we are increasingly seem policymakers start to ask the very real question about how much influence these huge companies do have on our economy in fact I'm\nFederal Reserve and economic policy makers in Jackson Hole it's a big summit and Jackson Hole we're talking about the impact of tech companies partly because of their sheer size and how they're starting to have economic impact that actually goes beyond what policymakers can necessarily do\nWe also asked people about the spread of false information on tech platforms in Seventy four percent in our poll say they are worried about it tech companies have had to answer questions on this and are out there promoting their efforts to do something about it you've been reporting on a lot on this are the tech companies taking this concerns seriously\nI think these companies are taking these concerns seriously but not to the extent that it would\nDamage the business model I guess and so it is notable and increasingly important then you have this many Americans concerned\nNevertheless I think the response of the tech companies does seem to be in direct proportion to the amount of concern and outcry about it and so it is really important for Americans to say that they're concerned about it and they want these platforms to do better because frankly that's the only thing that's going to push them in that direction\nBollywood host a marketplace tech thank you so much ...\nYou can check out more at us and phone numbers and

because when ... when all these civilians were being killed they told us it was by accident even though all the suggested otherwise and so I think and I've been making is to my college for years but the dogs aren't telling us the truth\nI'm there in fact on to us and I now think that many of my colleagues eyes are being open\nTo the prospect that Mohammed bin Salman has not been straight in the United states about other things I'm just like he is not straight with the United states uh about what happened to demolish rugby\nSenator as you well know there are risks that come with calling the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia into question a experts will point to Saudi Arabia's oil experts will point to geo political stability in that region\nAre those risks enough to stay the hand of the United states\nWell this idea that the United states has more dependent on Saudi Arabia in Saudi Arabia is on us is\nI'm ... and how is important well it's important to remember that if the Saudi Arabia decided to stop selling oil to the United states it hurts the Saudi Arabia I'm frankly at this point more than that hurts the United states because we have found ways to become less dependent on Saturday\nOpen when we're in the past um and and I would also argue that we need to look at the broader scope of the train line on sales to Saudi Arabia\nOf we're selling Saudi Arabia I'm much more arms today than we were ten years ago um and and so what I'm suggesting that we get on to a level of on sales to military relationship that looks much more like it did\nA a decade ago um there has been a big increase in our military partnership with them over the years I'm suggesting scaling back to where it used to be\nSenator Chris Murphy Democrat of Connecticut and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee thank you senator thank you ...\nIt was well known among western journalists who have covered Saudi Arabia and the broader region among them NPR's Deborah Amos that has been reporting from Saudi Arabia for decades her first trip there was back in Nineteen Ninety One and she joins us now thanks for being with us today\nThank you what went through your mind as you read this final column from ... in the Washington Post\nYou know in a way for me it felt like\nAn ... for a man who was passionate about free media\nYou know he spent so much of his life in newsrooms and I remember his disappointment a few years ago when a TV station he opened in ... rain was closed in twenty four hours he put a prominent dissident in his first newscast ... and so the powers that be shut them down\nYou know what turns out to be our last conversation he wanted to build an Arabic version of public television for the region and he said he had the money to do it\nFor the first time in his career the Washington Post gave him this remarkable platform the post also translated his columns into Arabic which extended his reach\nBut it may have been the reason for his demise\nBecause as you note so he was working for the post and now that his columns had been translated you think that that angered the Saudi regime\nI think it's possible you know it's one thing to criticize in the west it's another thing to do it in Arabic I'm\nIt's much more powerful so as we have heard took us a Turkish officials are pointing the finger on not just at the regime but in in particular at the crown prince of Saudi Arabia uh Mohammed bin Salman can you explain his rise to power what kind of leader he is proving to be\nYou know he came on the scene when he first arrived we didn't even know how old he was\nA his older brothers have advanced degrees from the west but the crown prince he stayed by his father's side in the kingdom when his father was the governor of Riyadh and back then his father actually wasn't enforcer within the family he was in charge of the paychecks for the royals and he knew you know who owed money who was in trouble um\nMohammed bin someone's rise has been very quick um and his\nSort of his goal is to move the kingdom at a conservative religious kingdom into the modern age but he's done it with incredible brutality and a\nA he has no tolerance for critics he has arrested many are in the kingdom he has also arrested royals and a crack down on corruption holding them and like the fancy hotel for weeks and weeks at a time yes indeed and everybody had to pay up to get out\nYou know I think that there was some discomfort about that in the business community and the west but mostly it was like an odd Saudi thing to jail people in a five star hotel he also jailed\nOf Saudi women are these are activists who had been pushing for the end to a driving ban\nUh many of them are still in detention no charges we know nothing about what is happening with them so you know the same time he was fed in the west he was building this\nUm you know structure for a stamping out dissent but what does the west seeing him and in particular what does President Trump seeing him\nHe is you know there's this myth of the of the young reformer we sought a earlier in Syria or you know we saw with the son of a Moammar Gadhafi a you know young men who are about to take over from their fathers they have modern educations\nAnd sometimes it turns out they are as brutal as as their fathers I'm In this case I think uh Mohammed bin Salman sold himself in the west as\nA man who was going to change Saudi Arabia who's going to move the economy and in particular open up the social space for Saudis what he never said was he was going to ... politically liberalize the kingdom and that for certain he has not\nAnd I think that that is now dawning on the west as as this story unfolds what is in his future as far as you can discern I mean some in Congress now what President Trump to reevaluate weapons deals with the Saudis same thing is happening in Europe is is there a chance king sol mon decides that Mohammed been someone is too volatile and replacing them\nYou know I still think it's too early to uh to even answer that question a you know on the one hand I'm Talking to a lot of Middle East analyst who when this all started said no there's no chance now beginning to say the crown prince is toxic the king is going to have to consider some replacement\nBut it's also possible that the king and certainly the White House sees that this relationship is too important to us national security to allow the death of one journalist to alter where Saudi Arabia is now\nI I think we have to wait and see how the investigation goes is that tape released what happens in the White House to really see where the king will go on us\nRight NPR's Deborah Amos uh she's been reporting on Saudi Arabia for years thank you so much debt\nThank you and we

whatever that country did violated one of the rules of the WTO and they can range from really small cases to really big cases\nSo the Trump Administration just last month blocked the re appointment of a judge to that panel and it's now at the minimum number of judges I never got called judges are called members but the minimum number of judges that legally needs to even function\nSo it is not clear if the administration is trying to choke this court to death or if this is some kind of bargaining position what do you think they're trying to do\nI think they're trying to choke it to death um and I

journalist Jamal ... he's the writer a U.S resident based in Virginia who disappeared after walking into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul earlier this month\nTurkish officials say the Saudi Government murdered him by President Trump says the U.S needs more evidence before holding the Saudis responsible\nWe've asked for it if it exists vices I don't know I'm not sure yet that didn't exist probably does passively does\nTurkish media reported the existence of a recording yesterday it allegedly captured the last moments of ... life\nSaudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has denied any involvement in the disappearance but some lawmakers are calling for Saudi Arabia to be held accountable Senator Chris Murphy is one of them he's a Democrat from Connecticut and a member of the Foreign Relations committee the morning senator morning do you feel certain that you know what happened to democracy empty\nI I don't know that without the evidence that the Turks reportedly have I can say that I feel ... and\nUm but uh I had seen no evidence and I've seen the classified information available to members of Congress to suggest that show is alive uh everything that I have seen 'em that spoke publicly available and privately available\nLeads me to believe that the Saudis did a unfortunate with him or to show inside that conflict\nSo then how does the U.S hold Saudi Arabia accountable at this point specific place\nWell the first thing we asked is for the president to do its own investigation and who's responsible and a sanction individuals that it believed order a this execution and so that process is under way the president fired by law to report to us on\nIs finding a job but Congress can act on its own and I would argue that we should take the step of removing the United states from a military coalition with the salaries\nOf that is currently bombing\nOf the country of Yemen resulting in thousands of civilian deaths inside that country and\nThe reason that I think that these she should you link is because\nThe United states is partnering with Saudi Arabia because we believe the salaries when they tell us that they are not intentionally killing civilians\nWith their bombing campaign a given the fact that they are likely lying to us about what happened to show the I think that it is likely that they are also high into some have been lying to us for a long time about what they are doing inside Yemen I Believe as many others have but they are in fact\nTargeting civilians inside Yemen with United States bombs with the United states assistance and that is the case of that we shouldn't be any part of that coalition than it would be a I'd important message to send to us that if you're not telling the truth uh we're not going to be in business\nUsing making this point about Yemen and civilian deaths there and the U.S involved in potential involvement in Yemen for some time but you are legislation to stop us support for Saudi Arabia in that war hasn't gained much traction\nWhat makes you think that this specific case of of an and allegedly murdered journalist might make any kind of difference might be a tipping point\nWell I I Will admit I Am very frustrated that the United states has been assisting Saudi Arabia and killing thousands of civilians inside Yemen and it hasn't gotten much attention until the\nMurder of ... this journalist by getting attention now because the two are linked because\nWe have supported Saudi Arabia's bombing campaign because we have to leave them because when ... when all these civilians were being killed they told us it was by accident even though all the suggested otherwise and so I think and I've been making is to my college for years but the dogs aren't telling us the truth\nI'm there in fact on to us and I now think that many of my colleagues eyes would be open\nTo the prospect that Mohammed bin Salman has not been straight in the United states about other things I'm just like he is not straight with the United states uh about\nWhat happened to demolish rugby senator as you\nI don't know there are risks that come with calling the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia and to question a experts will point to Saudi Arabia's oil experts will point to geo political stability in that region are those risks enough to stay the hand of the United states\nWell this idea that the United states more dependent on Saudi Arabia in Saudi Arabia is on us is ridiculous I'm ... and how he was in ... well it's important to remember that if Saudi Arabia decided to stop selling oil to the United states it hurts Saudi Arabia\nI'm frankly at this point more than the United states because we have found ways to become less dependent on oil but we were in the past\nAnd and I would also argue that we need to look at a broader scope of the train line of arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nOf when you're selling Saudi Arabia I'm much more arms today than we were ten years ago um and and so what I'm suggesting that we get on to a level of\nArms sales to military relationship that looks much more like it did a a decade ago um there has been a big increase in our military partnership with them over the years I'm suggesting scaling up act or used to be\nSenator Chris Murphy Democrat of Connecticut and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee senator Becky Mm\nThe Associated Press asked President Trump this week if she would bear some responsibility if Republicans lose the house in November the president replied no but as NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports Trump may not want the blame if the

the economy than the president or Congress or workers Molly Wood is the host of marketplace stuck\nHey three so this was a big majority Seventy eight percent of Americans say financial institutions and to tech companies have a great or good deal of influence over the economy does this make sense to you or are Americans over estimating the power of talking big finance\nYeah I mean I think there's a couple of things that are interesting about this one is that it was a very unified results they crossed all the demographic lines it was male or female that was Republican and democratic ah the people at Edison point out though that it's not unusual for\nPeople in America to think that companies have a great deal of power what's notable is that it was only about sixty eight percent wasn't majority but sixty percent of Americans said the president and Congress have similar amounts of influence on the U.S economy so it does speak to this sort of\nThe mix of perception and reality about the power of these companies\nWe ascribe a lot of power to these large companies and we put a lot of pressure on these companies for example a Bernie Sanders has pressed Amazon to raise wages eventually did are they leading or are they having a lot of attention drawn to themselves\nI think we are increasingly seeing policymakers start to ask the very real question about how much influence these huge companies do have on our economy in fact I'm\nFederal Reserve and economic policy makers in Jackson Hole it's a big summit in Jackson Hole we're talking about the impact of tech companies partly because of their sheer size and how they're starting to have economic impact that actually goes beyond what policymakers can necessarily do\nWe also asked people about the spread of false information on tech platforms in Seventy four percent in our poll say they are worried about it tech companies have had to answer questions on this and are out there promoting their efforts to do something about it you've been reporting on a lot on this are the tech companies taking this concern seriously\nI think these companies are taking these concerns seriously but not to the extent that it would\nDamage the business model I guess and so it is notable and increasingly important then you have this many Americans concerned\nNevertheless I think the response of the tech companies does seem to be in direct proportion to the amount of concern and outcry about it and so it is really important for Americans to say that they're concerned about it and they want these platforms to do better because frankly that's the only thing that's going to push them in that direction\nBollywood host a marketplace effect\nThank you so much makes a very [noise]\nYou can check out more Edison

the first time in his career the Washington Post gave him this remarkable platform the post also translated his columns into Arabic which extended his reach\nBut it may have been the reason for his demise\nWe should also just remembered that he he had been living in the u._s. right he'd been in Virginia yes for a year he had had come he'd been there before he'd been a spokesman at the embassy\nBut he was a Washington Post journalist he was a resident of the United states he had a profile in Washington often at think tanks you know I'm beginning to think that he knew every journalist in town and most of the people who are covering this story knew him\nSo as we have heard took us a Turkish officials are pointing fingers are not just that the regime but in in particular at the crown prince of Saudi Arabia or Mohammad been someone can you explain his rise to power what kind of leader he is proving to be\nYou know he came on the scene when he first arrived we didn't even know how old he was\nA his older brothers have advanced degrees from the west but the crown prince he stayed by his father's side in the kingdom when his father was the governor of Riyadh and back then his father actually wasn't enforcer within the family he was in charge of the paychecks for the royals and he knew you know who own money who is in trouble um\nMohammed bin someone's rise has been very quick um and his\nSort of his goal is to move the kingdom at a conservative religious kingdom into the modern age but he's done it with incredible brutality and a\nA he has no tolerance for critics he has arrested many are in the kingdom he has also arrested royals and a crack down on corruption holding them and like the fancy hotel for weeks and weeks at a time yes indeed and everybody had to pay up to get out\nYou know I think that there was some discomfort about that in the business community and the west but mostly it was like an odd Saudi thing to jail people in a five star hotel he also jailed\nOf Saudi women are these are activists who had been pushing for the end to a driving ban\nUh many of them are still in detention no charges we know nothing about what is happening with them so you know the same time he was fed in the west he was building this\nUm you know structure for a stamping out dissent but what does the west seeing him and in particular what does President Trump's seeing him\nHe is you know there's this mess of the of the young reformer we sought a earlier in Syria a you know we saw with the son of Moammar Gadhafi a you know young men who are about to take over from their fathers they have modern educations\nAnd sometimes it turns out they are as brutal as as their fathers I'm In this case I think uh Mohammed bin Salman sold himself in the west as\nA man who was going to change Saudi Arabia who's going to move the economy and in particular open up the social space for Saudis what he never said was he was going to ... politically liberalize the kingdom and that for certain he has not\nAnd I think that that is now dawning on the west as as this story unfolds what is in his future as far as you can discern I mean some in Congress now what President Trump to reevaluate weapons deals with the Saudis same thing is happening in Europe is is there a chance king sol mon decides that Mohammed bin Salman is too volatile and replace him\nYou know I still think it's too early to uh to even answer that question a you know on the one hand I'm Talking to a lot of Middle East analyst who when this all started said no there's no chance now beginning to say the crown prince is toxic the king is going to have to consider some replacement\nBut it's also possible that the king and certainly the White House sees that this relationship is too important to us national security to allow the death of one journalist\nTo alter where Saudi Arabia is now I think we have to wait and see how the investigation goes is that tape released what happens in the White House to really see where the king will go on this right NPR's Deborah Amos uh she's been reporting on Saudi Arabia for years thank you so much that thank

that deal\nBut instead everybody backpedaled a in in fact uh some of the the leaders of the ... went out for beer and and French fries to sort of underscore how relaxed they were at this point and how they had no expectations anything was going to happen\nWow that is some telegraphing fair so what went wrong exactly\nWell it's the same issue that's been holding up this deals for for many months now and that is what happens between the republic of Ireland which is part of the emu and Northern Ireland which is a province in a United Kingdom\nYou know do you put a hard border there do you not uh people are very concerned if there is a hard border there that it would threaten the peace deal so they don't want that\nBut they just can't come to an agreement where they should put the boarder who should run that border how the customs union would work and it just they don't seem to be getting any closer on that point\nWell the ... you had explicitly asked Theresa May to come to Brussels and give them some new ideas that would help and all of this did you bring anything\nShe did not um but ah what's really interesting is that there seems to be a lot of sympathy for her even though she didn't uh for example to lug simmered prime minister ... said he realizes that prime minister May's in a tough spot at least to a point he realizes that\nYou know the three movies and the tricky

terms of increased taxes and that sort of thing\nUh so it's it's just something that nobody wants on either side of this equation\nWell how likely is that chaos to happen at this point\nWell everyone is still saying that they are cautiously optimistic it won't happen that they come to a deal up possibly in December so it's something that they're going to work towards at this point the negotiators

September where they decided to raise interest rates as what the fed does when it's trying to head off inflation from the looks of things they are very inclined to raise rates again in December dance want is chief economist with tax an advisory firm Graham Thornton\nThere is a growing chorus with in the Federal Reserve that not only believe that we should continue raising rates in twenty Nineteen but at the neutral rate that tipping point between which easy and tight monetary policy might be going up that is important because not only they think it's going up\nThere's also the sense that they need to go over it to actually rain the economy in from overheating you've heard that a lot recently even from former fed chair and notable done Janet Yellen\nWhy is it that they seem to be willing to err on the side of monetary policy that is too tight as opposed to to lose\nI think the issue is is that the economy has finally accelerated and wages although they're not going up rapidly they are going up with what the fed expected and if they got a little more we have got dry tinder out there in a very tight labor market in an economy would little slack bottlenecks and very little

I I don't know that without the evidence that the Turks reportedly have I can say\nThat I feel ... and um but uh I have seen no evidence and I've seen the classified information available to members of Congress to suggest that show is alive uh everything that I have seen 'em that spoke publicly available and privately to barrel\nLeads me to believe that the Saudis ah unfortunately murder to show inside that conflict\nSo then how does the U.S hold Saudi Arabia accountable at this point specific place\nOr the first thing we asked is for the president should do its own investigation and who's responsible and a sanction individuals that it believed order\nA this execution and so that process is underway the president's barred by law to report to us on his mind and ah but Congress can't act on its own and I would argue that we should take the step of removing the United states from a military coalition with the salaries\nOf that is currently bombing of the country of Yemen resulting in thousands of civilian deaths inside that country and the reason that I think these she should be linked is because\nThe United states is partnering with Saudi Arabia because we believe the salaries when they tell us that they are not intentionally killing civilians with their bombing campaign a given the fact that they are likely lying to us about what happened to show the I think that is likely to their also lying to us some help in line to us for a long time\nAbout what they are doing inside Yemen I Believe as many others have but they are in fact targeting civilians inside Yemen with the United states bombs with the United states a system that is the case of and we shouldn't be any part of that coalition that it would be a report message to send to us that if you're not telling the truth uh we're not going to be in business do\nYou live in making this point about Yemen and civilian deaths there and us involvement potential involvement in Yemen for some time but you are legislation to stop us support for Saudi Arabia in that war hasn't gained much traction\nWhat makes you think that this specific case of of an an allegedly murdered journalist might make any kind of difference might be a tipping point\nWill I Will admit I Am very frustrated that the United states has been assisting Saudi Arabia and killing thousands of civilians inside Yemen hasn't gotten much attention until the\nMurder of ... this journalist by getting attention now because of that you are linked because\nWe'd have supported Saudi Arabia's bombing campaign because we have to leave them because when ... when all these civilians were being killed they told us it was by accident even though all you suggested otherwise and so I think and I've been making is to my colleagues for years because I was telling us the truth\nI'm there in fact on to us and I now think that many of my colleagues eyes are being open\nTo the prospect that Mohammed bin Salman has not been straight the United states about other things I'm just like he is not straight with the United states uh about what happened to demolish rugby\nSenator as you well know there are risks that come with calling the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia and to question I experts will point to Saudi Arabia's oil experts will point to geo political stability in that region are those risks enough to stay the hand of the United states\nWell this idea that the United states has more dependent on Saudi Arabia in Saudi Arabia is on us is ridiculous I'm\n... and how important\nWell it's important to remember that if Saudi Arabia decided to stop selling oil to the United states it hurts the Saudi Arabia\nI'm frankly at this point more than ever to the United states because we have found ways to become less dependent on Saudi oil than we were in the past\nUm and and I would also argue that we need to look at the broader scope of of the trend line of arms sales to Saudi Arabia of we're selling Saudi Arabia I'm much more arms today than we were ten years ago um and and so what I'm suggesting is that we just returned to a level of\nArms sales to military relationship that looks much more like it did a a decade ago um there has been a big increase in our military partnership with them over the years I'm suggesting scaling back to where it used to be\nSenator Chris Murphy Democrat of Connecticut and member of the

Google have greater sway over the economy than the president's Congress or workers\nMolly Wood is the host of marketplace stuck Hi Molly Hayes debris so this was a big majority Seventy eight percent of Americans say financial institutions and to tech companies have a great or good deal of influence over the economy\nDoes this make sense to you or are Americans over estimating the power of tax and bank finance\nYeah I mean I think there's a couple of things that are interesting about this one is that it was a very unified result snake crossed all the demographic lines it was male or female it was Republican and democratic ah the people at Edison point out though that it's not unusual for\nPeople in America to think that companies have a great deal of power what's notable is that it was only about sixty eight percent was a majority but sixty eight percent of Americans said the president and Congress have similar amounts of influence on the U.S economy so it does speak to this sort of\nThe mix of perception and reality about the power of these companies\nWe ascribe a lot of power to these large companies then we put a lot of pressure on these companies for example a Bernie Sanders had breast Amazon to raise wages eventually did are they leading or are they having a lot of attention drawn to themselves\nI think we are increasingly seen policymakers start to ask the very real question about how much influence these huge companies do have on our economy in fact I'm\nFederal Reserve and economic policy makers in Jackson Hole at the big summit in Jackson Hole we're talking about the impact of tech companies partly because of their sheer size and how they're starting to have economic impact that actually goes beyond what policymakers can necessarily do\nWe also asked people about the spread of false information on tech platforms in Seventy four percent in our poll say they are worried about it tech companies have had to answer questions on this and are out there promoting their efforts to do something about it you've been reporting on a lot on this are the tech companies taking this concern seriously\nI think these companies are taking these concerns seriously but not to the extent that it would\nDamage the business model I guess and so it is notable and increasingly important then you have this many Americans concerned\nNevertheless I think the response of the tech companies does seem to be in direct proportion to the amount of concern and outcry about it and so it is really important for Americans to say that they're concerned about it and

through your mind as you read this final column from ... in the Washington\nPost you know in a way for me it felt like an ... for a man who was passionate about free media\nYou know he spent so much of his life in newsrooms and I remember his disappointment a few years ago when a TV station he opened in ... rain was closed in twenty four hours he put a prominent dissident in his first newscast and so the powers that be shut them down\nYou know what turns out to be our last conversation he wanted to build an Arabic version of public television for the region and he said he had the money to do it\nFor the first time in his career the Washington Post gave him this remarkable platform deposed also translated his columns into Arabic which extended his reach\nBut it may have been the reason for his demise\nWe should also just remember that he he had been living in the u._s. right he'd been in Virginia yes for a year he had had come he'd been there before he'd been a spokesman at the embassy\nBut he was a Washington Post journalist he was a resident of the United states he had a profile in Washington often think tanks you know I'm beginning to think that he knew every journalist in town and most of the people who are covering this story knew him so\nAs we have heard took us a Turkish officials are pointing the finger or not just that the regime but in in particular the crown prince of Saudi Arabia uh Mohammed been someone can you explain his rise to power what kind of leader he is proving to be\nYou know he came on the scene when he first arrived we didn't even know how old he was\nA his older brothers have advanced degrees from the west but the crown prince he stayed by his father's side in the kingdom when his father was the governor of Riyadh and back then his father actually wasn't enforcer within the family he was in charge of the paychecks for the royals and he knew you know who own money who was in trouble um\nMohammed bin so moms rise has been very quick um and his\nSort of his goal is to move the kingdom of conservative religious kingdom into the modern age but he's done it\nWith incredible brutality and a\nA he has no tolerance for critics he has arrested many are in the kingdom he has also arrested royals and a crack down on corruption holding them in like the fancy hotel for weeks and weeks at a time yes indeed and everybody had to pay up to get out\nYou know I think that there was some discomfort about that in the business community and the west but mostly it was like an odd Saudi thing to jail people in a five star hotel he also jailed\nOf Saudi women are these are activists who had been pushing for the end to a driving ban\nUh many of them are still in detention no charges we know nothing about what is happening with them so you know the same time he was fed in the west he was building this\nUm you know structure for a stamping out dissent but what does the west seeing him and in particular what does President Trump seeing him\nHe is you know there's this myth of the of the young reformer we sought a earlier in Syria a you know we saw with the son of Moammar Gadhafi a you know young men who are about to take over from their fathers they have modern educations\nAnd sometimes it turns out they are as brutal as as their fathers I'm In this case I think uh Mohammed bin Salman sold himself in the west as\nA man who was going to change Saudi Arabia who's going to move the economy and in particular open up the social space for Saudis what he never said was he was going to ... politically liberalize the kingdom\nAnd that for certain he has not\nAnd I think that that is now dawning on the west as as this story unfolds what is in his future as far as you can discern I mean some in Congress now what President Trump to reevaluate weapons deals with the Saudis same thing is happening in Europe is is there a chance king film on decides that Mohammed bin Salman is too volatile and replacing them\nYou know I still think it's too early to uh to even answer that question a you know on the one hand I'm Talking to a lot of Middle East analyst who when this all started said no there's no chance now beginning to say the crown prince is toxic the king is going to have to consider some replacement\nBut it's also possible that the king and certainly the White House sees that this relationship is too
