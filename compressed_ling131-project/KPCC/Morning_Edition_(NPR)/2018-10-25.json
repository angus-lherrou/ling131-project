[noise]\nAnd we we can keep it that way right\nAnd the question becomes how long does it stay like that and how long does he stay on the teleprompter if you will um you know falling that hearing with Christine Blasey Ford and uh and judge Kavanaugh he he said that she seems credible and he was very measured in the way he talked about her\nAnd then at some point he flipped the switch and he went to one of his rallies and he was highly critical of her um because he he felt that that was the right political thing to do\nWell the president and so far hasn't said anything directly about the people who were targeted but what about them have they said anything\nPublicly up well Hillary Clinton spoke yesterday and ah she did\nShe did say that is ... she's the one that she actually says quite a bit which is that she's not worried about herself she's fine but she's worried about America at John Brennan also spoke a lot of talk about about the political climate that exists at\nThis time Brian let me turn back to you I mean so far in these early hours investigators seemed to be suggesting they're not thinking about like possible political motives and stuff they're just literally digging into

collected they're being sent to the FBI lab at Quantico, Virginia will be analyzed there take a look at sort of what type of materials are are in these packages look for fingerprints run other tests

that's underway to secret services involved the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives is of course and even the U.S postal uh inspection services involved in this because of the the male element now\nFBI Director Christopher Wray has said that this investigation is of the highest priority of the bureau is putting its full weight behind it\nUm but this was also something that they can't they can't do all of this on their own uh and re has actually made an appeal to anyone in the public who might have information that could be used to the FBI and this investigation to come forward and contact the FBI and and tell them what they are what they have\nNo can't obviously NPR is going to be continuing to covered this story as it evolves will keep on top of it on the radio and

is a major conference going on in Riyadh right now it's called the future investment initiative\nAnd it's part of this attempt by Saudi Arabia to position itself as a modern open place for new

independent news at that conference in Riyadh and joins us on the line now either Ben\nHello David will talk to me about how the crown prince is handling this moment obviously wanting to position in this country as as an open modern\nPlace but with these allegations that it should be complicated what what is he saying\nWhether it was a day of high drama or not just a patient yesterday because these were the first comments by the crown prince since the murder of a hustle gee idea of this month\nAnd that means we should say we should say killing is is the way many are describing it but I'm tired of the murders if something's on the youth and yeah\nSo these were the first comments on the incident since um since the kinds lights\nAnd the whole here\nIn Riyadh at the convention center was absolutely packed not a new report says but with um Saudi officials and business leaders old waiting to hear what the crown prince that they have to root of Saudi Arabia\nWas going to say on the subject to a while to get into it eventually when he did he condemned as you would expect to the heinous crime he said that that would be\nA old that those responsible would be brought to justice and I think very interestingly he said that there are voters who are trying to drive a wedge between turkey and Saudi Arabia over the issue of course because I thought she was killed in the at\nThe embassy in Istanbul and he struck a defiant they're saying that those who were trying to drive to stretch will not succeed don't well I Am from prince ... my father is king\nAnd not while President Reagan as president of turkey and I think the context of this is that there are those who feel to his position in Saudi Arabia as the de facto ruler is under threat I think this was a message sent to those people saying that now I'm here to stay\nWow well I mean it it sounds like it was um a crowd that was receiving what he said well but we should say a lot of people who were expected to be there were not there I mean there were high profile speakers officials who pulled out of this conference because of these allegations is is that absence being felt\nThe absence is being felt in terms of some of the media partnerships and some of the high profile speakers inside of the high profile pile moderate says that set the west in business a executives had just not the ones at the top of the organizations who with on the original billing\nI'm keeping quite slow cheap prices fall here I think there's a sense of trepidation\nA sense of they don't know why this is going to go I have to say I also have spoken to some of them and they all sticking to the original vision they think that this is a passing storm and ah although you know it was a mistake and the uh the the ... just as the confidence that must be brought to justice than not losing faith in the original\nVision that he laid out two years ago\nIs this event really important to Saudi Arabia this investment conference\nI think it's hugely important it's a central positive in Solomon's vision that he wants to get foreign investment to Saudi you'll get foreign experts season to Saudi is with a five hundred billion dollar project to build a high tech city and that that's what he needs foreign expertise on money to do that are on this was\nOne of his primary forceful drumming up interest in drumming up ah people

DC\nAnd I'm David Greene in Culver City California President Trump's political career is in part to find by his willingness to openly mocked people he disagrees with now Trump is calling for civility after at least seven apparent pipe bombs were male to his political opponents\nYeah that's right at a rally in Wisconsin last night Trump condemned the act and then he turned his attention to the press\nThe media also has a responsibility to a civil as you stop the endless hostility a constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stores have to do [noise]\nSo far authorities haven't released any information about a possible suspects\nOr we're joined by White House correspondent Tamara Keith and NPR's national security correspondent Ryan Lucas to talk through all of this morning to you both learned more than I run I Want to start with you it seems like there were at least seven of these devices mailed out um who are these suspicious packages meant for\nWell the first was found Monday outside of New York home of the billionaire investor George Soros who of course there's also a big contributor to democratic causes a the others were then discovered addressed to Hillary Clinton a former president ... bomber Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder and his former CIA director John Brennan\nNow the package that was intended for rented was actually sent it to see in an office in New York and discovered in the mail room there yesterday\nAnd then late last night the FBI said that it had confirmed to more suspicious packages that were very similar in appearance of the other five of these two were address to Maxine Waters she's a California Democrat in the house who has been a very short critic of a President Trump\nSo officials are already talking about these things as pipe bomb they're using that term what what exactly are those and and who would have wanted to send pipe bombs to to these people\nWell in terms of who would have wanted to send them we don't we don't know at this point uh there's no word on a possible suspect uh this is still very early in the investigation now as for the the the packages themselves um we know that they were sent in identical bubble wrap Tamil envelopes\nOr they were the address is on them were all computer printed\nOn the return address on every single package was that a democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida are each package had six us a postal service stamps the one that was actually address to a former attorney general holder didn't make it to his office it was return to sender the FBI says so in that case\nTo the address of Wasserman Schultz she of course did not send these packages she has said that she's a very troubled by the way that her name has been using all of this and it actually her own office in Florida was evacuated yesterday or because of a suspicious package there\nTam let's turn this over to you for a minute I mean this is a pretty unusual moment in the country's recent history how was the president been reacting the president has\nBeen reacting in the way that you would expect the president to react he has a condemned or any acts or threats of political violence saying that it's an attack on our democracy itself\nUm and in his rally speech last night um he also said quote we want all sides to come together in peace and harmony he's talking about wanting to turn down the temperature on some of the political rhetoric maybe not at attacking one political enemies in moral terms now the reality is that he\nHas done just that attacking his political enemies in moral terms but he didn't do it last night\nIt's interesting because the president's mood at these rallies is usually pretty upbeat pretty combative [noise] um but it sounds like he was in a different kind of mood yesterday yeah so this rally was at an\nAirport ... aircraft hangar in uh in Wisconsin um and there was a big crowd of people and it had all the trappings of a usual Trump rally\nExcept that then the president simply red from the teleprompter and uh he he does this it was it was almost like he went to a rally and he delivered a speech that you'd see in the East Room of the White House\nUm and he was um he was a self conscious about that sort of calling it out to his supporters they're saying hey look oh here's a clip\nWay you see out some of the things is like [noise]\nWe're all very well [noise]\nI mean we can keep it that way right\nHow long he keeps it that way is not clear a off and he will become teleprompter Trump for a while and then he will switch back to rally Trump or and and you just don't know when it's going to happen\nIn the person isn't saying anything directly about the people who were targeted have any of them said anything\nYeah that's right he didn't say any of the names of the people who've been targeted often they're features of his rallies manages a Hillary Clinton was speaking yesterday at an event and she said that she is fine thanks to the secret service she called it a troubling time a deep divisions in the country\nNPR's Tamara Keith and Ryan Lucas thanks you guys You're welcome your\nOr the energy giant Exxon Mobil is accused\nMisleading investors and shareholders an analyst about the cost of climate change to the company's bottom line New York's attorney general Barbara Underwood is suing the company for ... shareholders and NPR's Wade Goodwyn has the story\nThe lawsuit doesn't hold Exxon Mobil libel for helping to create climate change it accuses the energy giant of misleading the investing public about how global warming was affecting the value of the company's fossil fuel assets around the world\nWhat the attorney general is essentially saying as you kept two sets of books\nTom ... the director of finance for the Institute for energy economics and financial analysis and former New York state comptroller ... says the allegations are about Exxon refusing to write down the value of its fossil fuel assets that are still in the ground\nTwo sets of books one internally that they were um keeping so that they understood what reality was\nAnd another more nuanced reality if you will for the investment public the allegation really is that the company is not as big as it says it is and it's not worth as much as it says it is\nExxon declined to comment to NPR but released a statement that said in part these baseless allegations are a product of closed door lobbying by special interests political opportunism and the attorney general's inability to admit\n\n\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Noel King and I'm David Greene so when the final season of the Netflix series house of cards Francis Underwood is dead and the spotlight now turns to Claire Underwood the first woman president of the United states you've played by Robin Wright [noise]\nFirst one hundred days presidents have been difficult\nYour husband and I had a repressive is dead or may not by me here's the thing whatever friends have told you the last five years [noise] don't believe a word [noise]\nNow the death of her husband was a rewrite the show runners Frank pool yesterday and Melissa James Gibson had to re envision their Emmy Award winning show after Kevin Spacey who played for instance Underwood was accused of sexual harassment and assault last year\nThey weren't determined to continue house of cards without him Robin Wright Franco yesterday and Melissa James Gibson all sat down together in our studios in New York City to talk with Richard Martin\nRobin if I could ask you about the allegations who told you or did you find out in the press\nYeah here we all found out through the press and you know of course shocked and surprised and then\nYou're polarized as a team\nWith the moral and ethical thing to do and they made an executive decision and Marcy on Netflix and and all of us deciding to close out this beautifully operatic show and what it also would have meant to shut down\nIs that we would have been putting almost two thousand people out of a job in the state of Maryland where we shoot and that was security that people were dependent on\nDid you essentially have to go back to square one I mean how much had you already started to think about the upcoming season or even I think I read you'd started shooting at right Melissa put you on the spot\nWe had started shooting at it and we we thought it through um really by just about the whole thing\nBut all of the DNA was was there at you know she's in five ended with a robin's character Claire turning to the camera and saying my turn so that was indeed what we continue to serve and explore\nAnd I will say just because the character Francis Underwood is not on the screen doesn't mean his absence is not on the screen and that doesn't mean that is not still being dealt with and in his options became a dramatic opportunity to see who would try to fill that space\nRight we knew to deny the existence of Francis Underwood would be dishonest you know to the history of the show um there's no way that Claire isn't in dialogue with her past with him as she's forging a future for herself and she may\nBe comfortable in this position but\nOthers around her or not and there's this scene early on when ... character this D.C power broker\nHe has ... Claire president Underwood into signing the bill and when she finally agrees he physically grabs her hand and covers it with his as she signs it and I found this so disturbing to watch\nMaybe because of everything else around the show but like this idea that he feels he could manipulate her what was that seemed like for your wallet\nThere's a lot of discussion around that remember where I was in which she\nMeant and the decision behind saying yes to let him do that ... was because in politics and what so much of the backbone of the show is about is you always have to sacrifice something to get what you want\nI mean we always knew that we wanted this season to be an exploration of who owns the White House so no matter what and this was a physical men is that if a station of a of a a theme we were working on\nAnd you know is a ... is this country [laughter] you know within the world of the show ready for a female president for\n[noise] um if I could ask you Robin just about your relationship with Kevin Spacey you've talked about read it before as something that was\nA it was a professional relationship um you didn't really know him socially but you told variety last month and I'm quoting here that you feel sorry for anybody who's life is in the public arena that you hate that part of the industry\nAnd you also said you believe in second chances do you still feel that way about Hollywood writ large in about about Kevin Spacey\nUm yes I hate what the media does with our sentiments in our words um [noise]\nAnd I didn't say just that sentence this is the problem being extracted [noise]\nUm you know that's one sentence out of a paragraph that I said I said I Believe when people do the work and they reform I think everybody has the ability to do that\nDo the work and reform and that's what I said and in that instance then you should be given a second chance in life\nIf they're true change that occurs so I wasn't pinpointing any specific human being I was talking about humankind and their abilities\nSo when I was paraphrased um I've just decided to not common anymore because I'm I'm so sick of\nAh being taken out of context and then then that's being insensitive to victims out there that I'm not insensitive to\nAs you all move away from this project what have you learned\nThere'll be looking at trying to assess motive in town and then the capability and of course the other question is are there are additional devices out there that have their in or out right\nNow that have not been intercepted to others of in addition to the ones already a male to\nYeah very big and very worrying a question of whether they're additional devices that let me ask you more broadly about motives what someone trying to achieve when they do something like this\nWill obviously attention uh yeah and and really looking at several different categories one Ruth is this a I'm a mentally unbalanced person who is trying to um get recognition in hopes of being caught\nOr is it somebody with some type of political motives who's trying to intimidate or scare a certain individuals\nOr is it a is it terrorism just straight out the either domestic or international um and so those are the three broad categories that investigators will be looking at trying to assess a witch\nAlso help them and tried to pinpoint a with the forensics a who was responsible for\nA well very briefly I Know this is the question a lot of our listeners will have if we don't know the motivation of who sent the devices yet Ken we call this an act of terrorism at this guy\nWell a lot of people have done that and and there's a number of definitions with the FBI department justice to bars um is the traditional definition and so so whether the person is a bitter fight as a terrorist before their park or after\nMotive uh really factors into that influence till the person or persons are caught up in the definition turban move is more academic or frankly\nAre at a lot of questions still remain John Pistole is a former deputy director of the FBI he's current president of Anderson University thank you sir [noise] like you know\nEight out of ten white

committee has informally advised the group\nAnd an event in San Antonio this week Tracy Goodrich who is still home schooling two of her four kids said she and her husband quietly left their evangelical church soon\nAfter the election that kind of feel like I'm In the base where\nI grew up and eventually go home\nAnd with the\nSeveral years has kind of not have feeling like I have a home

part of this attempt by Saudi Arabia to position itself as a place for new investment under a young energetic crown prince but a lot of business and finance leaders pulled out after ... death\nRight

have\nUm Saudi officials and business leaders who writes in the ... the crown prince who's the de facto ruined her of Saudi Arabia\nWas going to say on the subject but while to get into it and eventually when he did he condemned as you would expect as a heinous crime he said that there would be\nA old that those responsible would be brought to justice and I think very interestingly he said that there are those who are trying to drive a wedge between turkey and Saudi Arabia over the issue of course because I thought she was killed in the embassy in Istanbul\nAnd he stuck it very defiant

justice than not losing faith in the original vision he laid out two years ago is this event\nReally important to Saudi Arabia this investment conference\nI think it's hugely important it's\nCentral

of not piling up nominees in one hearing and now for the first time the Judiciary Committee is holding confirmation hearings during a Senate recess over the objections of the minority party\nNo other

in the way that you would expect a president to react he has a condemned or any acts or threats of political violence saying that it's an attack on our democracy itself\nUm and in his rally speech last night\nUm he also said quote we want all sides to come together in peace and harmony he he's talking about wanting to turn down the temperature on some of the political rhetoric maybe not attacking one political enemies in moral terms now the reality is that he\nHas done just that attacking his political enemies in moral terms but he didn't do it last night\nIt's interesting because the president's mood at these rallies is usually pretty upbeat pretty combative um but it sounds like he was in a different kind of mood yesterday yeah so\nThis rally was at an airport ... aircraft hangar in ah in Wisconsin um and there was a big crowd of people and it had all the trappings of a usual Trump rally\nExcept that then the president simply red from the teleprompter and uh he he does this it ... it was almost like he went to a rally and he delivered a speech that you'd see in the East Room of the White House um and he was um he was a self conscious about\nThat I sort of calling it out to his supporters they're saying hey\nLook here's a clip\nWay you see out some of the things like that [noise] we're all very well [noise]\nAnd we can keep it that way right [noise]\nHow long he keeps it that way is not clear are\nOften he will become teleprompter Trump for a while and then he will switch back to rally Trump\nOr and and you just don't know when it's going to happen in the prison saying anything directly about the people who were targeted have any of them said anything yeah that's right he didn't say any of the names of the people who've been targeted often they're

in New York City are investigating a package that was addressed to the actor Robert De Niro who is a prominent critic of President Trump\nAnd his all coming after seven apparent pipe bombs were sent to top Democrats all known political opponents of President Trump yesterday\nNPR's justice reporter and White House correspondent Tamara Keith are here with the latest when are you guys hello demoted to write mystery is obviously still moving this morning what is the latest that we know about that packages that have come in today\nWell a law enforcement official tells me that one was addressed to as you mentioned former vice president Joe Biden this was discovered in Newcastle county Delaware Biden of course is from Delaware I'm told that this package is similar to the others that have been found in recent days as being looked at in the light\nOf the second package was found this morning and New York's Tribeca neighborhood outside a business belonging to the uh actor Robert De Niro De Niro\nOf course has been a very publicly critical of President Trump\nOr the New York police department says this package contained a central explosive devices similar to the one received yesterday at CNN office in New York\nUh so these are in addition to the seven packages that we already know about that were sent to George Soros Hillary Clinton Brock Obama Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder or as former CIA director John Brennan and then the uh\nThe lawmaker Maxine Waters Democrat of California so that brings the total college nine\nTo nine in about the past twenty four hours are law enforcement officials any closer to knowing who may have sent these packages\nOr not that we know of at this point there is no word of a possible suspect and there isn't a lot of details at this point on\nUh the devices themselves but there is a lot on the packages a that is that what we do know that these were were pipe bombs that's how officials have described in the packages or that they were mailed in we're all identical bubble wrap mailed envelope just as as far as the ones that were discovered yesterday or the address is on the computer printed\nUm the return address on each package was that of a democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz Florida\nUh some of these packages appear to have been some through the mail some may have been handled liver\nOr the one that was mailed to attorney general former attorney general Eric Holder didn't make it to his office it was re routed\nA back to Wasserman Schultz she of course did not send these um she said that she's very troubled by the way that this is all played out that her name has been used in her own office in fact with evacuated yesterday in Florida because of a suspicious package there\nI can let me turn this over to for a second this morning we have been hearing from the president on Twitter which he didn't say\nWell he uh send out a tweet saying and this is part of a quote a very big part of the anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely falls and inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I refer to\nAs fake news now this comes less than twelve hours after at a rally in Wisconsin and he he called for 'em all sides coming together in peace and harmony to cut out the attacks at\nAnd and said that any threat any threats of political violence or an attack on our democracy itself\nThe arms aren't trying to say that very nicely [noise] see normally I screamed they wanna socialists take over that was a once a socialistic over [noise] I'm trying to be nice\nOr is it that a president a sort of transparently saying what he was doing which is the changing the tone\nIn in at this rally a in light of of the news that was around him\nYeah but ten sort of interesting that you pointed out that President Trump hasn't really said much directly about the people who have been targeted\nUm have any of them said anything\nRight so at that rally last night he didn't mention\nMaxine Waters he didn't mention Hillary Clinton normally at his rallies even just on Monday at his rallies there were a chance of lock her up not at this rally\n'em and yes there has been a response former CIA director and Trump critic John Brennan responded to the president's tweet this morning saying stop blaming others look in the mirror your inflammatory rhetoric insults allies and encouragement of physical violence are disgraceful he adds\nYour critics will not be intimidated into silent\nWell pretty harsh words I'm Ryan last question do you the FBI of course is investigating him what are the immediate next steps do you think\nWell I think first and foremost what this morning has made clear is that there may still be more packages out there um this is not something that is a done deal at this point\nI'm that's in fact something that the FBI warned about yesterday when it came out with the statement about what it knew at that point in time what the FBI is doing is they've collected all of the materials that they have so far all of these suspicious packages\nUm the ones that they had yesterday had been taken to a lab at Quantico, Virginia for analysis to look at

a former Democratic vice president Joe Biden the one in New York was sent a liberal activist and actor Robert Deniro\nGood morning All right we spoke to just a couple of hours ago and you said and you know this might not be over there could be more packages out there it turns out that you were in fact correct what do you think about how this is developing\nWell also the question that the investigators are looking at is is part of a pattern of a a larger plot with conspiracy is there some systemic um pervasive actors who are doing this that goes beyond just one individual\nSo that's the concern that they would have to say is this something much broader than the individual six or seven packages and now with these two additional ones\nThat expands the scope of the investigation obviously but it also gives the investigators just no evidence if you will in terms of again the signature of the bomber the the individuals who might be involved in terms of delivering packages that they do it by couriers\nSo it actually can be helpful and hopefully mitigating any additional risks\nAre but if you think back to nine eleven for example I'm not that this was in any way comparable course now but just in terms of was that the first wave of attacks I mean that's what we were all dealing with at the time is that the first wave of attacks and is there a second wave coming and so it's just a natural inclination of investigators say\nWhat else is going to happen before we can identify and hold this person accountable\nWell we've been talking to colleagues in New York this morning and in New York governor Andrew Cuomo who said that law enforcement additional law enforcement will be deployed I mean it brings up a an important question may be a difficult one to answer and shouldn't be worried and how worried should they be\nWell I think people should be cautious and aware of particularly a given the pattern of these packages that are seriously received a package of course if they are probably the person that sits in the least similar profiles those ones are they received the clearly they should not be opening packages that\nAre are similar but even if there's something that is unknown or suspicious\nYeah just out of abundance of caution and just exercise of due diligence to say okay let me take an extra step here perhaps call the police or whomever the the postal inspectors secrets or whatever it may be George ... task forces me to go in and do you see a course on leading those investigations\nSo yeah I think there's an abundance of caution given the fact that the person or persons has not been caught yet\nThese devices that thankfully and interestingly have have not detonated um which I assume leaves even more evidence in the hands of investigators does that give them an advantage that these these explosive devices are not voting\nWill does because again it gets to the signature of the bomber or bombers so are are all the devices
