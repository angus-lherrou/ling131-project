today we're going to find out whether the Senate is\nMoving ahead to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court however that vote goes it is certainly not going to be the end of the story exactly a year ago today Harvey Weinstein was accused of sexual assault\nIn an investigation into New York times the me too movement is radically changing discourse around women and sexual harassment but Kavanaugh nomination\nHas led to another movement and hash tag\nThe hash tag believe survivors movement now our next guest has some complicated feelings about that Emily Yoffe is a contributing editor at the Atlantic and she wrote a piece titled the problem with ... believes survivors and she joins us this morning thanks for taking the time\nGlad to be here so why did you decide to write this piece I\nAm a big supporter of me to of women especially what we're seeing long silence women come forward and tell their stories I think it's all to the good although it's causing a lot of French in conversation\nAnd people who come forward absolutely need support from loved one's family friends a therapeutic community if they see that out and they should be believed within that community\nMy concern is that the hash tag cannot apply when a specific man is accused and some kind of\nEducation investigation or life altering effects happen we simply can't believe one party over another uh just on the basis of someone coming forward that is not how justice works\nSo what what are you asking for practically I mean\nHow do you both tell\nWomen and tell survivors of sexual assault that they will be believed if they come forward but then also add but we're not sure that this man did this you've got to show the evidence like what how do you\nHow do you handle that well as I say that I that we're hearing a lot of testimony from women saying here or something that happened to me\nAnd they're leaving in at that and and there have been interesting stories from women saying I'm not going to name this person this happened a long time ago I thought about it it's not going to do a any good to disrupt his life or mine okay so that's one set of\nUh issues and that is a\nFairly self contained but as we saw with the Kavanaugh hearings\nWhen someone is accused\nWe need some way to weigh the two sides because sometimes we have men we've seen in the me too movement saying a as Lucy K yeah what these women said is right I did it\nUh often times we don't ah\nAnd I think we can draw some concerning lessons from campus where over the past six years or so uh there's been kind of a revolution in title nine this is the federal law\nThat ah governs that that means no a sex discrimination on campus and under this has been\nA a an effort to in an effort to eliminate sexual assaults on campus and what could be more worthy\nA lot of miss justices have happened and systems have been put in place that are fundamentally unfair\nMiss justices you're you're saying most justices I mean the the accused and have not been treated fairly and I know this is something you have written a lot about ah when this happened on college campuses what what what happens to be accused what have you seen happen on college campuses these days but I'm just\nIf you come forward with a report of a sexual misconduct against you whoever does that is entitled to support advocacy help and the people charged with doing that should believe you and help you\nBut that can't to\nBleed over into the investigation and advocacy process and unfortunately that happened that same point of view the accuser is telling the truth and we don't believe the accused became kind of a fundamental underpinning for a lot of these\nUh education um young men who say they were grossly and unfairly treated had been bringing lawsuits by the hundreds\nAnd they've been increasingly a meeting with success in the courts with the court saying wait a minute this is America you can have systems are based on a\nA pre determined assumption I at the end of the\nDay I mean that the central question really seems to be is there a way to protect the accused while still\nEncouraging women to be able to speak up about what could be painful and humiliating experiences I mean how do you protect the accused without sending a message to survivors that it's basically you've got to prove it\nThat's the question isn't it [laughter]\nI don't have the final answer\nIn some ways we can look at\nThis Kavanaugh wrenching Kavanaugh experience as what we don't want to do and in a little partial way maybe what we do want to do because once I'm Dr Christine Blasey Ford reluctantly came forward\nI think the country was helped by having\nA public process a process where in which she could tell her story now it is an adversarial process\nAnd there was attempt to knock her story that's what happens but I felt at the end of the day\nUm they didn't chip away at her and her credibility remained intact in it I I thought it was really helpful to hear the account of of someone who said she has been through this\nI'm equally a lot of people were\nA distressed by the uh extreme\n\n\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm David Greene today we're marking an anniversary twenty five years ago this week was the last time the federal gas tax went out today\nThat taxes still what it was in Nineteen Ninety three Eighteen point four cents per gallon and yet the cost of building and maintaining roads and bridges are going up here's more from NPR's David Schaper\nThe first week of October Nineteen Ninety three the top TV shows were home improvement Seinfeld and the first Roseanne the top song was Mariah Carey dream lover you could still buy a Sony Walkman for twenty nine Ninety five gas was just one dollar and eleven cents a gallon and one of the top movies that year started\nFilm are free to I'm reliving the same day over and over\nGroundhog Day or is about bill Murray's character getting caught in a time loop and he spends decades reliving the same Groundhog Day those of us that have followed the gas tax debate can't help but feel some of that same repetition\nCarl Davis is with the nonpartisan Institute on taxation and economic policy and he says that's because the federal gas tax is still the same Eighteen point four cents a gallon that it was when Groundhog Day was playing in theaters twenty five years ago\nThe whole reason this tax exists is to keep our roads paved and to keep our bridges from falling down and to do that effectively that needs to collect a sustainable amount of revenue over time and it can't do that if it's just not updated for decades of time\nWith rising construction and labor costs than less gas being used in more fuel efficient cars the purchasing power of the gas taxes now sixty four percent less than it was it Nineteen Ninety three\nIllinois transportation secretary Randy blanket horn says that stagnant federal gas tax means less money to fix and improve his state's highways bridges in transit systems\nWere losing revenue another day just because of inflation without new federal money the cap of what we can do is there we are right now\nSimply maintaining what we have\nSo Kevin ... the national conference of state legislatures says well Congress won't raise the federal gas tax states are taking action themselves\nAnd the last five years we've seen many states more than half of them actually enact legislation to increase funding for transportation\nSince two thousand and ten thirty three states have raised their own motor fuel taxes Missouri could joined them next month the voters approve of ten cents a gallon gas tax hike at Colorado voters are being asked to raise the sales tax to boost transportation funding\nAnd many states are also now indexing the gas tax to inflation so it'll go up as construction costs rise some states are also trying alternatives to the gas tax like\nMileage based user fees that will tax electric cars that also where down roads but don't use gas\nStaying with that Groundhog Day theme Congress does hold hearings from time to time of ways to hike federal funding for transportation but there's almost never vote ears Nevada congresswoman Dena Titus at one such hearing almost two years ago\nWere having the same conversation that same rhetoric named to fix the emphasis structure we need to look at the answer is just a matter of paying for it but there's no substance implant\nSo when it comes to a congressional inaction on transportation funding and the late baseball legend Yogi Berra might say it's deja vu all over again David Schaper NPR News Chicago\nEarlier this year Apple's chief financial officer said the company would buy back shares of stock one hundred billion dollars worth wow\nWhen you have a trillion dollar company you can do that this is part of a bigger trend of American companies engaging in stock buybacks to explain what exactly they are and why they're sometimes controversial returned or rain or counted Stacey Vanek Smith of the Planet Money to\nBefore we get into the whole debate over buybacks we should\nExplain what they are probably okay it's when a company decides is going to buy its own stock and if that stock from the people who own the stock from its shareholders and the company will pay its shareholders little premium for those shares so why do companies do this we put this question to John Cochran\nI'm a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford and I also have a blog grumpy economists\nAnd here's what grumpy John says about buybacks\nA company makes a lot of profit either 'cause they're you know apple and Facebook and money is pouring in the front door or the corporate tax cut increased above so they got money sitting around\nYou're seeing a sign of our company will manage that they're not going to take this dream of profits and make crazy investments they don't know how to make they're going to give it back to the owners\nSo they can give cash back to the owners AKA the company's shareholders which is right I mean it's better than wasting the money then or Paladino is an economist at the Roosevelt Institute\nShe says that when companies are giving all their extra cash to shareholders it means they're not investing more money in workers' she's looked specifically what Wal Mart could have done with the money it's planning to spend on buybacks and twenty Eighteen she calculated it could have increased the pay of one million full time workers I doubt\nThousand dollars per year so when ... says they really can't afford to pay their workers so that families can live above the poverty line we have to look at what they're using their money for and say that that's simply not true\nBut John Cochran says companies are supposed to answer to their shareholders it's actually their duty is not their duty he says to benefit the wider economy\nThe point to a company has to make money on behalf of its shareholders this does benefit workers because when a company is run efficiently it has to hire people and it has to make those people productive and in the end high productivity is hell wages or beat up but\nI think it's a misunderstanding to think that the company makes money and then decides who to give presents to and maybe give presents to workers or maybe gives prisons to owners or maybe decides to give a bonus to electric company just to be nice to them uh it's just not how it works\nSo well this debate has been happening buybacks have grown by a lot\nBack in the early eighties land rules around buybacks were relaxed by the Reagan Administration\nCompanies in the S. and P. five hundred we're spending about four percent of their profits on buybacks\nIn the past few years Lenore says that's jumped to more than fifty percent it'll be probably one trillion dollars spent on stock buybacks this year that's more than President Obama spent on the Recovery Act and that's just in twenty Eighteen alone\nStock buybacks have come under increasing scrutiny from leaders on Wall street and even from lawmakers in fact a few months ago legislation was introduced\nTo the Senate that would restrict stock buybacks and take us right back to the Nineteen eighties [noise]\nRain or going to smoke\nMore support from Planet Money comes

MORNING EDITION's Renee [noise]\nSenators are voting after they had a chance to share a single copy of an FBI background investigation just how limited with the bureau's background and I'm Steve Inskeep and this hour with President or former federal prosecutor them democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal\nAlso bizarre where you're the winner of a Nobel Peace prize we get a glimpse of 'em on your Trump but she visits Kenya stories hors headline\nOn the news is next\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm core of a cool in the Norwegian Nobel Committee has awarded this year's Nobel Prize to to activists who have worked to stop the war crime of sexual violence the peace prize winners er physician Dennis ... of Democratic Republic of Congo and ... a member of the minority in northern Iraq\nOr the president at one point suggests that the FBI was permitted to do whatever it would like 'em but there's been numerous or you know press reports from various sources suggesting that that was not the case\nI mean James Comey the former FBI Director did this op ed days before this investigation suggesting like this was a moment I mean the FBI was with limited in terms of time and scope it but he said the FBI\nCan do this suggesting it with the independent agency that that would rise up in this moment I mean if indeed the White House was really dictating a lot of this how uncomfortable might that have been for people inside the agency\nWell that certainly could have been ... uncomfortable I think age is you know may have been telling themselves well this is you know we're only we're doing\nOur job in the sense that this is a background check and we're following whatever leads we're being told to follow 'em but I you know there are certainly may have been some discomfort and I think that may be the result of that may have resulted in the leaks that we saw so\nThroughout the course of the investigation it became apparent from various news sources that certain um individuals are not being interviewed that um that the the FBI investigation was very limited\nThat they had been instructed not to follow certain leads and so on at least some of those\nUm some of those ah pieces of information may have appeared to have come from from people within the bureau\n[noise] so if for example um you know there were witnesses who were put forward by Christine budget for the first Kavanaugh accuser um the FBI did not talk to\nThem if that is true and if as you say the White House was sort of dictating how this happened um what was credible about this report\nWill certainly the FBI um I I have no doubt that the FBI did their job and interviewing the individuals that they were\nTasked with interviewing 'em and so ... you know we have an idea of some of the people that at the very least who were interviewed by the FBI for example Mr Amir as a mark judge and so on and I have no doubt that the FBI\nOr did their best to interview those people within the best of their ability and and frankly that does move the ball forward because for example and killed this uh FBI investigation mark judge should not been interviewed\nBy a by anyone he had he had just written had his attorney write a short statement to the committee so this this does move the ball forward\nUm but it it it is I think I'm a Jew everyone's detriment that it it doesn't resolve all the questions that we have that everyone was it interviewed within the week I which which could have happened 'cause the FBI is very considerable resources and and presumably could've could've done so and certainly could have interviewed judge Kavanaugh on ...\nWho were not interviewed let me just ask you a judge Kevin wrote an op ed in the wall Street Journal yesterday defending his record I'm also defending a what what you describe was his in his own words I mean very emotional testimony ... what did you make of of that\nOver those very anew\nAnd I'm a judicial nominee to write an op ed I Can't recall it ever hiring in my lifetime I'm sure that that's the first thing it's certainly quite a moment\nA and I think it I I think I was pleased that\nHas become an issue because I think for each each ... to me it should have been a nonpartisan issue that\nUm both sides should have felt that it was inappropriate for a judge to make the sort of partition comments that he did during the hearing or that said he just did that he was emotional and so on him in those weren't prepared remarks I thought that Joe Ron How\nFormer federal prosecutor another ... thanks as always\nThank

during the war in Iraq or during their war I should say in Iraq and Syria\nAnd she escaped and became a really a local ... a spokesperson for\nUh for the victims of the source of these sorts of crimes\nUm the committee says that they selected these two for making crucial contributions for focusing attention on and fighting war crimes he's seen as the helper who devoted his life defending victims and she has a witness who speaks bravely about the horrific abuses against\nHer I was just thinking about that what a remarkable thing to do not only to escape to to survive that ordeal but to talk about it afterwards something that's very difficult for anyone to discuss to talk about it publicly an advocate for people\nAbsolutely I mean she she is one of the few many of them are are too afraid to speak a and she was a last year named as a UN ambassador for her efforts are are basically the first goodwill ambassador for the dignity of survivors of human trafficking\nAnd how to Dr ... rise to global prominence\nWell you know Dr miracle again for his just absolute skill and his absolute devotion to these women and victims of of gang rape in war in his country\nAnd ah he basically or

work to be helping the victims of sexual violence in a wartime situation\nYeah absolutely I he has faced as many death threats and uh basically uh there's one in September two thousand twelve or he gave a speech decrying the horrors of mass rape in Congo at the un and then a month later gunmen came into his home and tried to kill him his wife and their two daughters\nHis guard was the only

that found that two thirds of the fifty million people in service sector frontline jobs today have literacy gaps and three quarters of the people have numerous see gaps they're already in the

that should we have a Supreme Court justice who declared in sworn testimony with no evidence to back it up that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons and the Democrats should be punished for this\nWell we're going to talk about allegations of no evidence to back it up we can certainly talk about the allegations that have been made against US Cabinet\nWilling to do one about Islam here he's the guy who's about to go on to the Supreme Court should we have a Supreme Court justice has made this part of some statements\nI think judge Kavanaugh [laughter] a very rightfully so was upset at yeah cues that being a gang\nRape is that you have to remember the first set of hearing that was that was the job interview this second hearing that was judge Kavanaugh defending his reputation and defending his defending his family I think any human being who has been a falsely accused of\nA range of things including ... have the right to be upset has the right to be angry and that's what we saw\nOn me now he has penned up at Penn as they say he ... he wrote an op ed in the wall Street Journal he said uh didn't quite apologize but did say that he got angry and he said quote I said a few things I should not have said not specify what they were what did he say that he shouldn't have said\nWell I think if you're number at the hearing last week can send our club which are gotten to a little bit I'm a little discussion a little\nHeated discussion about drinking and I know judge Kavanaugh regretted\nA the way he interacted with a center club which are which is why he apologized you are on the spot but look\nThis is a man who has been accused by by people who do not have any evidence to back up the Iraqis Asian he was put before the American people to defend himself against really egregious charges and let them make complete sense that he was upset at considering\nA than many many women who have come out in his defense saying what an incredible person he is not just as a judge but his treatment of women\nAnd I'm really wondering if we were all very quickly onto things you said no evidence we have to note there is sworn testimony by a person who says she's the victim so we can't truthfully say no as a ... operation per hour\nYou know the thing are you ... you said he takes back his statements to a club or short meaning he doesn't take back on the Clinton conspiracy theory part\nWell he certainly apologizes dinner club which are I don't want to I don't want to get anything out of a judge Kavanaugh's thoughts on on his testimony but he certainly apologized their public and again either way judge Kavanaugh's nutrient during this process as open and just trace\nGary ... the White House spokesperson thanks for joining us this

I Believe survivors and she joins us this morning thanks for taking the time\nGlad to be here so why did you decide to write this piece I\nAm a big supporter of me to of women especially what we're seeing long silence women come forward and tell their stories I think it's all to the good although it's causing a lot of wrenching conversation\nAnd people who come forward absolutely need support from loved one's family friends a therapeutic community if they seek that out and they should be believed within that community\nMy concern is that this hash tag cannot apply when a specific man is accused and some kind of\nAdjudication investigation or life altering effects happen we simply can't believe one party over another uh just on the basis of someone coming forward that is not how justice works so ...\nWhat are you asking for practically I mean how do you both tell women until survivors of sexual assault that they will be believed if they come forward but then also a but we're not sure that this man did this you've got to show the evidence like ... how do you\nHow do you handle that well as I say that I that we're hearing a lot of testimony from women saying here is something that happened to me\nAnd they're leaving in at that and and there have been interesting stories from women saying I'm not going to name this person this happened a long time ago I thought about it it's not going to do a any good to disrupt his life or mine okay so that's one set of\nUh issues and that is a fairly self contained but as we saw with the Kavanaugh hearings when someone says is accused\nWe need some way to weigh the two sides because sometimes we have men we've seen in the me too movement saying a as Lucy Kate yep what these women said\nIs right I did it a oftentimes we don't ah\nAnd I think we can draw some\nConcerning lessons from campus where over the past six years or so uh there's been kind of a revolution in title nine this is the federal law that ah governs that that means no a sex discrimination on campus and under this has been\nA a an effort to in an effort to eliminate sexual assaults on campus and what could be more worthy [noise]\nA lot of missed justices have happened and systems have been put in place that are fundamentally unfair\nMiss justices you you're saying most justices I mean the the accused of have not been treated fairly and I know this was something\nYou have written a lot about ah when this happened on college campuses what what what happens to be accused what have you seen happen on college campuses producers but I'm just\nIf you come forward with a report of a sexual misconduct against you whoever does that is entitled to support advocacy help and the people charged with doing that\nShould believe you and help you but that\nCan't to bleed over into the investigation an advocacy process and unfortunately that happened that same point of view the accuser is telling the truth\nAnd we don't believe he accused became kind of a fundamental underpinning for a lot of these uh education's\nI'm young men who say they were grossly and unfairly treated had been bringing lawsuits by the hundreds\nAnd they've been increasingly a meeting with success in the courts with the court saying wait a minute this is America you can have systems are based on a\nA pre determined assumption I at the end of the\nDay I mean that the central question really seems to be is there a way to protect the accused while still encouraging women to be able to speak up about what could be painful and humiliating experiences I mean how do you protect the accused without\nSending a message to survivors that it's basically you've got to prove it\nThe question isn't it [laughter] I don't have the final answer\nIn some ways we can look at\nThis Kavanaugh wrenching Kavanaugh experience as what we don't want to do and in a little partial way maybe what we do want to do because once I'm Dr Christine Blasey Ford reluctantly came

Hi alright so specifically what's changed with China's individual income\nJak well starting this month people earning less than eighty seven hundred dollars a year will not have to pay income tax that's increase from the previous threshold of six thousand dollars a year\nOr so left out to the tax people more for the consumer are they going to slash out and spend a lot of money with all this extra disposable income\nI'm not exactly the simple reason is the cost of living is going up particularly in housing we reached a taxpayer named young men who is in the eastern Chinese city of ... he's working as a project manager at an auto parts factory now with this tax change he says he'll be able to keep an extra fifty eight dollars a month\nBut are now going to put on the drugs\nThough he says an extra fifty eight dollars could buy a pair of shoes or two pairs of hands and she says the tax changes it it's a nice idea but it's not really going to help him get what he wants most which is to put a down payment on a property\nAlright so changing the taxes is a way to boost consumer spending other strategies that the Chinese government this are pursuing\nWell the government is also promising new individual tax deductions in January but analysts argue that does increase is still far too modest to boost consumer spending because at the same time in January China is changing the way it collects Social Security contributions this is important because\nAn estimated two thirds of companies and employees are not paying the full contributions so remember our taxpayer young then he

passes the nomination will move to a confirmation vote Kevin has written an opinion piece published in the wall Street Journal about his appearance last week before the Senate Judiciary committee\nI mean James Comey the former FBI Director did this op ed days before this investigation suggesting like this was a moment I mean the FBI was with limited in terms of time and scope it but he said the FBI\nCan do this suggesting it with the independent agency that that would rise up in this moment I mean if indeed the White House was really dictating a lot of this how uncomfortable might that have been for people inside the agency\nWell that certainly could have been ... uncomfortable I think age is you know may have been telling themselves well this is you know we're only we're doing\nOur job in the sense that this is a background check and we're following whatever leads we're being told to follow 'em but I you know there are certainly may have been some discomfort and I think that may be the result of\nAll of that may have resulted in the leaks that we saw so throughout the course of the investigation it became apparent from various news sources that certain um\nIndividuals are not being interviewed\nThat um that the the FBI investigation was very limited\nThat they had been instructed not to follow certain leads and so on at least some of those um some of those ah pieces of information may have appeared to have come from from people within the bureau\n[noise] so if for example um you know there were witnesses who were put forward by Christine budget for the first Kavanaugh accuser hum the FBI did not talk to\nThem if that is true and if as you say the White House was sort of dictating how this happened um what was credible about this report\nOr certainly the FBI um I I have no doubt that the FBI did their job and interviewing the individuals that they were\nTasked with interviewing 'em and so ... you know we have an idea of some of the people that at the very least who were interviewed by the FBI for example Mr Mir as a mark judge and so on and I have no doubt that the FBI\nOr did their best to interview those people within the best of their ability and and frankly that does move the ball forward because for example until this FBI investigation mark judge it not been interviewed\nBy a by anyone he had he had just written had his attorney write a short statement to the committee so this this does move the ball forward\nUm but it it it is I think I'm a Jew everyone's detriment that it it doesn't resolve all the questions that we have that everyone was interviewed within the week I Wish which could happen 'cause the FBI is very considerable resources and presumably could have\nCould have done so and certainly could have interviewed judge Kavanaugh on ... who who were interviewed\nLet me just ask you I'm just Kevin wrote an op ed in the wall Street Journal or yesterday defending his record I'm also defending a what what he described was his in his own words I mean very emotional testimony what what did you make of of that\nOver those very unusual for um a judicial nominee to write an op ed I Can't recall it ever occurring in my lifetime I'm so that's that's the first thing it's certainly quite a moment\nA it was I think it I I think I was pleased that this has become an issue because I think for each ... to me it should've been a nonpartisan issue that\nBoth sides should have felt that it was inappropriate for a judge to make the sort of partition comments that he did during the hearing that said he

President Trump cast the Supreme Court voted purely partisan terms\nDemocrats had been trying\nTo destroy judge Brett Kavanaugh says [noise]\nThe very first second view is that now and it was announced for one simple reason he is an incredible intellect\nKevin himself said that he was the victim of a conspiracy of Democrats seeking revenge on behalf of the Clintons yesterday the nominee vaguely backed off of that a surge in saying that he said some things he shouldn't have in his public testimony although we did not specify what those things were\nDemocratic Senator Richard Blumenthal is on the Senate Judiciary committee which has been considering Kavanaugh's nomination which now goes before the full Senate Senator good morning\nGood morning to you thank you for having me so\nLet's note that you ever had an opportunity as other senators have to view the FBI report the additional background information are looking into the allegations against Kavanaugh what did you see\nWhat's most striking about this report is what\nAre you know interviews with some of the really key witnesses including occupy the Ford and judge Kavanaugh themselves as well as other eyewitnesses there is evidence that should have been pursued lead should have been followed answers that should have been so hard\nAnd it has all the appearance of a white water\nLet let me just ask you about that senator because although it is true that there's not a very large number of witnesses who ride the uh who are identified and interviewed\nMark judge was interviewed we're told and that is the individual that Dr bloody Ford said was in the room at the time of this sexual assault they hadn't been interviewed before just made a a general statement denying any knowledge now he's been interviewed by the professionals did they find anything\nWell I Can't go into what was found and what's in the record but let me just speak generally every interview conducted by the FBI\nLeads to additional witnesses and information that actually is a great journalism NPR pursue leave after they hear them in interviews so do the FBI is what happened here was that if I Would certainly ascribe as to who they could interview and how long they had\nAnd as a result we have a very incomplete and inadequate report\nReading granting that is it a correct statement made by Republicans when they say they're still is no corroboration of the allegations against the Supreme Court nominee capital\nThat's incorrect so is the contention that there is no hint of misconduct there is a matter of public record powerful\nTestimony in this interview although it's not in court you can the interview from Deborah Ramirez and the\nSpecific I wouldn't than other leads that should have been pursued about are nowhere here including by the way it Connecticut constituent\nWho had information about judge Kavanaugh reaching out to some of those witnesses in an apparent effort\nTo shape their intentions to a New Yorker interview and that will\nAllow luggage and hundred and let me just untangle that and the minute that we have left here or there have been some allegations some suggestions that there may have been contact between Brett Kavanaugh people close to him\nAnd Deborah Ramirez and people close to her before that story was revealed a it's our understanding that Republicans have looked at that\nSo not found anything there there is some text messages that are subject to interpretation are you a legendary solid evidence that Kavanaugh himself was involved in some kind of cover up\nThere's certainly evidence that outreach but here too important for the first of all this report should be made\nSo you and I can't engage in a real conversation and so that the contention making

... his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nAnd let me ask you about that should we have a Supreme Court justice who declared in sworn testimony with no evidence to back it up that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons and the Democrats should be punished for this\nWhile they're going to talk about allegations of no evidence to back it up we can certainly talk about the allegations that have been made against that cat and\nI Will not be what about ism here he's the guy who's about to go on to the Supreme Court should we have a Supreme Court justice who's made those partisan statements\nI think judge Kavanaugh\nA very rightfully so was\nUpset at its use of being a gang rape is that you have to remember the first set of hearing that was that was the job interview this second hearing that was judge Kavanaugh defending his reputation and defending his defending his family I think any human being who had been falsely accused of\nA range of things including ... have the right to be upset and have the right to be angry and that's what we saw\nOn me now he has penned up at Penn as they said have you heard of you wrote an op ed in the wall Street Journal he's got a didn't quite apologize but did say that he got angry and he said quote I said a few things I should not have said not specify what they were what did he say that he shouldn't have said\nOh I think if you're number at the hearing last week can send our club which are gotten to a little bit on a a little discussion a little heated discussion about drinking and I know judge Kavanaugh I regret it uh the way he interacted with a center club which are which is why he apologized you are on the spot but look\nThis is the man who has been accused by by people who do not have any evidence to back up their accusation he was put before the American people to defend himself against really egregious charges and makes complete sense that he was upset at considering a\nThan many many women who have come out and his defense saying what\nCredible person he is not just that the judge but his treatment of women\nAre wondering if we were all very quickly onto things you said no evidence or we have to know if there is sworn testimony by a person who says she's a victim so we can't truthfully say no robbery you rather have an operation per hour\nYou know the thing or you you you said he takes back his statements to Amy Columbus are meaning he doesn't take back on the Clinton conspiracy theory part\nWell he certainly apologize dinner club which I don't want to I don't want to get the ins and outs of a judge Kavanaugh's thoughts on on his testimony but he's certainly apologized their public and again the way judge Kavanaugh's nutrient during this process has opened a disgrace\nGary ... the White House spokesperson thanks for joining us this morning really appreciate it thanks right now and NPR's Tim Mak is covering the story and has been listening along

all she's under a lot of pressure here at home\nA Senator Mitch McConnell the majority leader the Republican leader knows how to really be\nLet me not dance around is quite intimidating to people who defy him and this is a very important vote to him he for decades has wanted to change the composition of the courts too much much more conservative stripe and this is his moment\nUm and and Susan Collins looks\nFrayed when you see her in the Carter is there are lots of\nOf demonstrators here and in Maine she's got a police escort now she spent hours yesterday going ... I think three or four hours going over these reports um she ... you know I Know Susan Collins and she does not look like the normal says and cause you really looks\nAt frayed is the right word you are reminding\nUs of the stakes here this may even be a bigger vote in the very close healthcare vote where John McCain the late John McCain last year famously walked in and did thumbs down this is this is a good deal bigger let's go now to the Senate floor Chuck Grassley the chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee is now giving one of the earliest speeches here on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh let's give it\nA dozen times judge Kavanaugh is also pillar in his community and also on the legal profession he serves underprivileged communities cultures girls' basketball and his elect or at his church here Sean I deep commitment\nTo preparing young lawyers for their careers he has been a law professor at St prestigious law schools and mentor dozens of judicial law clerks this\nShould have been a respectable and dignified confirmation process in a previous era is highly qualified nominee would have received unanimous support the Senate\nBefore or left wing outside groups and democratic leaders had him in their sights judge Kavanaugh possessed an impeccable reputation and was held in high esteem by the bench\nAnd the bar alive even the American bar association which what Democrats say is their gold standard for judging judges\nDa da da na ... well qualified rating was left wing groups and their democratic allies have gone to judge Kavanaugh\nIsn't nothing short of monstrous I saw what they did to Robert Bork I saw what they did to Clarence Thomas that was nothing compared to what we witness here in the last three months\nThe conduct of left wing dark money groups and their allies in this body\nHave shamed us all the fix\nWas in from the very beginning before the was even dry on the nomination the minority leader announced that he would oppose judge Kavanaugh's nomination with everything he's got even before he knew the president's nominee\nMinority leader said that he was opposed to all twenty five well qualified potential nominees listed by this president\nEven one member of my committee said that those who vote to confirm judge Kavanaugh would be quote on quote complicit in evil\nAnother member of the committee reveal the endgame when she suggested that Senate Democrats to hold the vacancy open for two years if they defeated judge Kavanaugh and took control the Senate in these midterm elections\nI saw the most transparent\nI oversaw the most transfer confirmation process in Senate history based on the fact that more than five hundred thousand pages of judicial writing publications documents from judge Kavanaugh's executive branch service\nThis is on top of the three hundred and seven judicial opinions that he offered despite Democrats efforts to bury the committee and even more paperwork the Senate Judiciary committee held a timely for days hearing\nOn judge Kavanaugh's nomination last month\nJudge Kavanaugh testified for more than thirty two hours over the course of three days\nJudge Kavanaugh's showed the nation exactly why he deserved to be on the Supreme Court because of these qualifications judge Kavanaugh's antagonize is couldn't lambda punch on him during all it was just three days of testimony\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa reviewing some of the recent history very painful and very well known to many Americans at this point\nAs we prepare for a vote on cloture ending debate\nOn the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh and I want to go briefly to Kelsey Snell NPR's Kelsey Snell because she is at the United States Senate today and Kelsey you want to back away from Chuck Grassley voice for a moment can you just paint a picture of us who's in there is there is there a big crowd of senators which is not always the case\nActually on the floor for these speeches\nNot yet we're not at that part of the day yet I'm this is kind of a quieter moment the front of his chest open and honest and you really only have one or two senators and end up ... and a little gaggle of pages that the high school students who I spend about a semester here in the capital helping the senators out\nWe expect that people will start filtering in and giving speeches and I will also seen many speeches that are part of this debate that comes after the cloture vote this ... this necessary procedural vote because some senators are saying that they are going to wait until after this procedural vote to tell us how they're going to vote on the final\nConference okay this is important let's underline this this is a vote to end debate\nYou can conceivably say yes I'm ready to end debate but I'm Still not going to vote for the nominee a vote today on the side of Kavanaugh's does not guarantee that you would vote for Kavanaugh in the final votes which I guess might be tomorrow is that what you're telling me\nYeah that that is typically a once this hurdle that we're going to see in less than an hour now\nOnce his hurdle is cleared usually that means that the final vote is it done and but it isn't written in stone so there is a possibility that people could change their minds down the line and I will say that that like I said is quite rare we are expecting some people\nPolluting and you know we're still waiting to hear from Senator Susan Collins and we may hear from her at that time so we date it's one of those things where we're going to have to knock this throughout the day to know exactly what will happen on that final the which will come sometime on Saturday because Senate rules require that they ... about thirty hours after they finished this procedural do today\nAnd David Greene is co hosting our coverage this morning Kelsey I you know I\nWonder if you could talk about how different this moment feels I mean in terms of the procedures and and what we're watching play out it is very familiar you have senators from both parties standing up and being very passionate and talking about how they feel and and there's this era of of disagreement but then he senators you know they all know each other they get along I mean you you've been reporting on how\nThe culture of the Senate feels very different right now I mean to this day and in all this context feel different\nOh absolutely this has been one of them of tense moments that I've seen 'em up here in the capital when as I walked into the Capitol today there are barricades set up ... not knowing that there are barricades set up and there are more police you and then I had seen president on from just about any voted any kind\nIt it's just become one of these major flashpoints of the title isn't that we have talked about American politics for the past year or so\nAnd friends help her make the decision\nIf adopted this argument\nCould rewrite Supreme Court precedent and require courts to determine whether a young woman had a sufficient support network when making her to the decision even in cases as his head and this one where she had gone before a court\nHis reasoning demonstrates the judge Kavanaugh not only is willing to disregard president but his opinions fail to appreciate the challenging realities women face when making these most difficult decisions\nWhen I asked him about whether row and Casey we're settled law and whether they were correctly decided he refused to answer he would only say these cases are entitled to respect\nRomey weight as we all know is one of a series of cases that are held an individual's right to decide who to Mary\nWhere to send your children to school what kind of medical care you can receive at the end of life as well as\nYou're listening to live special coverage from NPR News we're hearing some of the Senate speeches today is where your way to vote on the ending of debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court\nNPR's Kelsey Snell is at the Capitol and listening along with us and tells you just want to know something is Dianne Feinstein the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee begins her speech your\nChuck Grassley of Iowa primarily focused on the lack of evidence against Brett Kavanaugh the accusations that have delayed this nomination and made allegations of democratic conspiracies a left wing groups a shaming us all as Grassley put\nFeinstein has returned to more traditional ground of arguing about Kavanaugh's judicial record on her disagreements with the with the ... and her suspicions that he's been placed on the court to overturn roe versus Wade or something like\nYeah I think that's partially because Democrats have more or less identified a three part strategy about cabinet they want to remind all of their voters that even if they do not weigh in on this if Kavanaugh is confirmed\nThat they fought on both his credentials so the his position particularly on role and on on gun control those are two major issues that Democrats have been talking about\nThey also want to make the argument about that the what we've heard the past several weeks that the issue about his behavior in high school and college and the allegations of sexual misconduct\nAnd the third thing is that they want to focus on the unfairness of this process and the fact that he they believe that he revealed himself to be a partisan during\nThe last hearings so they are going to you're going to hear them throughout the rest of today now on those three ideas because what they want to do is they want to remind voters that and this midterm election coming up is their chance to make a choice about who makes these decisions who has the majority and who should be in control of the house and Senate\nScott Detrow we've really seen that that temperament that partisanship argument pick up in the weeks since the hearing went when Kavanaugh was so confrontational with Democratic senators and that's one reason why\nHe had a remarkable op ed in the wall Street Journal last night saying I may have been too emotional during that time for during the confirmation hearing last week arguing he would be an impartial judge on the bench\nA he said that we couldn't quite say what was that he would have taken back I said some things I shouldn't have said didn't specify let's return to the Senate floor where Dianne Feinstein is still speaking here on here a little bit more of her speech\nHaitian on guns because of widespread ownership in this country I'm also concerned about his views on presidential power\nSpecifically he has said that sitting presidents cannot be indicted cannot be prosecuted should not be investigated and should have the authority to fire a special counsel at\nIn other words the president of the United states is above an outside the law\nThese views raised serious concerns that should concern us hall especially at a time when the president continually threatens to fire the leadership of the department of justice for failing to be loyal and raining in the mall or investigation\nThese views alone or not sufficient for me to vote against judge Kavanaugh but what we have seen and experienced in the past several weeks has raised serious new concerns concerns I Believe shouldn't worry is all\nJudges are expected to be quote even handed unbiased impartial and courteous and quote however\nLast week we saw a man filled with anger and aggression\nJudge Kavanaugh are raised his voice he interrupted senators he accused of damn Democrats of quote lying in wait and quote and replacing quote advice and consent with search and destroy and quote\nHe even went so far as to say that Dr Ford's allegations were nothing more than quote\nA calculated and orchestrated political hit filled with pent up anger about President Trump and the two thousand sixteen election and quote quote revenge on behalf of the Clintons and\nHow could he misbehavior revealed hostility\nAnd belligerent that is on becoming a someone seeking to be elevated to the United States Supreme court his display was so shocking that more than two thousand four hundred law professors from around the country have expressed their opposition\nThey wrote and I quote instead of trying to sort out with reason and care the allegations that were raised judge Kavanaugh responded in an in temperate inflammatory and partial manner as he interrupt\nAnd at times was just courteous\nTo Dianne Feinstein of California making her arguments here before the and vote to end debate on Brett Kavanaugh talking about the judge's temperament during\nHis testimony last week Nina Totenberg what are you learning about\nThat well we saw the Justice John Paul Stevens the retired from the Supreme Court last night he was raised Kevin on the path said he said he'd changed his mind after he saw this performance\nI've talked to some of Kavanaugh's colleagues on the bench on both Republican appointees in democratic Twinkies and they were really shocked by what they call the dropping of a veil they never knew was there\nWhere he talked about a conspiracy to get revenge for the Clintons because he was part of the Ken Starr investigation no evidence for that but that was his view and he said it under oath\nYeah and and they never seen it and were shocked\nOkay Nina Totenberg is going to remain with us as we continue our coverage here today and let's just review very briefly where we are and then in a moment we're going to take a break and continue hearing the speeches here\nContinue hearing the speeches today Charles Grassley of Iowa lead off today alleging that left wing groups have quote shame does all with their effort to stop Brett Kavanaugh he said that Senate investigators had been tracking down virtually all leads and that there was nothing at an FBI report we didn't already know\nAbout Brett Kavanaugh and that it's time to confirm this man Dianne Feinstein speaking right now saying that this is a judge willing to disregard president who believes that the president of the United states is above and outside the law\nAnd the man filled with aggression we'll continue our special coverage on NPR News\nAnd you're listening to eighty nine point three K PCC which will continue with NPR special live coverage of this preliminary belt

are roughly thirty minutes away\nFrom a vote in the United States Senate to end the debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court clears that hurdle the final votes would likely be sometime tomorrow senators are giving some closing arguments now we'll go to one of those and just a few seconds but first NPR's Scott Detrow who's in our studios and who covers\nCongress this year and Scott would you just remind us what the vote tally is so far as anybody knows\nTherefore key votes here who have not said whether whether they're going to vote yes or no that's Republican Susan Collins Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Joe Manchin we know that Joe mansion isn't going to announce his vote until he's on the Senate floor we're hearing indications that is the case for Susan Collins as well\nAnd one key thing to keep in mind is that this is not the final vote the Republicans especially may vote yesterday but not necessarily not not necessarily yes over the weekend good vinyl\nAnd say okay fine I'll end debate but I'm not going to vote for this guy and it sounds like if there's four key votes this has gotta be close they're going to guess forty eight forty nine fifty fifty one maybe fifty two at the absolute most\nAh let's go back to Dianne Feinstein she is the California Democrat who is the senior members senior democratic member on the Senate Judiciary committee and she used to live in her closing argument let's listen to her\nNominated as he was by an executive who just stains the constraints of his office and who is it this very moment the apparent subject of investigations his Supreme Court nominee believes should be invalid\nI met with judge Kavanaugh for almost two hours and I asked him about all of those issues his answers were constantly a vase if an orderly unsatisfactory\nIt was deja vu all over again in the first round of hearings when judge Kavanaugh deliberately avoided talking about his views on roe healthcare presidential accountability and more\nThere was no legal reason rule or logic that prevented him\nFrom being clear and saying what he thought he was a basis because he knows that his views are deeply\nAt odds with the progress America has made over the last century of jurisprudence and at odds with what most Americans believe\nHis performance was not only unfair and frustrating to the Senate\nIt was unfair to the American people when the nominee refuses to disclose their views chances are you have a nominee whose views are far outside the mainstream of America whether they be far right we're far left\nMy colleagues on the other side of the child may not have as grave are concerned about these views as we do but let no American be surprised if judge Kavanaugh\nBecomes a decisive vote to restrict the rights and privileges of the American people while stretching the bounds of privilege for the current occupant of the White House judge Kavanaugh's nomination ultimately does not only encompassed questions of ideology or credentials\nBut questions of character\nHere again judge Kavanaugh falls woefully short of what Americans expected deserve and the Supreme Court justice\nHe has repeatedly misled the Senate about his involvement in some of the most serious controversies of the Bush administration\nIncluding warrantless wiretapping of American citizens or policy against torture the theft of electronic records from Democratic senators and his involvement in the nomination very controversial judges\nFaced with credible allegations of various types of misconduct\nJudge Kavanaugh's credibility was again tested and he continued to assemble and even prevent advocate about easily refuted facts\nBeyond the issue of credibility judge Kavanaugh presented to the Senate the bitter is parties in testimony I have ever heard coming from a candidate seeking the Senate's approval whether they be for the bench or the executive branch\nNow there are many who thinks that what happened when judge Kavanaugh was Seventeen years old should not be this positive even if you believe that\nHis actions at age fifty three in terms of demeanor partisanship\nAnd above all credibility should be dispositive\nJudges at every level of the federal bench should be held to the highest standard of ethics and morals character judges at every level\nShould be judicious incredible and independence but especially especially on the Supreme Court\nI Do not see how it's possible for my colleagues to say with perfect confidence that judge Kavanaugh has the temperament independence and credibility to serve on the United States Supreme court\nSo I asked my colleagues on the other side of the aisle why judge Kavanaugh\nThere is no dictate that you have to Marge blindly forward with a nominee when there are there is available to you there are many judges who I Am sure conservatives would be happy to have on the court\nI'd remind my colleagues the seat that Brett Kavanaugh aspires to feel was held by a justice who assumed the bench after one nominee was voted down by the Senate and the second nominee withdrew his nomination\nBut the Republican majority has press forward blindly on judge Kavanaugh\nEven when brave women came forward to speak truth to power why for what costs for the sake of winning that's not reason enough\nMy colleagues on the other side\nIf you have any doubts about judge Kavanaugh's credibility about his ability to tell the truth about his ability to be impartial in nonpartisan no matter what you think of his jurisprudence or what he may or may not have done in high school in college\nYou should not vote to confirm him to the Supreme Court\nSo my friends Democrat and Republican for all the controversy all the heavy handed Mr the process all the hyperbole and vilification above sides\nThere's always hope that the Senate and save itself we can salvage some decency here at the end\nIf judge Kavanaugh was rejected President Trump will select another nominee likely right of center probably not to my liking but without the cloud that hangs over this nominee and we can proceed to consider that nominee and much less\nBetter much better less parties in way a bipartisan majority of senators considering fully the weight of judge Kavanaugh's testimony record credibility trustworthiness and temperament\nConsidering fully heartbreaking testimony or doctor Christine Blasey Ford can vote to reject judge Kavanaugh's nomination and asked the president\nTo say in the Senate another name for the sake of the Senate of the Supreme\nCourt ended up America I Hope I pray my colleagues will do so [noise]\nThat's Charles Schumer the Senate minority leader and we're waiting on Mitch McConnell the majority leader next Charles Schumer\nMaking the point argument arguing the Democrats have not delayed this nomination divisions among Republicans have done so those listening to this speech and others include David Axelrod former adviser to President Obama he's now on the line Mr ... good morning good morning what are you hearing there [noise]\nWell look I think uh there is a lot of a sound and fury on both sides about this nomination but there's only one thing that matters which is how a a a very few number of senators are going to vote and\nTo me the indications are that a judge Kavanaugh will be justice Kavanaugh by by the end of this weekend\nOK bottom line there now Mitch McConnell has taken to the floor of the Senate majority leader so let's bring that up and give a listen to that thanks to\nToday the Senate has the opportunity to advance his nomination every one of us will go on record was one of the most consequential votes you ever cash and the Senate now the stakes are always hot for Supreme Court nomination\nBut college the extraordinary events of regional wage have raised them even higher this time\nWhen we vote later this morning\nWe will not only be deciding whether the elevator stunningly well qualified to judge shore high court\nNot any more not after all this United States Senate will also be making a shape whether the states that partisan politics can override the presumption of innocence\nOr will reaffirm that in the United states of America everyone is innocent until proven guilty will either state the facts and evidence can simply be brushed aside line politically inconvenient\nAnd signal that media bullying and mob intimidation are valid tactics for shaping the Senate\nThe mob can attack and the Senate cage all will sign up and say that serious thoughtful fact based deliberation will still define this body\n\nWill either give notice that totally uncorroborated allegations are now officially officially enough to destroy an American fly\nOr will declare that our society cannot must not\nUntil that accuser walked her story that\nWe were informed that judge Kavanaugh beat someone up on a boat in Rhode Island harbor until that accused are totally ... we are in another tall tale of physical assault until that account was thoroughly debunked by sitting federal jobs\nOn yes we were informed a juvenile jokes and his high school yearbook were actually senator secret references\nOh the Keystone Cops were on the case\nKeystone Cops were on the case\nMadam president and Senate Democrats cheered them all\nMay read parts of this I'm corroborated unbelievable mudslide mudslide end of the Senate record\nThey sided them and unofficial letter demanding a judge Kavanaugh's nomination be withdrawn\nWhere are they true\nWell of course that was quite beside the point\nQuite beside the point so long as they were\nSaying you are listening to the nine point three in the the the\nFact free verdict of the mob and the media would wet out over the actual evidence make sure the mob prevail\nUncorroborated mud and the partisan noise and the physical intimidation of members here in the Senate will not have the final say around here\nThe Senate will have the final so I'm pregnant we're almost at the end of the runway\nAcross rounds of anger and fear and party and she'll have blown strong these past weeks they've harmed a good man\nAnd his family they've tarnished the dignity of this institution\nBut all of it going to end it at the time has come to vote for senator stands on the threshold of a golden opportunity we have the opportunity to advance the nomination of an incredibly well qualified and well respected journalists who oppose that demands such actually we\nHave the opportunity to put judge Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court or has the same service will make us in our nation proud\nFor years to come but we have the opportunity to do even more\nToday we can send a message to the American people that some core principles remain unfettered by the partisan\nPassions of this moment facts matter fairness matter the presumption of innocence is sacrifice\nThe senator started back on these things before ... but never for law and never without deep regret\nThis after Tucson does outlook back proudly on the era of Joseph McCarthy nor on any of the other times on the politics of personal destruction poison is judgment no no the Senate looks back on those things was shot\nAnd when the conviction that we cannot go down that road again\nWe know the Senate is better than this when all of the nation deserves better than this back and farming judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court this brilliant jurist will be charged with upholding the rule of law and honoring American injustice\nWe must hold ourselves to that very same standard we must seized a golden opportunity before us today the confirming Supreme Court justice who will make us proud\nAnd reaffirm our own commitment to the justice that every single American\nDeserves\n[noise] has a room that's Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader the Republican leader wearing a red tie with spectacles reading from his speech adjust now calling hit the vote that we're about to hear about today one of the most consequential votes you've ever had\nThat is what he described let's listen to the uh the action on the floor now\nTo be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United states sent by Seventeen senators\nAnonymous bin ... is there an objection\nWithout any action by unanimous consent the mandatory quorum call has been weighed the question is is it the sense that the Senate that debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh of Maryland to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court shall be brought to close\nThe ... the nays are mandatory under the rule the clerk will call the roll history Alexander\n... Baldwin\nOkay recalling the role this is not formally when the votes will be registered that will take a little while\nUh but we will learn over the next number of minutes how this vote has turned out\nWe should mention the speeches we've just heard are effectively speeches in one sense for an audience of four because they're only about four lawmakers maybe another that we don't quite know about\nWho are in any way undecided here or Murkowski of Alaska flake of Arizona Collins of Maine Manchin of West Virginia NPR's Scott Detrow has been following their progress there's some news about Susan Collins\nYeah we've been seeing on MORNING that this is a key test vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination but it is not necessarily the final tally Susan Collins confirmed that saying she is going to vote yes this morning on Kavanaugh but that she will announce her final decision on this weekend's final vote later today\nPeople just joining us may ask wait a minute what final decision if she's voting yes isn't that a yes\nThat is usually the case but there are lots of moments where where senators will vote to advance the nomination to a final vote and then change their mind to the last moment most high profile example of that John McCain last\nYear round care because we just heard the question on the floor is is it the sense of the Senate that were done with debate in effect to paraphrase what the resolution is that they're voting on you can vote to end debate and still vote against the nominee\nIf you should want to do that there is one ah let's give a listen actually to some of what Susan Collins has been saying today she spoke briefly to reporters off the Senate floor\nI Will be voting yes\nOn the head that final confirmation vote and I will announce may influence and sign out to vote later today\nAnd uh you hear everyone tried to get in one more question there Susan Collins leaving us in suspense for a few more hours another person on that list of for Joe Manchin the only Democrat from West Virginia a Scott has he been paying attention to those speeches this morning\nHe's been paying very close attention we know that Joe mansion spent more than an hour and that secure room in the Senate today rereading that report he went to the Senate floor not necessarily giving away his hands on how will vote but we are seeing that just now one of those undecided senators Jeff Flake did appear to vote I on cloture\nAgain that may not necessarily be his final though we know that flake was initially inclined to to support judge Kavanaugh before he changed his mind last I'm just\nNow in either way mentioned by the way it was it went to the hearings and sat there for hours of testimony that cabinet\nAnd just today than looking again that that FBI report looking at every detail\nThat he possibly could I'm just trying to keep count share a little bit Scott Detrow if a flake is yes at least on cloture if Collins is aghast at least on cloture doesn't it look like the Republicans have fifty which would be the bare minimum fifty one vice president Pence had to break a tie there there is that correct\nOr two no votes sink the nomination if if either Murkowski or mentioned votes for cloture then yes disadvantages too is that okay so we're\nStill one vote short or they are still one vote short that as the situation\nThat's right in this bill may drag out but this is a more formal vote than usual you see the senator sitting at their desk standing up and announcing their votes which very rarely happens in the United states give a listen to some of\nThat this bring that up and give a listen Maria and\nMs Murkowski Mr Murphy\nOkay silence on Murkowski because she's not there yet or\nUnclear if she's not there yet most will do it if their names are called in this more normal setting but are these votes can drag out again I go back to that ... vote to repeal Obamacare where there's lots of last minute drama if you know you're getting the deciding vote you may let it play out before you cast your deciding\nAbsolutely and we do see a number of senators that they're ... very often this voting period is a time when you see senators looking quite college or they'll be standing and not just people you'll see a hand on the back you'll see people you had to close conversation or you don't see any of that today which matches in some sense the sobriety of this moment doesn't it\nAbsolutely aren't even before all of the controversy of the last few weeks voting for a Supreme Court justice is one of the most formal you know historical things to do\nNPR's Ron Elving has seen many of these votes in the past and Iran I Want to ask you about one of the many characters in this drama we just heard a moment ago from Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader he has made himself central\nA two one historic debate after another for close to two decades now across the administrations of several presidents and if he manages to get this nomination through to confirmation it would be another significant move for Mitch McConnell yes and to some degree you would make up\nOr the narrow defeat he suffered a year ago when John McCain cast that or an addict thumbs down vote on the repeal of Obamacare of this would be the combination\nThat charge all we always was and it was always directed by McConnell in consultation with Jim let's get a nominee fast let's get him yet and get him here like ... or her here early in September and use it to as a club for Democrats who are up for re election in red state\nNow just mentioned as we're talking we have the line open to the Senate floor so when the presiding officer opens the microphone to announce the final count and everybody's now recorded at fifty one forty nine we will hear that\nAre Ron Elving is listening along with us it does appear though that the vote unless something dramatically changes his last second it's fifty one to forty nine it's actually one vote more than they would need ride Ron Elving\nThat's right because if there had been a tie which we do not have that would be broken by vice president Mike Pence who has the constitutional power to break tie we'll say let's give a listen approval or disapproval\nAre not permitted in the Senate galleries\n\nThat was just a reminder of from the gallery here let's see if more set on this vote the yeas are fifty one that knows are forty nine the motion is agreed to\nFifty one forty nine the gab all comes down Brett Kavanaugh advances to a final vote in the United States Senate there you have a cloture fifty one to forty nine or not the closest vote in the history of the Supreme Court Nina Totenberg pretty close to the closest\nI think the closest for some time in the Eighteen hundreds but this is this uh this is a one vote difference a Clarence Thomas was confirmed by it to vote margin and there are senators who who said afterwards\nThat had they known it was that close that they could have made a difference and I think it was ... were in Redmond in Bill Cohen we're prepared to vote against Thomas huh but Bob Dole\nAre said to them I've got the votes and they figured I Need other stuff from do I like an ... and I am so they are they went ahead now don't may have had more votes in his pocket that he didn't need to fall maybe there were eleven Democrats who voted for finance them is maybe had another one\nBut in any case he got up into the mid fifties and here we have fifty one it's not the final vote but it's hard to see on the final vote this going much higher than fifty one\nVery hot and we know I in fact we don't know that he'll get fifty one absolutely because senators can vote differently on the final measure in a moment I'm hoping to go outside of the United states Capitol hear what the response has been to protesters of this news as I'm sure the news is spreading very rapidly outside the United states Capitol\nUh I'd like to ask Ron Elving about having having studied the history of all this is you have what your senses of this moment\nOne moment at this one fought at this particular moment is that those ten senators we were just mentioning who are Democrats running in states yeah Donald Trump one and twenty sixteen nine of the ten have voted against cloture Joe mansion was the lone\nA Democrat to vote for cloture and he is one of those ten even though it is also necessary to say that he seems not to be in as much trouble as some of the others he seems to be on his way to re election but he did not want to be apparently the Democrat who made it a tie vote\nTo be the corresponding a vote that would have forced Mike Pence to break that particular tie a but in historical terms of this is quite unusual because until last year if you had fifty one or forty nine votes in this case\nAgainst culture you did not get cloture that's right used to be you had to have sixty votes and and when we talk about Mitch McConnell and his ... significant maneuverings over the years none is more important than his decision to change the filibuster rules so that it would apply\nThat that the filibuster would not apply or not be usable when we came to Supreme Court nominees you change that last year for Neil Gorsuch and now of course it's still in\nPlace I Want to take notice something that you just said there Ron Elving because you said that there are ten Democrats who are seen as vulnerable who are in states that voted for Donald Trump who might see some advantage in voting for the Supreme Court nominee and nine of them chose to vote no and the one who did choose to vote yes seemed to have an option he could have voted no but he decided that he wanted to vote\nYes we presume that so many of these lawmakers so much of the time or making shameless short term political calculations are\nThe evidence is overwhelming that that is very often drew and yet it is not necessarily always true and we heard just yesterday Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota who is extremely vulnerable uh who seems possibly on her way to a defeat\nWho chose to vote no announced or no vote and the immediate political analysis was well there goes her Senate reelection\nBut China and she said what she said was this isn't a political vote I just couldn't face myself when I got up in the morning if I voted that way they just you know I've known to many other women like this\nAnd and she is behind in North Dakota by a smile about as much as you mentioned is ahead in West Virginia so these are different calculations look at somebody like Claire McCaskill in Missouri whose races absolutely neck and neck she also chose to vote no\nAnd a number of these Democrats did vote for Neil Gorsuch he got three democratic votes isn't that right and you know I think that's I think he got three democratic votes\nAnd um and it was assumed that those people would be under tremendous pressure to vote yes again on another Trump nominee even if he were conservative as Brett Kavanaugh is until we got to the allegations of sexual assault and that raised a whole new set of questions\nAnd so did the cabin up performance at the hearing it wasn't just Christine Blasey Ford who was I think by what the Republicans on the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee said they believed her they just didn't believe it was Brett Kavanaugh the president\nOf the United states admitted that she was a credible with yeah so they decided to let them\nRead Kavanaugh's performance which she\nSort of kinda apologize for in the wall Street Journal editorial that performance was unlike anything anybody had ever seen by a nominee I think that's one thing that a Chuck Schumer said that is absolutely on debatable um there were things that both\nSchumer and McConnell set in their closing arguments that I thought were poignantly true for the country for the Senate\nFor the shambles that this was I don't think this was a one way street by any means nobody comes away from this either side with completely clean hands but\nIt it devolved I'm at the end into the worst spectacle imaginable for the Supreme Court of the United states uh and its standing\nWhich is really only a almost an emotional standing that it has that people follow what it says because they believe in it and for the Senate if the United\nWell let's review some of the remarks that were made in those speeches before the fifty one forty nine voted to advance Kavanaugh's nomination Chuck Schumer of New York described Kavanaugh's testimony as the bitter wrist partisan testimony in memory he said that this was a nominee had hard right conservative George jurisprudence\nAnd then the dam broke there were questions about him according to Schumer and the dam broke with credible allegations of sexual assault decades ago while he was in high school\nA completely opposite picture painted by Mitch McConnell of Kentucky saying that hidden sinister meanings had been found an innocent statements by Kevin on the past that he suffered great indignity\nThat there was no corroborating evidence against him that many of the charges were nonsense and he told senators this is one of the most consequential votes you've ever had\nAnd it's a vote that went for Kevin ... this is special coverage from NPR News\nAnd our special coverage continues and the eight o'clock hour you're listening to eighty nine point three K PCC I'm Suzanne ... late and the Senate has decided to advance Kavanaugh's nomination fifty one two forty nine

Southern California learned more Pasadena dot edu\n\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where a dramatic vote has just taken place\nIn the U.S Senate and the nomination to the Supreme Court of President Trump's choice Brett Kavanaugh it was an extremely close vote and the west Virginia senator who was the presiding officer today Republicans ah ah choose choose the presiding officer and was Shelley Moore capital of West Virginia let's give a listen\nOn this vote the age of fifty one that knows are forty nine the motion is agreed to\nFifty one to forty nine as the gavel goes down almost as close as it could be if it had been a fifty fifty tie we presume that vice president Mike Pence would have come in\nAnd broken that time fifty one to forty nine almost entirely along partisan lines the one Democrat who voted for Kavanaugh is Joe Manchin of West Virginia the one Republican who voted against Kavanaugh is Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nAnd we should emphasize before we begin our discussion here this is what's called a cloture vote this is not the final vote this was a vote to end the debate a kind of test\nBut not an absolute test because senators could choose to vote differently if they feel moved to do so when the final vote comes tomorrow\nWas a recent round of polling just in the past\nTwenty four hours or so were they asked people are you more or less likely in these battleground states yeah are you more or less likely to vote for somebody uh for the incumbent if they voted no on Kavanaugh and what was most interesting to me\nIs that uh in almost every one of those cases the I'm no difference actually one out and in some cases very decisively that the Kavanaugh vote would actually have no difference in how\nVoters were planning a ... and it would have no impact on their vote\nWhich sort of makes sense doesn't it because normally you get to a mid term people are not that engaged maybe they haven't been paying attention to politics but surely maybe not the whole country but a very large percentage percentage of the country has been been paying far closer attention to our politics for the last couple of years then would normally be the case\nI I think that's right and one last point I'd make on this though is that in mid term elections traditionally\nOne of the biggest motivators has been anger [noise]\nUh and so which side is going to be angry or come election day over this will be interesting and I think part of that could be how how tomorrow turns out if Kavanaugh wins narrowly there will be a tremendous amount of negative energy on the left that could help Democrats\nUh on mid term election day if he's defeated ... there's an argument to me made that it could swing the other the other way\nBut there is no question right now that this issue has harnessed a lot of anger on both sides\nWill stay with us for a moment because I Want to bring in NPR's to medical mountain are all into this political discussion and here's something that's on my mind to medical we know from an NPR survey and other surveys that Republicans who were not as enthused have become a lot more enthused at least according to the NPR survey\nHow are Democrats viewing this oh no we just blew it or just one more thing to deal with\nDemocrats have been fired up for the entire year and I think what was significant about the survey is not use our Republicans and their level of enthusiasm and whether or not they see the congressional elections this year as very important spike and really all you know all these changes I talked to\nA you know attribute that to the Kavanaugh's confirmation and especially among Republican men\nI think that the issue here is going to be whether or not that's a temporary spike and you know his cabinet gets through ... does not dissipate does do people move on from that and do they see that that these elections with less urgency or do they hold on to that\nIt's probably something in between which is usually what happens and also after Labor Day you tend to see\nA lot more of these groups that seemed sideline become more energized and Republican groups generally are the types of groups that become more energized I'm are more likely to vote in these elections\nMolly thing is it fair to observe normally we would say we're just a month away from the election but given the speed of the news cycle and the amount of news and they were three or four years away from the election if that's what\nYeah that's right there's like Seventeen lifetimes between now and election day [noise] uh and if there's one thing twenty sixteen uh taught us it is that\nWhat seems a certainty at any given moment or is it a a certainty and so there's plenty of time for both sides to make their case on this uh and who who knows what else is going to come up there\nI Would not be surprised if there's an entirely new issue that's not on anyone's radar screen that becomes more determinative collection\nMore lazy democratic strategist he's at Georgetown thanks so much really appreciate it thank you one of the voices we've heard as the vote was prepared for and then cast today I'm fifty one forty nine votes to advance the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the final vote which we'd expect tomorrow one of the voices we heard\nWas Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer who delivered a speech on the Senate floor of this morning\nA bipartisan majority of senators considering fully the weight of judge Kavanaugh's testimony record credibility trustworthiness and temperament\nConsidering fully heartbreaking testimony a doctor Christine Blasey Ford and vote to reject judge Kavanaugh's nomination and asked the president\nTo sit in the Senate another name for the sake of the center of the Supreme\nCourt ended up America I Hope I pray my\nColleagues will do so\nColleagues did not that's Chuck Schumer speaking just before a vote that came down to fifty one forty nine in favor of Brett Kavanaugh moving to that final round that final vote which is expected tomorrow let's bring on someone who downloads feels differently about that vote than Senator Schumer did\nTrotter is a spokeswoman for the Judicial Crisis network a conservative group that has campaigned against abortion and on other issues can mourning\nMourning so you are just the way you said good morning you sound happy\nYes it's been a long process and I just want to take this opportunity to thank senator Collins Senator Flake and than senator Manchin to vote to move them a card for very long and excruciating confirmation process to a final that\nNow with that said let me ask about the point that Charles Schumer just raised he essentially argued that whatever you think of bread Kevin uh we have damage to the institution of the Senate we've damage the institution of the Supreme Court by moving forward with someone who does not\nEnjoy a broad consensus of opinion even though you agree with judge Kavanaugh even though you favor judge Kavanaugh is there some damage to moving somebody without a consensus like this\nThere's been a lot of damage to the Supreme Court through this process and through the reputation of the Senate or don't we saw that before any of these allegations were ever raised we thought in the\nTwo hundred people who are arrested during the hearing the original thirty one hours that judge Kavanaugh testified we thought through the constant and an interruption by senator Kamala Harris and senator buck her\nWe thought through the questioning a judge Kavanaugh and the delay tactics used by the Senate Democrats so I Would agree with Senator Schumer that there has been a lot of\nCollateral damage through this process but I think that that was part of the intention that a Senator Schumer said before President Trump even a relief released the name of judge Kavanaugh as\nHis Supreme Court nominee and Senator Schumer said that they were going to oppose President Trump's eventual nominee by any means necessary\nCourse he knew that the nominee would be from a list that was approved by a conservative activist group would be a nominee nominated by president who said he expected his nominees to automatically overturn roe versus Wade in the thirty or so seconds we have before this break I'd just like to know Kevin loaded and say I'm going to overturn roe versus Wade\nBut do you anticipate that he would have an opportunity to do that or something close to it\nNever met one issue and I but let's ask about that one issue here\nNo one can say that an issue that was used against Sandra Day O'Connor upheld Ravi way that was used against senator\nAnthony Kennedy who judge Kavanaugh is going to replace them be another great justice and at the at a scare tactic used against justices you don't put politics first but instead are faithful to the constitution the independent it didn't work with judge Justice O'Connor it didn't work with Justice Kennedy it shouldn't work with ...\n... what we think will be just as a cabin on\n... thanks for taking the time I really appreciate and yeah it's great to be with\nYou she's with the Judicial Crisis network this is special coverage from NPR News\nOn eighty nine points three key PCC President Trump tweeted minutes ago this message very proud of the U.S Senate for voting yes to advance the

nowhere else to see more women in LA choose either cyanide for breast cancer treatments call one eight hundred meters one\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where we had been listening in the last little while to a historic vote on the floor of the United States Senate\nThe vote was fifty one forty nine the fifty one goes in favor of Brett Kavanaugh President Trump's nominee to serve on the Supreme Court he's not quite there yet this was a vote to end the debate and then the final vote\nComes tomorrow we would anticipate a final vote that may go exactly the same way fifty one to forty nine but senators are by no means obligated to vote the same way and sometimes they do\nVote differently on final passage than they would on ending to big as a matter of fact one Senator Susan Collins of Maine has specifically said that she voted yes this morning to advance the nomination but that she would give a different statements sometime later today perhaps around three o'clock\nAs to what her actual vote would be on the floor tomorrow so there is still some degree of doubt but it appears that Brett Kavanaugh is on his way a vote that Senator Mitch McConnell the majority leader on the Republican side said was one of the most consequential votes\nBut the Senate has ever had that's the way that he framed this vote Charles Schumer the Democrat of New York said that this was a vote for a justice who has a record of hard right conservative jurisprudence who was a doubtful nominee even before there were allegations of sexual assault\nThey're going to point it is Republican appointees by Republican presidents okay so it might be difficult to do that we'll have to see Carrie cubic is on the line she has a White House spokesperson and of course has been following the story closely mourning\nMourning so uh I'm presuming you're happy with the result that it was a yes rather than to know what do you think about the fact that it was so close fifty one forty nine\nWell you know we're certainly optimistic are happy to vote is it an sang unlucky senator obviously I make the decision they think is fast but the White House obviously believe that we couldn't ... ... e or qualified person to sit\nOur us up in court or could you take a moment to answer people who are on the opposite side of the aisle here perhaps even some of the protesters who are outside of the Capitol today who find this\nAs a blow to women as a rebuke to women or do you do you acknowledge that there is some merit in their arguments someone made credible allegations against this nomination is advancing anyway\nAnd certainly important to listen to everyone and debate I'd I'd probably have the public hearing about why the White House\nA combination of class to us supplemental update you got to have an outback Ron jak and I think we've been pretty trapped in an hour we have been listening to everyone and that's a conversation\nThat we have to go back to the facts here and that that that accusation that leveled against judge Kavanaugh are are uncorroborated in fact I think Senator Grassley had a statement saying\nThat after reviewing the FBI or for that is not even a hint of misconduct and that's all that well\nLet's stay with me for a moment I Want to play a little bit of tape here this is from one of the four speeches that were given on the Senate floor before the fifty one forty nine vote this morning Dianne Feinstein as a Democrat from California ... she is the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee and here's part of what she had to say\nHe even went so far as to say that Dr Ford's allegations were nothing more than quote\nA calculated and orchestrated political hit healed with pent up anger about President Trump and the two thousand sixteen election and quote quote revenge on behalf of the Clintons and\nHow quickly this behavior revealed hostility and belligerent that is on becoming someone seeking to be elevated to the United States Supreme court\nDianne Feinstein of course there was talking about Brett Kavanaugh talking about his testimony in which he refuted the allegations against him it was said a first that this was exactly the tone that President Trump wanted that he wanted a defiant tone out of his nominee is that true\nBut I think that gets tired and I would certainly justified and then go splat and frustration to flying emotion I got second after a member of that that was judge Kavanaugh's\nInterview for a job this ... this second hearing was judge Kavanaugh defending his reputation defending a family and defending against all allegations that I think I agree to gain weight so it made sense like judge Kavanaugh was pushing back in the way that he said\nYou know some people are just gonna stop you there for one second the gang rape allegation isn't quite true there was a woman who said that he was present in some way for a gang rape and she was someone who was never\nA particularly her cause was never particularly embraced by any of the Senate Democrats or the ... you've taken a an allegation that is pretty extreme made it a little more so um and it wasn't really embraced by Democrats is that really want with Kevin all faced\nA well actually I was an\nAllegation and change the story a number of times where the guy and including the gang rape was always a common denominator within her accusation that means that that was part of the whole package that allegations leveled against judge Kavanaugh I also after and then we also have you acknowledge the fact\nThat women have\nCome out defending Kavanaugh's treatment of women at you know their personal experiences within ranging from past high school girlfriend the past and present colleagues in South these are women who have praised judge Kavanaugh's respectful treatment high treatment of women I Am you know these are these are also the voices and said well\nTerry ... is a White House spokesperson and has been with us twice throughout our coverage here this morning really appreciate your coming to the line twice thanks thanks and good to talk with you and again the headline news here is a fifty one forty nine votes fifty one to forty nine of the United States Senate\nIn favor of Brett Kavanaugh President Trump's Supreme Court nominee this is not the final vote as we've set a few times but it's good to emphasize\nThe final vote is likely to come tomorrow this was a vote to end debate and debate is now ended at least on the floor of the United States Senate but surely not in the country at large and in a few seconds to medical ... is it fair to anticipate that this vote is going to be much discussed as congressional candidates make their final pitches over the next few weeks\nAbsolutely this is going to be a big part of the final push in these final in his final months before election day and it is just setting up what essentially looks like going to be something of a cultural train crash at the voting booths this fall\nAnd will continue covering the train crash whenever and wherever it might happen you are listening to special coverage of the
