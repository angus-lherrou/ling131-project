Berliner with us this morning or hey what's going on why the drop\nGood morning well there there are a lot of things that are going on right now um\nOne is that you know we've had a decidedly sour mood take over the market in the last few days yes in the five hundred is falling five straight days it got a lot worse yet because a lot worse yesterday and on the NASDAQ where a lot of the tech stocks are traded it was even worse so it was down more than four percent\nAnd ... isn't really that surprising because\nThe big technology companies they lead this long rally they really power to you know the the names you know Facebook Amazon apple Netflix a Google alphabet which is ... ... they've led this rally um but since the beginning of the month they started to fall off some of those stocks are really struggling\nSo President Trump is blaming the fed of presumably because they raise interest rates can you explain the connection here [noise]\nRight well so the fed has raised interest rates eight times in the last three years it started from a very low base\nRates were basically zero for a long time so it's steadily started to to raise rates as the economy improved as a recovered with the intention of keeping inflation in check ins recovery and keeping the economy on an even keel\nUm but that Russian interest rates makes borrowing costs more expensive for companies for people and it can have the effect of ... of somewhat slowing the recovery\nUm and the president as we heard in there say that he thinks the fed has gone crazy he Clinton clearly disagrees he wants the fed to prop up uh the economy by keeping interest rates low explain why that's not necessarily a great idea\n[noise] well I mean it's not uncommon for for presidents to complain about the fed or to be unhappy\nWith the ... when they raise rates especially if it's any time a close to an election what is unusual for president to say the fed is gone crazy um that's really unusual ah\nIf the fed has a policy where it's trying to keep this recovery going it's trying to keep inflation so I get once a steady economy um if you keep rates very low there's the potential the economy could overheat and fall back into recession\nRight and of course we know President Trump talks a lot about the stock market as an indicator of whether or not the overall economy is healthy and it is it isn't necessarily the best indicator but as you mentioned the elections coming up so it matters to him a lot I'm\nSure does I mean he's talked throughout his administration and how about how great the economy has been or how great the stock market has been he's taken a lot of credit for that now if the stock market does go into a downturn it will be interesting to see how explains that and what what do you think's cost isn't isn't that\nNPR senior business editor Uri Berliner for us Thanks Ari thanks [noise] All right we're learning more this morning about what might have happened to the missing Saudi journalist ... he went inside the Saudi conflict in is down built it stand bolt turkey last week and he has not been seen sense\nAnd here's one new thing we have learned the Washington Post is reporting that at one point the crown prince of Saudi Arabia ordered agents to learn because she'll be back to Saudi Arabia from his home in the United states Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said yesterday that if if the Saudi Government was behind she'll get disappearance that would be quote a game changer\nI've never been more disturb them right now if this did in fact happened if this man was murdered in Saudi conflict is simple step across every line of normality in the international community um if it did happen it would be hell to pay\nThe Saudi officials are continuing to deny any involvement in the show disappearance\nAll right we have reached Korean so he and he is the Washington Post correspondent in ... who's been following this story closely Corinne can you just explain what exactly you have learned that U.S intelligence officials new\nHigh yeah thanks for having me as my colleague Shane Harris reported today in our paper the or\nThe U.S officials are citing intelligence intercepted Saudi officials discussing this plot to lure them out back to Saudi Arabia we don't know for what purpose exactly um the and you know Jim out and told friends over the last year about\nNumerous attempts either Saudi officials are people close to the Saudi government's confirming some version of this story that he was offered jobs um or or a short that he would be safe if he returns to the kingdom\nSo we're still learning more about this but it did add detail to a a while we might know about what happened in the consulate here in this stumble\nBecause we should just say he has been a vocal critic of ... of the Saudi Government and had been living in a in the Washington DC area I mean do we know if the U.S intelligence officials gave him a heads up that they knew that that someone in Saudi was trying to get him back there perhaps to do harm to him\nNo we don't we know that um the details of this plot appear to have been widely\nCirculated around the intelligence community but we we have no evidence yet that he was warned\nAbout this plots and there's some debate about whether there was an obligation to tell them\nSo you are reporting you and your colleagues are reporting the basically what what seems to have happened in ... temple his disappearance there at this how the conflict in temple may have been plan B if they couldn't lure him back from the U.S to Saudi this what ... ... a disappearance and assemble may have may have been a the subsequent plan\nThat that's certainly one theory I mean the Turkish officials since the beginning of this case to maintain that what happened inside look to them like a premeditated killing\n'em but others are saying now that some some of the details from these intelligence in search that I'm a make it seem like make it seem possible that it also may have\nBeen an attempt to capture him and bring him back to Saudi Arabia\nI mean this is clearly complicated for the Trump Administration which has very close ties to Saudi Arabia and Mohammed bin some on the crown prince known as NBS I mean in particular you report he's got a really close relationship with Jared Kushner\nAbsolutely the um the uh the Trump Administration has a very close\nTies with a mom had been some men\nAnd they really promoted his vision hum of a transformation for the kingdom\nAnd so uh this whole episode has highlighted or the other part of mom and been some man's rule which has been um in a escalating repression dissidents hum and silencing descent\nSo we'll see if the Trump Administration if someone is is it seemed to be responsible for this plot if the Trump Administration would put sanctions on Saudi Arabia [noise] um we still appreciate you sharing your reporting Corinne ... of the Washington Post based in

European Union's breakfast negotiator says with good will on both sides in agreement on Britain's departure from the European Union is quote within reach and this comes ahead of a very important summit in Brussels next week\nLots of Newman Linder grant is a former diplomat who worked on the breakfast negotiations for both Finland and use unit in Brussels joins me on Skype right now good morning\nGood whining so is this for real I Know we've heard that the two sides have been close to something in a ... kind of falling apart what makes this moment feel different if at all\n[noise] uh I think it is for ... and one of the things that makes it different of course at the time is getting very nice if there is no choice to get a deal at all the deal is also a prerequisite for any sort of a trance a transition period\nSo if there is no deal then everything's going to happen overnight so I think at both sides have a very great interest in in a deal\nAnd then what is the deadline thing as the deadline I mean breakfast is going to take place at the end of march but before that you're going to have to rectify the deal in all twenty seven you parliaments and the British Parliament and the European Parliament on you have to translate it and process it so\nYou would have to be ready during November I think for it to be feasible to pull through\nYour the traffic going to like two dozen different languages yes as I could be fifty a lot of time okay you're going to say there is the second reason it's actually happening\nI think the second reason is is that that I mean one of the big problems in these negotiations from the beginning has been that it's been taken UK so long to arrive to any position and it's been negotiating just as much much with itself as it has with the new at this summer we actually got this so called check our proposal from the u._k. prime minister\nAt when it was the first time that they actually made a a comprehensive package of how they see\nThemselves leaving and what the new relationship could be an although the checkers deal was not acceptable as such I think it was really important that that was a basis for negotiations to go forward\nYou know a lot of people in Europe were just telling the u._k. just come up with something so we can get started in ... acts of working extremely frustrating I think for many parties can I ask you about one\nSticking point um there's this determination to avoid a hard border between Ireland which is part of you in Northern Ireland which is part of your cake and you just remind us why that is so important not to have a hard border there\nI think many people in in Europe forget and how recently actually the real a peace settlement was made in in regard Northern Ireland uh this is all about the so called Good Friday agreement which is from only Nineteen eighty nine the peace agreement between um the u._k. and and the Irish government's\nAnd many of these elements depend on the fact that both areas are part of the few so if you think about free movement of people are goods across the border people being able to live where they want\nAt all all of these elements which have to do with the integration of the area and they are about that you\nFound out when a when if if I went in Northern Ireland is leaving a there is a real risk and that what is happening underground or can can hamper the implementation of disagreement and it can possibly cause a lot of a conflict or locally\nAnd and among workers would just have a few seconds left but I mean there's been talk of maybe a new referendum and the u._k. backing out of a breakfast if there were vote would you take Britain back\nThe used I mean the u._k. is still a member of that you are but it's not the same ... that he was two years ago I think a lot of China has been broken during these negotiations\nTrying to describe it like a a divorce but um yeah I think I think what we're we have to\nLeave her out of time and have to stop there are a lot of Newman ... is a former diplomat who worked on the recommendation thanks a lot\nThank you so much have a good day Democrats have a slender path to taking the U.S Senate this fall they need to pick up two seats to gain a majority but they also have to defend plenty of seats including one in New Jersey where incumbent Democrat Bob Menendez is facing fresh attacks about his federal corruption trial last year\nJoe Hernandez from member station W H y y report\nMenendez was fired up as you spoke to crowd in Princeton New Jersey last month he's cast himself as a foil to President Trump whose approval ratings in the Garden State or in the thirties Jersey you\nDon't need someone who will stand with Donald Trump they need someone who will stand up to Donald Trump\nContrast that with the Bob Menendez of ten months earlier last November he had just walked out of a federal courthouse in Newark a free man after a judge declared a mistrial and his corruption case those\nNew jersian [noise] who gave you the benefit of that [noise] I think\nDepartment prosecutors had accused Menendez of taking gifts and trips from a wealthy friend in exchange for political favors but then there's a scape legal trouble but he was officially admonished by the Senate and his poll numbers in New Jersey took a hit\nAnd it wasn't long after he announced he would run for reelection that attack ads like me started appearing on was\nObama Justice department for taking hundreds\nThousands of dollars and improper again and campaign contributions\nIt's New Year's eve

[noise]\n\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm David Greene and I'm Rachel Martin the founders of this country designed Congress to constrain presidential powers\nAnd when it came to war the draft or is that the constitution did not want that consequential decision in the hands of just one person among them was James Madison presidential historian Michael Beschloss says when Madison became president himself\nHe learned that war is can we political benefit Steve Inskeep spoke to bash laugh about his new book is titled presidents of war\nMadison was the one who said men are not angels he was so worried about president who had bad judgment or would try to get us involved in a war for political reasons he was trying to slam the door on that\nBut once he was president and Eighteen twelve he's the one who opened the door to a president go into Congress than saying I think there should be a war and if you hadn't had Madison do that it might have been a much longer time before presidents could make were almost single head what\nWas the situation that the United states faced in Eighteen twelve\nThe United states had ships that were being harassed by the British are a lot of Americans want it to grab Canada so there was a group and Congress dish Canada then okay absolutely so they said\nHow about a war and Madison said well you know maybe there is a a good rationale for having a war and Madison sort of like the idea of being a war president himself exactly the opposite of the way he was in Seventeen eighty seven in\nPhiladelphia I'm thinking of that old saying that where you stand as determined by where you sit when he was sitting in what we now call the White House he started seeing things differently than the\nPerfect way of putting it in Madison also knew that it would be politically useful to him and Eighteen twelve he was running for reelection to have a war that he was the biggest advocate of sounds pretty moderate doesn't it\nSo James Madison is one of the presidents who gives the president a role in war making although they're still asking Congress at that point festivals let's go ahead a few decades to James Cape Polk is president of the United states in the Eighteen forties what did he do\nWell James Cape ... was a liar and achieve and a boy and he wanted the United states to have a big war with Mexico and his hidden agenda was he wanted to get New Mexico he wanted to get California which were owned by Mexico at that time a lot of other land and added to the United states\nEighteen forty six he sat American troops down to the Texas border to provoke the Mexicans and Mexican fought back and Polk says look there's been this terrible attack on us\nBy Mexico we need a big war Congress gladly\nGave it to I guess we should just explain this a little more he sent troops into disputed territory between us and Mexico right\nHe did and the result was Polk had essentially fabricated an incident would allow him to go to Congress than say we need a big war with Mexico but wait a minute\nHere he's still like to ask Congress Congress still had to act\nHow did senators respond when they were challenged by this guy was essentially taking their authority away many senators sad that poker is trying to cheat him they question the reason that we were going to war but they voted for this war overwhelmingly and set the pattern for the future why did they do that\nThey knew that the war would be popular they knew that many people would say the Mexicans attacked us why are we fighting back would be very hard for them to say no and that was a pattern that lasted in the future\nOkay but still at that time in history Congress was declaring war the president would ask Congress would do it if we go I had a century to around Nineteen fifty Harry Truman is the president of the United states what happened to Nineteen fifty\nI Love Truman Steve but he just terrible thing in Nineteen fifty the north Koreans attacked the south in June of Nineteen fifty and what Truman should have done under the constitution he should have gone to Congress and said\nI had like a war declaration they would have given it to him but Truman was terrified that there'd be a big debate where he might be criticized and that might undermine him in the mid term elections\nOf Nineteen fifty so trauma didn't even bother going to Congress he said I'm doing this as a police action under the United nations I don't need\nA declaration and the result of that was that Lyndon Johnson in Nineteen sixty four when he wanted his war in Vietnam said Truman didn't ask Congress I don't have to do it either and we've never had a declaration of war since not since Nineteen forty two and that is totally in violation of the constitution what\nAre some of the consequences of this evolution increase really in presidential power when we look at the last I don't know twenty Thirty years\nThe result is a modern president nowadays can start a war almost singlehandedly and most of them are tempted because they know that if you've got political problems and you get the United states in World War that as popular your poll ratings were arrives\nYou writes early in this book where the founders to come back they would probably be astonished and chagrin discovered that in spite of their Arden striving Z the life or death of much of the human race has now come to depend on the character of the single person\nWho happens to be president of the United states\nThe founders knew but almost anyone could become president and they didn't want all of our security to rest on whoever happened to get a job when you wrote that line recently did you have any particular individual in mind\nPresident Trump has often talked about starting wars for political reasons in two thousand eleven he tweeted President Obama's going to start a war with Iran in order to get reelected president addicted that President Obama\nAbout if you mix the connection between Warren politics with the founders never wanted to see a president make\nThe other thing is that like other presidents President Trump is more remarked on but fact but often times if you want to be considered a great president it's easier to do that if you've been commander in chief during war that as they thought that our founders would never wanted to hear from every president\nOne of the recent episode I Want to ask about presidents Obama and two thousand Thirteen seemed on the verge of launching an attack against Syria because of Syria's use of chemical weapons\nI'm ready to act in the face of this average today I'm asking Congress to send a message to the world\nBut we are ready to move forward together as one nation and specifically said I'm not going to do that without the approval of\nCongress it's seen as a serious mistake and foreign policy had left for Charlotte's out of Syria was much more freedom would you argue that it was the right choice even though it seems to have been a mistake\nI figured as always the right choice for president never to get into a war unless he's got Congress in with him on the take off he belatedly saw that that was not going to be possible and that's why he pulled back\nMichael Beschloss is the author of presidents of war the epic story for a mate you know seven to modern times thanks so much thanks great to be used

away\nJeff Hoffman as a meteorologist before to public radio we really appreciate your time this morning Geoff oh You're welcome [noise]\nThere's a lot at stake in this year's midterm elections Donald Trump's legislative agenda ... ability to put conservative judges on the court but the political stakes are particularly high for the party currently out of power and cares national political correspondent Mara Liasson reports\nI asked veteran democratic strategist Paul the Gallup what's at stake for his party in the mid term elections oh everything everything everything to the Gallup the old cliche about this election being the most important one of our lifetimes is really true\nThe Democrats are completely shut out even though they've won the popular vote six out of less than in presidential elections and even though they mostly when the popular vote for the house\nIf the Democrats lose this fall and losing means failing to take back the house and make significant gains that the state level there'll be shut out again without a saying legislation judicial appointments or as former Bill Clinton aide lane Kmart points out in the next congressional redistricting that happens after the twenty twenty cents is\nWinning back some state legislatures or at least getting close is critical for the long term future of the Democrats I mean you know we've had several elections now where there are more democratic votes for democratic members of Congress like Democrats can't win because all the Democrats have been gerrymandered into one district\nSo Democrats have to get control of state legislatures and stop that practice\nIs really has almost through life and death\nThe difference between life and death that's Ron Klain another previously mild mannered Democrat with a currently apocalyptic view of the stakes for his party in November a former top aide in the Clinton and Obama White house is clean says Democrats lose in November of their worst nightmares come true and Trump has a free hand\nThat means he couldn't fire Jeff Sessions and essentially end them alerted us to shut and replace them with food for a general who's choosing means that Trump could continue to roll back regulatory productions undo the Affordable CARE Act\nBut if the Democrats win one house or both claimed says then Congress returns to being a check and balance on the president and there will be a lot of oversight\nYou'll start to see questions being asked about taxpayer dollars are being wasted how the government is being used as a piggy big for the Trump family you'll see also looks at what's going up some of these agencies how big corporate interests are treated her environmental laws inside out at the environmental protection agency and the Interior Department\nIn addition to investigating called the Gallup says Democrats do also plans to legislate\nIf the Democrats take the house and they pass things that people want like increasing the minimum wage like a child care bill whites controlling prescription drug costs like shoring up pre existing conditions and reducing the cost of premiums ... then let the Senate take it up or not and then you've got something to run\nEven if they can't overcome Senate Republicans or a presidential veto the Gallup says Democrats can set an agenda for the next election and twenty twenty\nBut Republicans who've been through this before say be aware of what you wish for Eric Cantor is the former Republican majority leader who came to power when Republicans took over the house after President Obama's first mid term that was thanks to the Tea Party movement which wanted instant results\nI can tell you if we want contemplating Italy monthly if not more often repealing Obamacare\nThan we were not doing all we could even though there was no chance that a bill to repeal Obamacare would pass a Democratic Senate or would be signed into law by President Obama himself\nCanter says Democrats if they win will have to deal with the same danger of super high expectations from their left wing base\nThese constituencies are going to expect abolishing eyes there are going to expect a Democratic majority to implement and execute on Medicare for all and at the most extreme they're going to expect the Democrats who if they win majority in the house to um go ahead and pay the ...\nIf the Democrats win the house impeachment will quickly become their biggest hot potato they're left wing activist base will demand they moved quickly to impeach the president but the Democrats leadership in Congress is lukewarm at best to that idea\nBut Democrats are willing to wrestle with the political pressures and perils of impeachment because they know it's a problem they'll only have if they win the majority again Mara

are learning more this morning about what may have happened to the missing Saudi journalist democracy Yogi\nHe entered the Saudi consulate in Danville is Campbell turkey last week that much we know but he has not been seen since ... wrote for the Washington Post and had been living in the U.S\nThe post is reporting that at one point the crown prince of Saudi Arabia ordered Saudi agents to lure cause she'll get back to the country Saudi officials continue to deny any involvement in Kentucky disappearance\nWe're joined now by ... he's the Washington Post correspondent in ... who's been following this story closely thanks so much for being with us cream thanks for having me\nYou're reporting none of your colleagues shows that the U.S intelligence community knew at one point the Saudi Arabia was trying to get ... back to Saudi Arabia\nUm why were they trying to get him back and how were they trying to get him back\nUh yeah so ... as you said that the U.S has gathered intelligence that\nShowed that the crown prince ordered this operation to lure them from Virginia back to Saudi Arabia and U.S officials told my colleagues that intelligence intercepts that captured Saudi officials discussing this um it's pretty significant\nAnd it appears to confirm that the Saudi leadership at the highest levels will seeking to silence and uh he had written columns in the last year in the Washington Post\nCriticizing some of the monarchies policies including the arrests of women's rights advocates there on the Saudis and said that they have nothing to do with his disappearance and you know even that they were friendly with him and they're not worried about the safety of the intelligence\nIntercepts obviously under those assertions\nAnd they and they really add to the growing pressure on the Saudi Government now to explain what happened\nRight so let me ask you so basically you and your colleagues are reporting that what happened in his ... his disappear into that conflict could in some way to be like a backup plan it clearly they weren't able to get him back to Saudi voluntarily\nSo allegedly they've kidnap him when he was in Turkey I mean\nCertainly those intelligence intercepts have raised the possibility or you know ... there's been very little hard evidence about what\nInside that conflict there is that there is this theory that that what happened inside\nMay have been part of a a\nTo capture that somehow withdraw\nSo US Senators have triggered something called the Magnitsky Act which requires the White House to put sanctions on whomever is responsible for his disappearance even if it's the top leadership in Saudi but how do we find out who was actually leading the investigation to find out the truth is that the Turks that the U.S are they working together\nThe you know the the Turks are leading an investigation\nUm they they are a gathering evidence from various locations around assemble and uh they said that they will present their findings um\nWhen the time is right um but you know\nAll of this has raised questions about whether the U.S had a duty to warn gym but how about the details of the plot\nThat they've discovered and it's also been embarrassing for the Trump Administration which has cultivated very close ties with the crown prince and held him up this is potentially transformative leader in the middle east\n... of the Washington Post ah from his bureau in ... thank you so much thanks\nOkay curry mentioned President Trump's relationship with Saudi Arabia and speaking of that the president is vowing to quote get to the bottom of what happened to democracy will be this is the president speaking yesterday\nThis is a bad situation we can Nablus has happened\nLet's talk about this more with Ian Bremmer he's a political scientist and also founder of the global political risk consultancy firm that you raise your group but we'll come back to the program\nSure hepatitis C yeah\nSo the president saying that ah he's not going to let this happen it's a bad situation but can you just give us the context here what is President Trump and his administration's relationship with Saudi crown prince\nWell as you remember the first trip the truck made outside the United states wasn't to Canada or Mexico traditionally what the us presidents do but a uniquely to Saudi Arabia where he was treated\nLiterally like a king and of all the relations he has around the world perhaps only Israel is closure of both to Trump a and a and Jared Kushner and mom I've been following the crown prince\nI'm In Saudi Arabia so it it would really be tough for Trump personally uh to do anything that would want to damage\nThis relationship with is one thing we know from Trump or it would really be confusing for him to allow human rights abuses at an intern in another country um to stop him from trying to take advantage of a pretty good relationship um UC what he's been saying about the north Korean\nSupreme leader for example in the same interview that you were earlier a presented\nTrump also said that he wouldn't want to reduce arms sales to Saudi Arabia because that would hurt the United states\nBut this is not just a a human rights abuses if this turns out to be true in Saudi Arabia actually killed a journalist on Turkish soil or I mean Lindsey Graham Republican senators saying they would have to be hell to pay isn't that going to increase pressure on President Trump to to do something here\nWell I'm not sure well I mean you know the the the media was more outraged I think about Trump's individual meeting with President Bush in Helsinki and the press conference afterwards I mean even Fox News and a number of the Republicans were on the defensive around it but we're not talking about that anymore\nUm look I mean you and I can say that it is horrific um\nFor the most popular Saudi journalist to be what looks like pretty clearly um killed 'em in a consulate abroad in not in American allies toss what brought by the way but I don't think that means that Trump is going to be pressured what what is interesting of course has the ability of the Senate\nAnd others to constrain Trump's foreign policy when they feel that he's acting beyond the pale in significant in on the same way that we've seen I'm sick it increases in sanctions against the ...\nShould the Trump has attempted to slow walk\n'em I think the same thing is likely to occur these heavy Saudi Arabia and and that's going to be very interesting to watch over the coming months especially\nBecause Trump is putting so much pressure on Iran or ... ... after pulling out of the nuclear deal the about enemy of Saudi Arabia and Congress has been quite on board with that so these two things are going to come together\nAn escape plan and have a legacy to reach out to a financial planner they will help you they will guide you through what can feel really scary and it's

on corporate Coleman a Russian rocket carrying astronauts to the international space station experienced aid critical steal your during lunch today it forced the two men brushing American crew to make an emergency landing they survived and are tend to be in good condition Matthew Bodner reports from Moscow\nRight until you mentioned the storm surge I mean are there are active threats right now to the people who didn't evacuate too who are still in the areas that were hardest hit\nRecord what happens is all that water is forced them because the winds were so strong with the hurricane and you know we were we were talking about this the last three days and how far inland some of that storm surge goes it find every every low spots so rivers that normally flow\n'em out to the Gulf like the apple after caller river flood they've actually reverse that water goes back or to go ten Fifteen miles inland so once it's forced in with the wind now it has to flow out and that takes time so those water levels gonna stay high for a little while\nI'm this storm moved quicker than Hurricane Florence any part of the the devastation that some of that it was so slow moving um but this one it seemed to come on so fast why was that\nEven if it's interesting to look at these hurricanes because they're all so different and that's why we try to we spent so much time here at the hurricane center and and talking about those impacts because they're all completely different so foreign stalls\nAnd like a Harvey right in Texas and you get a Florence that when they start they can they could bring\nAn amazing amount of rain flooding dangerous life threatening rain this one was fast so but a different impact with a fast one is you know you start getting some of those hurricane force inland we had a hurricane in southwest Georgia last night which is which is staggering and that causes a lot of damage as well the other part of this\nEquation is interesting too and you have a Florence\nAnd and you have storms that come across the Atlantic you can see him for five six seven days right when they went this time of your typical for October when they form in the Caribbean there's just not a lot of real estate\nSo one once they form and they start moving especially with Michael moving you know during the life cycle anywhere from twelve to Fifteen miles an hour to get your quick so those timelines change based on where they form\nYou don't have a lot of time to prepare are not as much as we mentioned this thing is is not over it's been downgraded to a tropical storm but it's headed

we're still a tropical storm and even after all this time fifty mile an hour winds around the core so around those rain bands that you can definitely still get heavy rain flooding rain\nYou can get tornadoes in those rain bans on the other part that always worries me is you know the falling trees as well because once you've saturate that soil and we're still talking fifty mile an hour winds that'll knock down trees and power lines so yeah the dangerous still a lot over people still have to really watch Michael as we we move across the Carolinas\nAll right Ken ground he's the director of

Britain's departure from the European Union is quote within reach and this comes ahead of a very important summit in Brussels next week lots of Newman Linder grant is a former diplomat who worked on the breakfast negotiations for both Finland and ... and Brussels joins me on Skype right now good morning\nGood mining so is this for real I Know we've heard that the two sides have been close to something and and the ... of of kind of falling apart what makes this moment feel different if at all\nUh I think it is for ... and one other things that makes it different is of course at the time it's getting very and I have no choice there is no choice to get a deal at all the deal is also that prerequisite for any sort of a trance a transition period\nSo if there is no deal then everything's going to happen overnight so I think both sides have a very great interest in in a deal\nAnd then what is the deadline thing that deadline I mean breakfast is going to take place at the end of march but before that you're going to have to rectify the deal in all twenty seven ... parliaments and the British Parliament and the European Parliament huh you have to translate it and process it so\nYou would have to be ready during November I think for it to be feasible to pull for\nUs to translate into like two dozen different languages which I could be taking a lot of time okay you're going to say there was the second reason do you think it's actually happening\nI think the second reason is is that that I mean one of the big problems in these negotiations from the beginning has been that has been taken your case so long to arrive to any position and it's been negotiating justice not much with itself has with the new at this summer we actually got this so called ... proposal from the u._k. prime minister\nAnd when it was the first time that they actually made a a comprehensive package of how they see\nThemselves leaving and what the new relationship could be and although the checkers deal is not acceptable as such I think it was really important that that was a basis for negotiations to go forward on a lot of people\nIn Europe were just telling the u._k. just come up with something so we can get started and actually actually start working on something\nConcrete exactly it's been extremely frustrating I think for many parties can I ask you about one\nSticking point um that there's this determination to avoid a hard border between Ireland which is part of you in Northern Ireland which is part of your cake and you just remind us why that is so important not to have a hard border there\nI think many people in in Europe forget and how recently actually the real a peace settlement was made in in regard Northern Ireland uh this is all about the took on Good Friday agreement which is from only Nineteen eighty nine the peace agreement between um the u._k. and and the Irish Government\nAnd many of these elements depend on the fact that both areas are part of the ... so if you think about free movement of people are goods across the border people being able to live where they want at all all of these elements which have to do with the integration of the area and they are about that you\nFound out when a when if if and when and if Northern Ireland is leaving at there is a real risk as to what is happening underground or can can hamper the implementation of disagreement and you can possibly cause a lot of a conflict locally\nAnd among because we just have a few seconds left but I mean there's been talk of maybe a new referendum and the u._k. backing out of of breakfast if there were vote with that you take Britain back\nThe ... I mean the u._k. is still a member of that you are but it's not the same ... that he was two years ago I think a lot of China has been broken during these negotiations\nA lot of China you describe it like a a divorce but um it's pretty funny um sadly or at a time and have to stop their lotta Newman Linder grant is a former diplomat who worked on the recommendation thanks a lot\nThank you so much Democrats have a slender path to take in the U.S Senate this fall they need to pick up two seats to gain a majority but they also have to defend plenty of seats including one in New Jersey where incumbent Democrat Bob Menendez is facing fresh attacks about his federal corruption trial last year\nJoe Hernandez from member station W H y y report\nMenendez was fired up as he spoke to a crowd in Princeton New Jersey last month he's cast himself as a foil to President Trump whose approval ratings in the Garden State or in the thirties Jersey and I\nDon't need someone who will stand with Donald Trump they need someone who will stand up to Donald Trump\nContrast that with the Bob Menendez of ten months earlier last November he had just walked out of a federal courthouse in Newark a free man after a judge declared a mistrial and his corruption case those\nNew jersian [noise] who gave me the benefit of the house I think\nJustice Department prosecutors had accused Menendez of taking gifts and trips from a wealthy friend in exchange for political favors Menendez escaped legal trouble but he was officially admonished by the Senate and his poll numbers in New Jersey took a hit\nAnd it wasn't long after he announced he would run for reelection that attack ads like ... started appearing on member was\nBy Obama's Justice Department for taking hundreds\nThousands of dollars and improper getting and campaign contributions Bryan it's a great New Year's eve deserves\nThat ad comes from and then there's his opponent Republican Bob ... a wealthy businessman who's funding his own campaign you can as a marine veteran and a political newcomer who says New Jersey should be embarrassed by Menendez\nEarlier this year she can step down as the head of cell gene uh New Jersey based pharmaceutical company he touts cell gene as an example of a drug company that identify the patient need and satisfy to\nSell Gina's on amazing thing for cancer patients turning multiple cancers from a terminal diagnosis chronic disease but\nCritics say so gene is more like a poster child for high drug costs and shady marketing tactics Menendez has seized on that issue to discredit\nCorporate greed looks like a drug company ... he's getting a lot he said the more people needed drugs are in charge\nOf human is running as a moderate Republican he supports abortion rights and gay marriage he is also supported President Trump and donated tens of thousands of dollars to elect Trump twenty sixteen\nWendy joined KP cc's legacy society people who remember K.

legislative agenda ... ability to put conservative judges on the court but the political stakes are particularly high for the party currently out of power NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson reports\nI asked veteran democratic strategist Paul the Gallup what's at stake for his party in the mid term elections oh everything everything everything to the Gallup the old cliche about this election being the most important one of our lifetimes is really true\nThe Democrats are completely shut out even though they've won the popular vote six out of less than in presidential elections and even though they mostly when the popular vote for the house\nIf the Democrats lose this fall and losing means failing to take back the house and make significant gains that the state level they'll be shut out again without a saying legislation judicial appointments or as former Bill Clinton aide lane Kmart points out in the next congressional redistricting that happens after the twenty twenty cents is\nWinning back some state legislatures or at least getting close is critical for the long term future of the Democrats I mean you know we've had several elections now where there are more democratic votes for democratic members of Congress like Democrats can't win because all the Democrats have been gerrymandered into one district\nSo Democrats have to get control of state legislatures and stop that practice\nIs really is almost two should life and death\nThe difference between life and death that's Ron Klain another previously mild mannered Democrat with a currently apocalyptic view of the stakes for his party in November a former top aide in the Clinton and Obama White house is clean says it's Democrats lose in November their worst nightmares come true and Trump has a free hand\nThat means he can fire Jeff Sessions and essentially end the Miller investigation and replace them with a trade journal his choose it means that Trump could continue to roll back regulatory productions undo the Affordable CARE Act\nBut if the Democrats win one house or both claimed says then Congress returns to being a check and balance on the president and there will be a lot of oversight\nYou'll start to see questions being asked about taxpayer dollars are being wasted how the government is being used as a piggy big for the Trump family you'll see also looks at what's

controlling prescription drug costs like showing up pre existing conditions and reducing the cost of premiums ... then let the Senate take it up or not and then you've got something to run on\nEven if

danger of super high expectations from their left wing base\nThese constituencies are going to expect abolishing ice they're going to expect a Democratic majority to implement and execute on Medicare

their biggest hot potato they're left wing activist base will demand they moved quickly to impeach the president that the Democrats leadership in Congress is lukewarm at best to that idea\nBut Democrats are willing to wrestle with the political pressures and perils of impeachment because they know it's a problem they'll only have if they win the majority again Mara Liasson NPR News

EDITION from NPR News I'm David Greene in Culver City California\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin in Washington DC we are learning more this morning about what may have happened to the missing Saudi journalist democracy Yogi\nHe entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey last week that much we know but he has not been seen since ... wrote for the Washington Post and had been living in the U.S\nThe post is reporting that at one point the crown prince of Saudi Arabia ordered Saudi agents to lure 'cause she'll give back to the country Saudi officials continue to deny any involvement in cars hope he's disappearance\nWe're joined now by Karim Fahim he's the Washington Post correspondent in Istanbul who's been following this story closely thanks so much for being with ice cream thanks for having me\nYou're reporting that of your colleagues shows that the U.S intelligence community knew what at one point the Saudi Arabia was trying to get ... back to Saudi Arabia\nUm why were they trying to get them back and how were they trying to get him back\nUh yeah so as you say the U.S is gathered intelligence that showed\nThat the crown prince ordered this operation to lure them from Virginia back to Saudi Arabia and U.S officials told my colleagues that intelligence intercepts captured Saudi officials discussing this um it's pretty significant and it appears\nTo confirm that the Saudi leadership highest levels were seeking asylum and uh he had written columns in the last year in the Washington Post\nCriticizing some of the monarchies policies including the arrests of women's rights advocates there on the Saudis have said that they have nothing to do with his appearance and you know even that they were friendly with him and they're not worried about the safety of the\nIntelligence intercepts obviously under those assertions\n'em and they and they really add to the growing pressure on the Saudi Government now to explain what happened right\nSo let me ask you so basically you and your colleagues are reporting that what happened in ... his disappearance at that consulate could in some way to be like a backup plan it clearly they weren't able to get him back to Saudi voluntarily\nSo allegedly they've kidnapped him when he was in Turkey I mean\nCertainly those intelligence intercepts have raised ... uh you know there there there's been very little hard evidence about what\nIn that conflict right there is that there is this theory that the what happened inside\nMay have been part of a a\nTo capture him that somehow withdraw\nSo US Senators have triggered something called the Magnitsky Act which requires the White House to put sanctions on whomever is responsible for his disappearance even if it's the top leadership in Saudi but how do we find out who was actually leading the investigation to find out the truth is that the Turks are that the U.S are they working together\nThe ... you know the the Turks are leading an investigation um they they are gathering evidence from various locations around assemble and uh they say that they will present their findings\nWhen the time is right um but you know all of\nThis has raised questions about whether the U.S at a duty to warn jumbo how about the details of the far\nDiscovered and it's also been embarrassing for the Trump Administration which has cultivated very close ties with the crown prince and held him up as as potentially transformative leader in the middle east\n... of the Washington Post ah from his bureau in as temple thank you so much thanks\nGregory mentioned President Trump's relationship with Saudi Arabia and speaking of that the president is vowing to quote get to the bottom of what happened to democracy or give us as the president speaking yesterday\nThis is a bad situation we can not all of his\nBook talking about this more with Ian Bremmer he's a political scientist and also founder of the global political risk consultancy firm the Eurasia Group but we'll come back to the program sure up for the president saying that ah he's not going to let this happen it's a bad situation but\nYou just give us the context here what is President Trump and his administration's relationship with Saudi crown prince\nWell as you remember the first trip the truck made outside the United states wasn't to Canada or Mexico a traditionally what the US President do but a uniquely to Saudi Arabia where he was treated\nLiterally like a king and of all the relations he has around the world perhaps only Israel is closure of both to Trump a and a and Jared Kushner and mom I've been following the crown prince\nI'm In Saudi Arabia or so it ... it would really be tough for Trump personally uh to do anything that would want to damage this relationship with this one thing we know from Trump or it would really be confusing for him to allow human rights abuses at an in another country\nUm to stop him from trying to take advantage of a pretty good relationship um UC what he's been saying about the north Korean\nSupreme leader for example in the same interview that you were earlier a presented\nTrump also said that he wouldn't want to reduce arms sales to Saudi Arabia because that would hurt the United states\nBut this is not just a a human rights abuses if this turns out to be true in Saudi Arabia actually killed a journalist on Turkish soil or I mean Lindsey Graham Republican senators saying they would have to be hell to pay isn't that going to increase pressure on President Trump to to do something here\nWell I'm not sure well I mean you know the the the media was more outraged I think about Trump's\nIndividual meeting with President Vuitton in Helsinki and the press conference afterwards I mean even Fox News and a number of the Republicans will on the defensive around it but we're not talking about that anymore\nI'm looking at you and I can say that it is horrific um for the most popular Saudi journalist to be what looks like pretty clearly um killed 'em in a consulate abroad in not in the American allies cause what brought by the way\nBut I don't think that means that Trump is going to be pressured what what is interesting of course has the ability of the Senate\nAnd others to constrain Trump's foreign policy when they feel that he's acting beyond the pale is significant it on the same way that we've seen I'm sick it increases in sanctions against the Russians that Trump has attempted to slow walk\n'em I think the same thing is likely to occur these heavy Saudi Arabia\nAnd and that's going to be very interesting to watch over the coming months especially because Trump is putting so much pressure on Iran after pulling out of the nuclear deal the about enemy of Saudi Arabia and Congress has been quite on board with that so these two things are going to come together is\nThrough recovery the orthopedic team at Huntington Hospital makes it their priority to keep patients moving and

on the breakfast negotiations for both Finland and uses in Brussels joins me on Skype right now the morning or\nGood morning so is this for real I Know we've heard that the two sides have been close to something in a ... kind of falling apart what makes this moment feel different if at all\nUh I think it is for ... and one other thing is that makes a difference of course at the time is getting very night so they have no choice there is no choice to get a deal at all the deal is also a prerequisite for any sort of a trance a transition period\nSo if there is no deal then everything's going to happen overnight so I think both sides have a very great interest in in a deal\nAnd then that landing the deadline I mean breakfast is going to take place at the end of march but before that you're going to have to rectify the deal in all twenty seven you parliaments and the British Parliament and the European Parliament you have to translate it and process it so\nYou would have to be ready during November I think for it to be feasible to pull through\nYour the traveling there and say two dozen different languages yeah so I could be a lot of time okay you're going to say there is the second reason to think it's actually happening\nI think the second reason is is that that I mean one of the big problems in these negotiations from the beginning has been that it's been taken UK so long to arrive to any position and it's been negotiating just as much much with itself as it has with the new at this summer we actually got this so called check her his proposal from the u._k. prime minister\nAnd when it was the first time that they actually made a a comprehensive package of how they see\nThemselves leaving and what the new relationship could be an although the checkers deal is not acceptable as such I think it was really important that that was a basis for negotiations to go forward so a lot of people\nIn Europe were just telling the u._k. just come up with something so we can get started and actually actually start working on something concrete\nExactly it's been extremely frustrating I think for many parties can I ask you about one\nSticking point um there's this determination to avoid a hard border between Ireland which is part of you in Northern Ireland which is part of the u._k. can you just remind us why that is so important not to have a hard border there\nI think many people in in Europe forget and how recently actually the real a peace settlement was made in in regard Northern Ireland uh this is all about the so called Good Friday agreement the peace agreement between um the u._k. and and the Irish Government\nAnd many of these elements depend on the fact that both areas are part of the ... so if you think about free movement of people are good across the border people being able to live where they want\nAs all all of these elements which have to do with the integration of the area and they are about that you\nFound out when a when if if when and if Northern Ireland is leaving a there is a real risk as to what is happening underground or can can hamper the implementation of disagreement and it can possibly cause a lot of conflict a locally\nAnd and and one more question we just have a few seconds left but I mean there's been talk of maybe a new referendum and the u._k. backing out of of wrecks that if there were vote would you take Britain back\nThey used the u._k. is still a member of the new but it's not the same members that that it was two years ago I think a lot of China has been broken during these negotiations\nA lot

missing Saudi journalist democracy Yogi\nHe entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey last week that much we know but he has not been seen since ... wrote for the Washington Post and had been living in the U.S\nThe post is reporting that at one point the crown prince of Saudi Arabia ordered Saudi agents to lure 'cause she'll get back to the country Saudi officials continue to deny any involvement in ... disappearance\nWe're joined now by ... he is the Washington Post correspondent in ... who's been following this story closely thanks so much for being with us cream thanks for having me\nYour reporting none of your colleagues shows that the U.S intelligence community knew at one point the Saudi Arabia was trying to get ... back to Saudi Arabia\nUm why were they trying to get them back and how were they trying to get him back\nUh\nYeah so as you said that the U.S has gathered intelligence that showed\nThat the crown prince ordered this operation to lure him from Virginia back to Saudi Arabia and U.S officials told my colleagues that intelligence intercepts that captured Saudi officials discussing this um it's pretty significant and it appears to confirm\nThat the Saudi leadership at the highest levels will seeking asylum and uh he had written columns in the last year in the Washington Post\nCriticizing some of the monarchies policies including the arrests of women's rights advocates there and the Saudis and said that they have nothing to do with his disappearance and you know even that they were friendly with him and that they are now worried about the safety of\nThe intelligence intercepts obviously under cut those assertions\n'em and they and they really add to the growing pressure on the Saudi Government now to explain what happened\nRight so let me ask you so basically you and your colleagues are reporting that what happened in his ... his disappearance at that consulate could in some way to be like a backup plan it clearly they weren't able to get him back to Saudi voluntarily so allegedly they've kidnap him when he was in Turkey\nI mean certainly those intelligence intercepts have raised the possibility or you know ... there's been very little hard evidence about what\nInside that conflict there is that there is\nThis theory that that what happened inside\nMay have been part of a a\nTo capture that\nSomehow withdraw so US Senators have that triggered something called the Magnitsky Act which requires the White House to put sanctions on whomever is responsible for his disappearance even if it's the top leadership in Saudi but how do we find out who was actually leading the investigation to find out the truth is that the Turks are that the U.S are they working together\nThe ... you know the the Turks are leading an investigation um they they are a gathering evidence from various locations around assemble and uh they said that they will present their findings um\nWhen the time is right um but you know all of this has raised questions about whether the U.S had a duty\nTo warn job but how about the details of the plot\nThat they've discovered and it's also been embarrassing for the Trump Administration which has cultivated very close ties with the crown prince and held him up as as potentially transformative leader in the middle east\n... of the Washington Post ah from his bureau in as temple thank you so much thanks\nOkay curry mentioned President Trump's relationship with Saudi Arabia and speaking of that the president is vowing to quote get to the bottom of what happened to democracy it would be this is the president speaking yesterday\nThis is a bad situation we can have life has been\nLet's talk about this more with Ian Bremmer he's a political scientist and also founder of the global political risk consultancy firm that you raise your group but we'll come back to the program sure epidemic here\nSo the president saying that ah he's not going to let this happen it's a bad situation but can you just give us the context here what is President Trump and his administration's relationship with Saudi crown prince\nWell as you remember the first trip the truck made outside the United states wasn't to Canada or Mexico a traditionally what the US President do but a uniquely to Saudi Arabia where he was treated literally like a king and of all the relations he has around the world perhaps only Israel is closure of both to Trump a and a and Jared Kushner\nAnd mama been following the crown prince I'm In Saudi Arabia or so it it would really be tough for Trump personally uh to do anything that would want to damage this relationship with is one thing we know from Trump or it would really be confusing for him to allow human rights abuses at uh in in another country\nI'm just stop him from trying to take advantage of a pretty good relationship um UC what he's been saying about the north Korean Supreme leader for example in the same interview that you are earlier a presented Trump also said that he wouldn't want to reduce arms sales to Saudi Arabia because that would hurt the United states\nBut this is not just a a human rights abuses if this turns out to be true in Saudi Arabia actually killed a journalist on Turkish soil or I mean Lindsey Graham Republican senators saying they would have to be hell to pay isn't that going to increase pressure on President Trump to to do something here\nWell I'm not sure well I mean you know the the the media was more outraged I think about Trump's individual meeting with President pollutant in Helsinki and the press conference afterwards I mean even Fox News and a number of the Republicans were on the defensive around it but we're not talking about that anymore\nUm look I mean you and I can say that it is horrific for the most popular Saudi journalist to be what looks like pretty clearly\nUm killed 'em in a consulate abroad in not in American allies toss what brought by the way but I don't think that means that Trump is going to be pressured what what is interesting of course has the ability of the Senate\nAnd others to constrain Trump's foreign policy when they feel that he's acting beyond the pale in significant and on the same way that we've seen 'em sit it increases in sanctions against the Russians that Trump has attempted to slow walk 'em I think the same\nPepperdine has a twelve

British Parliament and the European Parliament you have to translate it and process it so\nYou would have to be ready during November I think for it to be feasible to pull through\nYou have to translate into like two dozen different languages besides ... says you know a lot of time okay you're going to say there is the second reason to think it's actually happening\nI think the second reason is is that that I mean one of the big problems in these negotiations from the beginning has been that it's been taken your case so long to arrive to any position and it's been negotiating just as much much with itself as it has with the new at this summer we actually got this so called ... proposal from the u._k. prime minister\nAnd when he was the first time that they actually made a a comprehensive package of how they see themselves\nLeaving and what the new relationship could be and although the checkered steel is not acceptable as such I think it was really important that that was a basis for negotiations to go forward you know a lot of people\nIn Europe were just telling the u._k. just come up with something so we can get started and actually actually start working on something\nConcrete exactly it's been extremely frustrating I think for many parties\nCan I ask you about one sticking point um there's this determination to avoid a hard border between Ireland which is part of you in Northern Ireland which is part of the u._k. can you just remind us why that is so important not to have a hard border there\nI think many people in in Europe forget and how recently actually the real a peace settlement was made in in regard Northern Ireland uh this is all about the took on Good Friday agreement the peace agreement between um the u._k. and and the Irish Government\nAnd many of these elements depend on the fact that both areas are part of the ... so if you think about free movement of people are good across the border people being able to live where they want\nAt all all of these elements which have to do with the integration of the area and they are about that you\nFound out when when if if when and if Northern Ireland is leaving at there is a real risk as to what is happening underground or can can hamper the implementation of disagreement and it can possibly cause a lot of conflict a locally\nAnd among because we just have a few seconds left but I mean there's been talk of maybe a new referendum and the u._k. backing out of a breakfast if there were vote with that you take Britain back\nThe ... I mean the u._k. is still a member of that you are but it's not the same members that that he was two years ago I think a lot of China has been broken during these negotiations\nA lot of China you describe it like a a divorce but um it's pretty funny um sadly or at a time and have to stop there are a lot of ... is a former diplomat who worked on the ... and thanks a lot\nThank you so much Democrats have a slender path to take in the U.S Senate this fall they need to pick up two seats to gain a majority but they also have to defend plenty of states including one in New Jersey where incumbent Democrat Bob Menendez is facing fresh attacks about his federal corruption trial last year\nJoe Hernandez from member station W H y y report\nMenendez was fired up as he spoke to a crowd in Princeton New Jersey last month he's cast himself as a foil to President Trump whose approval ratings in the Garden State or in the thirties Jersey and I\nDon't need someone who will stand with Donald Trump they need someone who will stand up to Donald Trump\nContrast that with the Bob Menendez of ten months earlier last November he had just walked out of a federal courthouse in Newark a free man after a judge declared a mistrial and his corruption case those\nNew Jersey of gave me the benefit of that [noise] I think justice\nDepartment prosecutors had accused Menendez of taking gifts trips from a wealthy friend in exchange for political favors Menendez survived legal trouble but he was officially admonished by the Senate and his poll numbers in New Jersey took a hit\nAnd it wasn't long after he announced he would run for reelection that attack ads like these started appear al Mendez was\nObama Justice department we're taking hundreds\nThousands of dollars and improper again and campaign contributions Bryan it's a disgrace New Year's eve deserves\nThat ad comes from and then there's his opponent Republican Bob you get a wealthy businessman who's funding his own campaign\nYou can is a marine veteran and a political newcomer who says New Jersey should be embarrassed by Mendez earlier this year you can step down as the head of cell gene uh New Jersey based pharmaceutical company he helped so gene as an example of a drug company that identified the patient need and satisfy to\nSell gene has done amazing thing for cancer patients turning multiple cancer from a terminal diagnosis chronic disease but\nCritics say so gene is more like a poster child for high drug costs and shady marketing tactics Menendez has seized on that issue to discredit\nHugo corporate greed looks like drug companies the EL von she's getting about he said the more people needed drunk the more he can charge\nYou can is running as a moderate Republican he supports abortion rights and gay marriage he is also supported President Trump and donated tens of thousands of dollars to elect Trump and twenty sixteen\nIn a state where no Republican has been elected to the Senate since Nineteen Seventy two you might think you can support for Trump would taint his chances victory in fact to recent polls show Menendez in the lead", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "11"}
