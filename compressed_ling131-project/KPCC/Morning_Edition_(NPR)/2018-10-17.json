but some observers including pals predecessor Janet Yellen's say the Fed's outs of say the president's outspokenness on this could make the Fed's job harder certainly the fed has been very transparent in telegraphing its plan to raise interest rates but that does raise costs for debtors\nIncluding the federal government who's deficit ballooned in the last twelve months by Seventeen percent and his own pace to hit a trillion dollars in the coming year\nOh well let's talk about that because Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader Senate Republican leader has been discussing that you suddenly concerned about the deficit let's listen to him talking to Bloomberg\nIs very disturbing image is ruined by the three big entitlement programs that are very popular Medicare Social security and Medicaid\nUm excuse me are those the things that have increased the deficit recently Scott Horsley\nNo those are certainly big parts of the federal budget but the immediate cause of a spike in the deficit is the GOP tax cut a corporate tax receipts last year plunged by thirty one percent and a boost in both military and domestic spending including interest on that\nIs there something familiar here Democrats have said this is the central Republican playbook you cut taxes that increases the deficit and then you say oh my goodness I'm worried about the deficit time to cut entitlement programs\nYes and and Democrats were very critical saying that McConnell was playing by that play book in his comments yesterday worth noting that President Trump's campaign saying he would protect

threatening to spread the Congo's neighbors Rwanda and you've gone to the world Health Organization plans to meet today to determine whether this current outbreak rises to a public health emergency of international concern\nOkay those are just words but they could meet a lot of especially since health officials are trying to find out how to fight this disease you know war torn country NPR's resides in most covering the story good morning good morning so supposedly go ahead and declare a public health emergency what does that mean in practical terms well\nIt's mostly a symbolic sounding the alarm but it's it's particularly effective way of galvanizing public awareness it's a way to rally international support and focus and even action for on things like funding for example\nAnd it's worth noting that the Daily Show has only declared this kind of emergency on a four times\nSince the start of this alert system I'm most recently in twenty sixteen Wednesday corrupted in Latin America\nAnd then before that um during the twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen Ebola outbreak in West Africa that are infected twenty eight thousand people\nOkay that was an appalling outbreak uh is something happening in the Democratic Republic of Congo the risks rising to that level\n[noise] well one of the the key issues is that this particular outbreak is taking place in a part of the country where there has been\nFierce fighting between rebel groups and the government\nAnd there's been an uptick in attacks by rebel groups on on government forces on peace keepers and also on civilians um and uh and what's happened is that people who for years had felt abandoned by them their government and international community because of these attacks\nUm started to turn against the health workers I'm sort of seeing them as a you know an arm of the government that is not protecting them from the violence\nWow so it is not just that it's difficult for health workers to get into a chaotic place or a generally unsafe place they themselves have been targets in recent months\nSo it's not so much yeah at the health workers had been targets by the rebel groups but it's that the population has started to\nDistressed at the health workers um so and and I should say it's you know a small group of people in the overwhelmingly the population is cooperating we've had Seventeen thousand people more than that um who have taken this experimental vaccine um\nBut you know there are these pockets of resistance where you have people who um you know there were rumors that the vaccinators are actually part of a plot to split spread the disease or you'll have safe burial teams come in and um you know one or two times a week um there'll be an attack on the safe burial team um\nAnd then you know when there's an attack on the civil a civilian population by the rebel group\nThough sometimes neighborhoods your entire cities will declare a day of mourning in protest where everything is shut down and

we're going to turn now to recent developments in the economy because there have been a lot of them the federal deficit grew to seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars in the two thousand and Eighteen fiscal year that's according to new numbers from the Treasury Department and it is a Seventeen percent jump from twenty Seventeen\nAnd President Trump went on Fox Business network yesterday where he said the U.S would start reducing spending but he also turned to a familiar complaint the Federal Reserve he\nCalled the fed quote his biggest enemy and said nominating Jerome Powell to lead it may have been a mistake\nIt's independent so I don't speak to him but I'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going too fast\nDavid Wessel is joining us now he's director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and he contributes to the wall Street Journal good morning David\nWarning I said the president has colorfully criticize the fed before but calling their the Federal Reserve his biggest enemy is something new\nUm he's critique is it they're raising interest rates to aggressively does he have a point\nI think it's very hard to argue that the fed has raised interest rates too much so far after all the Fed's interest rates are around two percent pretty low even though unemployment is at a fifty year low and inflation is starting to creep up\nBut I think there are people who argue that the fed is preparing to go too fast or expectations are they'll raise interest rates perhaps another in a percentage point twenty Nineteen and some people think that's more that's needed given that there's not much inflation and not much of a wage increase going on\nOur end the president appears to be in that camp let's turn to this uh this growing deficit seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars and some lawmakers immediately came out and blamed the Republican tax cuts here's a democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen talking in a budget committee hearing last month\nThe story deficits are\nHighly unusual given the fact that the economy has been growing for more than nine years\nWhen you look under this you find a number of elements of but one thing that jumped out in this most recent report is that corporate tax receipts have fallen by thirty percent in the aftermath of the passage of the Republican tax bill\nI mean David advocates of these tax cuts said look they're going to pay for themselves because cutting business taxes spurs economic growth are we seeing that play out and and it is that argument wrong\nWell look the economy is growing pretty well but revenues total revenue have not gone up an at all so the case that the deficit grew because we cut taxes a lot is clearly supported by the facts it's what the congressional budget office in other uh uh you know arbiter say\nI think the case that I'm cutting taxes which for growth is untested because that argument really was a long run one that businesses would invest more the economy will grow faster overtime and that would offset the cost of some or all of the tax cuts that's\nNot something that can happen instantly are at that that that argument may be jumping the gun at that Republicans now blame a government spending for the deaf said Here's Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell talking to Bloomberg TV yesterday\nIt's very disturbing it's ruined addict or a big entitlement programs that are very popular Medicare Social security and Medicaid that Seventy percent of what we spend every year\nDoes he have a link [noise]\nWell I think that uh Seventy percent is wrong at Social Security Medicare and Medicaid are fifty percent of the federal budget you have to throw in all benefits including farm benefits veterans and interest on the debt to get to Seventy percent\nBut he does have a point we have a deficit because we spend more than we take in and the big drivers of government spending as a society ages over the next decade are gonna be retirement and health programs we're not going to fix the deficit without touching them in my opinion and without touching taxes at the same time\nDavid Wessel of the Brookings Institution thinks David\nYou're welcome this fall's election comes in several parts before the fight to win votes there was a fight over who is allowed to vote in Georgia the Republican candidate for governor also heads the office that has been purging voter rolls\nAnd then there's the fight over how people may vote early voting starts today in North Carolina and it's so popular that more than half of North Carolina votes were cast early in two thousand sixteen\nFor two thousand Eighteen lawmakers altered the rules in ways that could lower turnout here's Alexandra Olga member station WFSU ...\nTo prepare for early voting elections director Adam Reagan in Gaston county just north of Charlotte is testing voting machines by running sample ballot through that [noise]\nThese machines were meant to be in five early voting locations throughout the county but the new law requires all sides with any county to be open from ... to seven PM during the week and as a result Reagan can only open three sites that election\nEarly but he was very popular in ... county and and I would have loved to have more early voting locations it came down to having more locations you know helping more voters versus\nAre you this year a responsibility to the county\nSome democratic lawmakers see this as another attack on voting rights and a state where a voter id redistricting and early voting rules have all been struck down by the courts at various points in the last few years\nDuring a June debate about early voting democratic state representative Amos Quick said the requirement that if one side is open on the weekend the rest also have to be could discourage counties from having any weekend hours\nWeekend early voting has them for fun and asked them about certain population and certain religion Jews right to vote not only been alive what has been rejected in a recent court decision\nHe's referring to black voters and appeals court ruled a twenty Thirteen law that among other things caught early voting by a week targeted African Americans with quote surgical precision but Republicans who champion this law argue they're only trying to minimize confusion here state representative David Lewis also during the Jim debate\nWhat we stood out would be in use you to do is to be able to make you more reliable and older dog voters would know that early voting shocked or start their county was open or Mr I'm In the morning to sit on the evening\nThe law has some bipartisan opposition Ron White is the Republican Party chair of ... county about fifty miles north of Charlotte the county has had to cut its early voting sites in half frustrated as were low would use and he says even though they may not seem like an unfunded mandate\nEight eight eight five seven to two or three to keep the seat or in a

those who did were mocked one definition of nerd is just somebody who's really under something in the world of a new movie directed by Jonah Hill caring can mean you're not mentally Rachel Martin has the story of a film about which hill cares a lot Jonah\nHill didn't want his first directing project to be just anything you wanted a story that matter to him personally mid nineties isn't a story about his life per se but it is about the universal longing of a teenage kid who just wants to fit in\n[noise]\nThink you're pretty cool you\nGet a ...\nIt's about a group of friends growing up in LA yes in the nineties and skateboarding is at the center of their universe Jonah Hill was determined to treat it with that kind of reference\nSkateboarding has always shown his Cowabunga dude and like you know\nAnd it's offensive and skateboarding is really sensitive even when they heard oh the kid from Superbad is going to make a skateboarding movie you know like some down that was the reaction Oh yes skateboarding is the most protective insular community which is why it's so difficult to make a film involving its butchered you know it's misunderstood imagine if there was like ten movies about NPR hosts\nAnd none of them have economic us right [laughter]\nThat's my next on Iraq but none of them had ever set foot in a recording was interviewed anybody you know and I and so it's like any\nReally proud subculture so that's the backdrop at the center of the story is a Thirteen year old named Stevie things are bad for him at home his brother beat them up he is lonely and looking for some kind of connection\nStevie sees this group of kids hanging out in front of escape shop and instantly he feels close to their tribe it's the kind of closeness\nYou can see from ten thousand miles away it's sort of a idiosyncratic perverse closeness haired with a lot of toxic masculinity and on the surface cruelty but such a deep connection and family situation\nDid you have that did you have that group of skateboarding friends\nI did I've had it in many various ways whether it was skateboarding film\nBut I definitely felt like an outsider I definitely felt like I didn't belong and\nThere's a certain person that skateboarding draws ... you know skateboarding now is such a it's going to be an Olympic sport for God's sake so mainstream but when I started the boring it was not cool and society really look down on you as a nuisance\nOne of the things I loved about it was the nonjudgmental miss in certain ways escape orders and I think that\nCreated a lens that I saw life through whether it was sense of humor musical taste cinema taste it really was an ethic an aesthetic for me that I carry with me to this day\nThere was something about maybe it's just me but it was the Potter of how the guys talk to each other to me that's universal like this is how adolescent boys are with each other they are stupid with\nYeah and the only thing that's ever even come close it's been such a magical experience showing this film because it is my heart it is my heart and my soul\nAnd the point zero one percent where someone views the toxic masculinity or homophobia as me thinking that's funny right has been heartbreaking because\nIt was done so intentionally to hold a mirror up to how people in this generation grew up in the changes we're having to make in the wrong lessons we've learned to me they speak so aggressively about women and gay people that it's it's that is how it was and I felt it would be way more disrespectful to change history\nThan to show it just as it was and let the audience see how ugly feels\nOur pop culture critic here at NPR Linda Holmes said this about the film quote it felt like a salute to how toxic masculinity makes boys feel included which is true she writes but not sweet as he'll seems to find it\nHow do you respond to that\nI just disagree I found that it was connective tissue which is unfortunate\nI still think these people were there for each other even though they had a lot of behavior I don't think is cool the point of the movies that nothing's black or white I'm not I'm more or less I'm not here to like\nTell an audience how they should feel I think the way they speak about women and gay people is really messed up way to go about that\nAnd then at the end of the film they still are there for one another so I don't think anyone is purely good are purely bad I Hope to create complex characters that constantly are challenging what you think of them\nCan I ask you about the casting because they're not a lot of names that people would perhaps recognize I mean the acting is pretty phenomenal especially the star the film and the guys who play the people in his boarding tribes [laughter] ah that's\nReally nice I mean this singular most moving experience in my life was casting first time are not actors\nAnd they became these people and became actors in art is one of the kids all in the long curly hair who's very like white and fun and funny at lunch I was you know all the kids would joke around talk trash and stuff and I thought he looked really offensive and that was abnormal\nKind of big brother leader protective over them so I was concerned and then I looked down and he had his rumpled up script under the table and he was rehearsing his lines during lunch\nAnd as a kid who had never thought about acting before which is so funny right because the guys the characters are playing are struggling to be perceived like they don't care about anything it's not cool to care\nIn the nineties especially it was the lame missing ever to say that you cared or tried at least in the culture I I grew up in and what I Love about spending time with these kids now is that they are motivated and these kids give such naturalistic performances\nI I'm just so proud of them it's very moving\nYou got the directing but now\nYou know my whole dream my whole life was to be a writer director I fell into this Fifteen your acting career where I got to learn from a lot of my heroes and it's something I wanted to do and would have done sooner it's just that\nYou only get one chance to make your first film and I really wanted to wait till it was something that really meant something to me I Love this film I stand by it and I hope to just keep making things that I care about that would be a great life I should be so lucky\nThe film is called mid nineties Jonah Hill is\nThinks much for talking yeah it was a pleasure thanks for having [noise]\nRoger\nCared enough to to them to MORNING

be good enough Senator Ted Cruz has some Latino support as he runs for re election in Texas and then there's Rick Scott a Florida the Republican governor is running for Senate in a state where the Latino vote is big NPR's Asma Khalid reports\nAlong a busy street in Orlando a group of Rick Scott supporters chanted known more now than in Spanish as they raped Puerto Rican flags [noise]\nThey just steps away the governor of Puerto Rico was backing Scott's opponent Bill Nelson\nI Am proud to say that I'm endorsing Bill Nelson for uh once I get in the U.S editor of Florida and helping people avoid the who's\n... even in endorsing Nelson the governor of Puerto Rico described Rick Scott as a friend Scott has gone to Puerto Rico eight times in the last year he also created a welcome center at the Orlando Airport where Puerto Ricans are riding after Hurricane Maria could immediately get driver's licenses\nAnd through that all he's won over some skeptics\nMe the Betty honest with you I don't live in ... in the beginning that he was governor so you the election\nCandy as far as considers herself a one hundred percent Democrats we first met him twenty fifth ... she despise Donald Trump back then and she's still dies but she says Rick Scott is no Donald Trump Scott has done a lot for Puerto Rico\nOr my input to legal you know he'd do something good for the for me\nAnd so she plans to vote for Scott this November we're not MIT is a democratic pollster in Miami he says they are really two main strategies for any Republican to win Florida you either maximize the white vote or you chip away at the Hispanic vote\nPolling shows Nelson has the support of a majority of Latino voters that a couple of surveys in August and September showed scot doing well with Puerto Rican men and older Latinos\nAnd the fact that Scott was doing better than thirty five percent suggested that he was in a position to kind of deny Bill Nelson reelection which I think is the concern of many Democrats because potentially it could offend any plans to recapture that chamber\nBut on Monday says even the Scott is trying to make inroads in the Latino community now since still has one big advantage\nHe happens to be on the ballot in the year where at least the political atmosphere conditions suggest that it's good to be a Democrat\nDemocrats insist the choice is clear when you look at

Steve Inskeep what's driving some Asian Americans to challenge affirmative action a lawsuit is underway this week against Harvard University is led by a conservative activist who has in the past to charge the College of efforts to balance their admissions discriminate against white students\nYet the Harvard suit alleges university is unfair to Asian applicants and should be admitted even more than it does some Asian American groups support this move wash U of the New Yorker has been talking with some of them is on the line ...\n... how widespread is\nAsian American skepticism about anything that it's seen as affirmative action in schools\nYou know the data shows that Asian Americans still are poor live action but the um the groups I talked to represent\nA growing very vocal faction and our by social media are by their own and diligent as organizers they'd had quite in the fact that we in effect in the popular imagination\nWhat what is the case that they make against affirmative action\n[noise] well they they're very much into a kind of number I should mention a A R cultured mission that isn't actually offered an exercise in reality but are they view the quote unquote penalty tort Asian students um in categories like personal renting a very subjective rank harbored\nOffers as advantageous Asian American\nUm you say numbers based do you mean to say Asian Americans a lot of them do really well on tests and so they think the testing should be they'd be all and end all\nYeah and some of the folks I talked to create a ... a because a lot of them are\nA newer immigrants from mainland China or testing is very much a make or break way of social mobility or they do believe that the test scores that Asian Americans get should count for more than a soft features like leadership or I'm I'm a personal rankings\nIs this debate any different if we move away from an elite university like Harvard to a lesser league university or a workplace or housing anything else\nYou know it's an interesting question I think it is unfortunately in a way that the debate around her infection has whittled down to this question at Harvard because Harvard is an unusual situation here suggesting\nUm when we look at work way a job hiring contracting\nA lot of people even American include are very supportive of that so that's really provides a skewed way go into the issue at all\nNo okay so there's a there's a relatively narrow group of people with a relatively narrow objection at least right now\nBecause they're challenging Harvard all of this could affect affirmative action or what is seen as affirmative action across the country\nI Do want to ask one question about these activists so uh it is easy from the outside to get or give the impression that some Asian groups here are being used because they are teaming up with a conservative activist who was against affirmative action for other reasons for his own\nReasons do the Asian American opponents of affirmative action feel like they're being used\nThe folks that talked it would really bristle at such an accusation um they're very conscious of what they're doing a lot of them were

economic anxiety since twenty Fifteen basically how people are feeling about their own personal economic situation and it looks like right now people are feeling pretty good\nVery good I Would say it's the lowest level of anxiety that we've gotten any of our surveys that we've been tracking since twenty Fifteen\nSo despite all of the headlines and attention paid to the ongoing trade war this is not really a big issue for people\nYou know some people definitely said trade was a very important issue to them but well behind other things like health care and immigration and so at least as of yet\nWhatever problems or issues that the trade stories that are out there are causing seemingly hasn't trickled down to them any individual such that they're telling us it's affecting their lives\nYeah despite warnings from economists and critics of the president's trade policy that this is the downside to these tasks that it will raise prices and hurt consumers right\nBut we also asked a really interesting question which was we asked what's more important than having generally low prices are protecting us jobs and people overwhelmingly set protecting us jobs was more important than lower prices\nBut I think the research would show that people say they're willing to pay higher prices for God's but when it comes to actually paying those higher prices and buy America campaigns things like that they might not actually follow through\nExactly and so again this could be a case where it just takes a little while for people to understand the influence of these things were all of

O. C. [noise]\nAnd from the listener to support this NPR stations [noise]\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep\nAnd I knew well king good morning we're going to turn now to recent developments in the economy because there have been a lot of them the federal deficit grew to seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars in the two thousand and Eighteen fiscal year that's according to new numbers from the Treasury Department and it is a Seventeen percent jump from twenty Seventeen\nAnd President Trump went on Fox Business network yesterday where he said the U.S would start reducing spending but he also turned to a familiar complaint the Federal Reserve he\nCalled the fed quote his biggest enemy and said nominating Jerome Powell to lead it may have been a mistake it's independent\nSo I don't speak to him but I'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going too fast\nDavid Wessel is joining us now he's director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and he contributes to the wall Street Journal morning David good morning or so the president has colorfully criticized the fed before but calling their the Federal Reserve his biggest enemy is something new\nUm he's critique is it they're raising interest rates to aggressively does he have a point\nI think it's very hard to argue that the fed has raised interest rates too much so far after all the Fed's interest rates are around two percent pretty low even though unemployment is at a fifty year low and inflation is starting to creep up\nBut I think there are people who argue that the fed is preparing to go too fast or expectations are they'll raise interest rates perhaps another in a percentage point twenty Nineteen and some people think that's more that's needed given that there's not much inflation and not much of a wage increase going on\nOur end the president appears to be in that camp let's turn to this uh this growing deficit seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars and some lawmakers immediately came out and blamed the Republican tax cuts here's a democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen talking to budget committee hearing last month\nThe story deficits are highly unusual given the fact that the economy has been growing for more than nine years\nWhen you look under this you find a number of elements but one thing uh that jumped out in this most recent reporters that corporate tax receipts have fallen by thirty percent in the aftermath of the passage of the Republican tax bill\nI mean David advocates of these tax cuts said look they're going to pay for themselves because cutting business taxes spurs economic growth are we seeing that play out and it is that argument wrong\nWell look the economy is growing pretty well but revenues toll revenues have not gone up an at all so the case that the deficit grew because we cut taxes a lot is clearly supported by the facts it's what the congressional budget office and other\nUh uh you know arbiter say\nI think the case that I'm cutting taxes which for growth is untested because that argument really was a long run one that businesses would invest more the economy will grow faster overtime and that would offset the cost of some or all of the tax cuts that's not something that can happen instantly\nAre at that that that argument may be jumping the gun at that Republicans though blame a government spending for the deficit Here's Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell talking to Bloomberg TV yesterday\nThe shortest serving an ... programs that are very popular Medicare Social security and Medicaid that Seventy percent of what we spend over here does he have a point\n[noise] well I think that uh Seventy percent is wrong at Social Security Medicare and Medicaid or fifty percent of the federal budget you have to throw in all benefits including farm benefits veterans and interest on the debt to get to Seventy percent\nBut he does have a point we have a deficit because we spend more than we take in and the big drivers of government spending as a society ages over the next decade are going to be retirement and health programs we're not going to fix the deficit without touching them in my opinion and without touching taxes at the same time\nDavid Wessel of the Brookings Institution thinks David You're welcome\nThis fall's election comes in several parts before the fight to win votes there was a fight over who is allowed to vote in charge of the Republican candidate for governor also heads the office that has been purging voter rolls\nAnd then there's the fight over how people may vote early voting starts today in North Carolina and it's so popular that more than half of North Carolina votes were cast early in two thousand sixteen\nFor two thousand Eighteen lawmakers altered the rules in ways that could lower turnout here's Alexandra old and a member station WFSU the\nTo prepare for early voting elections director Adam Reagan in Gaston county just north of Charlotte is testing voting machines by running sample ballot through them [noise]\nThese machines were meant to be inside early voting locations throughout the county but the new law requires all sites within a county to be open from ... to seven PM during the week and as a result raking can only open recites the election\nEarly but he's very popular in ... county and and I would have loved to have more early voting locations it came down to having more locations you know helping more voters versus are this year he responsibilities to the county\nSome democratic lawmakers see this as another attack on voting rights in a state where a voter id redistricting and early voting rules have all been struck down by the court at various points in the last few years\nDuring a Jew and debate about early voting democratic state representative Amos Quick said the requirement that if one side is open on the weekend the rats also have to be could discourage counties from having any weekend hours\nWeekend early voting has them refer and has been hurt by certain populations and certain religions right to vote as not only been outlawed it would have been rejected in recent court decision\nHe's referring to black voters and appeals court ruled a twenty Thirteen law that among other things caught early voting by a week targeted African Americans with quote surgical precision but Republicans who champion this law argue they're only trying to minimize confusion here state representative David Lewis also during the June debate\nWhat we set out would be in use you to do was

proud to say that I Am endorsing Bill Nelson for uh once I get and leave a senator of Florida and helping people avoid those\nBut even in endorsing Nelson the governor of Puerto Rico described Rick Scott as a friend Scott has gone to Puerto Rico eight times in the last year he also created a welcome center at the Orlando Airport where Puerto Ricans are riding after Hurricane Maria could

voters that a couple of surveys in August and September showed scot doing well with Puerto Rican men and older Latinos\nAnd the fact that Scott was doing better than thirty five percent suggested that

more optimistic than Democrats Larry Rosen president of Edison research is here to discuss hey Larry good morning\nSo Larry we've been tracking the country's economic anxiety since twenty Fifteen basically how people are feeling about their own personal economic situation and it looks like right now people are feeling pretty good\nVery good I Would say it's the lowest level of anxiety that we've gotten in any of our surveys that we've been tracking since twenty Fifteen\nSo despite all of the headlines and attention paid to the ongoing trade war this is not really a big issue for people\nYou know some people definitely said trade was a very important issue to them by well behind other things like health care and immigration\nAnd so at least as of yet whatever problems or issues that the trade stories that are out there are causing seemingly hasn't trickled down to that many individuals such as they're telling us it's affecting their lives\nYeah despite warnings from economists and critics of the president's trade policy that this is the downside to these terrorists that it will raise prices and hurt consumers\nRight but we also asked a really interesting question which was we asked what's more important than having generally low prices are protecting us jobs and people overwhelmingly set protecting us jobs was more important than lower prices\nBut I think the research would show that people say they're willing to pay higher prices for God's but when it comes to actually paying those higher prices and buy America campaigns things like that they might not actually follow through\nExactly and so again this could be a case where it just takes a little while for people to understand the influence of these things were all of a sudden their paycheck isn't going as far as they thought it was before\nAnd we also saw this kind of cause I hierarchy maybe in terms of the priorities people had when it comes to terrorists told me about that\nRight so we asked what's more important than different pairs and one pair we asked about was what's more important are protecting us industries and jobs or maintaining relationships with our allies and in this case people were much more likely to say keeping good relationships with our allies is more important than protecting us jobs\nOr by comparison people said protecting us jobs was more important than maintaining low costs on on consumer goods but I also emphasize that you have to make sure use focusing on that word allies because that doesn't mean every country that means the ones that we are

Foundation Mack foundation dot org [noise]\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep\nAnd I knew ... good morning we're going to turn now to recent developments in the economy because there have been a lot of them the federal deficit grew to seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars in the two thousand and Eighteen fiscal year that's according to new numbers from the Treasury Department and it is a Seventeen percent jump from twenty Seventeen\nAnd President Trump went on Fox Business network yesterday where he said the U.S would start reducing spending but he also turned to a familiar complaint the Federal Reserve\nHe called the fed quote his biggest enemy and said nominating Jerome Powell to lead it may have been a mistake it's independent so I don't speak to him but I'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going to\nDavid Wessel is joining us now he's director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and he contributes to the wall Street Journal morning David warning so the president has colorfully criticized the fed before but calling the the Federal Reserve his biggest enemy is something new\nUm he's critique is it they're raising interest rates to aggressively does he have a point\nI think it's very hard to argue that the fed has raised interest rates too much so far after all the Fed's interest rates are around two percent pretty low even though unemployment is at a fifty year low and inflation is starting to creep up but I think there are people who argue that the fed\nIs preparing to go to fast the expectations are they'll raise interest rates perhaps another in a percentage point twenty Nineteen and some people think that's more that's needed given that there's not much inflation and not much of a wage increase going on\nBehind the president appears to be in that camp let's turn to this uh this growing deficit seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars and some lawmakers immediately came out and blamed the Republican tax cuts here's a democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen tells you to budget committee hearing last month\nThese soaring deficits or highly\nUnusual given the fact that the economy has been growing for more than nine years\nWhen you look under this you find a number of elements of but one thing uh that jumped out in this most recent reporters that corporate tax receipts have fallen by thirty percent in the aftermath of the passage or the Republican tax bill\nI mean David advocates of these tax cuts said look they're going to pay for themselves because cutting business taxes spurs economic growth are we seeing that play out and and it is that argument wrong\nWell look the economy is growing pretty well but revenues total revenue have not gone up at all so the case that the deficit grew because we cut taxes a lot\nIs clearly supported by the facts it's what the congressional budget office and other uh uh you know arbiter say\nI think the case that I'm cutting taxes which for growth is untested because that argument really was a long run one that businesses would invest more the economy will grow faster overtime and that would offset the cost of some or all of the tax cuts that's not something that can happen instantly\nAre at that that that argument may be jumping the gun at that Republicans though blame a government spending for the deficit Here's Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell talking to Bloomberg TV yesterday\nBut you're disturbing is ruined addict or a big entitlement programs that are very popular Medicare Social security and Medicaid that Seventy percent of what we spend over here does he have a point\n[noise] well I think that uh Seventy percent is wrong at Social Security Medicare and Medicaid are fifty percent of the federal budget you have to throw in all benefits including farm benefits veterans and interest on the debt to get to Seventy percent\nBut he does have a point we have a deficit because we spend more than we take in and the big drivers of government spending as a society ages over the next decade are gonna be retirement and health programs we're not going to fix the deficit without touching them in my opinion and without touching taxes at the same time\nDavid Wessel of the Brookings Institution thinks David\nYou're welcome this fall's election comes in several parts before the fight to win votes there was a fight over who is allowed to vote in Georgia the Republican candidate for governor also heads the office that has been purging voter rolls\nAnd then there's the fight over how people may vote early voting starts

locations it came down to having more locations you know helping more voters versus are this year he responsibility to the county\nSome democratic lawmakers see this as another attack on voting rights and a state where a voter id redistricting on early voting rules have all been struck down by the courts at various points in the last few years\nDuring a junior debate about early voting democratic state representative Amos Quick said the requirement that if one side is open on the weekend the rats also have to be could discourage counties from having any weekend hours\nWeekend early voting has them refer and has been for a certain population and certain populations who's right to vote as not only been alive it would have been rejected in a recent court decision\nHe's referring to black voters and appeals court ruled a twenty Thirteen lot that among other things caught early voting by a week targeted African Americans with quote surgical precision but Republicans who champion this law argue they're only trying to minimize confusion here state representative David Lewis also during the debate\nWhat we set out with the into use you to do is to be able to make you more reliable
