about climate change the news is next\n\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Dave mad anyway one insurance company is estimating hurricane Michael did about eight billion dollars in damage to homes businesses and other property mostly in the Florida Panhandle\nMy goodness NPR's Greg Allen thanks so much Greg and stay safe we'll do\nPresident Trump will be campaigning for Republicans this weekend and he will visit eastern Kentucky the president will be in the congressional district from from which a MORNING EDITION team is reporting this morning\nYeah we're in Lexington, Kentucky after spending days listening to voters including Alan ... who is editor of a rural newspaper called the swift creek courier and he will be at the Trump rally\nI was actually Trump voter was and I may vote for him again I'm going to Richmond to see him as we can argue maybe I won't get show\nMaybe I won't get shot he says ... is deciding if people support the president's favorite congressional candidate the incumbent anti bar\nNow ... conservative but says he also prefers divided government Kentucky is a red state but also a state where teachers protested a Republican governor this year and Audrey Long is one of those who held up signs at the state capital we talked over dinner in Lexington\nDid those protests cause some teachers to become more politically active than they would\nHave oh heck yeah oh heck yes if I remember correctly it's more teachers running for state office didn't this year than ever before\nNow we've met dozens of people in three corners of this district a poor rural county an upscale horse track England\nAt a historic black neighborhood now we're gonna talk over what we found with Emily ... who is a political science professor at the University of Kentucky good morning walk them kind of money and I guess we should just mentioned we have a few friends with your room wagon bikes and coffee would you like the country know your your guys [noise]\n\nAnd let's just ask about this district were in the sixth district what would make this district competitive in such a red state\nWell that's interesting so historically Kentucky follows the pattern of other southern states in not even as the state's trend dead on Republican National level particularly for presidential elections Democrats retain strong control\nAt the state level and so we've seen um districts like the ... able to live rich bankers\nBoy I've got some more conservative Democrats something else going on here as well we're in a very modern an urban place in a city and an increasingly diverse place the teacher we heard from teachers English as a second language and get students coming from all over the world a Lexington, Kentucky yeah\nIs there a divide between rural and urban in a place like this if we just drive an hour to the east in the mountains I feel like we're in a very different world\nThan it is when you have different types of rural here in Kentucky right we have the um horse industry which brings a certain type of rural and then we have as you move further East I'm more I'm impoverished row coming\nThat's places where you've got small Hallows as they call them small farms or or nothing particularly going on and tremendous problems with drugs and and other issues that there is an economic divide as well right this is a very prosperous city that were in ... and a place of education how big a place to the University of Kentucky holding this or not that you're biased rented\nNot at all the University of Kentucky is the is the largest industry here in Lexington um along with um suppliers like Toyota manufacturers like Toyota and Lexmark and the bourbon industry\nAre now the bourbon industry that's really interesting isn't that industry being affected by terrorists President Trump Trump imposed Harrison you now have Europeans imposing tariffs on Kentucky bourbon there are concerns about the tariffs yeah so how are the candidates navigating these divides we have Andy Barr Republican we have Amy McGrath a Democrat running for office for the first time\n[laughter] so any McGrath is definitely appealing to that more centrist democratic tendency that we see here I'm trying to emphasize some of the economic issues and how does Andy Barr pushback by questioning the extent to which McGrath is a center is\nOkay and one final question how popular or does it feel to you that President Trump is in the state of Kentucky\nIt depends\nOn who [laughter]\nDeeply divided but he did receive sixty two percent of the voting and sixty eight percent of the congressional district I think that when he voted you of University of Kentucky thanks so much\n\nAlready looking ahead to the weekend on Sunday nearly forty years after he was assassinated while saying mass Salvadoran archbishop Oscar Romero will be canonized by the Vatican\nSays and the\nArchbishop Romero constantly spoke against the violence that was tearing his native El Salvador apart in the Nineteen seventies he's\nRadio broadcasts demanding social justice reached hundreds of thousands of people but his words also angered the country's military rulers and the ... with me he's one of our producers at MORNING EDITION and he's been reporting on Romero morning to any hey no what did you learn about Oscar Romero\nWell he was a fighter for justice and they called him the voice of the voice was this was a time when El Salvador's military regime which was supported by the United states killed kidnapped and tortured civilians many of them the poorest in society\nAnd so remember ran this commission that investigated human rights abuses and every Sunday during mass\nHe named victims of murder and the countless who disappeared\nAnd it was incredibly dangerous for him to do that I'm In his hobbies were broadcast on the radio and they became sort of like\nA newscast for the poor who am I talked with Franciscan brother of ... and he used to work at the Catholic British station in San Salvador everybody every body was\nListening including his ... and he had many enemies who are they\nEl Salvador's oligarchy um the military or they were threatened by Romero because he openly talked about these injustices and he empowered the poor\nTo do something about it and he died for that I'm In march of Nineteen eighty well he was saying mass at this little hospital chapel in San Salvador he was shocked at the altar by a gunman from right wing dust what\nWhy did it take almost forty years for Romero canonized\nWill remember has always been controversial especially within the Catholic Church I supported the poor he was critical of the government so he was accused of being a communist which he was not ... but his costs were seen had was stopped by the Vatican for years because of that\nA Vatican official said he was to allied with the theology that promoted to cause for social justice but Pope Francis finally change that\nAnd this is huge for El Salvador it's a country with one of the highest murder rates in the world so Oscar Romero was words are just as relevant now as they were thirty eight years ago\nA fascinating man and some

here with us what are you here in those voices Steve\nWhat I hear in these voices are themes that resonate really across the country both in terms of the nature of support for Trump and the ways that Trump is reshaping people's understanding of democratic politics ... in terms of the nature of support we see that it's not those who are most economically disadvantaged\nWho favor Trump in fact it's

K. why our member station here\nIn Lexington we are in the sixth congressional district where tightly contested race will help decide control of the house President Trump campaigns and the district this weekend and those who will be in the audience include Allen halls the editor of a rural newspaper called the swift creek courier\nI was actually a Trump voter was and I might vote for him again I'm going to read from the same as we can argue maybe I won't get shot\nHe leans conservative though he also says he prefers divided government checks and balances which makes his congressional vote tricky this is a time of political ferment in Kentucky teachers staged protests this year against a Republican governors effort to cut teacher pensions and those waving signs and the state capital included\nAudrey law did those protests cause some teachers to become more politically active than they would have oh heck\nYeah oh heck yes if I remember correctly it's more teachers running for state office didn't this year than ever before\nThose are some of the voters we've been meeting and now we'll talk over what we have found with Emily bald you a political scientist at the University of Kentucky and LCROSS journalism professor at the same University Good morning guys thanks for joining us early across how hard fought is this district\nBetween Eddie bar the incumbent David McGrath a Democrat\nIt couldn't be any harder phone I mean it was almost like a Senate race in terms of the money that's being spent are the stakes that both parties see in it or it's just one for the book\nMoney being spent how much money are we talking about here\nWell Amy McGrath expects to have a million dollars and a a total\nAged ... is an amount that used to be huge for a Senate race just a few years ago yeah OK and Andy Barr also had an\nEnergy bar will have a comparable amount and plus there's all the outside spending\nEmily bow you do you see that money being spent if you turn on the television or you drive around this district\nYou absolutely can in fact you hear it on the radio\nBitter bitter radio ads as well as television ads television I've seen tons of TV ads for the bars and restaurants\nAnd online ads to you can't ignore that\nAbsolutely not let's drill down in some of the divisions in this state and here a couple more voters one of them we spoke with is Laurie Graham she's in camped in Kentucky and wolf county a rural county she is the manager of a newly expanded Jim and she's a newcomer to the states she favors President Trump\nAnd she gave a lot of reasons why she favors his attitude she likes the economy and she also says she doesn't understand why people are talking about racial divisions in this country let's listen\nI played college basketball I went to a majority of black cool um I mean I I have dated a black guy at one point in my life I'm not racist by any means and I thought anything nothing like I I went to a majority black college\nOne of the only white girl on the team and we all got along everybody got along great\nIs that kind of part of the reason we support President Trump 'cause he kinda as you see your calls BS and all this and you kind of agree with that\nKind of yeah [laughter] I just I feel like [noise]\nI don't I felt like a lot of people have made a few things things that aren't really nice you\nKnow I Believe all year when we interview African Americans we hear a radically different perspective there how deep or the racial divisions in this day\nWell I think what's more important to recognize about this state is how overwhelmingly white it is right so it's about eighty four percent white ...\nIn this way that Kentucky sits at the intersection of a lot of divide in the country it looks more like a mid western state then its neighbors to the south or the east and sell\nTo the extent that there are racial divisions I think what you see more acutely is a is that feeling of marginalization from the African American and Latino community because they're small\nAlthough there are communities here and across we ate in a in a Mexican restaurant with Central American or waiters in wolf county Kentucky the teacher we heard from a moment ago is teaching English as a second language to emigrate immigrants this is becoming a more diverse state has the\nIt's becoming more diverse but it's slow you know the African American population is a a single digits are those the Hispanic population a and a ah eastern Kentucky a\nPart of which is in this district is one of the widest places in the United states\nHow real than is the anxiety over race are you surprised at all to go to a very very white county as we did and your multiple people say I don't understand that this black lives matter thing is all about and they're actually actively bothered by it\nIt's to me this is again a reflection of\nUm Donald Trump emphasis right that in that style of I'm emphasizing conflict in ... often that's been racialized right quite often it addressed um toward immigrants and the threat has immigrant but there's there's definitely a racialized element to that across\nIn this state um ah the racial element has been bad for Democrats or you know the election of Barack Obama was a historic event but it was bad for the Democratic brands and Kentucky\nYou look at the exit polls ... we have about a Fifteen Percent acknowledged racist electric people say I embrace no they said that race was eight oh was it ran a reason for my vote\nAnd yeah there would have been some African Americans and that but very few because we've only got seven and a half percent black\nPopulation well let's hear from a person who identifies as mixed race and lives in a historically black neighborhood of Lexington on the east and April Taylor is her name she's a community activist on the east and\nWe met her outside a farmer's market but she has helped to get going near historic theater there so she's very active politically active has strong opinions and yet she says she doesn't always vote let's listen\nDoes your vote matter in two thousand Eighteen and his congressional election\nI'm honestly not completely convinced that it does for so many people who are ...\nWho are the working poor right people who are working two and three jobs just trying to make ends meet people who may or may not have transportation or people who may or may not\nBe able to get the time off of work there have been times in my life where it was just not feasible to vote particularly when it felt like it may or may not matter\n\nWorld stock markets stabilize overnight as investors take stock of what has been the biggest drops in February\nMarketplace morning report is supported by T Rowe price offering a

market pro Barry ... says with red holds wealth management in New York Good morning\nMy pleasure so as a matter of personal\nFinance what do you think should each of us do the math and see if and how much we actually lost this week with any good come of that\nNo it's kind of fascinating you know stock surprise second by second you're home price varies day to day but you certainly don't track it the way you attract the stock market\nMost people are far too concerned about what happens yesterday and they're not concerned enough about what their portfolio is going to look like decades from now it's it's an ongoing issue it's part of the reason why we have such an underfunded retirement crisis\nYeah but you hear about these lightening fast algorithms moving stocks around and you think you're missing out if you're not fussing with your own portfolio\nEven all the more reason it if it's you versus the machine and all these MIT PHD's in computer programming what makes anybody thinks that they're going to log on from their their phone with a little laptop and they'll be able to compete\nWith those those folks listen I I I like football is next to this as much as the next person but I don't want to get on the field with these giant guys who are bigger stronger faster than me they're professionals I stay out of their way we should really approach high frequency traders sick way\nBut I've been out on the street you're talking to people and you know the one metaphor I hear is that it's a little like an earthquake the earth shakes a bit and you wonder though is it a foreshock of the big one to come and you may be okay with what you lost this week but maybe it's time to take some money off the table is what some people have been suggesting\nWell since the bear market ended in March two thousand nine we've seen twenty days where the S. and P. five hundred was down three percent and during every one of those days it feels like this is it this is the end\nHave you taken money off the table on any of those prior uh events you would have left a ton of upside there and then you run into the real significant problem which is once you sell how do you get back in people are very very bad\nAt objectively evaluating things like markets because it's red emotional it's it's exciting all of your desk and things and all of your best thinking completely get short circuit it by the emotions of losing money\nVeteran market watch your Barry ... wealth management Barry thanks so much my pleasure emotions\nAnd concerns about future interest rates are said to be a driver for the

you're walking\nEarly in the Trump Administration the regular White House press briefings were must see TV for a lot of people they commanded big ratings for the sparring sessions between the White House press secretary and the media\nBut in recent months those briefings have become less frequent to the point where calling them daily would not be accurate NPR's White House correspondent Tamara Keith has this story\nPress secretary Sarah Sanders last walked up to the lectern in the White House press briefing room on October third 'cause if everybody for this year\nIt had been twenty three

it go\nThe number of briefings began declining in the spring falling below levels of the last two administrations at the same point in their presidency's it dropped precipitously in the past two months briefings have also gotten shorter about\nTwenty five percent shorter on average from the first year of the Trump Administration meanwhile in recent days President Trump has been speaking for

there just briefing against say let's just go party\nBut he didn't instead he showed up in the briefing room and feel that the incoming\nIt just felt like it was a responsibility him you know sort of a democratic duty and\nNo one from the Trump White house would go on the record for this story and Sanders hadn't been to the lectern in eight days so there hasn't been a chance to ask at the briefing that the press\nAll right Sean Spicer defense the White House\nThe idea that the briefing is to be all end all and the standard bearer for the degree of accessibility is rather silly and\nAnd he argues that when the briefing became a rating sensation in the Trump Administration its utility decreased\nDynamic and the office of the briefing has shifted from reporters using it to gather information to reporters using it to further their own personal careers and they were\nBefore the start of the Trump Administration to former press secretaries McCurry and Ari Fleischer argued that to turn down the temperature the briefings shouldn't be live televised events that met with a lot of resistance from the press corps and didn't happen\nFleischer who was press secretary for George W.

when\nAll right I have to ask you a macro question here you know it's my job depressed people about why this is happening is\nThere a reason or people just sort of saying things that keep everyone keeps telling me and I keep writing that it has something to do with the recognition that we have higher interest rates in America\nSo there's two answers to that the math the answer is based on research we've had a number of read hiking regimes over the past fifty years and for\nMost of them for most of the time stocks go up when the fed is tightening stop and think about it from a causal relationship [noise] why is the fed tightening because the economy is is doing well in fact it's\nDoing so well that corporate profits are at all time highs and the wages are going up and we're actually looking at possible inflation and therefore the fed just wants to take a little bit of heat out of the economy so we can continue on a sustainable pace\nSo that's the Massey part of the brain talking the philosophical answer is hey humans are really good at explaining\nWhat just happened after the fact I heard the exact same thing in January we had that sell off and then eventually that recovered and then go back two years before and we heard oh this is it rate hikes are doing it now we get to worry about tariffs and trade war and we get to worry about the strong dollar\nThere's always a perfect after the fact rationalization but nobody ever really catches as an advance because the reality is markets move in a somewhat random walk there is a little bit of persistence see a little bit of trend but the day to day and we tweak stuff is very very variable\nHumans hate the idea that this is all random so we come up with these very competing narratives we tell a great story

this is a time of political ferment and Kentucky teachers staged protests this year against a Republican governors effort to cut teacher pensions and those waving signs and the state\nCapital included Audrey law did those protests cause some teachers to become more politically active as I Would have oh heck\nYes oh heck yes if I remember correctly it's more teachers running for state office didn't this year than ever before\nThose are some of the voters we'd been meetings and now we'll talk over what we have found with Emily bald you a political scientist at the University of Kentucky and LCROSS journalism professor at the same University of more than guys thanks for joining us early Al Cross how hard fought to use this district between Eddie bar the incumbent any regrets Democrat\nThere couldn't be any harder for me it was almost like a Senate race in terms of the money that's being spent a the stakes that both parties see in it or it's just a one for the book money being spent how much money are we talking about here well McGrath expects to have a million dollars and a a total\nAged ... is an amount that used to be huge for a set of red yeah just a few years ago\nYeah OK and Andy Barr also had to do any bar will have a comparable amount and plus there's all the outside spending\nEmily bow you do you see that money being spent if you turn on the television or you drive around this district you absolutely do and in fact you hear it on the radio bitter bitter radio ads as well as television ads television I've seen tons of television at bars and restaurants\nAnd online as to you can ignore that\nAbsolutely not let's drill down and some of the divisions in the state of here a couple more voters one of them we spoke with is Laurie Graham she's in camped in Kentucky and wolf county a rural county she is the manager of a newly expanded Jim and she's a newcomer to the states she favors President Trump\nAnd she gave a lot of reasons why she favors his attitude she likes the economy and she also says she doesn't understand why people are talking about racial divisions in this country let's listen\nI played college basketball I went to a majority of black cool [noise] um [noise] I mean I I dated a black guy at one point in my life I'm not racist by any means in anything nothing like I I went to a majority black college one of the only white girl on the team\nAnd we all got along everybody got along great\nIs that kind of part of the reason to support President Trump because he kinda as you see your calls BS at all this and you kind of agree with that\nKind of yeah [laughter] I just I feel like [noise]\nI don't feel like a lot of people have made issues and things that aren't really is you\nKnow I Believe all year when we interview African Americans we hear a radically different perspective there how deep or the racial divisions of the state\n[noise] well I think what's more important to recognize about this state is how overwhelmingly white it is right so it's about eighty four percent white mean\nIn this way that Kentucky sits at the intersection of a lot of divides in the country he looks more like a mid western state then its neighbors to the south for the east and so\nOur racial divisions I think what you see more acutely is a is that feeling of marginalization from the African American and Latino communities because they're small\nAlthough there are communities here across we ate in a in a Mexican restaurant with Central American ah waiters in wolf county Kentucky the teacher we heard from a moment ago was teaching English as a second language to emigrate reimbursed is just becoming a more diverse state as the\nIt's becoming more diverse but it's slow you know the African American population is a a single digits are those the Hispanic population a and a ah eastern Kentucky uh\nOr which is in this district is one of the widest places in the United states\nHow real than is the anxiety over race are you surprised at all to go to a very very white county as we did and there are multiple people say I don't understand that this black lives matter thing is all about and they're actually actively bothered\nBy it to me this is again a reflection of\nUm Donald Trump's emphasis right that in that style of I'm emphasizing conflict in threat often that's been racialized right quite often it's addressed um toward immigrants and the threat posed by immigrants but there's there's definitely a racialized element to that across\nIn this state um uh the racial element has been bad for Democrats or you know the election of Barack Obama was a historic event but it was bad for the Democratic brand and Kentucky\nYou look at the exit polls ... we have about a Fifteen Percent acknowledged racist electorate will say I know they said that race was or was it ran a reason for my vote\nAnd yeah there would have been some African Americans and that but very few because we've only got seven and a half percent\nBlack populations well let's hear from a person who identifies as mixed race and lives in a historically black neighborhood of Lexington on that used on April Taylor is her name she's a community activist on the Houston\nWe met her outside a farmer's market but she has helped to get going near historic theater there so she's very active politically active has strong opinions and yet she says she doesn't always vote was listen\nDoes your vote matter in two thousand Eighteen in his congressional elections\nI'm honestly not completely convinced that it does

the math and see if and how much we actually lost this week with any good come of that\nNo it's kind of fascinating you know stock surprise second by second you're home price varies day to day but you you certainly don't track it the way you attract the stock market\nMost people are far too concerned about what happens yesterday and they're not concerned enough about what their portfolio is going to look like decades from now it's it's an ongoing issue it's part of the reason why we have such an underfunded retirement crisis\nYeah but you hear about these lightning fast algorithms moving stocks around and you think you're missing out if you're not fussing with your own portfolio\nEven all the more reason it if it's you versus the machine and all these MIT\nPHD's in computer programming what makes anybody thinks that they're going to log on from their their phone with a little laptop and they'll be able to compete\nWith those those folks listen I I I like football is not as much as the next person but I don't want to get on the field with these giant guys who were bigger stronger faster than me they're professionals I stay out of their way we should really approach high frequency traders ... way\nBut I've been out on the street you're talking to people and you know the the one metaphor I hear is that it's a little like an earthquake the earth shakes a bit and you wonder though is it a foreshock of the big one to come or you may be okay with what you lost this week but maybe it's time to take some money off the table is what some people have been suggesting\nWell since the bear market ended in March two thousand nine we've seen twenty days where the S. and P. five hundred was down three percent and during every one of those days it feels like this is it this is the end\nHave you taken money off the table on any of those prior events you would have left a ton of upside there and then you run into the real significant problem which is once you sell how do you get back in people are very very bad\nAt objectively evaluating things like markets because it's red emotional it's it's exciting all of your best and things and all of your best thinking completely get short circuit it by the emotions of losing money\nVeteran market watcher Barry ... wealth management Barry thanks so much my pleasure\nPresident Trump yesterday repeated his criticism of Federal Reserve policy at one point he said I think I Know about it better than they do believe me unquote he also said raising interest rates was insane\nBut there was some pushback from

and we're actually looking at possible inflation and therefore the fed just wants to take a little bit of heat out of the economy so we can continue on a sustainable pace\nSo that's the ... part of the brain talking\nThe philosophical answer is have humans are really good at explaining what just happened\nAfter the fact I heard the exact same thing in January we had that sell off and then

of Kentucky and LCROSS journalism professor at the same university come on and guys thanks for joining us early Al Cross how hard fought is this district between Eddie by the incumbent David McGrath Democrat\nIt couldn't be any harder fault I mean it was almost like a Senate race in terms of the money that's being spent a the stakes that both parties see in it or it's just a one for the

few years ago yeah OK and Andy Barr also had anyone\nAny bar will have a comparable amount and plus there's all the outside spending\nEmily bow you do you see that money being spent if you turn on the television or you drive around this district\nYou absolutely can in fact you hear it on the radio\nBitter bitter radio ads as well as television ads television I've seen tons of TV ads in bars and restaurants\nAnd online ads to you can ignore that\nAbsolutely not let's drill down in some of the divisions in this state and here a couple more voters one of them we spoke with is Laurie Graham she's in camped in Kentucky and wolf county a rural county she is the manager of a newly expanded Jim and she's a newcomer to the states she favors President Trump\nAnd she gave a lot of reasons why she favors his attitude she likes the economy and she also says she doesn't understand why people are talking about racial divisions in this country let's listen\nI played college basketball I went to a majority of black cool [noise] um [noise] I mean I I had dated a black guy at one point in my life I'm not racist by any means and I bought anything nothing like I I went to a majority black college one of the only white girl on the team\nAnd we all got along everybody got along great\nIs that kind of part of the reason you support President Trump 'cause he kinda as you see your calls BS and all this and you you kind of agree with that\nKind of yeah [laughter] I just I feel like [noise]\nI don't feel like a lot of people have made a few things things that aren't really it's you\nKnow I Believe all year when we interview African Americans we hear a radically different perspective there how deep or the racial divisions in this day\nWell I think what's more important to recognize about this state is how overwhelmingly white it is right so it's about eighty four percent white live\nIn this way that Kentucky sits at the intersection of a lot of divides in the country it looks more like a mid western state then its neighbors to the south or the east and so\nTo the extent that there are racial divisions I think what you see more acutely is it is that feeling of marginalization from the African American and Latino community because they're small\nAlthough there are communities here across we ate in a in a Mexican restaurant with Central American or waiters in wolf county Kentucky the teacher we heard from a moment ago is teaching English as a second language to emigrate immigrants is just becoming a more diverse state has the\nIt's becoming more diverse but it's slow you know the African American population is a a single digits or so the Hispanic population a and I'm a eastern Kentucky a\nArticle which is in this district is one of the widest places in the United states\nHow real than is the anxiety over race are you surprised at all to go to a very very white county as we did and there are multiple people say I don't understand that this black lives matter thing is all about and they're actually actively bothered by\nIt to me this is again a reflection of\nOn Donald Trump emphasis right that in that style of I'm emphasizing conflict in threat often that's been racialized right quite often it's addressed um toward immigrants and the ... has immigrant but there's there's definitely a racialized element to that across\nIn this state um uh the racial element has been bad for Democrats or you know the election of Barack Obama was a historic event but it was bad for the Democratic brands and Kentucky\nYou look at the exit polls in two thousand they we have about a Fifteen Percent acknowledged racist electorate will say I embrace to note they said that race was eight oh was it ran into a reason for my vote\nAnd yeah there would have been some African Americans and that but very few because we've only got seven and a half percent black population\nWell let's hear from a person who identifies as mixed race and lives in a historically black neighborhood of Lexington on the east and April Taylor is her name she's a community activist on the east and\nWe met her outside a farmer's market but she has helped to get going near historic theater there so she's very active politically active has strong opinions and yet she says she doesn't always vote let's listen\nDoes your vote matter in two thousand Eighteen and his

White House press briefings were must see TV for a lot of people they commanded big ratings for the sparring sessions between the White House press secretary and the media\nBut in recent months there's three things have become less frequent to the point where calling them daily would not be accurate NPR's White House correspondent Tamara Keith has this story\nPress secretary Sarah Sanders last walked up to the lectern in the White House press briefing room on October\nThird 'cause if everybody for this year it had been twenty three days since she last break the press Hernandez

joins Kumar is a political scientist who for years has sat in on the White House briefings pits in Port and forum for the public\nAnd we shouldn't let it go the number of briefings began declining in the spring falling below levels of the last two administrations at the same point in their presidency's it dropped precipitously in the past\nTwo months the briefings had also gotten shorter about twenty five percent shorter on average from the first year of the Trump Administration meanwhile in recent days President Trump has been speaking for himself a lot\nOf any horses which has a very good way to this could lead to others question yes their question any other questions I don't know that you know\nOn air force one on the tarmac on the south lawn of the White House in the oval office and calling in to Fox News' Mike McCurry was press secretary for President Bill Clinton\nPresident Trump this is his own pressured er and he's the one that ought to be the spokesman every day and I I'm not even sure you got some spokesman press secretary\nMcCoy was Clinton's spokesman during the star investigation and other challenging news cycles\nMany time for I Would have been happy they just might briefing against say let's just go party\nBut he didn't instead he showed up in the briefing room and feel that the incoming\nIt just felt like it was responsibility you know sort of a democratic duty and\nNo one from the Trump White house would go on the record for that story and Sanders hadn't been to the lectern in eight days so there hasn't been a chance to ask at the briefing but\nPress secretary Sean Spicer defense the White House\nThe idea that the briefing is to be all and end all and the standard bearer for the degree of accessibility is rather silly\nAnd he argues that when the briefing became a rating sensation in the Trump Administration its utility decreased\nDynamic and the office of the briefing has shifted from reporters using it to gather information to reporters using it to further their own personal careers and name right\nBefore the start of the Trump Administration to former press secretary McCurry and Ari Fleischer argued that to turn down the temperature the briefings shouldn't be live televised event that met with a lot of resistance from the press corps and didn't happen\nFleischer who was press secretary for George W.
