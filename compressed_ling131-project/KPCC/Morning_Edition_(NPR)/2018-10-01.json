I guess we should remember that the old NAFTA it's a free trade agreement but not strictly that its free trade except when it's not quite free trade there are a lot of complexities but the basic idea is goods crossing borders without tariffs most of the time how is this new agreement supposed to be different\nWell let's start with a brand new parts the sections that can't on the U.S agreed upon in this last minute scramble both sides gave up some ground from positions that they were pretty entrenched on Canada said it's going to pry open it's dairy market which has been very protected up more to us farmers\nUs backed away from this demand they wanted to get rid of these independent dispute resolution panels that deal with complaints about unfair trade the administration didn't like them at all ... all over American sovereignty\nUs gave gave up there um and also significantly in the U.S agreed a rich and understand with candidates not going to go ahead and slap tariffs on autos imported from Canada President Trump is threatened that a bunch of times\nUm remember those those tariffs on a Canadian and Mexican steel and aluminum sure you know they're still in place for now and they're supposed to be negotiated out on the so\nCalled us interesting you mentioned the dairy rules will change this has been like a very public complaint of the president's he's made a number of complaints about Canadian a dairy practices so you're saying that will change but I Do have to ask this is an immense trading relationship between three nations is it really changing that much\nWell that's an interesting question I mean you know ... parts of it that were in place already when the U.S and Mexico came to an agreement or you know are significant\nThe ones that really aren't deal with auto manufacturing you know it ... the ... that increases the amount of content that has to be produced within the border of North America and and more significantly even it requires that at least forty percent of the vehicles made in within his trade zone has to be made by workers earning at least sixteen dollars an hour\nYou know this is designed to push up wages in America and hopefully to the Trump Administration move more manufacturing a back to the u._s. has\nGot a new name though doesn't it which is not insignificant because this is a president who is all about branding so if you've got a new name and something's changed right\nWell you know that President Trump always hated NAFTA you're always call it a total disaster the worst trade agreement um that the U.S has ever negotiated so yeah it's\nA night in states Mexico Canada agreement\nExactly right and left ... Owens used them enough to smoke you use ... does it it was ... there's just a matter of five\nOr so um what has to happen in order for this to be final this Congress have to sign off\nThat Congress has to approve it you know um that would have been very very hard if we just to U.S Mexico deal alone probably the odds are better if it's if it's all three countries um but we'll wait and see what happens in the mid terms that the Democrats take control the house or Senate or both they could insist on changes in making all difficult well\nThat's interesting although of course there are some Democrats who would favor changes NAFTA also already thanks very much You're welcome and ...\n\nMaybe you saw the video over the weekend people fleeing fleeing away from the beach as massive waves crash to shorten Indonesia friday beach front houses on the island of pseudo racy were swept away and hundreds of people are known to\nMost of the confirmed deaths are from the city of ... rescuers does say they could find more victims in the ... region is is closer to the epicenter of where the quake happened NPR's Julie McCarthy\nIs on that Indonesian island either Julie\nHi what are you seeing\nAs you say I Am on the island uh well I'm On the island and ... but many hours or to the north of me is the city of ... life has been totally up ended\nBody bags are lining the shore where the dead have washed up after this Eighteen foot tsunami\nPeople are hungry they're scrounging markets for food they're they're looting stores in government buildings cars carrying aid relief groups are worried about their base camps being overturn the military has now been ... been deployed but many people are asking what took so long\nA World Vision says that people are terrified I'm this nominee they're terrified of another tsunami it just didn't take lives it took a chunk of the city shoreline with it\nI'm just stuck on that number Eighteen feet Julie McCarthy because if you follow hurricanes that strike the United states a five foot storm surge is really bad floods a lot of areas and Eighteen foot storm surge must have been devastated or not star search ... says oh actually\nYeah you saw this video of this thing approaching and people kind of blatantly taking pictures of it on a hotel and then the picture goes black they they must have been gone\nUm and these are not small places this is a city hall that was the city of three hundred and thirty five people devastated now through aren't five dollars an hour and ... you're saying three thirty five hundred and thirty five thousand people\nThree hundred thirty five thousand in in in Palo and another three hundred thousand in I'm ...\nI'm In these places are remote on polio is nestled where this non became creating in and their buildings are cracked and their collapsed and there are still powerful aftershocks and people are building makeshift shelters in the hills too afraid to stay indoors\nWhile I have to ask you about the capacity for rescuing people and recovery is there an Indonesian equivalent of FEMA is the military really strong logistically the way the U.S military would be do they have the resources to go after this\nWell this has been a huge challenge in fact the polar airport was closed today a one police major said four thousand people stormed the airport there they rushed a military transport\nFilled with aid and that shut down the fight to the flights for the day so you know the chaos is emerging people are shown a standing on tankers siphoning the fuel power has been cut hospitals or crippled\nPeople have moved outside where patients aren't been moved outside where the doctors are trying to administer them outside their\nUm military military transports are flying and generators some ... that there is a is a desperation setting and the president um joke a widow do has authorized international aid agencies into the quake area and now they've got to overcome the hurdle to reach these devastated\nPlaces okay Julie thanks very much really appreciate it thank you Steve That's NPR's Julie McCarthy speaking to us from the island of pseudo ways [noise]\nIt's NPR news\nThis week on the world we're in the Amazon rain forest where scientists have some disturbing news\nNow I'm a zone was buy you some time that is not going to buy anymore\nThe rain forest was absorbing greenhouse gases no it may actually be emitted them we get the latest from Brazil where the battle is on for the future of the Amazon it's on the world joined us this afternoon at two on eighty nine point three K.

online at Carnegie dot org\nThis is MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep we've been asking the prime minister of Israel about a Palestinian state subject returned to Benjamin Netanyahu's agenda last week\nPresident Trump put it there Trump joined his predecessors favoring a separate Palestinian state on land that Israel is occupied since Nineteen sixty seven war\nI think probably just state is more likely but you know what if they do seem to if they do a double I'm okay with it if they're both happy if they're not happy I'm okay with either I think that just state is more likely\nIt is not clear how the two sides would get to a second staked the Trump Administration has yet to reveal its peace plan us diplomats are pressuring Palestinians to settle for less and less\nSome Palestinians have been shifting focus Palestinian analysts ... told us the other day the Palestinians need basic civil rights\nI don't care if the state that represents them is Israel or Palestine or some other science fiction name these are human beings are entitled to live a life of dignity is parity in which they fulfilled themselves as individuals and groups\nIn every possible way that any American a rich person or Chinese person would walk\nPalestinians today I have trouble going abroad without Israeli permission and have no say about the movements of Israeli forces\nThe demand for equal rights is provocative you'd implies that is Palestinians are denied a state millions could demand voting rights in Israel\nNot surprisingly Benjamin Netanyahu sees this matter differently he wants indoors to separate Palestinian state but now favors something less so when he came on the line friday we asked him about President Trump's endorsement of a two state solution can that happen on your watch prime minister\nLook I think people mean different things when they say two states or other than going into the label I'd like to talk about the substance my view of a potential agreement of Palestinians should be able to have all the powers to govern themselves but none of the power to\nKeep power that must not be in their hand is the question of security in the tiny area west of the Jordan River up to the Mediterranean it's all about the width\nOf about fifty sixty kilometers mhm we're\nBoth Palestinians and Israelis Lou Israel must return the overarching security responsibility otherwise we'll good what happened already in Lebanon and Gaza when we left\nAnd the basically militant Islam came in under\nBy law observing through long or under Hamas and Islamic jihad and Gaza observing them or do you do if you have a state of most of the bars of state\nBut not the our security is that if they are not a state I don't know you can argue about that that aren't my position I've been very very clear both to the previous administration\nUnder the Trump well let's look at it from the other perspective if we can then the question of what Palestinians actually the ordinary Palestinians would get David Friedman the United states ambassador to Israel\nSaid some days ago some weeks ago at a conference call with the American Jewish Congress that there are two and a half million Palestinians he sat on the west bank and quote you either have to let them go in and independent states or Israel is going to have to absorb them at some point Israel is going to have to make a decision he says\nNow you're not willing to put the state's label the independent state label or give them full independence what about the other option are you ready to absorb a two and a half million Palestinians and give them full civil and voting rights equal rights in Israel\nYou know I don't want them either ... or subject but I think there is not an either or model I think we have a third model very leave\nWhich is basically all the powers of sovereignty or nearly all the bars but not the ones obscurity look in the middle east which are littered with failed states that's often the best you can do to try to do something you know you get a ...\nBut you're you're didn't work out what you're talking about the situation that prime minister where you don't want them as citizens of Israel but you want Israel to still have affected security control of that area\nThat leads on the question are you willing to support that proposal that would give Palestinians equal rights civil rights full rights that are equal to those of any Jewish Israelis citizen and what form would that take\nWell they would have those rights and their own territory in other words they have their own parliament on government going flag on\nWell then I don't even know but they have very very little writes compared to the average Israeli I Would think\nWell if you go we don't go running the Palestinians don't administer\n... or no blue governed by the ... but you can extend that governance but not to the point where you would endanger Israel\nNow this is a very odd thing with the Palestinians are demanding something that would collapse of their own authority in their own government but it's not the first time but they do so I think we have to be realistic\nAs long as you know we have the middle east on reformed and pockmarked\nMuch violent felons radicalism from what's the best we could\nAnd you you believe in any circumstance that Israel should be able not only that security control but to arrest people to bring them into Israeli courts you want that to stay with Israel\nFor a walk in and I'll tell you why you don't how come you don't feel that much terrorism was\nWell first of all we'll security cooperation with the Palestinian authority of good I'm going out with Hamas in Gaza but the bulk of security operations are done by off\nBut here's own gone for about a tourist in one of the Palestinian\nAnd we would call up typically screwed it up orders from for water to take care of I don't want to send our soldiers are we don't know why should we you know an offer we have to do because we're willing to take the within the taxes we weren't after the UN\n... Abbas so they want us to talk of\nFine actually final thing prime minister because I Know your time is very blew up the irony of what I I understand I Do\nFinal thing you have been very closely allied with President Trump that has carried certain great benefits for you is there are also a risk and being so closely allied with such a polarizing president because you would rather as Israel historically has have bipartisan support in the United states\nOf things to become a sustaining member go to keep BCC dot org and thank you [noise] [noise]\nWell\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin when she was young Jo Marie Larkin had big dreams and she wasn't about to like being a girl getting away\nThere were a lot of things I wanted to be life I wanted to be an archaeologist don't want it to be an astronaut I wanted to be so many different things she's settled on music and today is one of the most celebrated women in Iraq you know her\nAs Joan ...

nasty\nWhat did they say exactly [noise]\nSlut die core [noise]\nTrying to throw us off our game trying to get us not to have that sort of confidence in our own selves and now that was easy to do

you were actually physically hurt at one point\nOh you have hobbies on young people throwing heavy objects that your bottles or a show yeah oh\nYeah definitely they lived in Japan though\nYes they did and it was mostly girls to women were looked at as they are I guess around the world is sort of second class citizens and um so the girls were responding to what they perceived\nAs or power I suppose thousands of girls rock in our car and stuff it was um\nQuite a juxtaposition from what we've various shapes\n[noise]\n\n\nRoughly a year later you decided that the band had just gone in a different direction\nAnd you had to leave what was that decision like\nSo horrible it felt like defeat\nAnd um was all for stupid reasons I thought and you know so it was really it was gut wrenching for me because of the runways ... was\nMy baby you went into a pretty dark place yeah yeah yeah what do you remember from that time [laughter]\nYeah not a lot I was trying to\nBury at all you know it was too painful to to sort of a drug to assess it and figure out what happened I mean I was I was in trouble and I thought about joining the military because they thought all learn something I'll meet people

auto production production I'm so in order to import a car carefree from another NAFTA country that car will now have to have more of its parts and production her with in the NAFTA countries\nThere's also prevention about how much the car has to be produced by workers earning at least sixteen dollars an hour that's an effort to keep all the work from being done by low wage workers in Mexico\nIn

along with us here Mara Liasson what did you hear there\nWell what I heard was that a senator\nCoons laid down the criteria for what would satisfy him and my thought was that doesn't really matter if it satisfies any Democrats the only thing that matters is is the process this week long investigations satisfies Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski and Jeff Flake who are the three moderate Republicans who wanted this pause something the president and\nA leader Mitch McConnell and Kavanaugh himself didn't want but the math is that the Republicans can afford to only lose one vote and you have senator Collins saying it's very quote reassuring to the public that we're doing this investigation he's\nUm she said it shows Republicans want to make sure we have all the facts to make an informed decision

Netanyahu's agenda last week\nPresident Trump put it there Trump joined his predecessors favoring a separate Palestinian state on land that Israel is occupied since Nineteen sixty seven war\nI think probably two state is more likely like you know what if they do seem do if they do a double I'm okay with it if they're both happy if they're not happy I'm okay with either I think the two state is more likely\nIt is not clear how the two sides would get to a second state the Trump Administration has yet to reveal its peace plan us diplomats are pressuring Palestinians to settle for less and less\nSome Palestinians have been shifting focus Palestinian analysts ... told us the other day the Palestinians need basic civil rights\nI don't care if the state that represents them as Israel or Palestine or has some other science fiction name\nThese are human beings are entitled to live a life of dignity prosperity in which they fulfilled themselves as individuals and groups in every possible way that any American a rich person or Chinese person would\nWhile Palestinians today I've traveled going abroad without Israeli permission and have no say about the movements of Israeli forces\nThe demand for equal rights is provocative eat implies that is Palestinians are denied a state millions could demand voting rights in Israel\nNot surprisingly Benjamin Netanyahu sees this matter different like he wants indoors to separate Palestinian state but now favors something less so when he came on the line friday we asked him about President Trump's endorsement of a two state solution can that happen on your watch prime minister\nLook I think people mean different things when they say two states rather than get into the label I'd like to talk about the substance my view of a potential agreement as the Palestinians should be able to have all the powers to govern themselves but none of the power to threaten us\nTo keep power that must not be in their hands is the question of security\nIn the tiny area west of the Jordan River up to the Mediterranean it's all about the width\nOf about fifty sixty kilometers mhm we're both Palestinians and Israelis live Israel must return the overriding security responsibility otherwise we'll get what happened already in Lebanon and Gaza when we left\nAnd basically militant Islam came in under\nHis by law observing to Iran or under Hamas and Islamic jihad and Gaza observing them or do we do if you have a state that has a most of the sovereign bars state\nBut not the ... security is that if they are not a state I don't know you can argue about that that aren't my position I bet it very very clear\nBoth through the previous administration under the Trump and he was\nWell let's look at it from the other perspective if we can then the question of what Palestinians actually the ordinary Palestinians would get David Friedman the United states ambassador to Israel\nSaid some days ago some weeks ago when a conference call with the American Jewish Congress that they're two and a half million Palestinians he sat on the west bank and quote you either have to let them go in and independent states or Israel is going to have to absorb them at some point Israel is going to have to make a decision he says\nNow you're not willing to put the state's label the independent state label or give them full independence what about the other option are you ready to absorb a two and a half million Palestinians and give them full civil and voting rights equal rights in Israel\nYou know I don't want them either ... or subject but I think there's it's not an either or model I think we have a third model the very least\nWhich is basically all the powers of sovereignty or nearly all the bars but not the ones obscurity look in the middle east which is littered with failed states that's often the best you can do to try to do something else you know you get a Gaza\nBut you didn't work out what you're talking about the situation that prime minister where you don't want them as citizens of Israel but you want Israel to still have affected security control of that area\nThat leads Sunday question are you willing to support that proposal that would give Palestinians equal rights civil rights full rights that are equal to those of any Jewish Israelis citizen and what form would that take\nWell they would have those rights than their own territory in other words they have their own parliament now their own government going flag they have their own\nWell they have any of them by now but they have very very little writes compared to what the average Israeli I Would think\nWell if you go we don't govern the Palestinians don't administer Ramallah origin or no blues are governed by the Palestinian but you can extend that governance but not to the point where you would endanger Israel\nNow this is a very odd thing with the Palestinians are demanding something that would collapse of their own authority in their own government but it's not the first time that they do so so I think we have to be realistic\nAs long as the you know we have the middle east on reformed and pockmarked with so much violence so much radicalism so much terrorism this is the best arrangement we could we could have\nAnd you you believe in any circumstance that Israel should be able not only that security control but to arrest people to bring them into Israeli courts you want that to stay with Israel [noise]\nUh yes I Want to have an overriding bar and I'll tell you why you don't see this is an interesting question how come you don't see that much terrorism in a in the west bank\nWell first of all we have to ... to cooperation with the Palestinian authority that's good I'm going to have it with Hamas in Gaza but the bulk of the security operation was a it was done by off\nBut here's how it's done we have say intelligence about I'm a terrorist in a one of the Palestinian towns\nAnd we would call up typically the Palestinian security authorities and say why don't you take care of it 'cause I don't want to send our soldiers there if we don't have to why should we you know and often we have to do because because we're willing to take the risk within attack as we were at the\nUn by President Abbas so they want us to take care of their security but also you know attack us\nFind internationally final thing prime minister because I Know your time is very ... I Hope you've got the irony of what I said I understand I Do\nFinal thing you have been very closely aligned with President Trump that has carried certain great benefits for you is there also a risk in being so closely allied with such a polarizing president because you would rather as Israel historically has have bipartisan support in the United states\nJoined us this afternoon at three eighty nine point three K.

more and more\nThese days starting pitchers who pitch in to the fifth inning or something of a rarity but the Tampa Bay rays have taken the bullpen strategy to an extreme\nFor much of the season the rays would have started to pitch in any or to only to be replaced with another pitcher Fisher says baseball general managers don't think of pitchers in specified roles much anymore that means starters enclosures aren't the only ones getting paid a lot these days\nThose middle reliever as we're that used to be a minimum salary one million two million kind of guy there are very frequently mid seven

open for years if necessary until Democrats can install someone you like\nThat's not my goal um and I found a senator Graham's a outburst really both out of character and\nAh unfortunately contributed to what has been a sharply partisan divide on the committee\nI I think part of what made a Senator Flake or joined me in my call for a week long pause was his concern um that are this hearing and this environment is not just tearing apart our committee and the Senate that reflects a way in which were tearing the country apart\nLooked real here on all this I think as Dr Ford who came forward with allegations when she had nothing to gain and everything to lose I think this one week pause is a\nReasonable bipartisan gesture not to keep this nomination open indefinitely but to show that we took seriously enough Dr Ford's allegations to actually investigate\nLet me just ask though in about thirty seconds or so senator if you're presented with a candidate for this position\nWho you extremely disagree with on the issues but Kavanaugh is cleared or someone comes after him who has a clean record or a seem to have a clean record are you going to say yes even though we just lost the process is fair it's find Republicans one they got their justice are you going to accept that process\nI did call the White House and urge the president to nominate someone who is confirmable when Justice Kennedy announced his resignation I Will say the judge Kavanaugh is a truly at the extreme end of an American legal thought\nOn some key issues I intend to vote against him but I Do think that this

Murkowski and Jeff Flake who are the three moderate Republicans who wanted this pause something the president and\nA leader Mitch McConnell and Kavanaugh himself didn't want but the math is that the Republicans can afford to only lose one vote and you have senator Collins saying it's very quote reassuring to the public that we're doing this investigation he's\nUm she said it shows Republicans want to make sure we have all the facts to make an informed decision so this might\nBe the kind of thing Democrats wanted but be aware of what you wish for because it just might Greece's Ginsburg have

cyberattacks and espionage\nBut the Russian online influence operations during the twenty sixteen elections were done All right there in the open something that caught American spies and law enforcement off guard here's Victoria Nuland a top State Department official during the Russian interference campaigning twenty sixteen testifying before Congress\nThere was a tendency in the U.S intelligence community to look only at classified information so we were as a government not is aware of what was happening in the private sector\nNow Americans won't be caught off guard like they

been asking the prime minister of Israel about a Palestinian state subject returned to Benjamin Netanyahu's agenda last week\nPresident Trump put it there Trump joined his predecessors favoring a separate Palestinian state on land that Israel is occupied since Nineteen sixty seven war\nI think probably two state is more likely but you know what if they do seem to if they do a double I'm okay with it if they're both happy if they're both happy I'm okay with either I think the two state is more likely\nIt is not clear how the two sides would get to a second state the Trump Administration has yet to reveal its peace plan us diplomats are pressuring Palestinians to settle for less and less\nSome Palestinians have been shifting focus Palestinian analysts dizzy and say you told us the other day the Palestinians need basic civil rights\nI don't care to state that represents them as Israel or Palestine or some other science fiction they\nThese are human beings are entitled to live a life of dignity prosperity and which they fulfilled themselves as individuals and groups in every possible way that any American a rich person or Chinese person would wild\nPalestinians today I have trouble going abroad without Israeli permission and have no say about the movements of Israeli forces the demand for equal rights is provocative you'd implies that is Palestinians are denied estate millions could demand voting rights in Israel\nNot surprisingly Benjamin Netanyahu sees this matter differently he wants indoors to separate Palestinian state but now favors something less so when he came on the line friday we asked him about President Trump's endorsement of a two state solution can that happen on your watch prime minister\nLook I think people mean different things when they say to states and get into the label I'd like to talk about the substance my view of a potential graders are the Palestinians should be able to have all the powers to govern themselves but none of the power to threaten us\nKeep our the must not be there is the question of security in the tiny area was to the Jordan River up to the Mediterranean it's all about the width\nOf about fifty sixty kilometers\nWhere both Palestinians and Israelis Lou Israel must return the overarching security responsibility otherwise we'll good\nWhat happened already in Lebanon and Gaza when we left\nAnd then basically militant Islam came in under\nBy law observing drew on or under Hamas and Islamic jihad and observing them to do if you have a state that have most of sovereign bars state but not the our security is that if they were not a state\nI don't know you can argue about that that aren't my position a bit of a very very clear\nBoth to the previous administration under the Trump\nWell let's look at it from the other perspective if we can then the question of what Palestinians actually the ordinary Palestinians would get David Friedman the United states ambassador to Israel said some days ago some weeks ago at a conference call with the American Jewish\nCongress that there are two and a half million Palestinians he sat on the west bank and quote you either have to let them go in an independent state or Israel is going to have to absorb them at some point Israel is going to have to make a decision he\nSays now you're not willing to put the state's label the independent state label or give them full independence what about the other option are you ready to absorb a two and a half million Palestinians and give them full civil and voting rights equal rights in Israel\nYou know I don't want them either ... or subject but I think it's not an either or a model I think we have a third model very leave\nWhich is basically all the powers of sovereignty or nearly all the bars but not the ones who security look in the middle east which was littered with failed states that's often the best you can do to try to do something of you know you get a guy\nBut you didn't work out what you're talking about the situation that prime minister where you don't want them as citizens of Israel but you want Israel to still have affected security control of that area that leads to question are you willing to support a proposal that would give Palestinians\nRights civil rights full rights that are equal to those of any Jewish Israeli citizen and what form that take\nWell they would have those rights in their own territory in other words they have their own parliament now their own government going flag on\nWell they have any of them by now but they have very very little writes compared to the average Israeli I Would think\nWell if you go we don't go to the Palestinians don't administer\nRamallah origin you or no blue governed by the ... but you can extend that governance but not to the point where you would endanger is\nThis is a very odd thing with the Palestinians are demanding something that would collapse their own authority in their own government but it's not the first time but they do so I think we have to be realistic\nAs long as you know we have the middle east on reformed and pockmarked\nViolence so much radicalism so much terrorism this is the best we go to a lot and\nYou you believe in any circumstance that Israel should be able not only that security control but to arrest people to bring them into Israeli courts you want to stay with Israel\nI Want to have an overarching bar and I'll tell you why you don't have struggles how come you don't do that much terrorism was\nWell first of all security cooperation with the Palestinian before that's good I'm going out we've come off and go but the bulk of security operations are done by off\nBut here's own gun we intelligence about terrorists in one of the Palestinian\nAnd we would call up typically elephant scrutiny of orders and for water to it 'cause I don't want to send our soldiers are we don't know why should we you know and often we have to do because we're willing to

his advocates on the committee\nAlthough we should be senator Republicans of course have accused Democrats of extreme partisanship here they don't like the way that these allegations were revealed it they don't like the demands for further investigation and your colleague Lindsey Graham the Republican colleague Lindsey Graham and his\nSpeech or explosion really when he was quite angry uh during the testimony on Thursday said of Democrats quote what you want to do is destroyed this guy's life\nHold his seat open and hope you win in twenty twenty I'd like to ask directly is that your objective to keep the Supreme Court seat open for years if necessary until Democrats can install someone you like\nThat's not my goal um and I I found a senator Graham's a outburst really are both out of character and\nAh unfortunately contributed to what has been a sharply partisan divide on the committee\nI I think part of what made a Senator Flake or joined me in my call for a week long pause was his concern um that are this hearing and this environment is not just tearing apart our committee and the Senate that reflects a way in which were tearing the country apart\nAnd look the real here on all this I think as Dr Ford who came forward with allegations when she had nothing to gain and everything to lose\nI think this one week pause is a\nReasonable bipartisan gesture not to keep this nomination open indefinitely but to show that we took seriously enough Dr Ford's allegations to actually investigate\nLet me just ask about thirty seconds or so senator if you're presented with a candidate for this position\nWho you extremely disagree with on the issues but Kavanaugh is cleared or someone comes after him who has a clean record or a seem to have a clean record are you going to say yes even though we just lost the process is fair it's find Republicans one they got their justice are you going to accept that process\nUm I did called the White House and urge the president to nominate someone who is can for mobile when Justice Kennedy announced his resignation I Will say the judge Kavanaugh is truly at the extreme end of an American legal thought\nOn some key issues I intend to vote against him but I Do think that this week pause was an important opportunity\nFor the allegations against him to be investigated and either um confirmed or denied\nSenator Chris Coons of Delaware thanks so much thank you Steve I have a good morning now and NPR's Mara Liasson has been listening along with us here Mara Liasson what did you hear there\nWell what I heard was that\nA senator Coons laid down the criteria for what would satisfy him and my thought was that doesn't really matter if it satisfies any Democrats\nThe only thing that matters is is the process this week long investigations satisfy Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski and Jeff Flake who are the three moderate Republicans who wanted this pause something the president and\nA leader Mitch McConnell and Kavanaugh himself didn't want but the math is that the Republicans can afford to only lose one vote and you have senator Collins saying it's very quote reassuring to the public that we're doing this investigation he's\nUm she said it shows Republicans want to make sure we have all the facts to make an informed decision so this might\nBe the kind of thing Democrats wanted but be aware of what you wish for because it just might Greece's Ginsburg have another confirmation\nNPR's Mara Liasson thanks very much\nThank you it's October and the fall election campaign is in high gear cell or the social media operations full of mind games and false heads things that marred the twenty sixteen election campaign NPR's Tim Mak has been asking how people can protect themselves\nThe online social media world in many ways is an illusion\nThe Senate intelligence committee recently heard from an expert who testified there is twenty five to thirty times more fake information from automated accounts on the extreme left in the extreme right and there is genuine real life conversation\nAnd with the midterm elections just around the corner\nExperts are bracing for spike in foreign disinformation we're going to have an October surprise that spread brewing who during the Obama administration worked at the national Security Council on how to respond to Russia's efforts to spread false information during the invasion of Ukraine is\nNot a question in my mind of whether it's going to happen it is a question only of when and how large\nThe government and America's intelligence agencies have traditionally been more capable in tracking cyberattacks an espionage but the Russian online influence up or\nBecause during the twenty sixteen elections were done All right there in the open something that caught American spies and law enforcement off guard here's Victoria Nuland a top State Department official during the Russian interference campaigning twenty sixteen testifying before Congress\nThere was a tendency in the U.S intelligence community to look only at classified information so we were as a government not as aware of what was happening in the private sector\nNow Americans won't be caught off guard like they were then but we still need to Wade through the sludge of our online news environments and be smarter about the information we read and I'd just here's April ... who's the head of intelligence law at the national Security Agency\nThat's been social science research demonstrating that if I tell you some really outrageous proposition something that's clearly untrue I tell you you know it took him the sky is green today the first time I say you're going to try to catch us it's a dumb thing I've ever heard\nOf the next time I say you're going to be more inclined to believe that and by the third or fourth or fifth time it starts sounding almost possible\nA big problem is the nature of the Internet which allows foreign actors to pretend to be American spreading real information here's Kevin Mandiant the c._e._o. of cybersecurity firm FireEye\nIt's an unbelievably complex challenge for a free society\nWith the anonymity of the Internet to really police you know the ideas that you're reading the ideology or reading and who the true source of those ideas\nAre roughly Krikorian joined the Democratic National Committee in twenty Seventeen to be the lead on cybersecurity and has given some serious thought about how to combat misinformation\nWhen I Would tell my father to do is to actively just look for a living with a view should understand what the opposition to win it'd be might be like a huge data in putting your own head to try to sort through what's going on\nUltimately the biggest recommendation from experts in online disinformation campaigns is to diversify your new sources and remain skeptical\nThe germ that we use is digital resilient\nThat's ... who leads the Atlantic council's digital forensics research lab\nOf a degree of critical thinking where if you see something that's overly a motive or you know doesn't seem quite right ... another source just do some basic kind of a leg work on your own to say okay well that could be right it could be wrong and just have a degree of skepticism on what you're seeing on one\nAnd if there's one thing about which there is bipartisan consensus in Washington DC it's that foreign actors like Russia are continuing even now to try to undermine American democracy and so confusing right up until election day in November Tim Mak NPR News watch [noise]\n\nThis is

night joined the United states and Mexico and this new trade deal and the president spoke about it and the White House Rose Garden today\nThe agreement will govern nearly one point ... trillion in trade which makes it the biggest trade deal in the United states history\nRather than continuing to talk now with NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley has come over to talk to us about this I just got good to be with you Steve how is this different from NAFTA well\nThe name is different for starters the president puts a premium on branding and he wants to re brand this trade agreement as the U.S Mexico Canada agreement or us MCA\nBut doesn't become an acronym as easily as now it doesn't quite\nRoll off the tongue and work on the pronunciation but when when NAFTA was negotiated a quarter century ago there was a carve out for Canadian dairy for example protectionist measures over left in place for Canadian dairy even as trade barriers generally between the U.S and Canada and Mexico were lowered\nThis a new agreement does away with some of those protections measure so it will give a American dairy farmers greater access to the Canadian dairy market\nIn exchange Canada got something it wanted which was to preserve a an arbitration system for trade disputes with the United states and they very much wanted to preserve in which the Trump Administration wanted to get\nRid of okay so there are some things here that Americans can celebrate people selling agricultural goes to Canada might be very happy with this um there are labor provisions on the Mexican side right to prop up wages in Mexico and therefore hypothetically in the United states\nThere are new rules of origin for automobiles which will require that more of a car be made in North America in order to sell duty free in the United states and in particular require that more of a vehicles content be made in factories the pay sixteen dollars an hour that could have the effect of raising wages in Mexican auto factories it could also have the effect\nOf shifting some auto production from Mexico to higher wage places like us and Canada will see\nWith that as someone Scott who's covered the White House for years and covered economics for many many years is disagreement fundamentally different than it was before\nI think what we're really seeing is certainly updates to a twenty five year old agreement which didn't take it account digital commerce for example a ... this includes some new protections for electoral property but really we're looking here at kind of updates and changes around the margins rather than a wholesale revision of\nNow so let me ask you about that because the president speaking of the rose garden you said we're going to bring back manufacturing he said the previous administration didn't want to set it was going to go way that's a false statement President Obama also promoted American manufacturing of different\nKinds I suppose just about every president must um but the president says it's going to happen there's going to be a lot more manufacturing jobs beyond the adjustments to this a trade agreement is there a clear strategy to vastly increased manufacturing jobs in the U.S from his administration dissidents\nRation clearly is much more willing to pursue protectionist measures to encourage domestic industry of all sorts whether it's manufacturing or other industry\nAt the expense of what had for decades been a a U.S commitment to lowering trade barriers elsewhere\nA ... for example the new Korean trade agreement that this administration negotiated is as much about extending trade barriers safe for us may or may pick up trucks as it is lowering trade barriers in South Korea so in that sense\nThere is a strategy a it's not one that necessarily economist across the board think is wise or will encourage a economic progress in this country\nScott always a pleasure talking with you thank you very much That's NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley\n\nThe republic of Macedonia may no longer be able to call itself that NATO and the European Union safe that country is going to join their ranks they have to change
