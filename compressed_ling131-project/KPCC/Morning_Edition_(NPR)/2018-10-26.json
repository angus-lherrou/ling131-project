NPR's medical months and our thanks to medical You're welcome art which I Want to get your thoughts on what to medical was saying because you have been in Texas for the last week talking to voters\nRight let's talk about Texas I Am currently in Del Rio which is\nJust next to lake ... on the Rio Grande river which separates the U.S and Mexico and this is the last stop on a week long road trip that we've done through the twenty third congressional district here in Texas this is one of the state's only true swing districts\nTotally fascinating place and well that sounds about a third of the entire U.S Mexico border\nOkay so this is a massive district and I wonder have you been knocking doors talking to people does any of what to medical was just saying line up with what you've been hearing from people particularly from women\nRight so he mentioned the power women so we wanted to talk to some especially in the suburbs around San Antonio suburban women are really going to be influential in these midterms we met a woman named Janet ... uh she like a lot of white liberal women in this country said that Donald Trump's election\nJust devastated her a and really caused her to become politically active in a completely new way now she registers people to vote she volunteers for democratic candidates um she is committed in a way she never was\nBefore let's listen to a little bit I Wish I'd done more earlier for progressive candidates I just didn't think it was so necessary now I Do and\nSo at the same time or I should note we also talked with one of jealous neighbors a Republican who really likes what President Trump is doing in fact she was going to speak with us a on Monday we had this all scheduled and she had to reschedule so that she could road trip to Houston with her friends to see Donald Trump do his thing at a Houston rally [laughter]\nAnd I know that while you been down to you also been looking at particular economic factors in these places and you you visited a place that's experiencing something like an oil boom\nSomething I mean totally like boom I'm this is a place called ... Texas\nIt's really benefited from uh all the fracking that's been happening in oil country I'm just to give you a sense of how the place has grown in twenty tend to population was around eight thousand people today city officials don't even know what the real popular while they speculate that because of all the temporary oil workers who are there\nAre there could be up to fifty thousand people living there at any given time uh which has put a massive a strain on the town because it ... it all happened so quickly they haven't been able to really keep up there's not enough food on the grocery store shelves they don't have enough restaurants\nBut what's really interesting is how it seems to be changing the politics of the place most of the population is Hispanic traditionally they've been Democrats\nBased on our conversations there that could actually be shifting a because these all these new people are coming in with new viewpoints people who give the party in power credit for the current economic boom I Want to play a clip a from a conversation we had with a guy named John pack\nOf a double bus our from far for a struggle for a long time and have come out here and I'm ...

border cities we met people who cross the border on a daily basis to go to the dentist to buy the groceries\nUm they don't see it as a crisis here uh and opinions about President Trump and his immigration policies are pretty much split in a partisan way what people here do agree on and we're talking about Democrats we spoke with an Republicans\nIs that a wall the idea of building a border wall is not going to fix the country's broken immigration system\n... last question Democrats have been looking for years to turn Texas blue I think it's going to happen\nRight so we've heard a lot

broadcasting from Del Rio Texas which is just a few miles from the U.S border with Mexico I'm at this very moment looking over lake on his side on the Rio Grande river or this is the natural divide between the U.S and Mexico\nDel Rio is part of the twenty third congressional district in Texas a really why the only swing districts in this red state and we've been here talking to voters about what's on their mind to head of the twenty Eighteen but terms and how they measured the presidency of Donald Trump\nThere is a new poll out this morning from NPR PBS NewsHour and merits that addresses that very topic and we have NPR's lead political editor Domenico Montanaro with us to discuss the findings governing the medical Hi Rachel so I Am at this moment looking up at the vast Texas guy and it feels pretty far away from Washington DC in\nPolitics but so that's\nReally nice but let's dig into the poll\nFindings eh let's start with a president and Republicans they saw bumping enthusiasm among the base during a justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing did it last [noise]\nNot really you know the Kavanaugh factor appears to actually have faded as a big motivating issue for voters Republicans have maintained their level of enthusiasm but with the pollsters tell us is that that is more likely because it's October the closer you get to the election there's a natural rise\nA and when you look at Kavanaugh specifically the number of people saying he's motivating their vote has gone down between both parties including Republicans\nAnd we see the president's approval rating back down to thirty nine percent\nWe see Democrats opening up a gap of ten points now on the question of whether you'd want to have a Democrat or Republican in control of Congress and your district\nI feel like you've been on the program several times over the past few months talking about the importance of women in his mid term elections a President Trump is struggling on that front as the polls show that he's making any inroads with female voters\nNot at all at one of our pollster said that it's really all about the gender gap here in twenty Eighteen or they said twenty ten and twenty fourteen were really about men who are motivated to take back the house and Senate upset with President Obama but in twenty teens about women who are motivated against President Trump\nWe saw that up and down on questions related to the president's approval rating to preference for control of Congress and in particular when you look at white college educated women they give the president the lowest approval ratings of almost any group and are among the highest to believe that these elections are very important so they're very motivated\n... really interesting because we did meet a woman here Janet Ogle ... in the suburbs of San Antonio\nSame thing um she's a liberal she's a Democrat but the election of Donald Trump a shattered her and she's become politically motivated in a in a totally new way so we've definitely seen that play out here what about issues the medical I mean it does a poll addressed what are the issues that are that are going to motivate people to turn out that you\nWill you know first and foremost a driving factor in this election as President Trump to third say that the president will be a factor in their vote that's twenty points higher than in twenty fourteen when the same question was asked about President Obama and that's the year Republicans took back the Senate but when we does it when we drove in specifically at some of the issues that are important to people\nThe top issue of course was jobs and the economy\nFollowed by health care and immigration all of which we've heard a lot about in this election but when you break it down by party that's where you see some real differences Republicans jobs in the economy and immigration far and away the biggest issues nothing else comes close\nFor Democrats it's health care and climate change I noticed I didn't mention those tax cuts Republicans hope to run on those but they haven't broken through more people say they'd be motivated to vote for a Democrat because of those tax cuts\nAnd when you ask people about the rising federal deficit sixty percent including a plurality of Republicans say in order to address the deficit they'd prefer to roll back tax cuts rounds okay entitlements\nAnd fears and medical months in our across\nThe Midwest it's green harvesting time and this year there are three big problems one is wet fields too low crop prices exacerbated by trade war that decimated the Chinese market for soybeans and third some twists from the new tax law Amy Mayer reports from Iowa Public radio\nRan and harvest inland on Iowa the combined laid out the Sam's paws are pulled apart and the hard yellow beans fill the hopper sentence cousin pose a matching red tractor up alongside positioning the attached rains higher catch the beans as they're offered out of the

dollars a bushel off the price as mints and we'll get costing him tens of thousands of dollars\nIt's one more thing that we have pretty much no control over it seems like that affects us greatly so I guess we're just kind of rolling with the punches here on this\nThe punches keep coming this year besides the Harris persistent rain pushed harvest back by weeks and there's the new tax law that could have a big effect on farmers who sell their crops to the local grain cooperative\nIowa State university ag economist Kerry Jacobson says the laws changes make who to sell to a dicey proposition that's what's hard to nail down and that's where farmers are in marketing decision process at this point for example a farm with lots of employees might be better off selling to a private ethanol plant\nBut one with no employees might benefit from joining a co op Mike Howland who farms near Huxley Iowa serves on the border heartland co-op he says even though he's been paying close attention he still doesn't understand how that changes will affect his bottom line\nI've contacted my accountant about it and he's still going to school and learning about it so he didn't feel comfortable at this point advising\nFor now Helens more concerned with bringing in his crop most of us will be glad when this year just over the agriculture department promised farmers twelve billion dollars to help offset the tariff impact but ... says that's not a real effects but we are in an election year so I figured there'd probably be something like that coming out\nAs a\nKey cough elevator enroll in the Iowa sees

women and girls came forward in court this year and said they were sexually abused by one man and that abuse went on for decades\nLarry Nassar was the top doctor for the U.S women's Olympic gymnastics team he also worked from Michigan State university this past January Nassar was sentenced to up to a hundred and Seventy five years in prison\nToday we're going to look at really what is the central mystery has the case how did Nasser get away with it for so long to reporters at\nMichigan Radio have been digging into this question and a new podcast that's called believed I talked to the host Kate Wells and Lindsey Smith and before we start we should warn listeners this conversation includes some graphic language describing sexual assault\n... both high while for having us I Know that um when you guys set out one of your goals was to dig more deeply into the failures that allowed ... to abuse women and girls for as long as he did\nWhat did you find this is Kate\nSo one of the things that we found is that guys like Larry Nassar are are really good at winning your trust and you can hear some of that actually happening in a police tape\nHere was taped during two different police interview there two years apart for both two different complaints by the Michigan State university police\nAnd in the first one you can hear him talking to this detective about this complaint that come in against him\nAs far as the same time ... would feel that I was ...\nYears you know it's going to be here that you feel bad that she feels\nThat way because I feel like this little really that's not right and that's why we're solving long drawn out for a while if I recall right twice a year\nI mean this is fascinating she is being interrogated by a police officer who's telling him it's good to hear that you feel bad what does that tell you\nWell I mean what really the shows you how good Larry Nassar is at manipulating other people and and how overwhelming on an individual level\nThat can feel you know what is more likely in this situation that one young woman as far as this detective is aware as miss understood a valid medical technique\nOr you know the ... Olympic doctor who's been doing this for so long and who's so many people love and he's the best at this that he abused one girl I mean it's just hard on a human level to not get sucked into this kind of manipulation\nThis is Lindsey he does this over and over I mean we've given you one example Noel but he does this in a multitude of ways of this two and a half hour long interview and he also layers and I teach this I lecture on this any sort of doubt you might have had about his\nTechnique than his legitimacy he's really doing everything they can to build that up this is Kate again he gets cleared to go back to work after that they put them back into the clinic and we know that at least Seventy women and girls say that they were abused after that twenty fourteen case and and when he returned to treating patients\nSeventy yeah eventually another interrogation and this interrogation leads to his arrest I Know you have some tape of that but tell tell me about it as well\nSo this is an interrogation from twenty sixteen uh another accuser has come forward this same her name is Rachel ... also comes forward publicly in a newspaper article in the Indianapolis Star\nAnd she also decides to call police about a case of abuse that had happened to her Fifteen Years prior and this call goes to a different detective at MSU police detective Andrea maneuvered and she definitely takes a different approach\nOr she is working ... name of his own\nSo that was eventually over ... characters or would you mind if I if I were using this as a country is not a huge pushing off her\nLook I I'm again this\nWas something that you're just trying to me is very different than how she just ...\nWhat is the important difference in this interrogation why does this interrogation lead to an arrest were the other one did\nNot I mean to put it probably to simply does that give them an Fred comes in believing Rachel she also has the benefit of knowing that this is the second complaint\nAnd Rachel has brought a lot of evidence with her that this abuse happened journal entries medical records and so India believes Rachel and she's able to go into this interview and put the pressure on Nassau\nIt's not about well why did it take so long for this woman to come forward or maybe she was confused is very much Nasser needs to be able to answer very simple questions and you start to hear that he can't he just starts to fall apart\nThere was a arousal is is is very much because of for over a much higher as well as your version or Russian your immune but I don't\nActually you know you're just saying that you know you you you um [noise]\nWhen we interviewed this detective Andrea Mumford one isn't she talks about looking back at the interviews that she herself was kind of onshore wind NASCAR would have so much trouble answering\nSuch a simple questions like why would you have interaction during a medical appointment\nI was thinking should ask questions a different way and that pertains to answer and then I thought that was his and he doesn't have one he doesn't have an explanation\nHe doesn't have an explanation so you guys in you're digging you learned that it does make a big difference if if police if parents start by believing the victim worth the very least hearing the victim out yeah\nWell I mean fundamentally this is how guys like this operate is they know that you don't want to believe that somebody you love and trust and who seems like just as great guy\nCould be hurting somebody as humans are not good at thinking that can happen to the people that we work with or who are family but the reality is that guys like ... don't operate in a vacuum it it takes a lot of people to be manipulated and to fail\nThese women and girls for so long [noise]\nKate Wells and Lindsey Smith are hosts of the new podcast believed from Michigan Radio and NPR thank you both so much\nThings now while the wild things to have enough [noise]\nYou're listening to MORNING EDITION from NPR News or the music was written by BJ Lederman an arranged by Jim Pew I'm Noel King and I'm Rachel Martin [noise]\n[noise] I'm Jonathan Capehart politics is your favorite reality show or if you're just trying to keep up with this rapid pace of\nThe midterm elections we've got you covered joined me every Monday through Thursday for America on the line alive using college show will have the latest political news analysis and your calls on the issues that will matter most to you when you cast your ballot America on the line a national conversation\nMonday through Thursday of seven pm on eighty nine point three Casey cc\nMm\nThis is Southern California public radio eighty nine points ...

we're not in you know we're just not we're not going to be somebody's little hand out all the time and that you know we want to grow our economy here\nAnd ask for pick a specifically\nAs long as they keep moving forward that's what my\nBiggest hasn't just been moving forward it has been barreling down the highway at breakneck speeds with\nIt's really an emergency situation we weren't prepared for this this is the mayor\n... name has been ... seals and she says her city needs to see more of that money because now there are way more people here in this place can handle what's the population of\nThat's a hard one to answer [laughter] according to the twenty to and population were just under ten thousand we are easily on any given day somewhere between thirty and fifty thousand depending on how many people are driving in\nAnd that's putting a huge strain on this small towns infrastructure there aren't enough things like restaurants or even grocery stores\nUnless you've actually been here you don't understand what the need is here\nYou don't understand what it's like to stand in these lines at the grocery store and then when you go\nThe shells the route of bread milk you know all the staples\nMy husband's retired he knows when ... guys you know [laughter] and the bread guy shows up literally ... when he goes to get get those things for us that's crazy it is crazy we would probably have exploded even more if we'd had the housing in place\nBecause right now so many of these workers that are living in the arby's travel trailers the workforce lodging\nThey'll live there but most time their families aren't going to live there for an indefinite length of time\nThere's an oil field you don't want to bring your family here anyway it was a man camp like\nYet um she said man camps that is literally what people here call the temporary housing sites that have popped up in the last few years to come\nAnd I ate all of these oil workers Kelly Duke is the twenty four year old manager of this man camp she's wearing a rainbow tied I T shirt with a unicorn on it it says keeping it real\nThey work these crazy hours so we just have to get in there and make it like home like home cooked meals smile on your face you know agreed on like kind of that thing so it's not like it's their princesses but uh it's nice to come home domain bed\nKaylee points out the double wide trailers as we walk around each of them can sleep up to ten men sometimes they get their own room sometimes if they work opposite ships they share\nWe got our two full size beds and we have a night table into a closet like what\nTwo years ago Kelly was doing the same work in North Dakota and when the oil and he goes to took off so did she\nIt's good money and let's say you're not going to college at the moment I mean this is the place to be if you're out in effect for money\nSo that's a snapshot of the situation here and take us fracking has opened up the basins and there's money to be made by anyone who can find a foothold into oil or any of the related businesses\nNot everyone is seeing a direct benefit though property taxes have gone up here the problem is it's not just the oil companies that pay that hike it's working class families who have\nBeen here for generations that mentality is take it while you can but they don't recognize that there are people who are being left behind\nAll the ... is the county attorney she is a lifelong Democrat as are most people here but the oil boom seems to be changing\nHere we are [noise]\nAll the has been going door to door\nHi how are you sir\nI'm trying to get their vote out\nFor Beto O'Rourke okay thanks bye-bye spit or work has even Republican incumbent Senator Ted Cruz a run for his money and all the never expected that ... would have an uphill battle here\nPeople I knew um who had been Democrats three years having now just [noise]\nDecided that I guess the Republican ways better\nBetter because even if\nThey themselves are making money hand over fist people around them are and that has to be good in the long run so the thinking goes maybe they'll finally get that grocery store there's also talk of any hospital maybe the city will have enough money to fix up the rundown cemetery in the middle of town [noise]\nSo what happened to the blue wave I mean the reason that our work has gotten so much that's where many attention is because he's come further than any other democratic candidate in recent history a but you're not feeling it I'm not feeling it here [noise]\nWe were filling up our GMC you pause at the gas station on the main drag a bearded guy in an equally large truck\nHis name is John packed a retired from the fire department\nFor three years go by her work\nOf a double bus hours in front of

C. and I'm Rachel Martin in Del Rio Texas we've been on a road trip through the tax us twenty third congressional district district which is actually a rare swing district in this very red state it covers a long\nStretch of land that goes from outside El Paso all the way to San Antonio and we've been visiting different corners of the district talking to voters about what's going through their minds ahead of the mid term elections immigration has become a huge issue leading into these midterms across the country President Trump has seized on to the issue during rallies I had a voting day\nIncluding the rally that he held here in Houston earlier in the week\nBut we wanted to know how the immigration issue is playing here along the border right now at this very moment I'm looking out over the natural barrier that separates the U.S and Mexico\nIt's lake ... on the Rio Grande river armies Dodd means friendship in Spanish which is appropriate because like other American border towns life in Del Rio is woven together with the town on the other side in Mexico and they'll reuse case it's the city of a junior Mexico\nWe're a family and this border\nThis is Amanda ... her family has lived around Del Rio for generations and our house is just a five minute drive to the border in on the other side is a coon yeah\nI don't look down to them I Am they're equal because I grew up with him but you still don't want them to come here I Want them to come here but I wanted him to come here the right way a\nMental lives with her longtime partner Ralph also grew up here you know like if you're going to be like some tea yeah okay I really would be in a hot humid or I don't know if you're also demand across into a coon yeah a couple of times a week\nWhat to say that I have friends yes and I have um I go shopping over there I go to the dentist over there I buy groceries over their\nAmanda has sympathy for people who are seeking a better life in the U.S [noise] but you also has a lot of stories about people she says are gaming the system she tells me she worked for a time at the local jail where she talked with people who got caught coming over the border\nTo fight to keep coming in because I get my teeth you know my medicine\nDo you think there are too many illegal immigrants who are exploiting the system yeah\nThat's the part that I don't think it makes me very angry\nWhat do you make of talk from President Trump when he says he wants to build a wall that would separate Del Rio from Mexico now\nIt when they say separate or what there is a while to get on with anybody back and if you went through you can get through\nNow to be clear in parts of the border near Del Rio there's not a wall there's a big black fence and in other areas there is no manmade barrier at all\nIt's it's it's ... it's a rugged terrain\nThis is Joe Frank martini as he's been the sheriff here for the past ten years he is a tall man with weathered skin and white hair and a voice that says he's seen an awful lot in these harsh conditions\nPeople are prepared for that we've had those instances where people have died out there when the last six months up that we've had three\nOver the past year he's taken an assortment of lawmakers from Washington DC on a\nTour of the border just like he's doing for us today we drive along the dirt road that runs parallel to Mexico\nThat's linked up before your body starts talking about the border wall and you see it in this natural state people up north Dakota there's a war zone out here and it's actually not to me before we started throwing money at a problem you have to identify the problem\nTo him the problem is an immigration system that's been broken for fifty years\nAnd he says it can't be fixed with a wall because for starters where would you put it Jeff Martinez drives us up the road where there is no more fence instead there are these houses along the river bank he pulled up on a vacant lot between two homes he knows the owner he tells us it's no problem there ... sheriff\nSo don't deserve as much as\nJust across this little yes it's even a river this looks like a week of increased the river and remember how many feet are we talking about\nAh we're probably talking what three hundred feet followed her feet\nI mean that's the hardest will cross now so a ninth someone can just swim across just walk up here just like we didn't walk to that road mhm I asked\nSheriff Martinez how the immigration debate is affecting people's politics here\nAnd like other folks we spoke to in Del Rio he said it's not top of mind for residents this is a relatively quiet part of the border the people who do sneak in get out quickly and moved to bigger cities\nAnd even a Republican congressman will Hurd has spoken out against the wall he's facing a democratic challenger named Gina Ortiz Jones who's trying to tie her to President Trump\nBut this is a swing district and heard has positioned himself as a moderate and by doing so he's won the support people like Jeff Martinez\nWill ask them to an air of giving them the same tour alike well here's your self that our office he uh he's been an advocate for us\nAnd this is interesting because sheriff Martinez like most elected officials here is a Democrat and even though we didn't vote for President Trump and has some issues with his policies and his rhetoric Martinez is pleased about one thing\nThis administration the shirts have been invited to the table previous administrations we worked or if we were older buddy hills was even the bones were blown that up but the\nTo solve the immigration issue the sheriff has to be able to read that you can't just go to though\nBecause he knows the battle over immigration is going to go on for a very long time which brings us back to the original question what about that won't\nSee my idea was to you can control with technology cameras instead of putting a physical structure because where you're going to put it\nHe points to the house is along the river on the U.S side of the border\nAre you going to put these people and ...\nIn the wrong side of the wall where your vote ... meanwhile people like Amanda a year a block out the noise about the wall she will vote for the incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz and Republican congressman will Hurd and she will keep going back

European countries get for some of the most expensive drugs dispensed by doctors yeah this is a really creative proposal Dan Mendelson of health care consulting firm ...\nBasically what they would do is create a benchmark of prices based on what drug companies are charging internationally\nEmpowering Medicare to get those lower prices this is something Republicans have resisted in the past but Northwestern University health care economists Craig Garth weight calls at the same Trump in world view behind recent terrorists\nWhere the world is that other people are taking advantage of the United states and we're going to be strong and we're going to fix that\nAnd so we're going to force of Europe to pay more by having the United states pay less\nHe says European prices would go up a little with drug companies knowing there simultaneously setting us prices now there's a lot of unknowns here how it would work if it would work who would affect those answers won't come until a draft

the economy or fix the environment\nThat used to seem crazy to many other economists who tend to focus more on concrete things such as widgets coming out of factories not seemingly mushy things like ideas\nDr Paul Romer chews on all sorts of interesting matters such as the difference between blind optimism I things will be fine you'll magically have enough money for retirement versus what is called conditional optimism retirement will be fine if we have a savings plan\nRobbers an economist in New York University's stern school of business the other day he got the news that he was one of two winners of the Nobel Prize in economics ... welcome to the program glad to be here\nI mean since you won the prize the other day has been trying to catch up and read up on what you call conditional optimism trying to understand it better this isn't just rose colored glasses aw shucks technology progresses be patient a lot of this gets worked out\nCan you give me a sense of what the nature of the conditional optimism is\nIf you think about the fears people had a century ago about mechanization and the way this was gonna destroy jobs the complacent attitude would have been to say it'll all work itself out everybody will be fine\nThat's that would have been the wrong attitude what we had was this sense of we've got to do the right thing and the twentieth century there was a high school movement that said we got to get everybody up to the level of high school education\nTo be able to do the new kinds of jobs that are that are coming so if conditional on doing the right thing in that case a big investment education everything can turn out better for everybody but if you just our complacency it'll work itself out\nOr you're you're not going to be happy with the outcome\nYou know it's funny you should mention that historical example a crucial story we continue to follow here is what technology will do for but also due to the labor force\nWith artificial intelligence automation robots are entering everyone says a highly disruptive period but I Do talk to people who say don't worry about it as a matter of policy it's worked itself out in the past does your notion of conditional optimism\nHelp us with what tech will do to the workforce this time around\nAbsolutely and and there's a cautionary message here because people can look at the past and say hey you know twenty century turned out fine so there's no problem it turned out fine because we did things to make sure it turned out fine and so there's no basis for complacency\nIn the success record that we can see when we look back there are new things we need to do in the labor market in education and in thinking about the future of energy sources as long as we do those things everything really can turned out fine\nNow many of our listeners will know that your dad Roy Romer was the governor of Colorado for more than a decade you probably think of a pretty good sense of how politicians chick but help me understand this you don't think that economists like yourself should be out there actually lobbying for the policies that they believe in\nOne of the most powerful insights and economics is this idea of a division of labor\nYou do the thing you're good at other people do something else that they're good at the net effect is better for everybody so there's a process that involves a kind of political entrepreneurship where you know someone like my dad or any other politician builds coalitions they tried to make a case for some kind of decision\nThat's something that that I could see he was very good at but I didn't want to compete with him because he was so good at it so I wanted to go off and do something else what we can do as economists and scientists more generally say\nWe're not going to join the fight between the different sides that's got to play out but all sides will be better off if you start from an accurate sense of what's true and our job is to be the ones who can say here's what here's what we know and there's some things that you could try but you welcome Lee are the ones who make the decision\nAnd before we go to a doctor at UC

elections leading up to next month's voting we've been bringing you stories from some of the key districts across the country Texas is twenty third district is viewed as one of the Lone Star state's only real truth ... swing districts and that's where we find our own Rachel Martin Morning Rachel\nHey no algal morning from Del Rio Texas that's where we're broadcasting from this morning right near the U.S border with Mexico this district is huge not in terms of population necessarily but in terms of just actual land mass it goes all the way from just outside El Paso to San Antonio\nAnd the suburbs around those cities are really key in the upcoming elections Republicans and Democrats are both fighting for the votes in particular of white suburban women like the two women were going to introduce you to right now\nWe drove into hunters creek neighborhood and quickly noticed a pattern we've passed hunter circles entrance gate hunters do\nEvery street starts with hunters yes it's kind of silly right it just makes it that much more confusing because\nThis is Janet Ogle store she and her husband made a good living in real estate they are retired now and she teaches part time ... at the gym nearby and so that makes it more cardio okay that little sweaty okay have you taken a lot and we met her at her house in a well manicured cul de sac\nGet it says people here are friendly enough but on the whole everyone sort of keep to themselves which actually suits are just fine she filled up water bottles and we had it out for a walk with a straight yeah actually for this way in many ways Janet represents a lot of white liberal women\nWhen Trump was elected and I kind of fell apart and to get back together I actually did a lot of reading of you know OK Howard how to survive this and the advice was get busy\nFor her that included volunteering for a group she cared a lot about Planned Parenthood and I actually\nGot a pink Cape my first year\nThere 'cause I put in more hours and then people can be about as much and you don't have to wear the Cape again today\nJanet follows politics more closely than she ever did before she registers people to vote she donates to campaigns she even let's campaign staffers stay in her house so it was it an overstatement to say that it has been a political awakening\nFor you know I've always been aware of politically but I've also been complacent and they look around wearing this relatively affluent area I got mine you know I don't really have to worry that much and I hate that about my history I Wish I'd done more earlier\nFor progressive candidates I just didn't\nThink it was so necessary now I Do\nWe keep walking around the island in the middle of the street where the cactus is are painted to look like pumpkins for Halloween\nSo if you like we can cut right through here to my house yeah let's do okay there are a lot of campaign signs in Janet's front yard all for Democrats including Beto O'Rourke who's running a surprisingly competitive race against Republican incumbent Senator Ted Cruz\nJanet's not the only ONE Campaign signs have stirred up an Internet scene battle on the Web site next door\nIt all started when one guy said someone had stolen his Ted Cruz sign then he and others on the site talked about reading their signs with the power record to electric you the next person who tried Janet read the comments off the thread\nHere's what I wouldn't want to kill them but I Would share the video of him being shocked until the break or kicked good for you it's just goes on\nFor her crew supporters are in the same camp as Trump supporters and she just can't understand where they're coming from\nI think Trump spaces last I think when I hear them described as a cult that makes sense to me from what I've heard and seen that whatever he says it's fine whoever he hurts assigned\nIts neighbor Ellen Pfeifer is a big fan of Donald Trump Hi Ellen thank you so much for doing this absolutely I'm excited we were supposed to talk with her the same day we saw Janet but then Trump came to Texas for a rally and Ellen hats\nGo she and a couple of friends drove up to Houston stood in line for hours and got to see the president do his thing we spoke the next morning how was it\nIt was great it was everything that you hear on TV that it's going to be in more\nEllen likes the direction of the country is moving she likes Trump's tax cuts the low unemployment rate she also likes the president's position on immigration\nThe obvious uh onslaught of migrants coming up uh the inability of the the countries that are coming from and coming through to staunch the flow a\nIt's very concerning and ah there's just no accounting for all these people flowing\nIn I told Ellen about my conversation with her neighbor Janet ... in particular the bit were Janet said Trump's base acts like a cult Ellen says she doesn't think of herself as a radical she's voting for Ted Cruz and Republican will hurt and the congressional race but she thinks of herself as open minded\nI'd walk walked with a liver over in a very liberal neighborhood all summer and uh because I thought she was the best person for the job so I don't know I don't think I'm part of that cold\n[noise] um I guess I Would close by just asking if you could change anything about our current political moment would what would you change\nAh [noise] I I think I'm Out there every day you know I'm trying to a ... to be the opposite\nOf a cold and and have open arms to people and\nUh I I you know I Hope that I can lead by example and I think I Do ah we might have\nPolitical differences that we all or you know working towards the same goal\nBut no all that sentiment that you heard Ellen expressing there really is aspirational she she totally feels the divides between parties right now so does her neighbor Janet as we heard they're each making their case to their neighbors to try to see the world is they see it\nAnd these voters are going to be making decisions into really big races how are they talking about the Senate contest between Beto O'Rourke and Senator Ted Cruz and about the congressional race\nRight so we should say the congressional race a pitch the incumbent Republican will heard against the Democratic challenger Gina Ortiz Jones and according to a recent poll by the New York times will heard is up in that race by Fifteen points so that's a really big spread you know he's got an advantage not only is he the incumbent but\nHe's really positioned himself as as a moderate in in a swing district which he has to do a and and that is working to his advantage over ark and cruise much closer a cruise is up by seven points that our work is making a play\nOr we'll see if all the miles he's put on his car all the time he's putting with voters will make a difference um but it would be it would be\nTo tonic shift in Texas politics things right so this is NPR News ...\nAn entire

with Mexico I'm at this very moment looking over lake um east side on the Rio Grande river or this is the natural divide between the U.S and Mexico\nDel Rio is part of the twenty third congressional district in Texas a really why the only swing districts in this red state and we've been here talking to voters about what's on their mind to head of the twenty Eighteen bitter herbs and how they measure the presidency of Donald Trump\nThere is a new poll out this morning from NPR PBS NewsHour and merits that addresses that very topic and we have NPR's lead political editor Domenico Montanaro with us to discuss the findings governing the medical Hi Rachel so I Am at this moment looking up at the vast Texas guy and it feels pretty far away from Washington DC in\nPolitics but I'm not\nReally nice but let's dig into the poll\nFindings eh let's start with the president and Republicans they saw bumping enthusiasm among the base during a justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing did it last [noise]\nNot really you know the Kavanaugh factor appears to actually have faded as a big motivating issue for voters are Republicans have maintained their level of enthusiasm but with the pollsters tell us is that that's more likely because it's October the closer you get to the election there's a natural rise\nA and when you look at Kavanaugh specifically the number of people saying he's motivating their vote have gone down between both parties including Republicans\nAnd we see the president's approval rating back down to thirty nine percent\nWe see Democrats opening up a gap of ten points now on the question of whether you'd want to have a Democrat or Republican in control of Congress and your district\nI feel like you've been on the program several times over the past few months talking about the importance of women in these midterm elections a President Trump is struggling on that front as the polls show that he's making any inroads with female voters\nNot at all at one of our pollster said that it's really all about the gender gap here in twenty Eighteen or they said twenty ten and twenty fourteen were really about men who are motivated to take back the house and Senate upset with President Obama but in twenty eight peanuts about women who are motivated against President Trump\nWe saw that up and down on questions related to the president's approval rating to preference for control of Congress and in particular when you look at white college educated women they give the president the lowest approval ratings of almost any group and are among the highest to believe that these elections are very important so they're very motivated\n... really interesting because we did meet a woman care Janet ... in the suburbs of San Antonio same thing um she's a liberal she's a Democrat but the election of Donald Trump a shattered her and she's become politically motivated in a in a totally new way so we've definitely seen that play out here\nWhat about issues the medical I mean it does a poll addressed what are the issues that are that are going to motivate people to turn out that you're\nWell you know first and foremost a driving factor in this election as President Trump two thirds said that the president will be a factor in their vote that's twenty points higher than in twenty fourteen when the same question was asked about President Obama and that's the year Republicans took back the Senate but when we drove in specifically at some of the issues that are important to people\nThe top issue of course was jobs and the economy\nFollowed by health care and immigration all of which we've heard a lot about in this election but when you break it down by party that's where you see some real differences Republicans jobs in the economy and immigration far and away the biggest issues nothing else comes close\nFor Democrats it's health care and climate change a notice I didn't mention those tax cuts Republicans hope to run on those but they haven't broken through more people say they'd be motivated to vote for a Democrat because of those tax cuts\nAnd when you ask people about the rising federal deficit sixty percent including a plurality of Republicans say in order to address the deficit they'd prefer to roll back tax cuts rose okay entitlements and fears of medical months in our across\nThe Midwest it's grain harvest in

just kind of rolling with the punches here on this\nAnd the punches keep coming this year besides the terrorists persistent rain pushed harvest back by weeks and there's the new tax law that could have a big effect on farmers who sell their crops to the local grain cooperative\nIowa State university ag economist Kerry Jacobson says the laws changes make who to sell to a dicey proposition that's what's hard to nail down and that's where farmers are in their marketing decision process at this point for example\nA farm with lots of employees might be better off selling to a private ethanol plant but one with no employees might benefit from joining a co op Mike Howland who farms near Huxley Iowa serves on the border heartland co-op he\nSays even though he's been paying close attention he still doesn't understand how that changes will affect his bottom line\nI've contacted my accountant about it and he's still going to school and learning about it so he didn't feel comfortable at this point advising\nFor now Helen's more concerned with bringing in his crop\nMost of us will be glad when this year just over\nThe agriculture department promised farmers twelve billion dollars to help offset the tariff impact but ... says that's not a real effects but we are in an election year so I figured there'd probably be something like that coming [noise]\nAs a key\nCos elevator enroll in the

covers a long stretch of land that goes from outside El Paso all the way to San Antonio\nWe've been visiting different corners of the district talking to voters about what's going to their minds ahead of the midterms\nPresident Trump has made immigration a central issue in the upcoming vote warning about the influx of migrants from Central America who are coming through Mexico towards the U.S the president hammer at this point again during a rally in Houston earlier this week\nBut we wanted to know how the issue is playing here along the border which is where we are right now I'm looking out over lake ... which connects to the Rio Grande river\nThat river is the natural barrier that separates the U.S and Mexico army started means friendship and Spanish which is appropriate because like other American border towns life in Del Rio is woven together with the town on the other side a coon yeah Mexico\nWe're a family and this border this is Amanda ... her family has lived around Del Rio for generations and our house is just a five minute drive to the border and on the other side is a coon yeah I don't know down to them and they're equal\nBecause I grew up with him but you still don't want them to come here I wanted to come here but I wanted him to come here the right way Amanda lives with her longtime partner Ralph law also grew\nUp here like if you're going to be like some tea yeah okay I really would be in a hot humid or higher than manned across into a ... a couple of times a week what to say that\nI have friends yes and I have um I go shopping over there I go to the dentist over there and my groceries over their\nAmanda has sympathy for people who are seeking a better life in the U.S but he also has a lot of stories about people she says are gaming the system she tells me she worked for a time at the local jail where she talked with people who got caught coming over the border\nLike you can get it because I get on my teeth you know my medicine\nSo you think there are too many illegal immigrants who are exploiting the system yeah\nThat's the part that I don't think it makes me very angry\nWhat do you make of talk from President Trump when he says he wants to build a wall that would separate Del Rio from Mexico now\n... ... ... when they separate a while there is a while to get on with anybody backing and you went to you can get through\nNow to be clear in parts of the border near Del Rio there is not alone there is a big black fence and in other areas there is no manmade barrier at all\nIt's it's it's ... it's a rugged terrain\nThis is Joe Frank martini as he's been the sheriff here for the past ten years he is a tall man with weathered skin and white hair and a voice that says he's seen an awful lot and he's harsh conditions\nPeople are prepared for that we've had those instances where people have died out there when the last six months of that we've had three\nOver the past year he's taken an assortment of lawmakers from Washington DC on a\nTour of the border just like he's doing for us today we drive along the dirt road that runs parallel to Mexico\nThat's before anybody starts talking about the border wall the new season this natural state people up north like that there's a war zone at her and it's actually not to me before we started throwing money at a problem you have to identify the problem\nTo him the problem is an immigration system that's been broken for fifty years\nAnd he says it can't be fixed with a wall because for starters where would you put it Jeff Martinez drives us up the road where there is no more fence instead there are these houses along the river bank he pulled up on a vacant lot between two homes you know the owner he tells us it's no problem there perks sheriffs\nThat'll do for others much\nJust across this little yeah that's even a river this looks like it will be Christian books river unreal how many feet are we talking\nAbout ah we're probably talking what three hundred feet four hundred feet\nI mean that's the hardest across now so at night someone can just from across just walk up here just like we didn't walk to that road mhm\nI asked sheriff Martinez how the immigration debate is affecting people's politics here\nAnd like other folks we spoke to in Del Rio he said it's not top of mind for residents this is a relatively quiet part of the border the people who do sneak in get out quickly and moved to a bigger cities\nAnd even the Republican congressman will Hurd has spoken out against the wall he's facing a democratic challenger named Gina Ortiz Jones who's trying to tie her to President Trump but this is a swing district and heard has positioned himself as a moderate and by doing so he's won the support of people like Jeff Martinez\nWill come to an air of giving them the same tour alike well here's your self that our office he uh he's been an advocate for us\nAnd this is interesting because sheriff Martinez like most elected officials here is a Democrat and even though we didn't vote for President Trump and has some issues with his policies and his rhetoric Martinez is pleased about one thing\nThis administration the shirts have been invited to the table previous administrations\nWe worked or we were over there everybody else was even the bowls worrying blow\nIt up like that to solve the immigration issue the sure to be at the table rejected can't just go to\nBecause he knows the battle over immigration is going to go on for a very long time which brings us back to the original question what about that won't\nSee my idea was to you can control with technology cameras instead of putting the physical structure because where you're going to put it\nHe points to the houses along the river on the U.S side of the border\nAre you going to put these people in Mexico or you go to put these people in the wrong side of the wall\nWhere you are but [noise]\nMeanwhile people like a ... year a block out the noise about

the program glad to be here\nI mean since you won the prize the other day I've been trying to catch up and read up on what you call conditional optimism trying to understand it better this isn't just rose colored glasses aw shucks technology progresses be patient a lot of this gets worked out\nCan you give me a sense of what the nature of the conditional optimism is\nIf you think about the fears people had a century ago about mechanization in the way this was gonna destroy jobs the complacent attitude would have been to say uh it'll all work itself out everybody will be fine\nThat's that would have been the wrong attitude what we had was this sense of we've got to do the right thing and the twentieth century there was a high school movement that said we've got to get everybody up to the level of high school education\nTo be able to do the new kinds of jobs that are that are coming so if conditional on doing the right thing in that case a big investment of education everything turned out better for everybody but if you just our complacency oh it'll work itself out\nOr you're you're not going to be happy with the outcome\nYou know it's funny you should mention that historical example a crucial story\nWe continue to follow here is what technology will do for but also due to\nThe labor force with artificial intelligence automation robots are entering everyone says highly disruptive period but I Do talk to people who say don't worry about it as a matter of policy it's worked itself out in the past does your notion of conditional optimism\nHelp us with what tech will do to the workforce this time around\nAbsolutely and there's a cautionary message here because people can look at the past and say hey you know twenty century turned out fine so there is no problem it turned out fine because we did things to make sure it turned out fine and so there's nobody says for complacency\nIn the success record that we can see when we look back there are new things we need to do in the labor market in education and didn't thinking about the future of energy sources as long as we do those things everything really can turned out fine\nNow many of our listeners will know that your dad Roy Romer was the governor of Colorado for more than a decade you probably think of a pretty good sense of how politicians chick but help me understand that you don't think that economists like yourself should be out there actually lobbying for the policies that they believe in\nOne of the most powerful insights an economics has this idea of a division of labor you do the things you're good at other people do something else that they're good at the net effect is better for everybody\nSo there's a process that involves kind of political entrepreneurship where you know someone like my dad or any other politician builds coalitions they try to make a case for some kind of decision\nThat's something that that I could see he was very good at but I didn't want to compete with him because he was so good at it so I wanted to go off and do something else what we can do as economists and scientists more generally say\nWe're not going to join the fight between the different sides that's got to play out but all sides will be better off if you start from an accurate sense of what's true and our job is to be the ones who can say here's what here's what we know and there's some things that you could try but you ultimately are the ones who make the decision\nAnd before we go duck to remember at UC Berkeley when they win a Nobel Prize they get an assigned parking

to the mid term elections leading up to next month's voting we've been bringing you stories from some of the key districts across the country Texas is twenty third district is viewed as one of the Lone Star state only real true swing districts and that's where we find our own Rachel Martin Morning Rachel\nHey no algal morning from Del Rio Texas that's where we're broadcasting from this morning right near the U.S border with Mexico a this district is huge not in terms of population necessarily but in terms of just actual en masse it goes all the way from just outside El Paso to San Antonio\nAnd the suburbs around those cities are really key in the upcoming elections Republicans and Democrats are both fighting for the votes in particular of white suburban women like the two women were going to introduce you to right now\nWe driven hunters creek neighborhood and quickly noticed a pattern we passed hunter circles entrance gate hunters do every street starts with hunters yes it's kind of silly right it just makes it much more confusing because this is Janet Ogle store she and her husband made a good living in real estate\nAre retired now and she teaches part time ... at the gym nearby and so that makes it more cardio okay that little sweaty okay have you taken a lot and we met her at her house in a well manicured cul de sac\nGet it says people here are friendly enough but on the whole everyone sort of keeps to themselves which actually suits are just fine she filled up water bottles and we headed out for a walk with Australia yeah actually for this way in many ways Janet represents a lot of white liberal women\nWhen Trump was elected and I kind of fell apart and to get back together I actually did a lot of reading of you know OK Howard how to survive this and the advice was get busy\nFor her that included volunteering for a group she cared a lot about Planned Parenthood\nAnd I actually got a pink Cape my first year\nBecause I put in more hours than people kept me about it much and you don't have to wear the Cape again today\nJanet follows politics more closely than she ever did before she registers people to vote she donates to campaigns she even let's campaign staffers stay in our house so it was it an overstatement to say that it has been a political awakening\nFor oh it's I've always been aware politically but I've also been complacent and then look around we're in this relatively affluent area I got mine you know I don't really have to worry that much um and I hate that about my history I Wish I'd done more earlier\nFor progressive candidates I just didn't\nThink it was so necessary now I Do\nWe keep walking around the island in the middle of the street where the ... are painted to look like pumpkins for Halloween\nSo if you like we can cut right through here to my house yeah let's do it in fact there are a lot of campaign signs in Janet's front yard all for Democrats including Beto O'Rourke who's running a surprisingly competitive race against Republican incumbent Senator Ted Cruz\nJanet's not the only ONE Campaign signs have stirred up an interesting battle on the Web site next door\nIt all started when one guy said someone had stolen his Ted Cruz sign then he and others on the site talked about rigging there are signs with a pow record to electric cute the next person who tried Janet read the comments off the thread\nHere's what I wouldn't want to kill them but I Would share the video of them being shocked until the break or kicked good for you it just goes on\nFor her crew supporters are in the same camp as Trump supporters and she just can't understand where they're coming from\nI think Trump spaces last I think when I hear them described as cult that makes sense to me from what I've heard and seen that what ever he says it's fine whoever he hurts assigned\nGen its neighbor Ellen Pfeifer is a big fan of Donald Trump\nHi Ellen thank you so much for doing this absolutely I'm excited we were supposed to talk with her the same day we saw Janet but then Trump came to Texas for a rally and Ellen had to go she and a couple of friends drove up to Houston stood in line for hours and got to see the president do his thing we spoke the next morning how was it\nIt was great it was everything that you hear on TV that it's going to be and more Ellen likes the direction that the country's moving she likes Trump's tax cuts the low unemployment rate she also likes the president's position on immigration the\nObvious uh onslaught of migrants coming up uh the inability of the the countries they're coming from and coming through two songs to flow a\nIt's very concerning and ah there's just no accounting for all these people flowing\nIn I told Ellen about my conversation with her neighbor Janet ... in particular the bit were Janet said Trump's base acts like a cult Ellen says she doesn't think of herself as a radical she's voting for Ted Cruz and Republican will hurt and the congressional race but she thinks of herself as open minded\nI blocked walked with a liver over in a very liberal neighborhood all summer and uh because I thought she was the best person for the job so I don't know I don't think I'm part of that cold\n[noise] um [noise] I guess I Would close by just asking if you could change anything about our current political moment would what would you

and I think I Do uh we might have\nPolitical differences that we all or you know working towards the same goal\nBut no all that sentiment that you heard Ellen expressing there really is aspirational she totally feels that divides between parties right now so does her neighbor Janet as we heard they're each making their case to their neighbors to try to see the world as they see it\nThanks so much

C.\nLive from NPR News in Washington encore of a cool I'm In law enforcement has intercepted two more suspicious packages addressed a prominent critics of President Trump\nAs NPR's Miles parks reports one package was addressed to democratic senator Cory Booker and another to former director of national intelligence James Clapper care of CNN\nMm [noise] All right NPR has been visiting swing districts and the twenty Eighteen midterms and in the state of Texas that is the twenty third congressional district which is where we find our own Rachel Martin today and get rid of it going\nHey Noel going pretty good I Am in Del Rio Texas looking out over lake um east odd which is actually part of the natural barrier that separates us from Mexico at least in this part of the border\nBut this is a huge congressional district just in terms of geography it stretches all the way from outside of El Paso to San Antonio but what is in the middle of this district is also a very interesting at this moment fracking has turned the ones small city of ... Texas into a boom town\n[noise] this is the practice [noise] there's a there's a lot of things that are having your voice you hear is that a thirty year old\nNot Sally [noise] like a lot of people born and raised here to take that he knows the language of\nThe ... they'll go downhill as well as\nMany people making money off the oil industry here is that a wife and three kids and not a lot of tolerance for [noise]\nYou'll hear people say that the oil industry\nIt really can be because\nPeople are fearful they get so dependent on it when it's gone they don't know what and I didn't want that to be\nSo we started a business that rents out construction equipment like port a potties to all sorts of corporations including oil companies and when it comes to politics not Elliott doesn't give President Trump all the credit for this bill but he does like what he's been seen\nAmerica First taking pride in what we do you know letting people know that [noise]\nYou know we're not you know we're just not we're not going to be somebody's little hand out all the time and\nThat you know we want to grow our economy\nHere and as for pick us as civically\nAs long as they keep moving forward that's\nThe biggest hasn't just been moving forward it has been barreling down the highway at breakneck speeds with\nIt's really an emergency situation we weren't prepared for this this is the mayor ... name has\nBeen ... seals and she says her city needs to see more of that money because now there are way more people here in this place can handle what's the population of\nIt's a hard one to answer [laughter] according to the twenty to in population were just under ten thousand we are easily on any given day somewhere between thirty and fifty thousand depending on how many people are driving in\nAnd that's putting a huge strain on this small towns infrastructure there aren't enough things like restaurants or even grocery stores\nUnless you've actually been here you don't understand what the need is here\nYou don't understand what it's like to stand in these lines at the grocery store and then when you go\nThe shows the route of bread milk you know all the staples\nMy husband's retired he knows when ... guys you know [laughter] when the braid guys shows up literally ... when he goes to get get those things for us that's crazy it is crazy we would probably have exploded even more if we'd had the housing in place\nBecause right now so many of these workers that are living in the army's travel trailers the workforce lodging\nThey'll live there but most time their family starting and lived there for an indefinite length of time\nThis is oil field you don't want to bring your family here anyways the man camp like\nShe said man camps that his list\nTruly what people here call the temporary housing sites that have popped up in the last few years to accommodate all of these oil workers Kaylee Duke is the twenty four year old manager of this man camp she's wearing a rainbow tied I T shirt with a unicorn on it it says keeping it real\nThey work these crazy hours so we just have to get in there and make it like home like home cooked meals smile on your face you know agreed on like kind of that thing so it's not like it's their princesses but uh it's nice to come home to remain bed\nKaylee points out the double wide trailers as we walk around each of them can sleep up to ten men sometimes they get their own room sometimes if they work opposite ships they share\nWe got our two full size beds and we have a night table into a closet like what\nTwo years ago Kelly was doing the same work in North Dakota and when the oil and he goes to took off so did she\nIt's good money and let's say you're not going to college at the moment I mean this is the place to be if you're out in effect for money\nSo that's a snapshot of the situation here in pick as fracking has opened up the basins and there's money to be made by anyone who can find a foothold into oil or any of the related businesses\nNot everyone is seeing a direct benefit though property taxes have gone up here the problem is it's not just the oil companies that pay that hike it's working class families who have\nBeen here for generations the mentality is take it while you can but they don't recognize it there are people who are being left behind all the ... is the county attorney she's a lifelong Democrat as are most people here but the oil boom seems to be changing\nHere we are [noise]\nAll the has been going door to door how are you sir\nI'm trying to get their vote out\nFor Beto O'Rourke [noise] okay thanks bye-bye federal Rourke has given Republican incumbent Senator Ted Cruz a run for his money and all the never expected that ... would have an uphill battle here people I knew\nUm who had been Democrats ... years having now just [noise]\nDecided that I guess the Republican ways better better\nBecause even if they themselves are making money hand over fist people around them are and that has to be good in the long run so the thinking goes maybe they'll finally get that grocery store there's also talk of any hospital maybe the city will have enough money to fix up the rundown cemetery in the middle of town [noise]\nSo what happened to the blue wave I mean the reason but our work has gotten so much that's where many attention is because he's come further than any other democratic candidate in recent history a but you're not feeling it I'm not feeling it here [noise]\nWhen we were filling up our DNC you pause at the gas station on the main drag

[noise] because right now we're moving forward for trash than hers\nQuick fast and in a hurry people like the feeling of the momentum here no well and the impact of the oil boom as you heard the shifting politics and pick us but like we said this was a really big congressional district it is truly one of the state's only swing districts and we export to other fascinating corners of it this week\nIt was great to hear those voices and you can hear more stories from rituals reporting in those other corners of the twenty third ... congressional district elsewhere in today's show that includes the story of a city among the U.S Mexico border\nThis is NPR News coming up on ...

C. and I'm Rachel Martin in Del Rio Texas we have been on a road trip through the Texas twenty third congressional district which is a rare swing district in this very red state\nIt covers a long stretch of land that goes from outside El Paso all the way to San Antonio we've been visiting different corners of the district talking to voters about what's going through their minds ahead of the midterms\nPresident Trump has made immigration a central issue in the upcoming vote warning about the influx of migrants from Central America were coming through Mexico towards the U. S. the president hammer at this point again during a rally in Houston earlier this week\nBut we wanted to know how the issue is playing here along the border which is where we are right now I'm looking out over lake ... which connects to the Rio Grande river\nThat river is the natural barrier that separates the U.S and Mexico ... means friendship and Spanish which is appropriate because like other American border towns life in Del Rio is woven together with the town on the other side a coon yeah Mexico\nWe're a family and this border this is Amanda ... her family has lived around Del Rio for generations and our house is just a five minute drive to the border and on the other side is a coon yeah I don't know down to them I Am they're equal\nBecause I grew up with him but you still don't want them to come here I Want them to come here but I Want them to come here the right way Amanda lives with her longtime partner Ralph\nAlso grow up there like if you're going to be like some tea okay I really would be in a hot humid or how he is I mean you're also demand across into a ... a couple of times a week what to say that\nI have friends yes and I have um I go shopping over there I go to the dentist over there and my groceries over their Amanda has\nSympathy for people who are seeking a better life in the U.S but she also has a lot of stories about people she says are gaming the system she tells me she worked for a time at the local jail where she talked with people who got caught coming over the border\nTo fight to keep coming in because I get my teeth you know my medicine\nSo you think there are too many illegal immigrants who are exploiting the system yeah\nThat's the part that I don't think it makes me very angry\nWhat do you make of talk from President Trump when he says he wants to build a wall that would separate Del Rio from Mexico\nNow it when they say separate ... there is a while to get on with anybody back and you what do you can get through\nNow to be clear in parts of the border near Del Rio there is not a wall there's a big black fence and in other areas there is no manmade barrier at all\nIt's it's it's ... it's a rugged terrain\nThis is Joe Frank martini as he's been the sheriff here for the past ten years he is a tall man with weathered skin and white hair and a voice that says he's seen an awful lot in these harsh conditions\nPeople are prepared for that we've had those instances where people have died out there was the last six months up that we've had three\nOver the past year he's taken an assortment of lawmakers from Washington DC on a tour of the border\nJust like he's doing for us today we drive along the dirt road that runs parallel to Mexico\nThat's linked up before anybody starts talking about the border wall the need to see it in this natural state people up north Dakota there's a war zone at her and it's actually not to me before we started throwing money at a problem you have to identify the problem\nTo him the problem is an immigration system that's been broken for fifty years\nAnd he says it can't be fixed with a wall because for starters where would you put it Jeff Martinez drives us up the road where there is no more fence instead there are these houses along the river bank he pulled up on a vacant lot between two homes he knows the owner he tells us it's no problem there perks sheriff's\nThat'll do for others let's\nJust across this little yes if even a river this looks like a lake of increased the river unreal how many feet are we talking about\nOur problem talking what three hundred feet followed her feet\nI mean that's a hard to swim across now so uh nine someone can just from across\nJust walk up here just like we didn't walk to that road mhm I asked sheriff Martinez how the immigration debate is affecting people's politics here\nAnd like other folks we spoke to in Del Rio he said it's not top of mind for residents this is a relatively quiet part of the border the people who do sneak in get out quickly and moved to a bigger cities\nAnd even a Republican congressman will Hurd has spoken out against the wall he's facing a democratic challenger named Gina Ortiz Jones who's trying to tie her to President Trump\nBut this is a swing district in heard has positioned himself as a moderate and by doing so he's one of the support people like sheriff Martinez\nWill have come to an air of giving them the same tour alike well here's you felt that our office he ah he's been an advocate for us\nAnd this is interesting because sheriff Martinez like most elected officials here is a Democrat and even though he didn't vote for President Trump and has some issues with his policies and his rhetoric Martinez is pleased about one thing\nThis administration the shirts have been invited to the table previous administrations\nWe work or if we were over ... hills was even the bones were blown\nThat up but the to solve the immigration issue the sheriff has to be able to return it can't just go to though\nBecause he knows the battle over immigration is going to go on for a very long time which brings us back to the original question what about that won't\nSay my idea was to you can control with technology cameras instead of putting the physical structure because where you're going to put it\nHe points to the houses along the river on the U.S side of the border\nAre you going to put these people and let you go are you going to put these people in the wrong side\nOf the wall where are you going to put it\nMeanwhile people like Amanda year a block out the noise about the wall she will vote for the incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz and Republican congressman will Hurd and she will keep going back and forth across the border in her backyard as she did with us when I\nFridays at seven eighty nine point three K BCC [noise]\n\nAlleged rewards for alleged bad behavior in the tech world\nMarketplace morning report is

services and I'll see\nOf course ideas matter but let's talk to a Nobel laureate who showed that ideas are quantifiable can be put into calculations showing how technological bright ideas boost the economy or fix the environment\nThat used to seem crazy to many other economists who tend to focus more on concrete things which is which is coming out of factories not seemingly mushy things like ideas\nDr Paul Romer Jews and all sorts of interesting matters such as the difference between blind optimism ice things will be fine you'll magically have enough money for retirement versus what is called conditional optimism retirement will be fine if we have a savings plans\nRobbers and economists to New York university's stern school of business the other day he got the news that he was one of two winners of the Nobel Prize in economics Dr rubber welcome to the program glad to be here\nI mean since you won the prize the other day has been trying to catch up and read up on what you call conditional optimism trying to understand it better this isn't just rose colored glasses aw shucks technology progresses be patient a lot of this gets worked out\nCan you give me a sense of what the nature of the conditional optimism is\nIf you think about the fears people had a century ago about mechanization in the way this was gonna destroy jobs\nThe complacent attitude would have been to say uh it'll all work itself out everybody will be fine that's that would have been the wrong attitude what we had was this sense of we've got to do the right thing and the twentieth century there was a high school movement that said we've got to get everybody up to the level of high school education\nTo be able to do the new kinds of jobs that are that are coming so if conditional on doing the right thing in that case a big investment education everything turned out better for everybody but if you just our complacency on it'll work itself out\nOr you're you're not going to be happy with the outcome\nYou know it's funny you should mention that historical example a crucial story we continue to follow here is what technology will do for but also due to the labor force\nWith artificial intelligence automation robots are entering everyone says a highly disruptive period but I Do talk to people who say don't worry about it as a matter of policy it's worked itself out in the past does your notion of conditional optimism\nHelp us with what tech will do to the workforce this time around\nAbsolutely and and there's a cautionary message here because people can look at the past and say hey you know twenty century turned out fine so there is no problem it turned out fine because we did things to make sure it turned out fine and so there's nobody says for complacency\nIn the success record that we can see when we look back there are new things we need to do in the labor market in education and didn't thinking about the future of energy sources as long as we do those things everything really can turn out fine\nNow many of our listeners will know that your dad Roy Romer was the governor of Colorado for more than a decade you probably think of it pretty good sense of how politicians chick but help me understand that you don't think that economists like yourself should be out there actually lobbying for the policies that they believe in\nOne of the most powerful insights in economics there's this idea of a division of labor you do the thing you're good at other people do something else that they're good at the net effect is better for everybody\nSo there's a process that involves a kind of political entrepreneurship where you know someone like my dad or any other politician builds coalitions they try to make a case for some kind of decision\nThat's something that that I could see he was very good at but I didn't want to compete with him because he was so good at it so I wanted to go off and do something else what we can do as economists and scientists more generally say\nWe're not going to join the fight between the different sides that's got to play out but all sides will be better off if you start from an accurate sense of what's true and our job is to be the ones who can say here's what here's what we know and there's some things that you could try but you ultimately are the ones who make the decision\nAnd before we go duck to

we've been bringing you stories from some of the key districts across the country Texas' twenty third district is viewed as one of the Lone Star state's only real true swing districts and that's where we find our own Rachel Martin Morning Rachel\nHey no algal morning from Del Rio Texas that's where we're broadcasting from this morning right near the U.S border with Mexico this district is huge not in terms of population necessarily but in terms of just actual en masse it goes all the way from just outside El Paso to San Antonio\nAnd the suburbs around those cities are really key in the upcoming elections Republicans and Democrats are both fighting for the votes in particular of white suburban women like the two women were going to introduce you to right now\nWe driven the hunters creek neighborhood and quickly noticed a pattern we passed hunter circles entrance gate hunters do\nEvery street starts with hunters yes it's kind of silly right it just makes it that much more confusing\nThis is Janet Ogle store she and her husband made a good living in real estate they are retired now and she teaches part time ... at the gym nearby and so that makes it more cardio okay the little sweaty okay have you taken a lot and we met her at her house in a well manicured cul de sac get it says people here are friendly enough\nBut on the whole everyone sort of keep to themselves which actually suits are just fine she filled up water bottles and we had it out for a walk with a straight yeah actually for this way in many ways Janet represents a lot of white liberal women\nWhen Trump was elected and I kind of fell apart and to get back together I actually did a lot of reading of you know OK Howard how to survive this and the advice was get busy\nFor her that included volunteering for a group she cared a lot about Planned Parenthood\nAnd I actually got a pink Cape my first year\nBecause I put in more hours and then people can be about as much as you don't have to wear the Cape again today\nJanet follows politics more closely than she ever did before she registers people to vote she donates to campaigns she even let's campaign staffers stay in her house so it was it an overstatement to say that it has been a political awakening\nFor you know I've always been aware of politically but I've also been complacent and they look around we're in this relatively affluent area I got mine you know I don't really have to worry that much and I hate that about my history I Wish I'd done more earlier\nFor progressive candidates I just didn't\nThink it was so necessary now I Do\nWe keep walking around the island in the middle of the street where the ... are painted to look like pumpkins for Halloween\nSo if you like we can cut right through here to my house yeah let's do it okay there are a lot of campaign signs and Janet's front yard all for Democrats including Beto O'Rourke who's running a surprisingly competitive race against Republican incumbent Senator Ted Cruz\nJanet's not the only ONE Campaign signs have stirred up an Internet scene battle on the Web site next door\nIt all started when one guy said someone had stolen his Ted Cruz sign then he and others on the site talked about reading their signs with a pow record too\nElectric cute the next person who tried Janet read the comments off the thread\nHere's what I wouldn't want to kill them but I Would share the video of them being shocked until the break or kicked good for you it just goes on\nFor her crew supporters are in the same camp as Trump supporters and she just can't understand where they're coming from\nI think Trump spaces last I think when I hear them described as a cult that makes sense to me from what I've heard and seen that whatever he says it's fine whoever he hurts assigned\nGen its neighbor Ellen Pfeifer is a big fan of Donald Trump Hi Ellen thank you so much for doing this absolutely\nI'm excited we were supposed to talk with her the same day we saw Janet but then Trump came to Texas for a rally and Ellen had to go she in a couple of friends drove up to Houston stood in line for hours and got to see the president do his thing we spoke the next morning how was it\nIt was great it was everything that you hear on TV that it's going to be in more\nEveryone likes the direction that the country is moving she likes Trump's tax cuts the low unemployment rate she also likes the president's position on immigration\nThe obvious uh onslaught of migrants coming up uh the inability of the the countries they're coming from and coming through to staunch the flow a it's very concerning\nAnd ah there's just no accounting for all these\nPeople flowing in I told Ellen about my conversation with her neighbor Janet ... in particular the bit were Janet said Trump's base acts like a cult Ellen says she doesn't think of herself as a radical she's voting for Ted Cruz and Republican will hurt and the congressional race but she thinks of herself as

Del Rio Texas which is just a few miles from the U.S border with Mexico I'm at this very moment looking over lake on his side on the Rio Grande river this is the natural divide between the U.S and Mexico\nDel Rio is part of the twenty third congressional district in Texas a really one of the only swing districts in this red state and we've been talking to voters about what's on their mind to head of the twenty eighth team the terms and how they measure the presidency of Donald Trump\nThere's a new poll out this morning from NPR PBS NewsHour and merits that addresses that very topic and we have NPR's lead political editor Domenico Montanaro with us to discuss the findings ... original so I Am at this moment looking up at the vast Texas guy and it feels pretty far away from Washington DC in politics\nBut so that's\nReally nice but let's dig into the poll\nFindings eh let's start with the president and Republicans they saw bumping enthusiasm among the base during a justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing did it last\n[noise] not really you know the Kavanaugh factor appears to actually have faded as a big motivating issue for voters Republicans have maintained their level of enthusiasm but with the pollsters tell us is that\nThat is more likely because it's October the closer you get to the election there's a natural rise a and when you look at Kavanaugh specifically the number of people saying he's motivating their vote have gone down between both parties including Republicans and we see the president's approval rating back down to thirty nine percent\nWe see Democrats opening up a gap of ten points now on the question of whether you'd want to have a Democrat or Republican in control of Congress and your district\nI feel like you've been on the program several times over the past few months talking about the importance of women in these midterm elections a President Trump is struggling on that front as the poll showed that he's making any inroads with female voters\nNot at all or one of our poster said that it's really all about the gender gap here in twenty Eighteen twenty ten and twenty four team are really about men who are motivated to take back the house and Senate upset with President Obama but\nIn twenty Eighteen it's about women who are motivated against President Trump\nWe saw that up and down on questions related to the president's approval rating to preference for control of Congress and in particular when you look at white college educated women they give the president the lowest approval ratings of almost any group and are among the highest to believe that these elections are very important so they're very motivated\n... really interesting because we did meet a woman here Janet Ogle store in the suburbs of San Antonio\nSame thing um she's a liberal she's a Democrat but the election of Donald Trump a shattered her and she's become politically motivated in a in a totally new way so we've definitely seen that play out here what about issues the medical I mean it does a poll addressed what are the issues that are that are going to motivate people to turn out that you're\nWell you know first and foremost the driving factor in this election as President Trump two thirds said that the president will be a factor in their vote that's twenty points higher than in twenty fourteen when the same question was asked about President Obama and that's the year Republicans took back the Senate but when we drove in specifically at some of the issues that are important to people\nThe top issue of course was jobs and the economy followed by health care and immigration all of which we've heard a lot about in this election but when you break it down by party that's where you see some real differences Republicans jobs in the economy and immigration far and away the biggest issues nothing else comes close\nFor Democrats health care and climate change I noticed I didn't mention those tax cuts Republicans hope to run on those but they haven't broken through more people say they'd be motivated to vote for a Democrat because of those tax cuts and when you ask\nPeople about the rising federal deficit sixty percent including a plurality of Republicans say in order to address the deficit they'd prefer to roll back tax cuts rather than touching title means\nAnd fears of medical months
