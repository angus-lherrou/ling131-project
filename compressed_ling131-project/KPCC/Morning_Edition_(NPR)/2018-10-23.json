visa and the diplomatic possible and he was even mess of the airport by member of the foreign office VIP team\nPatrick Robert ... has made a career out the steering senior political figures three public relations crises\nWell normally what happened in the situation like this is the foreign office with tipoff of visiting former head of state in the bill leave\nBefore anything unwarranted happened that clearly in this case the powers that be decided that they wanted to proceed with the with the rest of the way they did was horrified I mean it was just it was just the most undignified thing for us to do my quickly made contact with his representative\nAnd homeless from twenty four hours from than I was working hard trying to advise the general and how to get out of England\nBut getting out of England wasn't going to be easy\nViewership is charge for to cry genocide and batteries or in our best when his charge for the kind of general site they he's not in Munich at\nThe request to detain General Pinochet had come from Spanish lawyers who accused of murdering I'm torturing political opponents during his Seventeen year rule\nThey argued that on the international no European countries could try the general serious crimes committed elsewhere at large for the British public opinion supported the idea\nBut says Patrick what's in the general himself now under house arrest and went west remained unfazed by the crisis unfolding around him\nThe first time I mentioned was in this house on the went with his days\nAnd it was a peculiar thing because he was sitting at this lunch table and we had the English special rounds police are controlling to the rooms and meanwhile the rest of the house was controlled by the Chilean military and the leading figure in among these was the cook\nIt'd be bringing these biscuits out on the on the full of president Pinochet will be guzzling these these little biscuits and having cups of tea\nAnd being extremely welcoming and friendly to everyone who came into his house and let's face it he didn't know me from Adam and these extreme because is what happened in that ... did you come with a plan I came with a plan but the problem was that you have to remember in the early stages everyone believed this was going to be result in the high court very quickly by this case being thrown out\nAnd I was absolutely convinced that was not going to happen [noise]\nDid you manage to convince Pinochet himself with that I'm not sure I did my Spanish was never good enough\nDo not show by the way that he ever involved himself to that extent to detail in any of these cases if I have one criticism alternatives that he's in the room was delegates her I think that was obviously his great strengths as a as a president but when you're in trapped between the ... movement of angry Spanish judge and the CPS on the other hand you do need to be aware of what you're up against\nThe CPS crown prosecution side it's argued that General Pinochet had no immunity from prosecution General Pinochet argued that as a former head of state he did the argument went on for a month\nYou have to understand that you're gonna do my job properly you always have to be direct your clients and told them what you think you need to say to them this\nIs the only way that I can help you this is what you need to do\nWith uh some moments when they just have a blind spot will they cannot move for reasons that are awfully understandable to them but not to me\nThat's frustrating and quite a lot of that happened in the ... case because there were very few people in fact in charge you have children army you're the Chilean government your children military intelligence or the Chilean lawyers and then you have the u._k. lawyers hired by the truly lawyers I mean you have me\nWhat's the one piece of advice you wished he ... he didn't there was one point we had a huge argument with him about the need to issue an article\nExplaining his own personal situation and his advisors and that that would reduce his dignity\nAnd I said that you don't have to Fifteen months sitting in a baritone went versus dignity had been substantially reduced as it is and that it might be we're producing an optical explaining his situation\nBut they said falsely refuse what they did agree to do was to have TV lady factor which I then turned into a media moments which went live throughout the world and half of surely will come to watch this thing\nIt was the first of all the trinity we'd waited five months to see you know suddenly all across the finish or seen on television for the first time since the rest of the London but also ladies that Jeff Bingaman\nLady Sacha nicknamed the Iron Lady was British prime minister and a key ally of right wing leaders around the world\nAnd lots of joy comfortable here I Know how much we are to you the whole health during the ... campaign\nOr the Tea Party made headlines but it made no difference to the case itself\nLawyers were was pretending that they were doing and miles is Joel ... ruling the case in the next ... hearing all the rest of it didn't happen they get to go higher and higher and higher and there was\nIs eras excess and the from the legal suspected from day one we didn't win a single significant hearing\nIn fact the legal battle was leaving against Pinochet in Nineteen Ninety nine the Lord's ruled that she could be extradited to serious crimes allegedly committed often Nineteen eighty eight when Britain had rectify the un convention onto it ...\nIt was a momentous decision overturning the international tradition of immunity for full my headset state\nBut Patrick had already been done pushing a different idea an exemption on the grounds of Pinochet's ill health\nHe was a frail man question about it he was quite large and that to be moved around with care I think what the media does that they took the impression that he was in ... of because of the fact that we moved around in a wheelchair which was actually simply the easiest way to move ... around with a large at school\nOr when you're trying to go from one hospital project called to another back to his prison struck home\nIt what a dumped his ripple gave the British Government reason enough to know the extradition request and sent General Pinochet hung to Chile [noise]\nDid back in the south is cheering

hundreds of thousands of people took the streets of London recently to demand what they call the people's vote on Brexit they want to vote again\nAt the same time prime minister Theresa May is trying to complete breakfast and she is in some political danger members of her own conservative part of us had to be plotting against are forcing some and the opposition Labour Party to defend her ears ... shadow bread it here's cure storm or the shadow breakfast minister\nSome of the cause some comments about climate to this weekend attributed to conservative than the ... as a nothing short of disgraced [noise]\nNPR's London correspondent Frank Langfitt is on the line Frank morning hey good morning Steve a is Britain any closer to actually completing this deal to leave you\nKnow it's interesting Steve I'm answer she ... the prime minister may was in the house of commons yesterday she says Ninety five percent of the deal is done but that remaining five percent is huge so we've talked about how to avoid a border on the island of Ireland\nNow you know by leaving the you use the u._k. creates a need for a border between Ireland matches up you know part of the a party you and Northern Ireland which is part of the u._k. but they can't seem to work out an agreement on this and that's what's been holding everything up\nSo with all of this pressure on trees are made from within her own party for essentially not having a hard enough breakfast or not getting a deal done or just because conservatives in fight country survive\n[noise] um it was really tough language as you were hearing from cure storm or there was talk of yesterday were against the last few days where even a member of a party said there's a meeting on Wednesday and she should bring her own news um it's it's very hard language isn't really actually kind of bothered people here in the United kingdom um\nBut the thing is what's been remarkable about a prime minister may is she's been out this now for two years and she's still standing a lot of people didn't think she'd be here\nUm and even opponents I think have some grudging respect for her um her ability to sort of continue to dig punches a but continue to work on this and the other thing is there's nobody obvious to replace her\nAnd the the Tory party for part of the conservatives are very concerned about a another election where they could lose the labor\nWhile I'm trying to figure this out Frank I'm just going across the political spectrum ... sort of in the middle trying to get a deal done there are people on her right who want it to be a harder deal that Britain Lauren independence from that you but then there are these people on the left the hundreds of thousands that we mentioned do without 'em protested free peoples vote on Brexit what exactly would that be\nWhat they were talking about there is here's here's what they basically said they say you know two thousand sixteen when this ... was a first put to the people they feel they were sold a bill of goods or the Brexit years that ah everything's going to be great we're going to cut a great deal with the you were going to get a lot of money back\nTo working to pay for healthcare none of that to happen and Brexit negotiations or what British call a shambles in pretty much everybody agrees on that\nUm and so that's what they want but it's not likely the Theresa May is going to go for this because it's the last thing she wants to she has so much trouble politically in her party and beyond she certainly doesn't want to take this back to the people there's there's no going back as what you know I I really it's very unlikely at this point Steve\nFrank thanks so much really appreciate it happy to do it Steve That's NPR's Frank Langfitt speaking with us from London\n[noise] All right now let's get some perspective on that highly publicized caravan that's heading for the United States Air dramatic pictures showing about seven thousand people on the road out of violent Honduras and these are real families with real stories as we've reported on NPR\nBut he's not as big an event as news stories might suggest a few thousand of those people may reach the U.S and if they're like people in past caravans they'll probably request legal entry but remember the U.S except for more than one million legal permanent residents every year\nThe reason you're hearing about the caravan at all because of this symbolic use being made of these very real human beings\nMigration activists hope to call attention to Central American suffering President Trump has used the caravan to stoke fear before an election he falsely spoke yesterday of plots to quote overwhelmed by the states he kept the caravan and the news by threatening to cut off aid to Central American countries\nNow the aid that he threatened was actually designed to address the problem of migration that he was complaining about NPR's Michele Kelemen reports\nPresident Trump is sounding increasingly frustrated with how Central American countries are handling migration\nWaterfall on south Georgia made a lot of money every year we give a far is just not safe for us nothing\nHe's now warning those countries that he will start cutting off or substantially reducing foreign aid and some lawmakers are pushing back\nBy cutting off you know write your faith rather than doing here\nThat's Eliot Engel the ranking Democrat on the house committee on foreign affairs he says the president may be frustrated and angry about the caravan of migrants coming from those three countries and moving through Mexico but cutting aid will help\nMake sure we we\nIt'd be working with these countries to try to help alleviate some of the problems that are driving people to come to the United states and never by\nUSAID and the region is meant to do just that addressing the root causes of migration by improving security and rule of law last year according to the U.S global leadership coalition the U.S provided amount eight hundred thirty eight million dollars in foreign assistance to Central America and Mexico\nAnd it is making a difference on the ground according to Rick Jones who spoke to us from El Salvador where he works for Catholic Relief services\nIndustry the economic and sorry ... what do you answer connected George very much and the answer to the United states that developed an ... year that violence here because it pushing people and the Georgian irregular migration\nThe Trump Administration is reviewing all USAID making clear to countries that receive assistance that they should support U.S interests congressman angle points out that Congress holds the purse strings and he and his colleagues won't sit quietly bind if the administration tries to go around the will of Congress\nWe keep hearing from the administration that everybody who after all they won't vote for president obeying the empowerment controller which president from withdrawing on pounding money appropriated by Congress\nBut don't expect any quick moves on this as James Roberts of former foreign service officer now with the Heritage Foundation a conservative Washington think tank\nTo become a sustaining member go to Kay PCC dot org and thank you\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Noel King good morning celebrity chef\nCarla Hall grew up in Nashville where she was raised on soul food she celebrates the food of her childhood in her latest cookbook it's called Carla Hall soul food everyday and celebration host spoke to our co host\nDavid Greene and she shared a few recipes with him starting with the classic feared okra and you can just take\nThis Okrent slice it in half and salt and pepper and place it on the grill and it gets the smoking is that is so wonderful and then you don't have to worry about\nThe slime which I think a lot of people of course misunderstood it can get slimy right I think a lot of people don't like it because I think oh it's slimy and it's true you use those pods to thicken gumbo and soups and everything so that is one use for it\nBut you can also roasted you consider it you can grill it and\nIt becomes this other textured thing so am I right I mean when I\nThink of soul food I often think of of stuff that might not be that healthy ... chicken maybe fried okra to are you giving us like a healthier version of soul food order so food misunderstood I mean I Know that fried chicken in your book we should make that clear but got those fried chicken but they're more vegetables and fried chicken so ... what does that tell us about so\nI think that it is misunderstood I think there is a small piece that people know a soul food when you go to a soul food restaurant\nThe people who own that restaurant again to give you those celebration dishes that are going to bring you in when you are around the table and people from the outside come into your home you're celebrating so of course you're going to have Mac and cheese and some other pork chops and fried chicken and ribs and all of these things because that's\nWhat you do even in other cultures that's what you do\nSo I think that soul food got stuck there because this is what people are eating because they're celebrating and going to restaurants but people are having fried chicken every day because they couldn't kill their chickens I needed the eggs [noise]\nOne of the the real smile moments I'm reading the book was you distinguishing between soul food and southern food [laughter]\nCan you remind us what the differences in your mind black people okay [laughter] black people\nUm I think it's also the difference between a him and an egg rolls spiritual okay you know you can sing the same song but even if if you were doing a no like oh and then you have like\nNo\nOther notes that are being song or not on the paper but it is something about stealing that song and where that emotion came from so that is like our food it is it's a and I don't want to say is staying on it but it's not stay on it you know you're putting that heart and it is\nComing from some place deep in\nYour soul that you are getting out and and just wanting to pull somebody in and say I see you I feel the pain that you've been through that's an egg rolls spiritual\n[noise] well speaking of of pain that people have been through um I I Know you you took a journey through the self ah for this book and one of the stops you made was a mother Emanuel one of\nThe oldest black congregations in itself it was but churches hundred Ninety nine birthday but this was also as so many of us know where a gunman opened fire on\nWorshipers just over three years ago in interest in men's tragedy for for a whole country what what was that experience like\nWe had second thoughts about going there um because\nIt was there was so much pain but then because we were in town um\nWe decided to go in Charleston so in ... in Charleston South Carolina and they were having a celebration and it was so beautiful and we went to the kitchen and we're in the way\n[laughter] way because you're like a ... of the famous celebrity chef in Idaho right now I see and care that the matrix that catch there was like\nI'm trying to get this re past food done and you all are in the way um but they had all of these pots going in\nAnd then just this huge kitchen and there's a hierarchy that happens in the kitchen especially at these churches were these these women are getting this food out and then there's this one woman who's the best cook who was doling out a tasks\nTo other people and it is serious it was really beautiful and it was it was about the congregation coming together and there was a tragedy but there was also\nYou knew that they had each other and that anybody who came into that church that day was part of that family and it was just a beautiful thing\nOne more recipe from the book I wanted to ask you about um hot water corn bread this is not your average corporate Carla this is something different right\nIt is not your average corn bread if you're not from the south okay [laughter]\nPeople under ... exactly what you're talking about I I I've certainly had my share of corn bread and loved it but how what our vote of having a so what what what what what would I be doing with it if I tried to make this\nHot water corn bread um you start with white corn meal you boil water\nAnd the corn meal there is salt and there is a little bit of baking powder and the hot water actually cooks the corn meal and then you make it into little patties\nAnd I always remember my grandmother's finger\nBeing in those patio so she would make little over one's my mother and makes round ones whatever ... whatever shape and size you want and then you fry it and that\nBut it doesn't mean seriously it sounds like this recipe really carries a lot\nOf the the larger\nThings that you were learning about yourself through this project\nI must say that this was a personal journey but this book I set out to tell this story so that African\nAmericans could appreciate the food more and people outside of the community can understand what it is and and sort of maybe be inspired to not only cook this food but also to look at what their personal ... is and what their food from their culture looks like\nBut I got more from it I think I appreciate other cuisines more I realize I was carrying a chip on my shoulder about my food and wanting it to be special and and having this this moment or not just a moment but to be realized at and\nWhat it is but I had a chip on my shoulder into it come out sideways and it and you know uh and now it is just a law for this food and a deeper appreciation for other cuisines co hard

today he's expected to give a press briefing later detail how the U.S will pull out of a Cold War era and nuclear arms treaty\nThe Nineteen eighty seven I N F treaty prevented Russia and the U.S from having certain intermediate range missiles but President Trump says Russia is in violation of the agreement it's worth noting the Obama administration said the same and two thousand fourteen\nAnd then yesterday President Trump said that the U.S in fact plans to expand its nuclear arsenal until other nations in his words come to their senses John ... is with me now he's the director of the nuclear Crisis Group and former special assistant to President Obama can morning sir\nMorning I said we are hearing the term arms race thrown around is this language and are these developments warring team\nThey are um not only are the United states and Russia um vastly increasing their nuclear capabilities their missiles or numbers of nuclear weapons but we're no longer engaging with each other we're sort of operating in a blind and the chances\nThat we could miss calculate misunderstand or stumble into a crisis where nuclear weapons could be used as well\nAll right so so time to be very careful you served on the national Security Council under President Obama and and you were there when he accused Russia of violating this treaty the U.S did not withdraw then why not\n[noise] so we're very concerned that Russia is developed a small number of missiles which are banned by the treaty and deployed them\nBut they haven't produced them in numbers that really threatening to change the military situation in Europe we still have the upper hand through NATO Russia's building these the counter our conventional superiority our goal at and under the Obama administration to get Russia\nBack into the treaty because it serves our interests I think the big difference between President Trump the President Obama is President Trump really doesn't have a strategy for Russia back in a is really happy just to pull out\nA and John Bolton who was killed a number of arms control agreements over multiple ... and the government uh is very happy to go along with that strategy but there is NO PLAN for how you prove American security once we do to\n[noise] what do you think John Bolton is going to say today\n[noise] I think I'm going to say you can't cheat on American get away with it I'm the same thing he told the north Koreans back in two thousand two um he's going to say this treaty no longer so it was American interest because you cheated on it\nUm and we're going to go a merry way and build whatever you want you guys will just have to play catch 'em and I think as we've seen a lot of them are good news more than ...\nNot only playing catch up buildings systems which undermine our security and we're going to be adding fuel to this arms race that were already in\nThat there's another nuclear arms reduction treaty that I Know a lot of people have an eye on the new start treaty which is due to expire in two thousand and Twenty one and yesterday John Bolton said the U.S has not finalized its position on extending new start briefly remind us what it is and what happens if it expires\nSo you start is the last a strategic arms control agreement in place in the United states and Russia it puts American inspectors on the ground in Russia and Russian inspectors on the ground in the United states and it limits both countries to know more than Fifteen hundred and fifty nuclear weapons\nUm some of those races there's office two years how they haven't figured out that this is in our interest is beyond me but if it goes away we will be looking at a Russian program that grows a even more than it has and we will be like we have to increase our own spending on

time that the Saudis have become increasingly I'm\nA willing to allow civilian casualties uh to bomb a more or less indiscriminately uh we shouldn't be providing military assistance that enables them to do that\nSo I think a re examination certainly have our support for Saudi and the war in Yemen is overdue but I think what the ... murder does also is\nIt tells us we need a broader re examination of our relationship with Saudi Arabia not just a piece of the Yemen but is this really um the country we want to paint our entire Middle East policy on we want to make decisions about ah our support our relationship was after a on the basis of so\nThis I I think ought to cause us to do a deep dive examination of\nUs how to conduct a relationship with Saudi Arabia across the board and

been partisan disagreement on your committee are you in a position to push any action forward on Saudi Arabia\nI we certainly can push for deep examination of intelligence related to this incident but

from the rocketing lied to its target\nNow big countries like the U.S China and Russia already have weapons that can do something like this they're called intercontinental ballistic missiles and they can hit anywhere on the planet in minutes\nBut those missiles just go into a straight line\nFrom launched to target this vehicle would not only be able to come from space that people deterrent and bank and and uh fly almost like a real airplane and\nThe real appeal of hyper sonics especially for China and Russia they're afraid the u._s. can shoot down there\nWell let's take missiles with

that some of the problems ... years ago the civilized and nobody was talking about vice presidents do nobody was talking about no Jew whatsoever\nThe prime minister was trying to complete Brexit is in

London correspondent Frank Langfitt is on the line Frank I'm ordering hey good morning Steve a is Britain any closer to actually completing this deal to leave your\nMost interesting Steve I'm prime minister may was in the house of commons yesterday she says Ninety five percent of the deal is done but that remaining five percent is huge so we've talked about how to avoid a border on the island of Ireland\nNow you know by leaving the you use the u._k. creates a need for a border between Ireland matches up you know party you and Northern Ireland which is part of the u._k. but they can't seem to work out an agreement on this and that's what's been holding everything else\nSo with all of this pressure on the ... from within her own party for essentially not having a hard enough breakfast or not getting a deal done or just because conservatives in fight country survive\n[noise] um it was really tough language as you were hearing from cure storm or there was talk of yesterday were against the last few days where even a member of a party said there's a meeting on Wednesday and she should bring her own news um it's it's very hard language and really actually kind of bothered people here in the United kingdom um\nBut the thing is what's been remarkable about a prime minister may is she's been out this now for two years and she's still standing a lot of people didn't think she'd be here\nUm and even opponents I think have some grudging respect for her um her ability to sort of continue to dig punches a but continue to work on this and the other thing is there's nobody obvious to replace her\nAnd the the Tory party for part of the conservatives are very concerned about a and other election where they could lose the labor\nWhile I'm trying to figure this out Frank I'm just going across the political spectrum ... sort of in the middle trying to get a deal down there are people on her right who want it to be a harder deal that Britain lore independence from that you but then there are these people on the left the hundreds of thousands that we mentioned do without 'em protested free peoples vote on Brexit what exactly would that be\nWhat they were talking about there is here's here's what they basically says they say you know two thousand sixteen when this ... was a first put to the people they feel they were sold a bill of goods or the Brexit fears that ah everything's going to be great we're going to cut a great deal with the you were going to get a lot of money back\nTo working to pay for healthcare none of that to happen and Brexit negotiations or what British call a shambles in pretty much everybody agrees on that\nUm and so that's what they want but it's not likely the Theresa May is going to go for this because it's the last thing she wants to shift so much trouble politically in her party and beyond she certainly doesn't want to take this back to the people there's there's no going back as what you know I I really it's very unlikely at this point Steve\nFrank thanks so much really appreciate it happy to do it Steve That's NPR's Frank Langfitt speaking with us from London\n[noise] All right now let's get some perspective on that

being made of these very real human beings\nMigration activists hope to call attention to Central American suffering President Trump has used the caravan to stoke fear before an election he falsely spoke yesterday of plots to quote overwhelm the states he kept the caravan and the news by threatening to cut off aid to Central American countries\nNow the aid that he threatened was actually

handling migration\n... cell salvage always have a lot of money every year we give a far as I did not say for us nothing he's\nNow warning those countries that he will start cutting off or substantially reducing foreign aid and some lawmakers are pushing back\nBy cutting off you know write your faith residents to hear\nThat Eliot Engel the ranking Democrat on the house committee on foreign affairs he says the president may be frustrated and angry about the caravan of migrants coming from those three countries and moving through Mexico but cutting aid will help\nMake the

EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep\nAnd I'm Noel King good morning national security adviser John Bolton is in Moscow today he's expected to give a press briefing later detail how the U.S will pull out of a Cold War era and nuclear arms treaty\nThe Nineteen eighty seven I N F treaty prevented Russia and the U.S from having certain intermediate range missiles but President Trump says Russia is in violation of the agreement and it's worth noting the Obama administration said the same and two thousand fourteen\nAnd then yesterday President Trump said that the U.S in fact plans to expand its nuclear arsenal until other nations in his words come to their senses John wolf style is with me now he's the director of the nuclear Crisis Group and a former special assistant to President Obama can morning sir\nGood morning I said we are hearing the term arms race thrown around is this language and are these developments warring team\nThey are um not only or the United states and Russia um vastly increasing their nuclear capabilities their missiles and numbers of nuclear weapons\nBut we're no longer engaging with each other we're sort of operating in the blind and the chances that we could miss calculate misunderstand or stumble into a crisis where nuclear weapons could be used as growing\nAll right so so time to be very careful you served on the national Security Council under President Obama and and you were there when he accused Russia of violating this treaty the U.S did not withdraw then why not\n[noise] so we're very concerned that Russia has developed a small number of missiles which are banned by the treaty and deployed them\nBut they haven't produced them in numbers that really threatened to change the military situation in Europe we still have the upper hand through NATO Russia's building these the counter our conventional superiority or goal had been under the Obama administration to get Russia back into the treaty because it serves our interests\nI think the big difference between President Trump for President Obama\nIs President Trump really doesn't have a strategy for bringing Russia back in a is really happy just to pull out a and John Bolton who was killed a number of arms control agreements over multiple stunts and the government is very happy to go along and pursue that strategy but there is NO PLAN for how you improve American security once we do that\nWhat do you think John Bolton is going to say today\n[noise] I mean John ... going to say you can't cheat on American get away with it I'm the same thing he told the north Koreans back in two thousand and two um he's going to say this treaty no longer serves American interests because you cheated on it um and we're going to go or merry way and build whatever missiles we want you guys will just have to play catch up\nUm and I think as we've seen a lot of reporting is more than capable not only playing catch up a building systems which undermine our security and we're going to be adding fuel to this arms race that were already in\nThere's another nuclear arms reduction treaty that I Know a lot of people have an eye on the new start treaty which is due to expire in two thousand and Twenty one and yesterday John Bolton said the U.S has not finalized its position on extending new start briefly remind us what it is and what happens if it expires\nSo new start is the last a strategic arms control agreement in place between the United states and Russia it puts American inspectors on the ground in Russia in Russian inspectors on the ground in the United states\nAnd it limits both countries to know more than Fifteen hundred and fifty nuclear weapons I'm from administrators in his office two years how they haven't figured out that this was in our interest is beyond me\nBut if it goes away we will be looking at a Russian program that grows or even more than it has a and we will be likely having to increase our own spending a at our own nuclear deployments\nJohn ... of the nuclear Crisis Group thanks so much\nThanks for having me\nThis fall's governors' races include one of the largest a swing state Florida the Democratic mayor of

Marshall guns or has more\nOne of the new regulations would lead employers give workers money to buy health insurance on the Obamacare exchanges the Obama administration didn't allow that\nBecause of fears that employers would push their sickest workers on to the exchanges another new rule allows states to offer cheaper insurance plans that skirt some Affordable Care act requirements with fewer protections for people with preexisting conditions\nThese plants could appeal to younger healthier consumers but that could leave more older sicker people than the more comprehensive plan that do meet Affordable Care act requirements like coverage of preexisting conditions\nNancy Marshall games or in Washington Let's check the markets\nIn London is down one percent the German decks indexes down one point seven percent he's talking to us and Hong Kong film more than three percent overnight you're the essence of the future is down one point four percent a hint of a turbulent data come\nCrude oil is down one point seven percent of new\nYork to sixty eight dollars and change President Trump has repeated to reporters and unsubstantiated claims that congressional Republicans will roll out a ten percent tax cuts for middle class Americans before the midterm elections Trump said it would not be an executive order from him but that it would go through Congress which is in recess through the midterms\nCongressional leaders are indicating they know nothing of such a plant [noise]\nIt was the famous conservative economists Milton Friedman original formulation about economic stimulus throw money out of a helicopter so that individuals get a directly metaphorically speaking\nWell it turns out that there are a lot of twenty and thirty some things in America who might like to get one of those money Laden helicopters to fix education University of Chicago political science professor Cathy Cohen is founder of Gen forward a regular scientific survey that pays\nSpecial attention to the race and gender of respondents professor Hi hello David\n... get used to know a comedian who had the ... discuss some problem any problem and then ask what's my point more money for education you would say is the answer to every single problem that's in a sense what you found when the question is education\nI think that's true clearly millennials have have seen his routine when we ask young people any number of questions about the best way to improve public education they always circle back to increase in funding for public education so they want to pay teachers more\nThey want to invest in neighborhood schools and overall they want to give more funding to public education\nAnd one of the features you surveys that you do green data based on the race of the responded and the gender what what did you find in Missouri a difference depending on who was answering\nIn this case it doesn't seem to matter very much overwhelming a young people I don't want to say independent of race and ethnicity but with their races and ethnicities support this idea of increasing funding for education on any number of dimensions\nSo uh this is a pretty consistent finding that seems to kind of extent across race and ethnicity\nAnd how would you respond and use the money if there were more money for education\n[noise] well they do a number of different things right there is a clear sense and the findings that young people believe that the most effective way to impact public education\nIs to really those kinds of relationships in the classroom that if given a priority with a limited amount of money they want to give it to teachers they want to support teachers they want to strengthen teachers' unions\nWhat about views of if it's not exactly public school I'm Talking about private school but also talking about the charter school movement\nYeah it's complicated I guess I Would say in the sense that young people are looking to improve education so they're supporting any number of strategies they are supportive of and\nSeeing the number of charter schools they are supportive of providing vouchers using government funds for in particular low income students but I Want to go back and say when given a list that says here are a number of options for improving public education\nThey choose investing in public education at the local\nLevel always good to talk about the latest results from this Gen forward surveys or its founder is University of Chicago political science professor Cathy Cohen Cathy thank you\nThank you [noise]\nMarketplace morning report is supported by his Cox insurance providing customized insurance for small and medium businesses so they can do more and be more\nTo learn more at H.

... murder it did Oh yes uh you know if it can actually the Saudis are were intent on pushing back though who these who were trying to take over the country dreaded oppose the legitimate government in Yemen a and we're getting around and help to do it\nBut we've seen over the course of time that the Saudis have become increasingly I'm\nA willing to allow civilian casualties uh to bomb a more or less indiscriminately uh we shouldn't be providing military assistance that enables them to do that\nSo I think a resentment I should certainly have our support for Saudi and the war in Yemen is overdue but I think what the ... murder does also is\nIt tells us we need a broader re examination of our relationship with Saudi Arabia not just a piece of the Yemen but\nIs this really um the country boy we want to paint our entire Middle East policy on we want to make decisions about ah our support to our relationship was after a on the basis of so this I I think ought to cause us to do a deep dive examination of\nUs how to conduct a relationship with Saudi Arabia across the board and inappropriately respond\nWell Saudi Arabia is human rights abuses are not anything new in in the U.S has remained close ally for years were you concerned when crown prince Mohammed bin Salman visited the White House during the Obama administration\n[noise] well it you know not concerned you know I mean certainly we hoped that uh the new ... the new crown prince would\nBring about changes and reforms in Saudi Arabia and certainly at times he has made nods towards a reform ah and that looked encouraging a Saudi Arabia has been an important ally\nBut that doesn't mean that we accept everything they do and critically and where are their prosecution of the war in Yemen is resulting in more and more ... ... civilian casualties\nWe can and must a push back a and certainly not allow our military assistance to to be used to uh hurt the innocent people are so they're important ally but they're not one that we want to rely on exclusively for our foreign policy in the region\nAnd very briefly there's been partisan disagreement on your committee are you in a position to push any action

is in Moscow for a second day to day he's there to discuss President Trump's pledge to withdraw from an arms control treaty that ban certain kinds of missiles this is one sign that world powers might be returning to an arms race mentality\nNow we have another side efforts by the United states China and Russia or to develop a new kind of missile a weapon that can fly faster and farther than almost anything in existence NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has the latest\nThese weapons are called hyper sonic weapons and they are fast really fast by definition they travel at least five times the speed of sound thousands of miles per hour\nThe air force is currently developing hyper sonic weapons including at a place called wind tunnel number not just outside of Washington DC was in\nThe morning I sure don't damn Mariner who's in charge said the test they were running that they were classified I wasn't going to get inside no not at this point but I was allowed in the lobby of the wind tunnel building [noise]\nTheir marriage showed me unclassified versions of\nThe things they work on so if you look on this table here we have several of the shapes that we've tested in the window among the models as a sleek silver wed with a spine down to center it was called a wave rider and so it's a fancy way to say rides on its own shock wave\nHere's how the wave writer works the wedge shaped warhead would be put on top of a rocket and fired at enormous speeds to the very edge of space then it would detach from the rocket and glad to its target\nNow big countries like the U.S China and Russia already have weapons that can do something like this they're called intercontinental ballistic missiles and they can hit anywhere on the planet in minutes\nBut those missiles just going to straight line\nFrom launched to target this vehicle would not only be able to come from space but people to turn and bank and and uh\nFly almost like a real airplane\nAnd that's the real appeal of hyper sonics especially for China and Russia they're afraid the u._s. can shoot down their ballistic missiles with missile defense hyper sonic weapon can swerve or take a roundabout route to the target will still going incredibly fast it's essentially unstoppable [noise]\nBack in August China tested a hundred percent of prototype that flew for more than five minutes it reached beads about four thousand miles per hour according to state media Russia to has been testing and the missile defense roundtable last month the Pentagon's head of research and development Mike Griffin said he was worried the u._s. was losing its edge\nWe did the groundbreaking research they've chosen to weaponize it we need to respond\nAnd the Pentagon is stepping up to ... percent of extra search now there are still some big technical challenges to building these weapons pushing through the air it five or six times the speed of sound generates a lot of friction and friction means heat it hyper sonic speed steel turns soft like butter\nIn fact the air force tried to build high percentage airplanes into the Nineteen sixties but they kept melting\nProtection moving towards like hyper so many years suddenly forces eventful too\nThat's an archival air force video showing how one experimental aircraft the ex Fifteen almost burned up during its flight but James acting with the Carnegie Endowment for international peace says advanced materials in super computers are helping hyper sonics\nWe are seeing Russia or the United states and China will conduct I just want to test many of those tests suddenly all of them being successful acting also says\nThat ... percent of weapons pose a real threat to the U.S military but he says the solution isn't necessarily to develop our own hyper sonic weapons in response\nI don't think we should develop type ... just because somebody else is doing that ... I think we should develop hype is on it if it's so specific millet treat problems or feels specific military needs\nFor now the U.S is stepping up testing and back when title nine they're ready\nTo

demanded what they call the people's vote on Brexit here's a London Mayor Sadiq Khan but at the Associated Press\nOr say and even some of the problems ... years ago the of what what should realize that nobody was talking about by Russia do nobody was talking about ... whatsoever\nThe prime minister was trying to complete breakfast is in some political danger members of Theresa May's own conservative party are said to be plotting against are forcing some of the opposition Labour Party to defend her ears cure ... who's the shadow bricks administer\nSome of the corps of comments about climate to this weekend attributed to conserve them ... as a nothing short of discourse [noise]\nNPR's London correspondent Frank Langfitt is on the line Frank I'm ordering hey good morning Steve a is Britain any closer to actually completing this deal to leave you\nKnow it's interesting Steve I'm prime minister may was in the house of commons yesterday she says Ninety five percent of the deal is done but that rainy five percent is huge so we talk about how to avoid a border on the island of Ireland\nNow you know by leaving the you use the u._k. creates a need for a border between Ireland matches up you know part of the EU and Northern Ireland which is part of the u._k. ah but they can't seem to work out an agreement on this and that's what's been holy everything else\nSo with all of this pressure on trees are made from within her own party for a sexually not having a hard enough breakfast or not getting a deal done or just because conservatives unified country survive\n[noise] um it was really tough language as you are hearing from your storm or there was a talk of yesterday were against the last few days where even a member of a party said there's a meeting on Wednesday and she should bring her own news um it's it's very hard language and really actually kind of bothered people here in the United kingdom um\nBut the thing is what's been remarkable about a prime minister may is she's been out this now for two years and she's still standing a lot of people didn't think she'd be here\nUm and even opponents I think have some grudging respect for her um her ability to sort of continue to dig punches a but continue to work on this and the other thing is there's nobody obvious to replace her\nAnd the the Tory party for part of the conservatives are very concerned about a nother election where they could lose the labor\nWhile I'm trying to figure this out Frank I'm just going across the political spectrum ... sort of in the middle trying to get a deal done there are people on her right who want it to be a harder deal that Britain that has more independence from you but then there are these people on the left to hundreds of thousands that we mentioned without an protested fray people's vote on Brexit what exactly would that be\nWell what they were talking about there is here's with here that they basically said they say you know two thousand sixteen when this vote was a first put to the people they feel they were sold a bill of goods or the Brexit fears that everything's gonna be great we're going to cut a great deal with the you were going to get a lot of money back\nTo working to pay for healthcare none of that to happen and Brexit negotiations are what British call a shambles and pretty much everybody agrees on that\nUm and so that's what they want but it's not likely that Theresa May is going to go for this because it's the last thing she wants to shift so much trouble politically in her party and beyond she certainly doesn't want to take this back to the people there's there's no going back as what you know I I really it's very unlikely at this point Steve\nFrank thanks so much really appreciate it happy to do That's NPR's Frank Langfitt speaking with us from London\nRight now let's get some perspective on that highly publicized caravan heading for the United states there are dramatic picture showing about seven thousand people on the road out of violent Honduras now these are real families with real stories as we've reported on NPR\nBut he's not as big an event is news stories might suggest a few thousand of those people may reach the U.S and if they're like people in past caravans they'll probably request legal entry but remember the U.S except for more than one million legal permanent residents every year\nThe reason you're hearing about the caravan at all because of this symbolic used being made of these very real human beings\nMigration activists hope to call attention to Central Americans suffering President Trump has used the caravan to stoke fear before an election he falsely spoke yesterday of plots to quote overwhelmed the states he kept the caravan in the news by threatening to cut off aid to Central American countries\nNow the aid that he threatened was actually designed to address the problem of migration but he was complaining about NPR's Michele Kelemen reports\nPresident Trump is sounding increasingly frustrated with how Central American countries are handling migrations\nWaterfall on south Georgia made a lot of money every year we have a far as it is not safe for us nothing\nHe's now warning those countries that he will start cutting off or substantially reducing foreign aid and some lawmakers are pushing back\nIt's like cutting off you know write your faith rather than through here\nThat's Eliot Engel the ranking Democrat on the house committee on foreign affairs he says the president may be frustrated and angry about the caravan of migrants coming from those three countries\nMoving through Mexico but cutting aid won't help\nMake the situation we're we we should be working with these countries to try to ah help alleviate some of the problems that are driving people to come to the United states is diverse by\nUSAID and the region is meant to do just that addressing the root causes of migration by improving security and rule of law last year according to the U.S global leadership coalition the U.S provided about eight hundred thirty eight million dollars in foreign assistance to Central America and Mexico\nAnd it is making a difference on the ground according to ...

Inskeep\nAnd I knew well king good morning national security adviser John Bolton is in Moscow today he's expected to give a press briefing later detail how the U.S will pull out of a Cold War era and nuclear arms treaty\nThe Nineteen eighty seven I N F treaty prevented Russia and the U.S from having certain intermediate range missiles but President Trump says Russia is in violation of the agreement and it's worth noting the Obama administration said the same and two thousand fourteen\nAnd then yesterday President Trump said that the U.S in fact plans to expand its nuclear arsenal until other nations in his words\nCome to their senses John ... is with me now he's the director of the nuclear Crisis Group and a former special assistant to President Obama can morning sir good morning I said we are hearing the term arms race thrown around is this language and are these developments warring team\nThey are um not only or the United states and Russia um vastly increasing their nuclear capabilities their missiles and numbers of nuclear weapons\nBut we're no longer engaging with each other we're sort of operating in the blind and the chances that we could miss calculate misunderstand or stumble into a crisis where nuclear weapons could be used as growing\nAll right so so time to be very careful you served on the national Security Council under President Obama and and you were there when he accused Russia of violating this treaty the U.S did not withdraw then why not\n[noise] so we're very concerned that Russia has developed a small number of missiles which are banned by the treaty and deployed them\nBut they haven't produced them in numbers that really threatened to change the military situation in Europe we still have the upper hand through NATO Russia's building these the counter our conventional superiority or goal had been under the Obama administration to get Russia back into the treaty because it serves our interests\nI think the big difference between President Trump for President Obama as President Trump really doesn't have a strategy for bringing Russia back in a is really happy just to pull out\nA and John Bolton who was killed a number of arms control agreements over multiple stunts and the government is very happy to go along to pursue that strategy but there is NO PLAN for how you improve American security once we do that\nWhat do you think John Bolton is going to say today\n[noise] I mean John Boehner is going to say you can't cheat on American get away with it I'm the same thing he told the north Koreans back in two thousand two um he's going to say this treaty no longer serves American interests because you cheated on it um and we're going to go or merry way and build whatever missiles we want you guys will just have to play catch up\nUm and I think as we've seen a lot of reporting is more than capable not only playing catch up a building systems which undermine our security and we're going to be adding fuel to this arms race that were already in\nThere is another nuclear arms reduction treaty that I Know a lot of people have an eye on the new start treaty which is due to expire in two thousand and Twenty one and yesterday John Bolton said the U.S has not finalized its position on extending new start briefly remind us what it is and what happens if it expires\nSo new start is the last a strategic arms control agreement in place between the United states and Russia it puts American inspectors on the ground in Russia in Russian inspectors on the ground in the United states\nAnd it limits both countries to know more than Fifteen hundred and fifty nuclear weapons I'm from the ministry has been in office two years how they haven't figured out that this was in our interest is beyond me\nBut if it goes away we will be looking at a Russian program that grows or even more than it has a and we will be likely having to increase our own spending a at our own nuclear deployments\nJohn ... of the nuclear Crisis

education so they want to pay teachers more\nThey want to invest in neighborhood schools and overall they want to give more funding to public education\nAnd one of the features you surveys that you do green data based on the race of the responded and the gender what what did you find in Missouri a difference depending on who was answering\nIn this case it doesn't seem to matter very much overwhelming a young people I don't want to say independent of race and ethnicity but with their races and ethnicities support this idea of increasing funding for education on any number of dimensions\nSo uh this is a pretty consistent finding that seems to kind of extent across race and ethnicity\nAnd how would you respond and use the money if there were more money for education well they do a number of\nDifferent things right there is a clear sense and the findings that young people believe that the most effective way to impact public education is through really those kinds of

trading in Asian markets overnight as NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports\nHas your position on this coalition changed\nIt has changed and certainly changed to before the ... the murder it did Oh yes I think initially the Saudis are were intent on pushing back though who these who were trying to take over the country trying to depose a the legitimate government in Yemen a and we're getting around and help to do it\nBut we've seen over the course of time that the Saudis have become increasingly I'm\nA willing to allow a civilian casualties uh to bomb a more or less indiscriminately uh we shouldn't be providing military assistance that enables them to do that\nSo I think a ... certainly have our support for Saudi and the war in Yemen is overdue but I think what the ... the murder does also is\nIt tells us we need a broader re examination of our relationship with Saudi Arabia not just a piece of Yemen but is this really um the country we want to paint our entire Middle East policy on we want to make decisions about ah our support to our relationship was after a on the basis of so\nThis I I think ought to cause us to do a deep dive examination of\nUs how to conduct a relationship with Saudi Arabia across the board and inappropriately respond\nWell maybe as human rights abuses are not anything new in in the U.S has remained close ally for years were you concerned when crown prince

bring about changes and reforms in Saudi Arabia and certainly at times he has made nods towards a reform ah and that looked encouraging a Saudi Arabia has been an important ally\nBut that doesn't mean that we accept everything they do and critically and where are their prosecution of the war in Yemen is resulting in more and more civilian ... civilian casualties we can and must a push back a and certainly not allow our military assistance to to be used to uh hurt innocent people\nAre so they're important ally but they're not one that we want to rely on exclusively for our foreign policy in the region\nAnd very briefly there's been partisan disagreement on your committee are you in a position to push any action forward on Saudi Arabia\nI we certainly can push for deep examination of

another side efforts by the United states China and Russia to develop a new kind of missile a weapon that can fly faster and farther than almost anything in existence NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has the latest\nThese weapons are called hyper sonic weapons and they are fast really fast by definition they travel at least five times the speed of sound thousands of miles per hour\nThe air force is currently developing hyper sonic weapons including at a place called wind tunnel number nine just outside of Washington DC wanting\nThe morning I showed up dam Mariner who's in charge that the test they were running that day were classified I wasn't going to get inside no not at this point but I was allowed in the lobby of the wind tunnel building\nTheir marriage showed me unclassified version of the things they work\nOn so if you look on this table here we have several of the shapes that we've tested in the window among the models as a sleek silver wet with a spine down to center it was called a wave rider and so it's a fancy way to say it rides on its own shock wave\nHere's how the wave rider works the wedge shaped warhead would be put on top of a rocket and fired at enormous speeds to the very edge of space then it would detach from the rocketing lied to its target\nNow big countries like the U.S China and Russia already have weapons that can do something like this they're called intercontinental ballistic missiles and they can hit anywhere on the planet in minutes\nBut those missiles just going to straight live\nFrom launched to target this vehicle would not only be able to come from space but people deterrent and bank and and uh\nFly almost like a real airplane\nThat's the real appeal of hyper sonics especially for China\nRussia they're afraid the u._s. can shoot down their ballistic missiles with missile defense hyper sonic weapon can swerve or take a roundabout route to the target will still going incredibly fast it's essentially unstoppable [noise]\nBack in August China tested a hundred percent of prototype that flew for more than five minutes it reached beads above four thousand miles per hour according to state media Russia to has been testing and the missile defense roundtable last month the Pentagon's head of research and development Mike Griffin said he was worried the u._s. was losing its edge\nWe did the groundbreaking research they've chosen to weaponize it we need to respond\nAnd the Pentagon is stepping up its ... research now their students some big technical challenges to building these weapons pushing through the air it five or six times the speed of sound generates a lot of friction and friction means heat it hyper sonic speed steel turns soft like butter\nIn fact the air force tried to build high percentage

News I'm Noel King and I'm Steve Inskeep [noise]\nHundreds\nOf thousands of protesters in London last week demanded what they call the people's vote on Brexit here's a London Mayor Sadiq Khan but at the Associated Press\nOr say some of the problems ... years ago the city life and nobody was talking about by Russia Joe nobody was talking about ... whatsoever\nThe prime minister was trying to complete breakfast is in some political danger members of Theresa May's own conservative party are said to be plotting against are forcing some of the opposition Labour Party to defend her ears pierced armor who's the shadow breakfast administer\nSome of the court some comments about Mr this weekend attributed to conserve as ... as a nothing short of disgraceful [noise]\nNPR's London correspondent Frank Langfitt is on the line Frank morning hey good morning Steve a is Britain any closer to actually completing this deal to leave your\nMost interesting Steve I'm prime minister may was in the house of commons yesterday she says Ninety five percent of the deal is done but that remaining five percent is huge so we've talked about how to avoid a border on the island of Ireland\nNow you know by leaving the you use the u._k. creates a need for a border between Ireland matches up you know part of the EU and Northern Ireland which is part of the u._k. but they can't seem to work out an agreement on this and that's what's been holding everything else\nSo with all of this pressure on trees are made from within her own party for essentially not having a hard enough breakfast or not getting a deal done or just because conservatives in fight country survive\n[noise] um it was really tough language as you were hearing from cure storm or there was a talk of yesterday were against the last few days where even a member of her party said there's a meeting on Wednesday and she should bring her own news um it's it's very hard language and really actually kind of bothered people here in the United kingdom\nUm but the thing is what's been remarkable about a prime minister may is she's been out this now for two years and she's still standing a lot of people didn't think she'd be here\nUm and even opponents I think have some grudging respect for her um her ability to sort of continue to dig punches a but continue to work on this and the other thing is there's nobody obvious to replace her\nAnd the the Tory party for part of the conservatives are very concerned about a and other election where they could lose the labor\nWhile I'm trying to figure this out Frank I'm just going across the political spectrum ... sort of in the middle trying to get a deal done there are people on her right who want it to be a harder deal that Britain more independence from that you but then there are these people on the left the hundreds of thousands that we mentioned do without 'em protested fray people's vote on Brexit what exactly would that be\nWell what they're talking about there is here with here that they basically says they say you know two thousand sixteen when this post was a first put to the people they feel they were sold a bill of goods or the Brexit years that ah everything's going to be great we're going to cut a great deal with the you were going to get a lot of money back\nWorking to pay for healthcare none of that to happen and Brexit negotiations are what British call a shambles in pretty much everybody agrees on that\nUm and so that's what they want but it's not likely that Theresa May is going to go for this because it's the last thing she wants to shift so much trouble politically in her party and beyond she certainly doesn't want to take this back to the people there's there's no going back as what you know I I really it's very unlikely at this point Steve\nFrank thanks so much really appreciate it happy to do That's NPR's Frank Langfitt speaking with us from London\n[noise] All right now let's get some perspective on that highly publicized caravan heading for the United states there are dramatic picture showing about seven thousand people on the road out of violent Honduras and these are real families with real stories as we've reported on NPR\nBut he's not as big an event is news stories might suggest a few thousand of those people may reach the U.S and if they're like people in past caravans they'll probably request legal entry\nBut remember the U.S except for more than one million legal permanent residents every year\nThe reason you're hearing about the caravan at all because of this symbolic used being made of these very real human beings\nMigration activists hope to call attention to Central Americans suffering President Trump has used the caravan to stoke fear before an election he falsely spoke yesterday of plots to quote overwhelmed the United states he kept a caravan in the news by threatening to cut off aid to Central American countries\nNow the aid that he threatened was actually designed to address the problem of migration but he was complaining about NPR's Michele Kelemen reports\nPresident Trump is sounding increasingly frustrated with how Central American countries are handling migration\nWater bottle of Honduras El Salvador's invested a lot of money every year we give a far nothing for us nothing he's\nNow warning those countries that he will start cutting off or substantially reducing foreign aid and some lawmakers are pushing back\nBy cutting off you know write your faith residents here\nThat's Eliot Engel the ranking Democrat on the house committee on foreign affairs he says the president may be frustrated and angry about the caravan of migrants coming from those three countries and moving through Mexico but cutting aid will help\nMake the situation we're we we should be working with these countries to try to help alleviate some of the problems are driving people to come to the United states and never by\nUSAID and the region is meant to do just that addressing the root causes of migration by improving security and rule of law last year according to the U.S global leadership coalition the U.S provided amount eight hundred thirty eight million dollars in foreign assistance to Central America and Mexico\nAnd it is making a difference on the ground according to rich Jones who spoke to us from El Salvador where he works for Catholic Relief services\nThey treat the economic and sorry got completely interconnected sports very much in the interests of the United states you see that devaluing happened here that violence here because it's pushing people in Georgian irregular migration\nThe Trump Administration is reviewing all USAID making clear to countries that receive assistance that they should support U.S interests congressmen angle points out that Congress holds the purse strings and he and his colleagues won't sit quietly bind if the administration tries to go around the will of Congress\nWe keep hearing from the administration that everybody has to obey the law out about the president do bang empowerment Control Act which prohibits the president from withdrawing on pounding money appropriated by
