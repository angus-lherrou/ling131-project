Thanks Greg You're welcome\n[noise] [noise]\nRight when the UN ambassador Nikki Haley announced on Tuesday that she was leaving her post the news really came as a surprise\nYeah but the oval office announcement with President Trump had all the indications of a well planned event was cordial dignified Nikki Haley laying out the reasons for her departure\nI we've got an hour for six years and we've dealt with a hurricane a thousand year fly to start shooting at school she didn't give us a lot and then they come in and years of Russia and Iran and North Korea it's been eight years in tax time and I'm a believer in term limit\nAnd unlike a number of other recent White House personnel changes Haley seems to be partying on good terms with the president\nShe's done a fantastic job and we've done a fantastic job together we've solved a lot of problems in the process of solving a lot of problems\nI Want to bring in NPR White House correspondent Mara Liasson Hi there Mara Hi David so two years is actually a pretty long time for this administration right I mean this has been a White House full of turmoil hum what what might the impact of this departure be\nAt the well the impact of this departure on the administration's foreign policy I think will be minimal the UN ambassador doesn't make foreign policy and I think that the secretary of state Mike Pompeo and the new national security adviser John Bolton already were strong voices on foreign policy and I think now they just get even more so\nSo why the timing of this I mean should we believe Hayley in saying that it's just been a really intense eight years and she thinks that she should be term limited and might want to take a break\nNo I'm sure she\nLooked she not only as you pointed out was one of the very few administration officials who left on her own terms she was not fired by tweet\nBut also the timing of this was impeccable Nikki Haley is probably the most adept politician and the Trump cabinet\nShe left on her own terms she wrote the letter to President Trump saying she wanted to leave about a week ago that was right in the middle of winter Trump was attacking Christine Blasey Ford it wouldn't have looked good if she'd resigned right then but\nShe wanted to step down now even though she's staying till the end of the year she wanted to announce her departure now rather than after the midterms because if the president and his party gets lacked\nAnd a lot of people start bailing out it doesn't wind up she doesn't want to look like\nThese are wrapped deserving the sinking ship and she's been really successful unlike any other Trump's cabinet official at creating her own political persona her own Brandt independent\nLoyalists but not a sick event and you know she announced in an op ed piece recently two things one that she wasn't anonymous the secret resistor and number two that she did disagree with Trump from time to time but\nOften did it privately sometimes she did it publicly she was tougher on Russia than he was she wants said that the women who were accusing Trump of sexual misconduct deserved a hearing she was able to do all that and still maintain good relations with the president any idea who's going to replace her\nWell a lot of names are being floated the president said Dina Powell former a top\nTrump White House Foreign policy aide current Goldman Sachs executive is on the list he talked about Ivanka his daughter ... who who is he said was highly competent but would open himself up to charges of nepotism bunkers we did later that she would not be taking the job so there are a lot of people on the list\nWill be watching NPR White House correspondent Mara Liasson talking about how his departure of the un thanks so much Mara thank you [noise]\nBy more details are emerging now about the disappearance of a Saudi journalist democracy in Turkey\nRight to ... is a Washington Post contributor who was laughing entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey eight days ago the post says that it has been told by persons with knowledge of the Turkish investigation into his disappearance\nThat a team of Fifteen Saudi men flew into assemble early on October second hours before console games I've seen as he entered the costs like the team checked into to nearby hotels and then were taken to the consulate by car\nAnd the post is also reporting the Fifteen men departed is tumbled later that very same day on flights to both Cairo and Dubai NPR's Peter Kenyon has been following all of his in his stumble Hi Peter I did so what is standing out to you at this point is more information is coming in\nWell this focus on the fifteenth Saudis who arrived a Turkish paper today are published both their names and their photos all Fifteen of them\nAre these are the mentally say arrived in Istanbul last Tuesday the day ... disappeared or there are a media reports that Turkish intelligence says now identified as some of those men as military officers of special forces member and a forensic expert among them\nA Turkish TVs aired footage of a black van that was seen leaving the Saudi consulate\nOr sometime after the show the entered a\nAirport security reportedly X rayed the luggage of at least some of these Saudi men as they prepare to leave this stumble that same night are they also X rayed the men themselves kind of standard procedure and reportedly at the request of Turkish intelligence they also surged one of the planes\nAre they apparently found nothing suspicious allowed it to take off but clearly the focus is on these men and what they were doing here that day\nWas there were two planes go right to that they've only search one of the planes that the ...\nThat's right that is a gap at the moment in the story that I'm getting a no explanations as to why one plane was searched and not the other uh there are a number of anonymous tips going out providing other uh sometimes grisly details\nAnd supported this conclusion that preliminary conclusion that the show he was killed a one official tells the New York times at one of the Saudis who arrived last Tuesday was an autopsy expert and that a bone so it was used on the body after the murder\nSo where does the investigation go from here I mean Saudi Arabia is denying anything terrible happened here what ... what a Turkish investigators do now\nWell there's two leading theories obviously one that he was spirited out of the country or that he was killed and his body disposed of police seem to be leaning toward the ladder theory at the moment\nAs you say the Saudis deny any involvement or they want to know work a show give themselves they say they can't provide any evidence to back up their claim that he left the consulate with an hour of arriving which is what they claim there's no CCTV footage they say Turkish police are going through their own camera footage from the streets outside the consulate\nThey haven't seen any images of the show the leaving TV is airing pictures of him entering though the first we've seen those uh and they will be searching the consulate building with Saudi permission of that could happen as early as today\nAnd Peter remind us of the diplomatic context here I mean Saudi Arabia turkey ... what is that relationship like and how badly this damage it\nWell it wasn't great before a turkey has been siding with Qatar in an ongoing dispute with the Saudis are so far president aired ones being cautious he says we need answers but the main secular opposition party is already calling for an immediate review of Turkey's relations with Saudi Arabia\nSo I think however this plays out it will be to some degree a worsening of ties\nAnd then one of the big questions is out of us relations and how that could be impacted as well\nYeah very unclear at the moment are lots of headlines here quoting Trump saying he doesn't know anything about the show he case so some level of frustration but no sign so far the Washington's exerting pressure in Riyadh\nAll right NPR's Peter Kenyon in Istanbul Peter thanks Thanks David [noise]\nThis is NPR News\nI'm On the world a first time candidate for

farmers have had a tough go of that recently taking a financial hit for the Trump administration's trade dispute\nBut last night at a rally in Council Bluffs Iowa President Trump made an announcement he hopes will make a lot of those farmers very happy\n... wrote to acting ethanol All right that's right [noise]\n[noise] way our unleashing\nThe power of the Fifteen to fuel\nCountry all year long\nPresident Trump referring there to his promise to lift certain restrictions on the sale of ethanol in gasoline to do that in ... in order to boost sales that's the point of this whole thing and put more money in the pockets of corn farmers\nClay Masters of Iowa Public radio without ... joins us now from Council Bluffs Iowa I play good morning so just lay out for us what President Trump is ordering the EPA to do by lifting regulations on that though\nSo last night the president laid out his intent to extend the sailor kind of gasoline called E. Fifteen year round right now selling it in the summer months is\nProhibited you Fifteen is basically gasoline with Fifteen Percent of it being primarily from corn based\nEthanol doing this could prop up corn prices that's been down thanks to tariffs by other countries imposed in retaliation for the Trump administration's trade war now there is no time table yet from the White House as to how fast\nThis proposed rule change will go into effect but there are hopes that haven't completed before next summer when you know many drivers are getting the road or certainly there were Iowa Republican politicians at this rally last night who faced tough races next month they were applauding the decision they were all the Democrats in the state who were pleased with this announcement\nAnd so it is it really going to make a difference for Iowa farmers then\n[noise] yeah I think it will but again a lot of it does really depend on the timeline for when it gets into effect when it goes into effect that is\nUm ethanol is often hailed as being environmentally friendly because it reduces the use of fossil fuels although many environmentalists are posted this particular move by the president can you explain their position here\nWhere we use an example of yesterday the national Wildlife Federation said the move is not legally allowed under the clean Air Act they said no relief but the change would produce more pollutants that lead to smog on gasoline alone\nA there are reports that a number of outside environmentalist groups have said that they will do over any change through the fuel policy so there's that with environmental concerns from environmentalists but I should also add that there is a bipartisan opposition to this move also from US Senators and primarily oil producing states\nI mean you mentioned the political backdrop of all this mid term elections are coming out I mean clearly the president has a political calculus in in this can you explain what the political consequences might be here\nRight and I mentioned earlier the idea that the president's trade war has been affecting Iowa agriculture in manufacturing in the states so talking about this in Iowa along with\nThis new NAFTA deal or as it's called us in the a as well as other trade deals it's kind of a way for the president to garner some support for a couple of these races that look pretty close here in Iowa for the mid term that includes\nA Iowa's governor Kim Reynolds she faces Democrat Fred how old\nShe was at the event and the president she worked changing plenty of complements with each other off of the Republican congressman who represents this district David Young with also at the rally he faces a tough race as well in the summer youngest said Trump's tariffs were making him nervous and he seemed to be walking the line you know when it came to supporting the president but now there's really\nNo question last night the president said of a vote for David\nA vote for me what's the political argument against is myth though you said that there are some politicians who oppose it\nWell certainly the politicians that are opposing it are from oil producing states and so you know they have oil in mind and so a lot of those senators don't want corn ethanol being of the future in energy they're more interested in in oil\nClay Masters of Iowa Public radio thanks so much we appreciate it yeah thank you\nOnly one Democrat voted to confirm Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh here with Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia mentioned faces a political

defended him in the past\nI have been a person who has been the person to say to someone\nThat we need to recognize that West Virginia Democrats are more conservative that we're a state with an aging population and that you know Joe Manchin is better than his opponent\nBut after Kavanaugh's confirmation Arlen so she won't vote for mentioned in November and when we come came to a similar decision she's a public school teacher even the west Virginia Public school teachers went on strike earlier this year and the teachers union support mansion commercials\nYou'll leave her ballot blank\nI

from NPR News I'm David Greene and I'm Rachel Martin\nIn the Nineteen thirties a New York prosecutor brought down lucky the shelling out the notorious head of the New York mafia it made the prosecutor Thomas Dewey a household name and set him up for a career in politics less remembered as the staff lawyer who made it possible an African American woman named Eunice Carter\nAnd her story is the subject of a new book that is called invisible the forgotten story of the black woman lawyer who took down America's most powerful mobster it's by her grandson the law professor and prolific writer Stephen Carter who told Steve Inskeep that he knew his grandmother growing up it was never told about her accomplishments\nShe did all these things she was a prosecutor for years she was a big power and Republican politics for a long time and yes I grew up without knowing any of that but knowing it now I think the story is quite a remarkable and\nI Want to underline that named Thomas do if people know it because of the famous false headlined Dewey defeats Truman he was a presidential candidate who was supposed to win and Nineteen forty eight and last but before that was a noted prosecutor in New York City what was the task was set to in the Nineteen thirties\nSo Ninety five New York experienced what the press called the runaway grand jury when a local grand jury refused to work anymore the corrupt the district attorney's office will just make no effort to break up organized crime\nSo the governor of New York for the New York has been attorney to choose a special prosecutor ended up being Thomas Dewey and his job was to clean up organized crime in New York\nBy hiring people who have never been prosecutors would never been involved with the prosecutor's office which is seen as entirely corrupt so we hired ... what he called the twenty against the underworld Nineteen white men plus one black woman Eunice Carter\nNo matter how many pages of your book I read it still seems somehow a little surprising to be in a time of such prejudice that first that your grandmother became a lawyer that you became a successful lawyer and then that she got hired by this white prosecutor how'd that happen\nWe don't know exactly why hired her but higher her he did the downside was that after do we hired her he set about again trying to investigate what was the ... but do we want it to investigated for murder\nOr some ... what he considered a serious crime but at the same time the only woman and only black person on his staff my grandmother Eunice or do we assigned to look into prostitution even though he made clear that he had no intention\nOf prosecuting Louisiana for prostitution because do he said he was not going to be a narrow crusader\nWhile and Eunice Carter faces the task along with these other lawyers have tried to find some way to work her way up to the top man to lucky Louisiana where did she began\nSo after Eunice was hired she was banished in a sense to the for the cubicle in this special office do we had a set up and when do we asked citizens of New York to come in and talked about organized crime in their neighborhoods\nTurned out that most of the letters and complaints were about prostitution\nAll these things are coming in and they had to be dumped on somebody's desk and they're all dumped on union says there's a sense in which was sidelined during the investigation\nBut she didn't want to hold her back in fact from the beginning she went over to the attacks you actually put together the first evidence anyone who's ever had the mob was involved in prostitution because there was an article of faith among the police\nThat prostitution was run by small time operators and certainly the mafia was not involved units set herself the task of proven otherwise and against considerable opposition including her own office she succeeded in improving it\nI guess the method here as you start at the bottom work\nWay up something like that once you begin to gather the evidence she persuaded Dewey to a range of police raids which ... was in charge of\nOn eighty a bravo one night they brought in the prostitutes the women who worked in these ... was there was a reason they arrested only the women because the women\nWere accustomed being bailed out by these men called the Sixers but the rest of the fixtures troops there was no one to bail them out videos to keep the women's they would turn against the fixers then to pressure the fixers so they would turn against their bosses who turned against their bosses of hope to only turn against a Louisiana enter every one surprise\nUnisys idea worked wow and how did the trial turn out the trial was actually\nA lot of fun for the press precisely because the main witness was against Louisiana\nWere prostitutes and one of them for example the one the press had the most fun with was a woman known as Cokie flow brown reaches notice Cokie flow was because of her cocaine\nHabit or when she arrived on the witness stand to testify that she'd over heard Louisiana several times discussing that the prostitution business with his aides\n[noise] she was so jittery apparently having withdrawal not having had a fix in several days that the judge three times what ... interrupt her testimony in order to have a sip of brandy ... to calm her nerves\nAnd finally the defense counsel that as Lucy on his lawyer demanded that she be tested for drugs to see whether she was high during her testimony so kooky flow was taken to another room with a couple of doctors and Eunice Eunice was the only woman on the prosecution team and Louisiana team had no women so she was there\nThe doctors examine term return to pronounce that she was a drug free and the jury obviously believe your testimony was the jury voted very quickly to convict [noise] so how does learning\nThis story changed your understanding of New York city and then I team thirties or America that I Do thirties [noise]\nOne to take away from it is how similar in a sense America then was to American now my grandmother was on the commission was appointed by the mayor to look into the causes of the New York city riots of ... going in Harlem\nAnd the commission's report if you read it today jumping to be written today it talks about mistreatment of black men by police it talks about suspicion of black people who go into stores and talks about employment discrimination all the sorts of things that people talk about today but at the same time I think part of our forgotten history\nIs that there were people who are against all odds in that era and even earlier made\nReally remarkable lives for themselves but there were people who built a society are with him the segregated world in which they

gives the Washington Post contributor was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last week the Washington Post says it has been told by people with knowledge of the Turkish investigation into this disappearance that team\nOf Fifteen Saudi men flew into you stumble on October second hours before the show was last seen entering the consulate\nThe post is also reporting those Fifteen meant departed stumbled later that very same day on flights to Cairo and to do by NPR's Peter Kenyon is following all of this\nIn is stumble and Peter what is standing out\nTo you at this point of view learned more facts here\n[noise] uh well I'd say the main news of the day is this publication in a in a Turkish pro government paper of both the names and photos of the Fifteen Saudi men who police they arrived in Istanbul last Tuesday as the day of the show these disappearance\nOr the paper a described them in as an assassination squad and other media are reporting that Turkey's intelligence services identified several of the men some they say are military officers including the special forces member a there's a reported Saudi intelligence officer in there and also a senior forensics expert\nA Turkish TV meanwhile are airing footage\nOf ... entering the constantly on October second and of a black man leaving the consulate about two hours later and heading to the consul general's residence or there is a report as well that airport security X rayed the luggage of some of the Saudi men as they prepare to leave this symbol that same night\nX. rayed them in themselves and reportedly at the request of the intelligence service\nSearch one of the planes one of the two planes they apparently found nothing suspicious allowed to take off\nBut the focus seems to be on these Fifteen men and what they were doing here\nWhy search one of the two points and that both the planes well that's a all\nWe know based on the information we have so far this is going to need some further explanation it's it's not clear why that would be the case\nIt what officials are anonymously talking about are further grisly details or one tells the New York times that one of the Saudis was autopsy expert in the bone so it was used on the buddy after the murder\n... a bone saw 'em talk of an assassin assassination squad it sounds like\nTurkish authorities are are moving towards the theory that that this is indeed was a targeted murder\nYes it certainly seems that the theory they're leaning towards I don't think you can rule out the other possibility that cause Yogi was spirited out of the country or I don't think either one has been completely ruled out yet\nAt the Saudis of course deny any involvement with the show these disappearance they claim he left the consulate within an hour of arriving but they say they don't have any video evidence to back that up\nTurkish police are going through their own camera footage this is from the streets outside the consulate uh they say so far they've seen footage of him going in but no footage of him coming out\nUh they've also been invited to search the consulate building with Saudi permission that we're told could happen as early as today uh there's no word yet I must say an searching the consul general's residence where the black then went eight days ago\nPeter I mean Saudi Arabian turkey weren't the best of friends right but what what could I mean if if indeed this journalists were killed on Turkish soil in the Saudi Government something to do with what could this due to the relationship between the two countries\nIt would be a serious blow to relations that were already somewhat afraid I mean there's been ongoing tensions in the Persian Gulf between Saudi Arabia and Qatar and turkey quite prominently took cut their side so that hasn't helped but this would be on another level completely this is a beyond the pale of anything\nWould have happened and again as you say if it's demonstrated that this happened and the Saudis do deny it completely but it would be a big blow yeah\nAnd the u._s. always under pressure to but by some to do more to put more pressure on Saudi Arabia which could grow here\nYes a turkey is media here are kind of surprised us some headlines are showing a little bit of frustration a big one says quote Trump I don't know anything about the ... case so far there isn't much sign that Washington is exerting pressure in Riyadh Cosby us investigators to join the probe are happening uh we'll see something like that occurs\nNPR's Peter Kenyon thanks bitter thanks\nThe largest oil company in the U.S is encouraging attacks on the dairy products that makes executives at Exxon Mobil and announce that the company will contribute one million dollars of the next two years to support a campaign for a tax on carbon based fuels so I kind of difference could this make on efforts to reduce the effects of climate change Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nExxon Mobil contribution was supporter group called Americans for carbon dividends an offshoot of the climate leadership council its aim is to raise the price of fossil fuels to reduce their use and cut the amount of climate changing carbon released into the atmosphere\nExxonMobil has voiced support for such a plan for years but Greg burn Wilson of the climate leadership council says the firm's financial contribution is a significant step\nIt's the first time in history that a U.S oil and gas super major has put significant financial resources behind a direct price on carbon\nIn other words a direct tax on carbon ... group prefers to call it a fee not attacks more on that later burns inside of Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax\nBut you may wonder why does an oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil support a tax on its main products verbal since says one big reason is that companies want regulatory certainty they want to know what the rules of the game will be and that's an unclear and the current environment\nWe're operating in what amounts to a game of regulatory thing along in which you have one administration developing rules only to have the next roll them back\nAnother important reason Exxon Mobil supports the plan is that why would tax carbon it would also remove most existing regulations on carbon emissions Bert ... says the carbon taxes group is proposing would be much more effective at reducing carbon pollution than that\nCurrent regulations the Americans for carbon dividends plan is based on a proposal from two Republican elder statesmen\nJames Baker this third and George ... both cabinet members in Ronald Reagan's White House one carrot for Republicans is that the revenue from the tax or fee would be fully rebate it to

down again this morning six point nine to to the dollar but look out for seven to the dollar which we haven't seen since the depths of the great recession ten years ago\nThat started a veteran China watcher Shawn Ryan in Shanghai he's managing director of the China market research group\nChina has manipulated its currency called the renminbi to drop about nine percent in value over the last few months and the government is doing that to offset the ten percent of terrorists that Trump has slapped on about two hundred billion US dollars worth of imports and that's why exports\nAre expected to grow about eight point nine percent in September\nFrom China and to the United states\nRight so the ten second economics lesson is when China's currency gets weaker each should make Chinese product easier to buy for Americans yet if we go down to the store this Christmas that may not be what we're going to see here in the U.S\nAmerican companies have to buy for Chinese manufacturers it's very difficult for companies like apple to transfer their production from China to other countries so what's happening is higher prices coming out of China are causing higher prices in Walmart and then the dollar store\nShawn Ryan is managing director of the China market research group thank you\nThank you we should\nNote that Chinese officials deny engineering the currencies decline nor has the U.S

... how did that affect your relationship with the White House and and did that play a role it on her departure you're\nWell it doesn't seem like it she was very politically adapt she was able to disagree with the president on some things publicly she wants even said that the women who were accusing Trump of sexual misconduct deserved a hearing\nBut uh she managed to craft a political persona for herself was which was as a loyal member of the Trump cabinet but not a sick event you know she said she different from him she was tougher\nRhetorically on Russia but that's true of most of the president's national security team compared to him\nUm she did speak out about human rights you just heard senator Coons talk about that but I don't think Nikki Haley was an outlier so much as she was able to use maybe the distance between Washington and New York city a as a way to develop a more independent\nPolitical brand for herself and can I just ask you\nMore I mean you were listening to senator crew in there that this whole question of how Democrats should approach this president I mean they have a base that they want to fire up they don't want to be seen as just being anti Trump and

MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm David Greene in Culver City California and I'm Rachel Martin in Washington DC American farmers have had a tough go of that recently taking a financial hit for the Trump administration's trade dispute\nBut last night at a rally in Council Bluffs Iowa President Trump made an announcement he hopes will make a lot of those farmers very happy\nMinistry is acting F. and all All right that's right [noise] way our unleashing the power of the Fifteen do you know\nCountry all year long\nPresident Trump is referring to his promise to lift certain restrictions on the sale of ethanol in gasoline in order to boost sales and put more money in the pockets of corn farmers\nClay Masters of Iowa Public radio was at the rally and he joins us now from Council Bluffs Iowa ... good morning so just lay out for us what President Trump is ordering the EPA to do by lifting regulations on that though\nSo last night the president laid out his intent to extend the sale of all kinds of gasoline called eve Fifteen year round right now selling it in the summer months is prohibited\nYou Fifteen is basically gasoline with Fifteen Percent of it being primarily from corn based ethanol are doing this could crop of corn prices that have been down thanks to tariffs by other countries imposed in retaliation for the Trump administration's trade war now there is no time table yet from the White House as to how fast this proposed rule change will go into effect but there are\nHopes to have a completed before next summer when you know many drivers are hitting the road\nOr certainly there were Iowa Republican politicians at this rally last night who faced tough races next month they were applauding the decision a there are also Democrats in the state who were pleased with this announcement\nAnd so it is it really going to make a difference for Iowa farmers then\n[noise] yeah I think it will but again a lot of it does really depend on the timeline for when it gets into effect when it goes into effect that is\nEthanol is often hailed as being environmentally friendly because it reduces the fossil fuels although many environmentalists are posted this particular move by the president can explain their position here\nWell we use an example of yesterday the national Wildlife Federation says the move is not legally allowed under the clean Air Act they send the release that the change would produce more pollutants that lead to smog than gasoline alone\nA there are reports that a number of outside environmentalist groups have said that they will sue over any change to the fuel policy so there's that with environmental concerns from environmentalists but I should also add that there is a bipartisan opposition to this move also from US Senators and primarily oil producing states\nI mean you mentioned the political backdrop of all this mid term elections are coming out I mean clearly the president has a political calculus in this can you explain what the political consequences might be here\nRight I'm I mentioned earlier the idea that the president's trade war has been affecting Iowa agriculture in manufacturing in the states so talking about this in Iowa along with this new NAFTA deal or as it's called\nUs MCA as well as other trade deals kind of a way for the president to garner some support for a couple of these races that looked pretty close here in Iowa for the mid term that includes a Iowa's governor Kim Reynolds she faces Democrat Fred Hubble\nShe was at the event and the president she worked changing plenty of complements with each other\nAlso the Republican congressman who represents this district David Young was also at the rally he faces a tough race as well in the summer young had said Trump's tariffs were making him nervous and\nHe seemed to be walking the line you know when it came to supporting the president but now there's really no question last night the president said of a vote for David is a vote for me\nWhat's the political argument against us live though you said that there are some politician to oppose it\nWell certainly the politicians that are opposing it are from oil producing states and so you know they have oil in mind and so a lot of those senators don't want corn ethanol being the future in in energy they're more interested in in oil\nClay Masters of Iowa Public radio thanks so much we appreciate it yeah thank you\nOnly one Democrat voted to confirm Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh it was Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia matching faces a political reality his state is getting more dominated by Republicans and he's in a tight race against the state's Republican attorney general Patrick Morrisey\nBut there are doubts about whether supporting Kavanaugh is really going to help mentioned on election day here's West Virginia public radio they've missed itch\nAs mentioned stood on the Senate floor to cast his vote to confirm Kavanaugh on Saturday protesters yelled

in the past and now I'm really on the fence about what to do turn Ireland is a Charleston city councilwoman she says she's always recognize that mention is new liberal but has defended him in the past\nI have been a person who has been the person to say to someone\nThat we need to recognize that West Virginia Democrats are more conservative that we're a state with an aging population and that you know Joe Manchin is better than his opponent\nBut after Kavanaugh's confirmation Arlen says she won't vote for mansion in November Emily ... came to a similar decision she's a public school teacher even the west Virginia Public school teachers went on strike earlier this year and the teachers union support mansion conversation will leave her ballot blank\nI absolutely will not be voting for senator mansion in November I won't be voting from Patrick Morrisey either I Would never vote for him but um I just we don't have a candidate that is going to fight for us\nAll three women so they hope the next Democratic Senate candidate from West Virginia will be more progressive the mansion he frequently breaks ranks with his more liberal democratic colleagues in the Senate for my computer

Washington Post contributor was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last week the Washington Post\nSays it has been told by people with knowledge of the Turkish investigation into the disappearance that team\nOf fifteenth Saudi men flew into you stumble on October second hours before the show was last seen entering the costs with\nThe post is also reporting those Fifteen meant departed stumble later that very same day on flights to Cairo and to do by NPR's Peter Kenyon is following all of this\nIn is stumble and Peter what is standing out to you at this point is you learn more facts here\nAnd uh well I'd say the main news of the day is this publication in a in a Turkish pro government paper of both the names and photos of the Fifteen Saudi men who police say arrived in Istanbul last Tuesday as the day of the show these disappearance\nUh the paper a described them in as an assassination squad and other media are reporting that Turkey's intelligence services identified several of the men some they say are military officers including a special forces member a there's a reported Saudi intelligence officer in there and also a senior forensics expert\nTurkish TV mean wells are airing footage of ... entering the consulate on October second and of a black man leaving the consulate about two hours later\nA heading to the consul general's residence or there is a report as well that airport security X rayed the luggage of some of the Saudi men as they prepare to leave this stumble that same night\nUh X. rayed them in themselves and reportedly at the request of the intelligence service searched one of the planes one of the two planes they apparently found nothing suspicious allowed it to take off but the focus seems to be on these Fifteen men and what they were doing here\nWhy search one of the two points and that both the planes\nWell that's all we know based on the information we have so far this is going to need some further explanation it's not clear why that would be the case\nWhat officials are anonymously talking about are further grisly details one tells the New York times that one of the Saudis was autopsy expert and the bone so it was used on the buddy after the murder\n... a bone saw talk of an assassination squad it sounds like Turkish authorities are are moving towards the theory that this is indeed was targeted murder\nYes it certainly seems that the theory they're leaning towards I don't think you can rule out the other possibility that cause Yogi was spirited out of the country\nI don't think either one has been completely ruled out yet at the Saudis of course deny any involvement with the show veep disappearance they claim he left to constantly within an hour of arriving but they say they don't have any video evidence to back that up Turkish police are going through their own camera footage this is from the streets outside the consulate\nThey say so far they've seen footage of him going in but no footage of him coming out they've also been invited to search the consulate building with Saudi permission that we're told could happen as early as today there is no word yet I must say an searching the consul general's residence where the black then with eight days ago\nPeter I mean Saudi Arabia and turkey weren't the best of friends right but what could if indeed this journalists were killed on Turkish soil and the Saudi Government something to do with what could this due to the relationship between the two countries\nIt would be a serious blow to relations that were already somewhat afraid I mean there's been ongoing tensions in the Persian Gulf between Saudi Arabia and Qatar and turkey quite prominently took cut our side so that hasn't helped but this would be on another level completely this is\nA beyond the pale of anything that would have happened and again as you say if it's demonstrated that this happened and the Saudis do tonight completely but it would be a big blow yeah\nAnd the u._s. always under pressure to buy something to do more to put more pressure on Saudi Arabia which could grow here\nA turkey is media here are kind of surprised us some headlines are showing a little bit of frustration of big ones is quote Trump I don't know anything about the ... case so\nAre there isn't much sign that Washington is exerting pressure in Riyadh Cosby us investigators to joined the probe are happening now we'll see everything like that occurs NPR's Peter Kenyon thanks bitter thanks\nThe largest oil company in the U.S is encouraging attacks on the dairy products that makes executives at Exxon Mobil have announced that the company will contribute one million dollars of the next two years to support a campaign for a tax on carbon based fuels so I kind of difference could this make on efforts to reduce the effects of climate change Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nExxon Mobil contribution was supportive group called Americans for carbon dividends an offshoot of the climate leadership council its aim is to raise the price of fossil fuels to reduce their use and cut the amount of climate change in carbon released into the atmosphere\nExxon Mobil his voice support for such a plan for years but Greg brutal scent of the climate leadership council says the firm's financial contribution is a significant step\nIt's the first time in history that a U.S oil and gas super major has put significant financial resources behind a direct price on carbon\nIn other words a direct tax on carbon though Burton says group prefers to call it a fee not attacks more on that later\nBurdens and says Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax but you may wonder why does an oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil support a tax on its main products\nVerbal since says one big reason is that companies want regulatory certainty they want to know what the rules of the game will be and that's an unclear and the current environment\nWe're operating in what amounts to a game of regulatory thing along in which you have one administration developing rules only to have the next roll them back\nAnother important reason Exxon Mobil supports the plan is that why would tax carbon it would also remove most existing regulations on carbon emissions Bert Wilson says the carbon taxes group is proposing would be much more effective at reducing carbon pollution than the current regulations\nThe Americans for carbon ... plan is based on a proposal from two Republican elder statesmen\nJames Baker this third and George ... both cabinet members

because there are unintended consequences of this technology you know I I'm thinking of Mark Zuckerberg who I think is a friend of yours and he did not envision his social network as a democracy disruption device but some argue it may have become that at some level\nI mean you think it's high time people developing apps new tech new business\nPause you say there's no time to pause but that they wrap in what am I doing to the world as part of their thinking\nSo portable we're learning and leisure gotten bigger you should transformed the level of investment you're putting in a mitigating risks so for example they now have hundreds of engineers dedicated to how do we make sure the content that's being shared\nIs actually in fact more accurate or how do we make sure that nation states are not hacking us trying to create political dissension within the country and they're putting investment now because they realize that they're part of social infrastructure\nRight now I really enjoyed part of the book in which you give a list of counterintuitive advise it's things like embrace chaos but will tell me about this you should launch a product that embarrasses you\nThe emphasis is on speed on getting a contact your customers and learning from it with the embarrassment as the understanding how fast you need to move and the fact that will make your awkward uncomfortable\nOr is it really seen here that during this initial burst of lightening speed growth you should ignore your customer\nOr it does what you're focused on is the bass of numbers of future customers so as opposed to saying oh we're trying to have a delightful experience Mrs or just for that first person it's growing towards what the large scale eventual customers all day it isn't that you do bad things your customer\nBut if you're like slow or a little response of people will be grumpy with you but they won't necessarily be angry with you\nRead Hoffman is the cofounder of linked in an investor ed

who was public we disagree with a President Trump ... how did that affect your relationship with the White House and and did that play a role it on her departure here\nWell it doesn't seem like it she was very politically adapt she was able to disagree with the president on some things publicly she wants even said that the women who are accusing Trump of sexual misconduct deserved to hearing\nBut uh she managed to craft a political persona for herself was which was as a loyal member of the Trump cabinet but not a second fan you know she said she different from him she was tougher\nRhetorically on Russia but that's true of most of the president's national security team compared to him\nUm she did speak out about human rights you just heard senator Coons talk about that but I don't think Nikki Haley was an outlier so much as she was able to use maybe the distance between Washington and New York city a as a way to develop them more independent\nPolitical brand for herself and can I just ask you\nMore I mean you were listening to senator crew in there that this whole question of how Democrats should approach this president I mean they have a base that they want to fire up they

it's waiting to see what position is gonna be after the elections I mean that's the big question going forward will Democrats have more cloud in the Senate will they take\nMajority will they have more

Martin in Washington D. C. American farmers have had a tough go of it recently taking a financial hit for the Trump administration's trade dispute but last night at a rally in Council Bluffs Iowa President Trump made an announcement he hopes will make a lot of those farmers very happy\nMinistry is acting F. and all All right that's right [noise] way our unleashing the power of the Fifteen to fuel\nCountry all year long\nPresident Trump is referring to his promise to lift certain restrictions on the sale of ethanol in gasoline in order to boost sales and put more money in the pockets of corn farmers\nClay Masters of Iowa Public radio was at the rally and he joins us now from Council Bluffs Iowa ... good morning so just lay out for us what President Trump is ordering the EPA to do by lifting regulations on that though\nSo last night the president laid out his intent to extend the sale of all kinds of gasoline called you Fifteen year round right now selling it in the summer months is prohibited\nYou Fifteen is basically gasoline with Fifteen Percent of it being primarily from corn based ethanol are doing this could prop up corn prices that have been down thanks to tariffs by other countries imposed in retaliation for the Trump administration's trade war now there is no time table yet from the White House as to how fast this proposed rule change will go into effect but there are\nHopes to have a completed before next summer when you know many drivers are hitting the road\nOr certainly there were Iowa Republican politicians at this rally last night who faced tough races next month they were applauding the decision a there are also Democrats in the state who were pleased with this announcement\nAnd so it is it really going to make a difference for Iowa farmers then\n[noise] yeah I think it will but again a lot of it does really depend on the timeline for when it gets into effect when it goes into effect that is\nEthanol is often hailed as being environmentally friendly because it reduces the fossil fuels although many environmentalists are posted this particular move by the president can explain their position here\nWell we use an example of yesterday the national Wildlife Federation says the move is not legally allowed under the clean Air Act they said no release but the change would produce more pollutants that lead to smog than gasoline alone\nA there are reports that a number of outside environmentalist groups have said that they will sue over any change to the fuel policy so there's that with environmental concerns from environmentalists but I should also add that there is a bipartisan opposition to this move also from US Senators and primarily oil producing states\nI mean you mentioned the political backdrop of all this mid term elections are coming out I mean clearly the president has a political calculus in this can you explain what the political consequences might be here\nRight and I mentioned earlier the idea that the president's trade war has been affecting Iowa agriculture in manufacturing in the states so talking about this in Iowa along with this new NAFTA deal or as it's called us MCA as well as other trade deals\nKind of a way for the president to garner some support for a couple of these races that looked pretty close here in Iowa for the mid term that includes a Iowa's governor Kim Reynolds uh she faces Democrat Fred Hubble\nShe was at the event and the president she worked changing plenty of complements with each other\nAlso the Republican congressman who represents this district David Young was also at the rally he faces a tough race as well in the summer youngest said Trump's tariffs were making him nervous and\nHe seemed to be walking the line you know when it came to supporting the president but now there's really no question last night the president said of a vote for David is a vote for me\nWhat's the political argument against us live though you said that there are some politician to oppose it\nWell certainly the politicians that are opposing it are from oil producing states and so you know they have oil in mind and so a lot of those senators don't want corn ethanol being the future in energy they're more interested in in oil Clay Masters\nOf Iowa Public radio thanks so much we appreciate it you think you\nOnly one Democrat voted to confirm Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh it

the strong economic data and the market particularly bond traders have you talked to bond traders they say things like you all the fed will never get to three percent of the fed funds rate will never get above three percent on the fed funds rate\nAnd the those bonds rated I think change their view in the last few days the last few weeks and that's because the fed consisted prodding and so I think that's now forced bond traders to change their narrative to change their view and so that's what you saw the last few weeks with interest rates prices and higher interest rate from the fed longer term

NPR News I'm Rachel Martin in Washington DC\nAnd I'm David Greene in Culver City California that are more details are emerging about the disappearance of a Saudi journalist democracy Yogi in Turkey because she'll gives the Washington Post contributor was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last week the Washington Post\nSays it has been told by people with knowledge of the Turkish investigation into this disappearance this team\nOf Fifteen Saudi men flew into you stumble on October second hours before the show was last seen entering the consulate the post is reporting that those Fifteen men departed stumbled later that very same day on flights to Cairo and to do by NPR's Peter Kenyon is following all of this\nIn is stumble and Peter what is standing out to you at this point is you learn more facts here\n[noise] uh well I'd say the main news of the day is this publication in a in a Turkish pro government paper of both the names and photos of the Fifteen Saudi men who police say arrived in Istanbul last Tuesday as the day of the show these disappearance\nOr the paper ah describe them in as an assassination squad and other media are reporting that Turkey's intelligence services identified several of the men some they say are military officers including the special forces member a there's a reported Saudi intelligence officer in there and also a senior forensics expert\nTurkish TV meanwhile are airing footage of ... entering the consulate on October second and of a black man leaving the consulate about two hours later\nA heading to the consul general's residence or there is a report as well that airport security X rayed the luggage of some of the Saudi men as they prepared to lead to stumble that same night\nUh X. rayed them in themselves and reportedly at the request of the intelligence service search one of the planes one of the two planes they apparently found nothing suspicious allowed to take off but the focus seems to be on these Fifteen men and what they were doing here\nWhy search one of the two points and that both the planes\nWell that's all we know based on the information we have so far this is going to need some further explanation it's not clear why that would be the case\nWhat officials are anonymously talking about are further grisly details one tells the New York times that one of the Saudis was autopsy expert in the bones so it was used on the buddy after the murder\n... a bone saw talk of an assassination squad it sounds like Turkish authorities are are moving towards the theory that this was a targeted murder\nYes it certainly seems that the theory they're leaning towards I don't think you can rule out the other possibility that ... was spirited out of the country\nI don't think either one has been completely ruled out yet\nThe Saudis of course denied any involvement with the show veep disappearance they claim he left ... within an hour of arriving but they say they don't have any video evidence to back that up Turkish police are going through their own camera footage this is from the streets outside the consulate\nThey say so far they've seen footage of him going in but no footage of him coming out\nThey've also been invited to search the consulate building with Saudi permission that we're told could happen as early as today there's no word yet I must say an searching the consul general's residence where the black then went eight days ago\nPeter I mean Saudi Arabia and turkey weren't the best of friends right but what could if indeed this journalist was killed on Turkish soil in the Saudi Government something to do with what could this through the relationship between the two countries\nIt would be a serious blow to relations that were already somewhat afraid I mean there's been ongoing tensions in the Persian Gulf between Saudi Arabia and Qatar and turkey quite prominently took cut our side so that hasn't helped but this would be on another level completely this is\nA beyond the pale of anything that would have happened and again as you say if it's demonstrated that this happened and the Saudis do tonight completely but it would be a big blow yeah\nAnd the u._s. always under pressure to but by some to do more to put more pressure on Saudi Arabia which could grow here\nYes a turkey is media here are kind of surprised us some headlines are showing a little bit of frustration the big ones is quote Trump I don't know anything about the ... case so far there isn't much sign that Washington is exerting pressure on Riyadh\nCause for us investigators to join the probe are happening uh we'll see anything like that occurs in Paris Peter Kenyon thanks bitter thanks\nThe largest oil company in the U.S is encouraging attacks on the dairy products that may\nExecutives at Exxon Mobil have announced that the company will contribute one million dollars over the next two years to support a campaign for a tax on carbon based fuels so I kind of difference could this make on efforts to reduce the effects of climate change Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nExxon Mobil contribution was supportive group called Americans for carbon dividends an offshoot of the climate leadership council its aim is to raise the price of fossil fuels to reduce their use and cut the amount of climate change in carbon released into the atmosphere\nExxon Mobil his voice support for such a plan for years but Greg brutal sin of the climate leadership council says the firm's financial contribution is a significant step\nThat's the first time in history that a U.S oil and gas super major has put significant financial resources behind a direct price on carbon\nIn other words a direct tax on carbon so brutal since group prefers to call it a fee not attacks more on that later\nBernstein says Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax but you may wonder why doesn't oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil support a tax on its main products\nVerbal since says one big reason is that companies want regulatory certainty they want to know what the rules of the game will be and that's an unclear and the current environment\nWe're operating in what amounts to a game of regulatory thing on which you have one administration developing rules only to have the next roll them back\nAnother important reason Exxon Mobil supports the plan is that why would tax carbon it would also remove most existing regulations on carbon emissions fertile since says the carbon taxes group is proposing would be much more effective at reducing carbon pollution than the current regulations\nThe Americans for carbon evidence plan is based on a proposal from two Republican elder statesmen\nJames Baker the third and George ... both cabinet members in Ronald Reagan's White House one carrot for Republicans is that the revenue from the tax or fee would be fully rebate it to consumers\nAnd this from the book is that as your skin when really

some level I mean you'd think it's high time people developing apps new tech new business\nYou know cause you say there's no time to pause but that they wrap in what am I doing to the world as part of their thinking\nSo part of what we're learning and leisure gotten bigger you should transformed the level of investment you're putting into mitigating risks so for example they now have hundreds and engineers dedicated to how do we make sure the content that's being shared\nIs actually in fact more accurate or how do we make sure that nation states are not hacking us trying to create political dissension within the country and they're putting investment now because they realize that they're part of social infrastructure\nRight now I really enjoyed part of the book in which you give a list of counterintuitive advisor things looking brace chaos but with somebody about this you should launcher product that embarrasses you\nThe emphasis is on speed on getting a contact with your customers and learning from it\nWith the embarrassment as the understanding how fast you need to move and the fact that will make your awkward uncomfortable\nOr is it really seen here that during this initial burst of lightening speed growth you should ignore your customer\nOr it does what your focus on is the massive numbers of future customers so as opposed to saying oh we're trying out a delightful experience Mrs or just for that first person it's growing towards what the large scale eventual customers will be it isn't but you do bad things your customer\nBut if you're like slow or a little

senator\nDecorative and want to turn to NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson who has been listening to this Hi Mara Hi David so Nikki Haley I'm One of the few members of this administration has publicly disagreed with President Trump ... how did that affect your relationship with the White House and and did that play a role it on her departure here\nWell it doesn't seem like it she was very politically adapt she was able to disagree with the president on some things publicly she wants even said that the women who are accusing Trump of sexual misconduct deserved a hearing\nBut uh she managed to craft a political persona for herself was which was as a loyal member of the Trump cabinet but not as sick event you know she said she different from him she was tougher\nRhetorically on Russia but that's true of most of the president's national security team compared to him\nUm she did speak out about human rights you just heard senator Coons talk about that but I don't think Nikki Haley was an outlier so much as she was able to use maybe the distance between Washington and New York city a as a way to develop a more independent\nPolitical brand for herself and can I just ask\nYou more I mean you were listening to senator grooms there that this whole question of how Democrats should approach this president I mean they have a base that they want to fire up they don't want to be seen as just being anti Trump and nothing else I'm here's a senator who you know post Haley came around and say she's done good things what position as this party and right now\nWell it's waiting to see what position is going to be after the elections I mean that's the big question going forward will Democrats have more cloud in the Senate will they take the majority will they have more seats will they be able to uh exert more influence on the\nConfirmation process we don't know that yet but what I think senator Collins is trying to explain is on certain things like a Supreme Court justice that changes the balance of power on the court they exert themselves as much as they can on other nominations\nThey approve the president's picks and prayers our

have had a tough go of that recently taking a financial hit for the Trump administration's trade dispute but last night at a rally in Council Bluffs Iowa President Trump made an announcement he hopes will make a lot of those farmers very happy\nIs acting F. and all All right that's right [noise] way our unleashing the power of the Fifteen to fuel\nCountry all year long\nPresident Trump is referring to his promise to lift certain restrictions on the sale of ethanol in gasoline in order to boost sales and put more money in the pockets of corn farmers Clay Masters of Iowa Public radio was at the rally and he joins us now from Council Bluffs Iowa ...\nGood morning so just lay out for us what President Trump is ordering the EPA to do by lifting regulations on that though\nSo last night the president laid out his intent to extend the sailor kind of gasoline called you Fifteen year round right now selling it in the summer months is prohibited\nYou Fifteen is basically gasoline with Fifteen Percent of it being primarily from corn based ethanol are doing this could crop of corn prices that have been down thanks to tariffs by other countries imposed in retaliation for the Trump administration's trade war now there is no time table yet from the White House as to how fast this proposed rule change will go into effect but there are\nFolks they haven't completed before next summer when you know many drivers are hitting the road\nOr certainly there were Iowa Republican politicians at this rally last night who faced tough races next month they were applauding the decision there were also Democrats in the state who were pleased with this announcement\nAnd so it is it really going to make a difference for Iowa farmers then\n[noise] yeah I think it will but again a lot of it does really depend on the timeline for when it gets into effect when it goes into effect that is\nEthanol is often hailed as being environmentally friendly because it reduces the fossil fuels although many environmentalists are posted this particular move by the president can explain their position here\nWell we use an example of yesterday the national Wildlife Federation says the move is not legally allowed under the clean Air Act they said no relief that the change would produce more pollutants that lead to smog than gasoline alone\nA there are reports that a number of outside environmentalist groups have said that they will sue over any change to the fuel policy so there's that with environmental concerns from environmentalists but I should also add that there is a bipartisan opposition to this move also from US Senators and primarily oil producing states\nI mean you mentioned the political backdrop of all this mid term elections are coming out I mean clearly the president has a political calculus in this can you explain what the political consequences might be here\nRight and I mentioned earlier the idea that the president's trade war has been affecting Iowa agriculture in manufacturing in the states so talking about this in Iowa along with this new NAFTA deal or as it's called\nUs MCA as well as other trade deals kind of a way for the president to garner some support for a couple of these races that looked pretty close here in Iowa for the mid term that includes a Iowa's governor Kim Reynolds she faces Democrat Fred Hubble\nShe was at the event and the president she worked changing plenty of complements with each other\nAlso the Republican congressman who represents this district David Young was also at the rally he faces a tough race as well in the summer young had said Trump's tariffs were making him nervous and\nHe seemed to be walking the line you know when it came to supporting the president but now there's really no question last night the president said of a vote for David is a vote for me\nWhat's the political argument against us live though you said that there are some politicians who oppose it\nWell certainly the politicians that are opposing it are from oil producing states and so you know they have oil in mind and so a lot of those senators don't want corn ethanol being the future in in energy they're more interested in in oil\nClay Masters of Iowa Public radio thanks so much we appreciate it you think you\nOnly one Democrat voted to confirm Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh was Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia mansion faces a political reality has state is getting more dominated by Republicans and\nHe's in a tight race against the state's Republican attorney general Patrick Morrisey but

vote for him um during the primary but I have voted for him in the past and now I'm really on the fence about what to do\nTurn Ireland is a Charleston city councilwoman she says she's always recognize that mention is new liberal but has defended him in the past\nI have been a person who has been the person to say to someone that we need to recognize that\nVirginia Democrats are more conservative that we're a state with an aging population and that you know Joe mansion is better than his opponent\nBut after Kavanaugh's confirmation Arlen so she won't vote for mansion in November and when we come came to a similar decision she's a public school teacher even the west Virginia Public school teachers went on strike earlier this year and the teachers union support mention come or social leave her ballot blank\nI absolutely will not be voting for senator mansion in November I won't be voting from Patrick Morrisey either I Would never vote for him but um I just we don't have a candidate that is going to fight for us\nAll three women so they hope the next Democratic Senate candidate from West Virginia will be more progressive the mansion he frequently breaks ranks with his more liberal
