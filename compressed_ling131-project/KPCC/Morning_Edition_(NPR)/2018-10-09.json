also hosts the NPR politics podcast thanks Tam You're welcome\n[noise]\nAre we're moving on now to a serious data breach at Google it happened earlier this year but Google decided not to tell hundreds of thousands of users that their personal information may have been compromised\nTheir according to a Wall Street journal report there was this software glitch in Google Plus that was Google's unsuccessful answer to Facebook so this glitch enabled outside developers to collect a user's profiled data and also the private data of our users friends\nAnd Google executives decided for some reason not to make this problem public Doug McMillan is with me in Studio he's one of the reporters who broke the story a dead thanks for coming in hiding morning so how long were users exposed for and what information might these outside developers have been able to collect on them\nYes for the software bug existed on fixed for more than two years it began in twenty Fifteen and was eventually fixed in March of this year we believe that it affected personal data that people entered into Google Plus profiles that included their name occupation things like relationship status birth date gender\nStraightforward profile information all that could have been potentially collected by outside adulterers\nBut at the developers would not have been able to read my email for for instance right it's just this profile information or justice was discovered last spring the big question is why did Google executives just go public now why didn't they say something about the ...\nThat is the big question and a reporting its end of this ... this is a relatively small number of users they're saying that they think maybe half a million users are affected the real concern is why they didn't disclose this they knew potentially these these were affected and they they did some digging they looked into\nWhether or not you know developers had misuse this data they found ultimately no evidence so they decided that that was a reason not to tell anybody we don't know if any data was misused so we have an obligation to tell people the real reason that we think you know swayed their decision was because they were they were afraid that how does it look\nThey're afraid of the the PR consequences and potential regulatory scrutiny of what was going on with Facebook in the news and the Cambridge Analytica breach that basically they would be dragged into that same story if they came out with us\nSo so we sort of have to if you're one of those users who's information was compromise you sort of have to trust Google when they say and nothing bad was done with it there is no law that says if there's a breach the company's gotta tell consumers [noise] there's a\nA patchwork of laws there's there Patrick state laws and there's a there's a new European law that address is is\nThe problem is the laws hinge on whether or not the company knew that data was improperly access in this case Google has pleading ignorance they're saying we don't know we have no evidence the data was access so we'd therefore have no obligation\nGoogle's chief privacy officer Keith Enright testified before a Senate panel two weeks ago and he talked about consumer trust let's hear what he had to say\nWe acknowledge that we have made mistakes in the past from which we've learned and improved our privacy program we understand that the foundation of our business is trust based on your reporting is that believable\nI think that they're going to have a lot of work to do to to regain user trust there is a lot of people questioning\nHow Google handled this incident and I think there are a lot of people generally look at these big ... that companies right now who have vast influence over a lot of data in our digital lives and I guess a big question about use your trust the laws one thing\nBut our relationship with these companies in our trust with them it's probably a bigger responsibility and that you're gonna have to start to see them grapple with these issues on day to day basis\nAnd we should note that Google has set is finally disabling Google Plus altogether dead McMillan covers Google for the wall Street Journal and he reported this story with fellow journal reporter Robert McMillan thanks that thanks [noise]\nAll right until yesterday the head of Interpol the international police organization based in France was a man named among Hong way he's from China\nRight but a few days ago in France amongst wife recorded that he had gone missing while he was on a visit to his native China and then yesterday among re surface and announced that he was resigning from Interpol this after apparently being detained by Chinese authorities on charges of corruption\nNPR's Shanghai correspondent Rob Schmitz has been following this story he's with us now Hi Rob\nGood morning All right so what do we know about ...\nOr ... hallway is sixty four years old he served as the vice minister of public security bureau which is China's national police are in twenty sixteen he became the first Chinese headed Interpol and there's an election was a big victory for China's government which under\nLeader Xi Jinping was eager to use Interpol to locate an extra day Chinese officials at it deemed corrupt to it a scape China\nAs it turns out among himself is now under investigation by Chinese authorities for corruption\nWhat exactly are they investigating him for\n[noise] what China's government hasn't released any details besides that he's under investigation for bribery and other unspecified crimes and the little we know about how is the tension unfolded has come from his wife grace among September twenty fifth\nThe day her husband arrive to China for a visit she allegedly received a text from him that said wait for my call which was followed by in a mood to even nights suggesting that she was in danger\nA week later she reported him missing the French police on Sunday she spoke to reporters and we own friends wearing trouble is headquartered in here's what she said\nWell you know what to do when you hear what I'm seeing I'm half of my other than my children all the people in my mouth and all the wind\nAnd children's husbands and fathers so that they may no longer disappear\nAnd as you can hear in that tape now while she's crying during this part of the video with their back turned to the camera because she's received threats and is under protection by French police well\nWhen she talks there about the husbands and fathers who've disappeared in China what does she mean\nWell she's talking about the government anti corruption campaign was launched by she can paying immediately after he took office in twenty Thirteen and snare hundreds of thousands of officials both on the local level as well as among the highest echelons of the party\nIn fact the man who appointed Malone way to vice minister of public security was Julian Kong the highest ranking Chinese official who was brought down by this campaign Joe was a former member of the politburo standing committee the group of seven men who rules China he was China security czar before he was sent to prison for life and twenty Fifteen\nSo by removing money from the presidency of Interpol China is going to lose a lot of sway inside of this organization that much is clear what does this mean for Interpol and its relationship with China\nWill Interpol has announced his resignation and appointed an acting president but even before this happened try to use of Interpol under his presidency was starting to raise a lot of red flags they were using his position to target people that China wanted in jail but that didn't have any\nEvidence of any wrongdoing on their case and and they were vetoed by other members of Interpol\nOr in this case with lung is a good example of how China's own messy politics who sort of spilling over into international organizations really\nInteresting NPR's Rob

when I thought about that\nBasically\nTelling the story of the blues this music where you'd have people with nothing or are close to nothing looking to music within themselves when times are their toughest\nWell I I Know for me that in my darkest hour there's always been a song that has helped me to transcend and certainly the story of country music and the story of the blues which I really want in the same the story of hardworking and oftentimes impoverished people\nLooking for that boat across dark waters you\nChose to make your characters African American and the illustrations in this book where and why was that decision\nMade when I first heard this story I heard it from a woman of Cherokee dissent a woman named Lorraine she had a pet crow and she was a kid on her dad's form\nAnd this crow used to steal everything and bury it all around the farm and they find a little bits of string or or cellophane or ... or so in my mind Lorraine was a hillbilly girl of Cherokee descent\nNow it took a long time to get this book finished um but really the big part of the time was getting it published and uh and then finding an illustrator\nAnd it wasn't until maybe four years passed before the publisher said sorry catch we can't really find the right illustrator would you like to search and I've found on the listing of a local art college Higgins bond\nHere in Nashville Higgins is a really important children's illustrator in the Nineteen seventies and eighties and then stops working for a long time\nHiggins is the reason that Lorraine is African American because Higgins is African American in fact she's the first African American woman to design a U.S postage stamp\nI was talking to the actress Viola Davis recently about a children's book that she's done she was saying two things one is there is an incredible need for characters of color in children's books it's been a void that's existed for very long time\nShe also said she loves when you have say characters of color but there doesn't have to be some explanation or reason for it what do you think of that is that's something we're seeing in your book\nYes and the thing that was missing and really waited until I discovered Higgins bond is that I I really wanted Lorraine to be an African American girl you know what I Do a lot of volunteer work around communities of color and in one of the places where I'm

for granted and what not wanting to to repeat that in twenty eight and\nYeah and and one thing that stood out to me is he talks about ah how Republicans may have done some damage for themselves\nAmong women a female voters in the cabin outside you know at the Clinton campaign and others thought that President Trump had at then candidate Trump had done a lot of damage with female voters\nUh with that Access Hollywood video that came out just about a year ago just about two years ago right on but ultimately white women\nVoted for Donald Trump they they broke for for Trump in the end um and and what we've seen in a lot of our polling is that gender is important that party is everything\n... well let's talk about President Trump for a moment because I Know Kevin we heard him at the White House um as he did the ceremonial swearing in saying he wants to move past\nThe bitterness he does not feeling bitter as he takes on this new job President Trump seems to be taking a of a of less pleasant tone when he's out there campaigning about this yeah\nWell a cabin I is going to be on the spring is on the Supreme Court at President Trump is trying to win a mid term and are trying to keep his party in power and do what they discovered is that Republican voters were fired up by the fight and um and you know the emotion of happiness\nAnd contentment is not as strong as the emotion of anger and frustration and and resentment and President Trump and Republicans want to keep that feeling going keep their voters upset and angry because they believe that will get them out to the polls and get them voting Republican\nI mean you know as well as I Do are living in a world where you never know when what seems like a big story of a sudden we're going to go away and there's going to be the next big story but\nAny sense of of whether this Kevin a fight is going to remain kind of in the talking points and agendas of both parties in in this one month that we have left or are there are other issues that are going to be coming up the voters gonna really can be thinking about\nWell there are absolutely other issues at ... in the end it's hard to say whether issues will will decide this or whether it will really just be a battle of enthusiasm and and and the fight over ...\nThe Trump and and Trump ism but one thing that keeps coming up I'm that hadn't gotten a ton of attention is health care\nUm and and that is an issue where you have a Republicans are coming in and saying well we don't want to take away your pre existing conditions there affirmatively going out there and doing ads about pre existing conditions because democratic candidates have made it such an issue um and and it's it's resonating with voters\nAnd Paris timer Keith Tam thanks a lot You're welcome [noise]\n[noise] state regulators in Arkansas have banned the use of a weed killer that's popular not just there but across the country this chemical often hurts other crops and wildlife but many farmers in Arkansas are defying the ban and the states having trouble enforcing it NPR's Dan Charles has the story\nThis year's confrontation actually started with a farming fiasco last year the company Monsanto which is now owned by mayor rolled out a new way to kill weeds it told farmers we've created some special new varieties of soybeans and caught and they can tolerate a weed killer called dicamba\nSo you can spray dot camera and the crops will be fine but you're weeds will die Terry Wohlers of member of the Arkansas state plant or kind of the pesticide police\nHonestly I don't think anybody in the whole world dreamed that back in ... good create such a nice you bring so many farmers against farmers\nThat gamut in stay where it belonged it drifted across the landscape and injured millions of acres of regular crops it was especially bad in Arkansas farmers who sprayed dicamba loved it but Terry fuller and the state plant board decided the collateral damage was unacceptable I talk to them about it last year\n... known your neighbor in your ... that's not my definition of good for business\nSo the plant board asked the most dramatic limits on campus and the whole country no die campus spring during the growing season this summer I called hurtful or back see how it was going and he told me it was happening again thousands of acres of crops damaged also trees in people's yards this was not supposed to happen this year\nNot supposed to happen this year scripts liquor just been a sad situation and um you know really an unbelievable situation\nThe plant boards investigators tried to catch the outlaw farmers inspectors drove country roads looking for dying weeds that looked like they'd been sprayed with Ken Buck took samples tested them\nIn at least a couple of dozen cases they found the band chemical those farmers now could face fines at least a thousand dollars possibly twenty five thousand dollars per violation\nI talked to a couple of those farmers and some of their supporters\nThey did not want me to record those interviews or use their names they told me spraying dicamba was a business decision some of them think Monsanto's dot camera tolerant seeds will give them a bigger harvest one said spraying dicamba is the only way to survive a couple of them said paying the fine is cheaper than fighting weeds any other way\nAnd by defying the band they're putting enormous pressure on the farmers who are farming by the rules like taboo now\nPersonally I don't believe is Brian dot camera I think it's too dangerous to spray I mean anybody that says otherwise is dreaming\nSo he didn't plant those new dot camera tolerant crops he got rid of weeds with other chemicals\nAre you not one drop of ... everybody says it can't be done it's a myth\nAnd then he solved the leaves of his soybean plants curling up that can but had blown in from some other farmers field\nDo I go out and try to which people and find and I'm not doing that but I have the legal right as a farmer to keep a crop that is not damaged by somebody else's sprayed\nThat legal right may not be enough though if other farmers insist on spraying dicamba he may have to also plant those new dot camera tolerant soybeans because they won't get injured\nAnd then he'd be tempted to spray dot camera to\nDan Charles NPR News\n\nThis is NPR News\nI'm Margo were on on the

Washington DC\nAnd I'm David Greene in Culver City California Good morning Google is shutting down its consumer version of Google Plus it's social network but some sauces and sort of Facebook\nThis comes after a flaw was discovered that might have exposed personal information\nOf hundreds of thousands of customers according to the wall Street Journal that flow was discovered in March but the company decided not to disclose it with us in our studio in Washington DC is one of the reporters who broke this story Doug McMillan thanks for being here hiker morning\nSo can you start by telling us about this flood of you and your colleagues at the wall Street Journal discovered I mean what what information could have gotten out here\nYes over a two year two to three year period from twenty Fifteen until earlier this year or people who entered their profile information into Google Plus um information like their gender birth date ... ... email address\nThat data could have been available to outside developers if basically if your friend had signed up\nTo some Google Plus at those developers potentially could have gotten access to this data\nThe number to potentially affect the number is abuse area's small it's only about potentially half a million users which in the world is kind of potential data breaches that is not a member of the real questions that are reporting focused on our kind of what Google did\nWhen did find out this this this uh you know the security patches ... existed\nOr didn't do right I mean they they didn't go public and let people know that that their privacy might have been at risk why\nYeah so there's sort of the story that they're telling which is they took a look at what happened they investigated these apps to some extent\nThey found that there was no suspicious activity and they decided that there is no evidence of a misuse of data so they had no obligation to tell users but our reporting shows that there was another factor at play which was they were worried about the repercussions of coming\nForward with this information or you know earlier this year right right of the time they discovered this the Facebook Cambridge Analytica data breach this happened um there's a lot of regulator scrutiny\nFacebook in tech companies and how they're handling data and internally they were worried about being pulled into this conversation and a bigger way ...\nWell have they responded to your reporting and I I guess also they said anything about how they might prevent this from happening in\nThere they took it pretty drastic step which is they now you said earlier they ... they announced they're closing the consumer side of Google Plus which is pretty big step they're also taking um a number of steps to kind of rain in\nAh some data privacy potential problems or they make a lot of data available to outside developers on an Android phones um for things like Gmail there are there are a lot of\nDifferent apps that can you can use to to and those developers can also get your data so they're taking some steps to shut down some of those channels in the short term that could actually hurt some of their relationship to developers\nBut they're saying that in the long term maybe this could prevent\nA situation like this from happening again\nBased on your reporting should people feel safe using Google that care about privacy\nI think that there are some real questions that users have to ask themselves about trust on it and the situation there was a pretty serious decision being made about how to handle a situation involving sensitive personal data\nAnd there was no transparency into that decision these you know these people in in a room in Mountain View decided how to handle a sensitive issue around user data so can users can Google Keep the trust of its users\nGoing forward I think that they're going to have a lot of work to do to to get that trust back\nDoesn't villain covers Google for the wall Street Journal

they did not see eye to eye and people fired them it's still going on we're very polarized America give us some advice here I mean what do you do if politics comes up at the office and you're the person who don't want to talk about it\nYeah it really is okay to set boundaries if you don't want to talk politics at work you can be directed at that you can say you know we look at these issues pretty differently and I'd rather keep politics out of our work relationship and other people may actually be relieved that someone is setting that boundary\nBut the presumption or your answer is that it can be acceptable\nTo talk politics in some offices in certain situations\nIf everyone involved is consenting to the conversation that's fine I Would say you want to be aware of trapped bystanders he might not appreciate the conversation as well that's a good way to drive your co workers mad or just make it hard for them to concentrate so you've got to be respectful it out that\nIt also it some of those the diversity issue because if you have a model culture you hire only people who agree with the boss politically that is going to cut out some talent\nI think that's a problem that I hear that from ... is that they're working in an office where their political views are very different from most people around them that people are assuming that they agree and they're drying them into conversations sort of making them feel complicit and viewpoints that they find pretty harmful or offensive lard\nThese days to pull this off in recent days the Supreme Court nomination hearings I've been going on and even if someone is\nResolved I'm not going to talk about this at work regardless of what side\nOf that particular issue one is you can imagine someone looking at the TV and saying\nOh you know one way or another and it's a little hard to suppress all of one's reactions\nI think it can be useful to to think about it from the other side of your co worker we're talking about a candidate all the time who you've found frankly harmful or had a big sign in their office promoting them it may impact the way that you thought of that person may impact the relationship in subtle ways and there's no reason that you need to inject that\nInto your workplace there are a lot of other times and places to use your life and the political process but work generally should not

not to disclose it with us in our studio in Washington DC is one of the reporters who broke the story Doug McMillan thanks for being here hiked the morning\nSo can you start by telling us about this

earlier this year or people who entered their profile information into Google Plus um information like their gender birth date\n... ... email address all that data could have been available to outside developers if basically if your friend had signed up\nTo some Google Plus at those developers potentially could have gotten access to this data\nThe number to potentially affect the number is abuser is small it's only about half a million users which in the world is kind of potential data breaches that is not a member of the real questions that are reporting focused on our kind of what Google did\nWhen did find out this this this uh you know the security patches ... existed\nOr didn't do right I mean they they didn't go public and let people know that their their privacy might have been at risk\nWhy yeah so there's sort of the story that their talent and which is they took a look at what happened they investigated these apps to some extent\nThey found that there was no suspicious activity and they decided that there was no evidence of a misuse of data so they had no obligation to tell users\nBut our reporting shows that there was another factor at play which was they were worried about the repercussions of coming a forwarded disinformation or you know earlier this year right right of the time they discovered this the face but Cambridge Analytica data breaches happened um there's a lot of regulator scrutiny of\nFacebook in tech companies and how they're handling data and internally they were worried about being pulled into this conversation in a bigger way\n... what have they responded to your reporting and I I guess also they said anything about how they might prevent this from happening in there\nThey took a pretty drastic step which is they now you said earlier they ... they announced they're closing the consumer side of Google Plus which is pretty big stuff there also taking um a number of steps to kind of rain in a some data privacy\nPotential

developers can also get your data so they're taking some steps to shut down some of those channels in the short term that could actually hurt some of their relationship to developers\nBut they're saying that in the long term maybe this could prevent\nA situation like this from happening again\nBased on your reporting should people feel safe using Google's they care about\nPrivacy I think that there are some real questions that users have to ask themselves about trust on it and the situation there was a pretty serious decision being made about how to handle\nA situation involving sensitive personal data and there was no transparency into that decision the you know these people and in a room in Mountain View decided how to handle a sensitive issue around user data so\nCan users you know

America project of the social science Research Council she joined us from Aspen, Colorado\nThe first group had been either working or in school when they were in their teens or early twenties and the second grip on the other hand were disconnected at that time so they were out of school and out of work by the time they reach their thirties\nThat people in the first scrape the once you've been in school and working working they earned on average thirty one thousand dollars more than those in the second grade you know\nYou're trying to use this data to make a case that even if you spent a fortune trying to keep younger people connected to education or a career path that might be cheaper than not spending the money\n[noise] yeah I think that people tend to think of out of school and out of work young people at a cost to society but a much better way to think about them is as an untapped resources so these are people who could be paying taxes buying houses sending money to support local businesses and they're just huge benefits as society from investing in these young people but\nAt the federal level I mean certainly it's got to cost a lot of money to help fix this\nSo given the annual difference in earnings between these two groups of young people more than thirty thousand dollars we estimate that the federal government would gain on average almost twelve thousand dollars per year and additional tax revenue for each young person who remains disconnected the result is an estimated fifty five\nBillion dollars in potential federal tax revenue game per year\nThe

C.\nAnd I'm David Greene in Culver City California Good morning Google is shutting down its consumer version of Google Plus it's social network but some sauces and sort of Facebook\nThis comes after a flaw was discovered that might have exposed personal information\nOf hundreds of thousands of customers according to the wall Street Journal that flow was discovered in March but the company decided not to disclose it with us in our studio in Washington DC is one of the reporters who broke this story Doug McMillan thanks for being here hiked the morning\nSo can you start by telling us about this flood of you and your colleagues at the wall Street Journal discovered I mean what what information could have gotten out here\nYes over a two year two to three year period from twenty Fifteen until earlier this year uh people who entered their profile information into Google Plus um information like their gender birth date\n... ... email address all that data could have been available to outside developers if basically if your friend had signed up\nTo some Google Plus at those developers potentially could have gotten access to this data\nThe number to potentially affected number is abuser is small it's only about half a million users which in the world is kind of potential data breaches that is not a member of the real questions that are reporting focused on our kind of what Google did\nWhen did find out this this this uh you know the security patches ... existed\nOr didn't do right I mean they didn't go public and let people know that their their privacy might have been at risk why\nYeah so there's sort of the story that they're telling which is they took a look at what happened they investigated these apps to some extent\nThey found that there was no suspicious activity and they decided that there is no evidence of a misuse of data so they had no obligation to tell users\nBut our reporting shows that there was another factor at play which was they were worried about the repercussions of coming forward with information or you know earlier this year right right of the time they discovered this the Facebook Cambridge Analytica data breach this happened um there's a lot of regulators scrutiny\nOf Facebook in tech companies and how they're handling data and internally they were worried about being pulled into this conversation and a bigger way ...\nWell have they responded to your reporting and I I guess also they said anything about how they might prevent this from happening in\nThere they took it pretty drastic step which is they now you said earlier they ... they announced they're closing the consumer side of Google Plus which is pretty big step they're also taking um a number of steps to kind of rain in ah some data privacy\nPotential problems or they make a lot of data available to outside developers on an Android phones um for things like Gmail there are there are a lot of\nDifferent apps that can you can use to to and those developers can also get your data so they're taking some steps to shut down some of those channels in the short term that could actually hurt some of their relationship to developers\nBut they're saying that in the long term maybe this was at\nA situation like this from happening again\nBased on your reporting should people feel safe using Google that care about privacy\nI think that there are some real questions that users have to ask themselves about trust on it and the situation there was a pretty serious decision being made about how to handle a situation involving sensitive personal data\nAnd there was no transparency into that decision the you know these people in in a room in Mountain View decided how to handle a sensitive issue around user data so can users you know can Google Keep the trust of its users going forward I think that they're going to have a lot of work to do to to get that trust back\nDoesn't villain covers Google for the wall Street Journal who joined colleagues and

or management issues thanks for weighing in here\nHi David thanks for having me we talked to some people before the last presidential election who had lost clients because\nPolitics came up and they did not see eye to eye and people fired them it's still going on we're very polarized America give us some advice here I mean what do you do if politics comes up at the office and you're the person who don't want to talk about it\nYeah it really is okay to set boundaries if you don't want to talk politics at work you can be directed at that you can say you know we look at these issues pretty differently and I'd rather keep politics out of our work relationship and other people may actually be relieved that someone is setting that boundary\nBut the presumption or your answer is that it can be acceptable to talk politics in some offices in certain situations\nIf everyone involved is consenting to the conversation that's fine I Would say you want to be aware of trapped bystanders who might not appreciate the conversation as well that's a good way to drive your coworkers Matt or just make it hard for them to concentrate so you've got to be respectful it out that\nIt also at some level is a diversity issue because if you have a model culture you hire only people who agree with the boss politically that is going to cut out some talent\nI think that's a problem that I hear that from leaders allowed to is that they're working in an office where their political views are very different from most people around them that people are assuming that they agree and they're drying them into conversations sort of [laughter] making them feel complicit envy points that they find pretty harmful or offensive\nLard these days to pull this off in recent days the Supreme Court
