it's really interesting advance and reproductive medicine if if you're a mouse\nYes great great news for mice um the Chinese Academy of science put out a paper showing that they were able to use on embryonic stem cells and gene editing to create mice from same sex parents ah which has been done before but\nUh they use a slightly different method these ... this time and well the mice with two dads only lived about forty eight hours\nI'm the mice with two moms live to adulthood and had babies of their own um so it's just kind of like another small step forward in this uh you know growing body of work that's teaching us how million reproduction works and how we might be able to alter it\n... that is a question though about ... worked with the ... the mice with two moms enough to to death\nYeah you know um I ... it's just considered more difficult to do it with um two meals felt it comes down to you at ... they're they're not quite um parallel I I hear referred to a lot of it's like ... up the chromosomes\nAnd there are certain genes that while both parents have them there turned off in males and turned on and females and vice versa and so it's about uh you know tweaking ... sex chromosomes so that they stick together properly\nAnd finally there's a study trip for students a special kind of memory I\nGuess so this really cool fonts called sons forget it guy um and it's actually designed to be slightly more difficult to read than than most fonts\nIt's like kind of tilted in broken and it's all about on this principle called desirable difficulty which is a phenomenon in learning where you need something to be difficult enough that it holds your interest you know that it doesn't work for the person trying to learn the information but not so hard that it keeps them from retaining it\nSo the idea behind the font is that it kind of breaks these traditional design principles\nSo that it gets your attention and me helps you retain information a little bit better so there's no public paper on it yet so we can't quite say how well it works but it is a really intriguing idea\nAlways interesting to have you Rachel Ray science editor of popular science and it was time to check in on the state of science\nYour WWE Louis how the breaking up with me in\nLocal science stories of national significance California's channel islands a cluster heat islands off of the Southern California coast\nHave been compared to the Galapagos isolated islands with unique ecosystems home to some species found nowhere else ... became a national park in the Nineteen eighties before that they were home to ranching and farming an oath to the shore much people for thousands of years before that\nBut a cascade of ecological problems threaten the islands Lance Orozco news director here at ... is with me now to talk about efforts to protect and preserve ecology there well because the CEO and we're good to be with the Irish so tell us about the ecological problems are a little bit of a history of this is nothing new rice\nNo it's it's really interesting and sort of like CSI for ... because we have this whole chain reaction of things but uh you as you mentioned we had the ranchers moved in and they brought in cattle and sheep and pigs and other non native things to the islands but what happened was after World War two and a lot of DDT ended up in the ocean\nThe D D G ended up and fish now the reason the significant is the bald eagles which are native to the islands eat these fish and it builds up to the point in the bald eagles that whenever they would nest the eggs would crack so that would basically they would suddenly actually would crack and the bald eagles came to the point of extinction so they brought in the bald eagles PR captive breeding program\nSo that opened another door golden eagles which don't live in the islands naturally said hey this looks like a great place to live because our our nemesis has gone now so so golden eagles moved out into the islands\nThe golden eagles when they moved out there started to eat the feral pigs are out there and also this rare species of Fox it's called the island Fox it looks like a cat it's a tiny little boxer cute they're adorable looking and the island Fox a very curious about people but the island Fox doesn't have it in their DNA to be on your list\nFor the golden eagles so the golden eagles basically started feasting on them push them to the point of extinction so you had this whole chain reaction biologist looked at this and said okay we need to grab what\nA Ireland Fox is we have left we need to bring them in for a captive breeding program to try to save them and so she had this whole cascade of events and so the biologist had to figure out how these things were in a related and they started to fix them and it's fascinating\nSo what what do you mean they they started to fix them so\nWhat happened was they they finally got enough of the bald eagles that they were able to reintroduce them to the islands than the golden eagles to move into the islands they did at trapping program they relocated them to another part of California in into into that as well and then the island Fox has had gotten to the point where they could release them onto the islands and and and they\nThey've they've just been growing at Jim ... who's a national park service biologist\nI'm I've talked to him for Twenty years about this project he said maybe in our lifetime we could see the island Fox recover\nIt happens in less than twenty it's remarkable biologists around the world or win at this because humans were able to fix the problem but wait there's more there is more because it because there's other non native things out you know there's the eucalyptus trees and there's aunts specifically Argentinean ants which you find on Santa Cruz island\nThey went in and they said okay we're gonna desk for these ants were going to get rid of these ants but the problem is I ... how do you know that you've gotten rid of all the ants\nOkay I'll throw it out for the I'm Sorry go ahead you have a little cup about that\nDay sucked at that point that we cannot find any aunts with us in our ... ... over sixty thousand dollar flat a plant where I think we get a really good job on the treatment and bringing out their stock to try to resolve to ensure that we can say okay we're done needed their education\nNow that's Christina Bowser with the nature conservancy so what they did is a this group co working dogs for conservation Montana trained this dog specifically to find Argentine finance the only dog but its type in the world it went out it checked out the islands\nAnd it said that Santa Cruz island his aunt free in fact now twice to just checked up into buys he's now looking for clock muscles in place for national park\nAnd so he's moved on but did they were able to show that the island is now an free thanks to the dog\nSo we have a happy ending we do have ... that the rest go as a news director here at K.

P. C. C.\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow\nThere is less than a month until the mid term elections on November sects and there's a lot of talk about hacking and voters security\nThe federal government has said hackers targeted the election systems of Twenty one states before the twenty sixteen presidential election but reportedly no information was changed or manipulated\nYet for the second year in a row the DEF CON underground hacking conference\nWell it showed how hackers could break into voting machines\nSo what are the real risks to our voting infrastructure how can we security systems\nHow does this affect voting behavior and our question for your listeners is what is your top concern about voting security heading into the mid term elections we want to hear from you give us a call our number eight for for seven to for eight to five five\nEight four for ... you can also tweet us ... what concerns you most about voting security heading into these midterms let me bring on my guests Lawrence Norden is a deputy director of the Brennan Center Democracy Program at New York University Welcome to science friday Thanks Ira\nThese days and the elections spaces that understand a lot of focus on how do we secure the very selection systems whether it be the machines of the er the voting registration system there is also the matter of building resilience into the system because we know that at\nSome time it someplace things really to break down like you experienced or you know there'll be mistakes or there will in fact the attacks and so then the question is why does the backup and was the backup plan and the case of if you have paper ballots\nUm although you might have electronic ballot marking devices that's a backup if the voter registration system is down if you're prepared with I'm In a provisional ballots\nUm or even on a paper backup of on electronic voting system um then you can move ahead and um you know if if\nAnd those are the sorts of things where when I look at state and local officials\nYou know that's what I Want to know about is what sort of resilience in an emergency planning is going into the operations just as much as I'm interested in well you know do you have the sensor on your servers do you have this sort of two factor authentication on your on your on your email et cetera\nLaurence ... is the Brennan Center more concerned about the voting system or the possible suppression of the voting registration of candidates\n[noise] yeah I mean we're [laughter] we're concerned about we're concerned about both for sure I I think and I think both of them I'm a\nContribute to a to cynicism about the process too concerned about the process I I Do think you know we've seen 'em\nAn unusual number of a voter purges in ... in the last couple of years since um\nSince the Shelby decision that struck down an important part of the voting rights act in states that were covered before\nAnd that had to get pre clearance for ... for for doing things like purging voters um we've seen a massive increase in states like Georgia\nAnd I'm In Texas and Florida and North Carolina and uh you know I I think when people see that that um people that would ... we should be entitled to vote and show up at the polls until they're not on the royals um for whatever reason and it could be because\nThere's there were mistakes programming errors or could because they were they were improperly purged hum that creates a lot of doubt\nAnd in the integrity of the system one thing that I Would say that everybody or in the run up to the election as they should be checking their voter registration that's an easy thing to do on line or if there are a\nFan and they think they register they may not\nYes absolutely and and in fact that's that's an early that can be an early warning signs for election officials that hey maybe I Need to figure out what's going on here maybe there's a problem so I think that's really important to do for the voter because it'll also remind them of where they should be going to vote and they can feel confident about when they show up on election day but I think it's also important for the system generally\nI'm Ira Flatow this is science friday from WNYC Studios uh Charles you looked at how the public sentiment towards election security when it feels if if they think are voting systems are secure do that [noise]\nUm well actually um they they do for the most part I I did a um I did I did a survey I'm just over the weekend on last weekend which I'm I'm replicated something I did in may and I asked\n'em a representative sample of voters um potential voters um whether they're competent at least that there\nUm that their own county or locality is prepared for um this November in\nTerms of computer hacking and about I'm sixty percent or so of the respondents said that\nThey were at least somewhat confident in um what um what what's likely to happen in November I'm with\nI'm not surprisingly maybe Republicans being a bit more confident the Democrats and\nUm and that that partisan divide by the way is one of the reasons why I always I'm kind of put an asterisk on any public opinion research being done on public attitudes about confidence and voting whether it be in cyber\nSecurity or just the vote count in general and that these days everything is partisan and um you know voters expectations about what's\nGoing to happen in November and whether we're prepared on the cyber security side um\nIs is much um is is likely to be determined by their\nPartisanship as um attitudes about almost any other issue\nIs voting security politically partisan issue [noise]\nI'm a little bit um I mean it's surprisingly nonpartisan in the sense that I mean there are democratic and Republican differences on the cyber security front um but they are you know you know they're the sort that a political scientist would write home about but maybe\nOn everybody else would have gone out when you compare it to you know ... attitudes about abortion or health care for instance um [noise]\nBut um when you look at other survey research that I've done Democrats for instance are more likely to be concerned about four on foreign attacks foreign influence on elections um Republicans are more likely to be concerned about um internal\nUm cyber security problems which is I I think consistent with Republican leaders in general about um um fraud and other things have happened domestically\nSo there is you know that they're all those kinds of differences that are reflective of the toy sixteen election but nonetheless Republicans and Democrats alike are both concern about cyber security and elections\nAnd voted among a whole are confident that their local officials um are are are doing the right thing\nHer in a very interesting topic well off to take out a moron and maybe even before the weeks before the elections and get an analysis when the elections are over I Want to thank both of my guests Lawrence Norden deputy director\nOf the Brennan Center is Democracy Program at New York university Charles Stuart the third professor of political science founding director of the

the ... brothers miss Madison Cunningham dirty projector fly from here we make great radio some good people\nSaturday Night at seven eighty nine point three key PCC [noise]\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow back in December of twenty Fifteen\nHundred Ninety five of the world's nations took their first steps down a long unclear road to addressing climate change\nIn signing the Paris climate agreement nations agreed to keep the increase in global average temperature\nTo quote well below two degrees Celsius a critical point at which the planet gets locked into a future of catastrophic impacts such as\nRising sea levels more devastating floods and droughts widespread food and water shortages and and more powerful storms and to ensure that we don't get too close to that to degree tipping point the agreement to ask countries to limit the temperature increase\nTo just one point five degrees Celsius but how much does happen to agree save us from the most devastating impacts of climate change a new report from the inter governmental panel on climate change the IPC see this week has shed some light on that\nIt highlights a number of climate change impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to one point five degrees compared to two degrees or more\nBut uh but you know we talked\nWe talked about energy usage in the past uh it's it's it's cheaper to make things more efficient so they don't use up as much energy than it is mitigating the problem later\nIs the same thing true of carbon it's it's better to keep it from being admitted it's much more efficient to do that than to try to suck it out of the year later\nThat's for sure absolutely certainly on reducing energy demand energy efficiency and these are all going to be critically important efficiency of industrial processes um and I changing some of the behavioral changes that would lead to kind of more low carbon society would be very critical\nAmerica's later this is science friday from WNYC Studios I mentioned some of the uh\nThe things we're watching now rising sea level the levels we are more devastating floods and we had a hurricane\nThat's now gone off the scale this week I'm In for some measurements are we not seeing is not fair to call these consequences of of climate change where evidence more or less of climate change\nAbsolutely I I I think what's important um and I think one of the reasons why I'm this report um is really hitting home to people is that everyone is seeing the um devastating impacts them just one degree of warming\nAnd now we're talking with the current climate change commitments and even if they were fully implemented we're slated for two point seven to three point seven degrees Celsius of warming\nUm said that the world that um we don't know what that looks like I'm certainly that that's better than without the climate change commitments but we are talking about a tremendous changes\nUm across systems on it certainly we have lots of evidence that on the impacts and folding around us I have a human fingerprints I and we can see the impacts of human activity I'm In a number of different changes including and storm activity\nUm in terms of the amount of time that storms are sticking around\nOn in the Atlantic the the frequency on the intensity of storms on the sea level rise basically gives a higher on boarding for on coastal inundation um so we're definitely already seeing a lot of impact sense hold her an ounce of rainfall\nIt's coming out of these that's right or just an amazing buddy but you you scared me a little bit when you just said we don't even know what it would look like and it above two degrees Celsius increase\nIs so and so on what we do have is we have some models that um look at what the projected impacts would be and I'm for some of these impacts we have more certainty and\nFor others we have less certainty they are also these so called wild cards on that probably are a low low probability but what had very high impact and where those thresholds lie on for some of those we are not completely\nI shore so if you think about shifting of ecosystem is from a tropical forest to savannah like state or because you have such extreme drought\nUm that would be not only catastrophic for the ecosystem and by diversity and services but also for carbon for carbon storage\nYou know and but frequently struck by people who say you know if we take it's going to cost us money is going to cost taxpayers money to implement some of these things we're talking about\nBut the other side of the argument ever gets talked about it what you're going to cost in terms of lives in capital and movement of populations and farming if we don't do any of these things it's just it's so totally unbalanced on the underside\nThat's absolutely right and interestingly the report found that economic losses are actually much greater as temperatures rise and with middle income countries in Africa Southeast Asia India Brazil Mexico\nI'm projected to be affected the most um they looked at 'em global GDP losses for one point five versus two degrees and found that um it was significantly different on a lot of these losses sometimes aren't even in the calculations to begin with\nA and I'm certainly if you have short term is ... where you don't value later on economic impacts are as well as those that are harder to quantify um it doesn't get into the equation\n[noise] so uh you know we'll just have to wait and see what happens when we were because it's not a pretty picture the way we're it's\nNot a ... it's not a pretty picture but there's there's a lot we can do and we must do I you know first time in terms of the international process governments in twenty twenty um are invited to up their commitments and to increase the ambition of their ... and that's going to be really important\nOr what we know is the current commitments are not good enough to get us on track so I think on making sure that there's an expectation and a pressure for governments to do that\nOn but also for for people not to throw up their hands on because there's an incredibly important role for everyone to play not on the government but the private sector and also individuals and I'm a lot of different things that individuals can do for sure\nMost yeah that was why I was\nJust thinking individuals can do\nI I was going to say the single biggest thing is to to get out and vote 'em because I think we need to um make sure that decision makers are taking climate change incredibly seriously and really turning the admissions director around\nGet up there and vote thank you very much like to live and Dr Kelly living as a senior associate with the world resources Institute thanks for taking

tools were actually used for woodworking\nMost were used for cutting fish or meat or for scraping highs or a you know a scaling\nFish and that was a so that really change things for us\nSo you found that they were using salt for a lot more things than had been suspected before yeah I thought\nSo previously I had built up a story based on I think some good solid evidence that they were producing a tremendous amount of salt and\nThey were probably trading at storing it and trading it in the form of salt cakes in standardized unit based on the standardized ah dimensions of the pottery fossils\nAnd they were taking salt as a commodity to markets up up rivers to inland cities to trade up marketplaces and so the discovery\nOf the the fish adds to the story by saying well yes I think they were\nAlso taking salted fish and both of these are store oval commodities that really are good risk management strategy for yeah household economy or and also for whoever\nBuys the things at the inland markets if you you don't have to use it right away you can hold onto it\nFor a while and it's amazing I mentioned the lighter surveys have found sixty thousand structures in Guatemala where what is this revealing about the complexity of this civilization\nWell like you said the Maya had the concept of the euro they they probably use\nThat a ... complex calculations in their market places as well as the the ... and they had a very dense and large population of cities towns and villages\nAre where we are on the ... southern cause to believe everything has been submerged by field will rise and covered in Maine gross\nA but in the interior and the rain forest a there's a surprising number of\nSites I think it's the lighter has really transformed our ability to look at sites in a whole different way first of all the them before you start excavating and make a plan but the density of a population is it's really impressive\n[noise] yeah I Do ... or is there enough or you know resources are people power or anything good quip meant that you can ... enough to go in and see these sixty thousand different structures and the vast expanse of the civilization many are you are able to do that\n[noise] well I think that fortunately\nFor my sights they're all under water and you can't\nSee them and they're below the sea floor and it's really hard to see anything at all you really have to do what you're looking\nFor I Know I Know where they are are we also have a GPS to help us find them a ad in the rain forest these sites are still protect in the rain forest\nSo even though they're visible on lidar unless you have access to the lidar data\nYou can't really see the sights and it's still very difficult to get them get to them but I think in terms of the archeological projects that work on the interior bought a mall and now they'll be able to plan their their research because there'll be able to see these things on lidar and make plans\nBefore they go in the field which is you know like working in the desert yeah yeah\nI Know it's interesting what is ... would cook I have a couple of questions where one is\nThe discovery of this all the salt making does it change your ideas about the economy of the Miami we're using this money using it for trade all the songs they were mass producing\n[noise] yes I think what it really does ah\nIs under score the fact that the classic Maya had a marketplace economy and it was largely a lot of trade or in a regional economy so that various different\nKinds of exchange wired things from short distance and long distance but if I think it was\nBased on the hustled economy\nSort of a family business in this case making salt and making them in standardized shapes and sizes so\nThe um for example I looked at the ... three different sites of our Paint Creek salt works three different areas and they were making their their pots were different in their ... dimensions\nSlightly different and these were statistically significant differences suggesting to me that they they made their own hot and they they made the salt and they were doing it as part of a household economy um and then you know now we know that they were taking the salt cakes standardized units of exchange\nAnd storage and also the salted fish taking them to inland sites and they were trading them the my of course didn't have a currency per se\nBut they did have currency equivalency and I think ... cakes can be discussed as a currency equivalency\n... or how much of this can be actually reconstructed\nYou say a lot of it was underwater and you know sea level rise I understand you you found a a\nCanoe paddle wouldn't we found\nA yes in two thousand four we found at five Fifteen we found a the first wouldn't post and then we started finding posts everywhere and we went back to fight fourteen and found a full size\nWithin canoe paddle four foot seven inches long which we've now are done it three D image does and you eat it's reconstructed and we've done uh we've printed\nBut full sized replica of it or we found that some of the new as well and so that's sort of the infrastructure of distribution\nRough and well I Want to thank you very much Dr McComas protecting time to be with us today\nWill come down and swim with us some time and see for yourself\nBurning I'm putting it on\nMy list heaven ... author of a study that was published in the proceedings of the national academies precedent apology at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge\nAh were to take a break and come back and talk about the secret lives of squirrel monkey [noise]\nDidn't know they had a secret life we're in we're uncovering and here you want to know the details stay with us we'll be right back after this spring\nAre up later this is science\nThey don't like to meet very much but when they meet they pretty much just go their separate ways\nUh there's not a ton of aggression in the group except during the mating season between adult males than things can get pretty ugly\nWherever the speaking of that you bring up a good point because squirrel monkey where there's this there's societies female dominated correct for this species yes fishing yeah does that have anything to do with the fact that they're not that aggressive\nAh possibly um so for a female dominated species we mostly see that in in lemurs really but for anthropology primates that's pretty rare really\nUm one thing about square monkeys is that they have\nA very interest specific differences between a they're in their life histories and all species have a very high degree of maternal investment but it's it's interesting to me that the two species where we see female dominance the females nurse the infants for a very long time\nSo possibly they getting priority of access to resources um that might be something that's going on\nWith the domination of females need species the men are the men pulled back because they know their place more\nThat's exactly how I Would describe it there's not that much aggression from females to males but the males kind of know their plate when um the center of the groups is formed by adult females and\nUh they're juveniles and the males except for the mating season they pretty much stay on the periphery of the group minding their own business um and if they try to get too close to the infants and juveniles the females are not happy\nI'm Ira Flatow this is science friday from WNYC Studios\nTalking with a Anita stone about the squirrel monkeys um [noise]\nSo any idea why society would involved one way or the other to have one gender dominate versus the other\nWell we know that uh for for most DC's a female's invest a lot more in reproduction than than males do 'em in primates do have gestation lactation you have the difference between sperm and eggs\nSo I'm from studying primates where there is female dominance um we know that sometimes they live in very harsh environment though females having that this is true and lemurs where the females have priority of access to resource may have something to do about where they live\nUm and how the resources are distributed a squirrel monkey is we're not exactly sure but of the seven species there's only that there's only two that we know of that are female dominant\nYeah when I ask you about something I learned in\nIs that the the the\nSquirrel monkeys have something called ... that we might consider it a strange behavior but for them it's called the urine washing\nYes I'm so this kind of became a side project in my research group because of a couple of students got really interested in it so\nThere's this odd behavior that's done it's not just were monkeys but ... do it to where an individual will urine ate a few drops onto the palms of their hands\nAnd rub it on the soul of the foot and sometimes repeated on the other side\nI'm it it doesn't take very long it's pretty quick\nAnd we don't really have a good idea about why this happens if you look at the literature most studies were done with ... in captivity and different studies point it just points in all different directions\nUm some things that are being proposed are that it could be a form of sexual communication between adult males and females even thermal regulation as a way to cool down because for monkeys don't sweat\nBut what we found in our population is that juveniles do it much more than adults and um it also seems to be so that really ... almost rules out the the sexual communication idea because juveniles are doing it more\nBut it also seems to be linked to stressful situations so you know fights in the ... or some sort of turmoil and so one thing that had been suggested which I think our data support is that it's some form of anxiety displacements sort of like a stress reliever\nA much like you know bringing your hands when you're nervous or something like that\nUm but we definitely need to dig deeper into that\nSo it's not like a territory marking no that out of your other animals the right\nWay so that actually has being looked at a long time ago and a semi captive population that it's not territory marking it's not a way for 'em one individual to know where they're supposed to go to follow the group\nUm that doesn't seem to be the function of it yeah uh but it couldn't be that it has multiple functions that could mean something for adults and something else for juveniles\n... you know we've seen we've seen issues where a animal cultures we're learning more passing their culture down from one to another do you see that in ... at all\nSo I've never actually seen a squirrel monkey use do what we would consider tool use in in the wild um [noise] I I did hear about ah\nSomething that sounded kind of like it in captivity so in terms of passing things down I Would think more that the constant proximity of the females with the juveniles and their constant communication I don't know what they're talking about\nUm but the the wasps ness of forging could very well be something that's you know the juveniles learn by observing the adults\nThat's terrific I Want to thank you both for taking time of protests thank you for taking them to be with us today and need a stone assistant professor of biology California Lutheran university here in Thousand Oaks fascinating\nStuff hope you get back in the jungle so thank you wait to be here we're going to take a break when we come back we're going to talk about the salmon swimming hundreds of miles was born\nAnd the magnetic sense of
