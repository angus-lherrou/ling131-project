hurricane that's we're talking from forty miles per hour winds to a hundred sixty miles per hour winds\nAnd and do we know how that or why that could happen so suddenly\nConditions were were just perfect for it it was going over an area with warm water and heat fuels hurricanes it was also in an area is a lot of moisture and there wasn't a lot of wind shear when shares just when you've got wind that different different speeds at different altitudes and that kind of thinking really dissipate a storm\nAnd will it didn't encounter any of those any of that as it was built into a category five but after that it did actually went back down to a category three before it made landfall very\nQuickly also yes again those are really quite chain ...\nIs this sort of a new pattern them for hurricanes to be expected\nIt's hard to say I think that it's part of the pattern of more hurricane intensity definitely so will is actually the tenth hurricane season to reach category four or five in the Pacific northeast it's the most intense season that area has had ever on record\nSo um it's it's definitely I mean ... researchers have warned that in a warming planet the hotter it gets the more intense we can expect hurricane season to be\nAnd you know with all the water that these hurricanes drop now oh maybe we need a new classification people have been talking about well you know the ones we may not just be adequate enough to describe\nI I completely and her reading it as a matter of fact most people who died hurricanes they die from freshwater flooding not from wind damage and category the category system only really talks about wind damage so I think it is important to talk about flooding so Willa\nHas made landfall and moved from Mexico to Texas and apparently the

your own water on Mars or are we talking about what it is\nIt's very exciting that the water there yeah so researchers when they found liquid water on Mars they knew that water had to be really salty because Mars can get very very cold and in order for that ... not freeze it must have a high salt concentration so they didn't really look at whether life might be be\nMight have enough oxygen but a new study has done just that they said well if we have this very salty water at this range of temperatures and that the these different pressures how much oxygen would dissolved in that water would it be enough to support 'em microbes that couldn't breathe that and they found it would be would have enough oxygen to support not only microbes\nBut certain types of sponges ... fungi on Mars while not not to sell you [laughter] know so much of this model organism and researchers like ... it's very very simple it's filtered feed her it's\nProbably one of the first animals to have all so it's it's

always amazes me how to use so if we think you know if we wish would a senior editor of popular science now it's time to play a good thing bad thing [noise]\nBecause every story as a flip side\nIt's become a common sight on social media you're scrolling along and you'll see a post asking for donations to support some kind of medical treatment\nOften because a person doesn't have insurance or they've exhausted their resources these crowd funding campaigns can raise a substantial amount of money but are very ethical concerns\nJoining me now to talk about the good and bad of crowd funding medical treatment is Dr Ford vox he's medical director of the disorders of consciousness program\nAnd chair of the medical ethics committee at the shepherd center in Atlanta Georgia and coauthor of a short research letter on medical crowdfunding published this week in the journal of the American Medical Association who joins us by Skype welcome to science friday\nHey that you know what are known afternoon to these crowd\nFunding campaigns can help bridge the gap financially for people facing expensive medical treatment but what what's the downside to this\n[noise] that's right but the downside is water people are going to be raising money for you know we certainly hope it's true insurance gas which there are there are a lot there's a lot that insurance doesn't cover the media should are extra added cost and people are off work and important equipment and so forth\nBut we're actually dangerous is what you're raising money for it might be ... face revenge or\nSome sketchy kinds of treatment something like that\nThat's right and that's what we focus on on this paper wheelchair far diverse different so called sketchy treatments are from the most dangerous ones things themselves and plan for instance central nervous system people raising money to get this done selling in Mexico or the China some procedures here in the ...\nStates as well in a variety of other things also that are not FDA approved potentially highly dangerous people in their generosity are donating these campaigns because folks are desperate to help out individuals that but not really realizing you could be causing them some real harm\nYou could be or how much how much money are we talking about here\n[laughter] so I'll probably end up itself is a this ... billion dollars has been raised so far on go on the alone\nAnd medical crowd funding is the single largest segment of that as far as the problematic campaigns I Can't say for sure because we just select the kind of a representative sample of five to snatch the activity\nWe found folks trying to raise about twenty seven million dollars or five of these shady street and that's a and they race is over six million dollars\nYou know some people would say what's what's the problem here these patients have a right to try and seek their own cures trying new treatments of others have not worked for them\n[noise] you're right and that's kind of the libertarian point of view and and it does exist however are this is a little bit different transactions than a year you know the point that out of your own like accounts were just your own close family or friends now third party is involved and potentially\nCausing harm to yourself and that goes that that is largely go hungry but the other platforms as well and so they do now have an ethical duty and that transaction\nIs there any way to know if you see one have how to find out on your own whether this thing is worth crowd funding for you\nThere is not and there should be and that's part of the critique uh that we outline\nA we think that that's the duty of the sites or perhaps filter out some of these campaigns worked for them on up to the humans are to interpret that uh they could have for example kind of a a medical handled a look at it they could refer people certain key words to the appropriate\nInformation on the website or other reputable website for example but thought are you really have to be an educator consumer and that's part of what the danger of these campaign says they represent people are going around a kind of

journalist based out of Leeds, England\nHer new book is nine pine said Journey Through the money medicine and mysteries of blood welcome to science friday\nThank you I guess I guess being from the u._k. a pint is the right measurement you would be using for blood I Believe that's\nSomething we share it with you though so it's the one thing we have in common alone with miles\n[laughter] see very ah they're all these different connotations about by the Romans drank it Homer used it in the odyssey to allow the day to speak why there's so many almost mystical ideas about what\nSo because at that point again blood was thought to have the spiritual mysterious quality\nIt was thought that if you transfer you someone would blow to you would get the quality of the characteristics of the creature so sheep's blood is very popular because they were thought to be mild and nice um cows popular too because\nI have to be gentle um dogs don't stop blood was experimented with a lot\nUm with various uh

book nine points a journey through the money medicine and mysteries of blood on science friday from WNYC Studios\nI'm there had been attempts to create synthetic blood we've I've been following it for years but why is it so hard to do that\nBecause blood is so amazing and because we cannot replicated even though so much money and so much half and so many great minds have been trying to say for decades to try to do it\nWe still haven't done it and we still cannot reproduce something that does everything that blood blood does in the body because it is very very busy it's you know it's transporting oxygen it's removing carbon dioxide is keeping us warm it's transporting nutrients and we just\nHaven't come up with the synthetic um alternative\nYet to happen to have to be really good progress but and that have been\nAnd since ... red blood cells which have been used down transfused in fact the trouble is that at the moment they would be so expensive um that\nThat just no

the preventive medicine so he would prescribe sixty reaches even\nBefore he'd seen his patient so um but then they found out the fashion once when the stupid things like germ theory and disease\nAnd because there that we used to blood less blood lifting was thought to balance the humans in the body once the humorist theory went out the window and so did leeches\nBut then in the um about fifty

friday\nHi thank you I'm happy to be here we're happy to have you so what is so special about breathing through your nose\nWell a nose breathing is special because it's how we smell and smell is a fascinating and really unique sensory system\nSo evolutionarily smell is our oldest sense it's also arguably the least understood of our sensory systems and there are several key aspects of smell that make it particularly interesting and that make nose breathing really different from mouth breathing so for one thing\nAnd they're the courts have been really reticent to get involved that the Supreme Court kind of hasn't given a clear answer to politicians about whether this is okay are not in the absence of that clarity\nPoliticians are kind of having a field day so I wanted to play a clip Ira that really took my breath away the first time that I heard it and this is a state legislator from North Carolina David Lewis he's a Republican state rep\nTalking about how Republican legislators in North Carolina we're going to redraw the state's congressional map\nI proposed that we draw the matched to give a partisan vantage to tune wrote a book comes in three Democrats because I've not believe it was possible to grow matter who you love ... ... ... ... to do from a crutch\nThey actually fed this on camera wasn't entirely subtle [laughter] and not take them all of the ... yes yes if I could gerrymander any better I Would\nOf this is science friday from WNYC Studios talking\nAbout gerrymandering\nA ... and ... those comments by representative Louis actually prompted a lawsuit by some North Carolina voters and and good government groups to try to get this gerrymandered congressional map taken down by the court\nSo tell me about this case how how does the ... fit in okay\nOkay so traditionally in partisan gerrymandering case is one of the things that they've had missing is is this question of how do you prove a gerrymander how do you actually quantify how much a particular math is hurting Republicans or Democrats\nAnd and that's where math can really help mouth is pretty good at quantifying thing uh so in this North Carolina case one of the the experts is a math professor named Jonathan ... and he came up with a way to actually quantify how skewed map is yeah\nAnd that so that would be the math professor he made a calculation is probably straightforward\nStraight forward might be pushing it but the theory behind the calculation is quite straightforward because the case he's making is\nIf you're going to call a particular map gerrymandered and said this map skewing the election results than it would help to know what a normal election result would have been for that year if you're going to say something unusual in gerrymandered you'd better now what usual looks like\nAnd so the way he figures that out is he takes the actual votes that people cast and then election so like\nAll the votes that north Carolinians cast in the congressional race in twenty twelve\nAnd then he calculates how many seats Democrats and Republicans would have one if the district maps have been just a little bit different\nAnd he does this thousands of times with thousands of nonpartisan alternative redistricting scheme and then the ... you know well how different is my you know quote unquote average result from what we actually saw\nAnd what he found for example in that twenty twelve congressional race is North Carolina elected for Democrats to Congress and twenty twelve\nBut Jonathan saw actually more typical result would have been six or seven Democrats so now he can look at that map and say you know what that map elected for Democrats it's unusual it's a typical and I'm able to quantify that\nSaid that that's what he set out to do is really key finding but it was actually something else that really surprised on it then when he did all of this um let him explain it\nI saw my doubts as to buy never changing a single vote\nBy only redrawing the districts I could change the number of Democrats elected from four to nine of Thirteen and we were just sort of each of those you know we call it a wave election either votes right and extremes but with the same boat you can create a wave election for the Republicans and a wave election for the Democrat\nSo that that's kind of amazing Johnathan is looking at an election where the votes are unchanged one set of votes but depending on how he you know move those district lines around she can create an election that's a landslide for the Republicans or a landslide for the Democrats that is how powerful gerrymandering as\nSoon as this mathematicians who's going to court with the stuff\nThat is correct so last October this mathematician Jonathan mattingley was an expert witness in a court case he actually took the stand on behalf of those North Carolina voters who were suing the state over the map and its goal is to try to convince the federal judges that hey this this map is gerrymandered\nThat have that go for a while we're hoping that you'll listen to the episode [laughter] shameless cliffhanger you can check the news anyway but

South Asia kind of left it together as the recall that'd be eastern cluster\nAnd then there's the southern last which is dominated by Latin American countries and countries of um a French uh Francophone heritage and as um the other countries are in the northern lost to us right now the western Leicester which is mostly western countries of a a a Protestant or or Catholic provenance\nMhm some of the countries in Asia in the middle east preferred to spare younger rather than an older characters or was not what is it was much less pronounced there\nYes the the the general preference for sparing younger over all the characters of them was much less pronounced in the case of the eastern Lester\n... and in Europe and North America they preferred to spare home\nOh um I mean that they had um you know the kind of more or less that it was the average ... and then in I'm In the southern lobster that's mostly the Latin American countries uh they had a slightly higher um propensity to save

harm\nUm so ... that's those are the well known ones and uh we've noticed for example like in different countries that are\nCultural factors and or an economic factors even that influence what decisions of people make 'em for example\nIn countries with relatively high or economic inequality they have a relatively higher tendency a relatively high or a preference for saving high status individuals was this little steps as individuals\nYeah you know you put that into your cats but in in its scenarios they include income gender and physical characteristics different ages and\nThese are things that the current driverless cars can identify are there any and they're not going to be\nYou know knowledgeable of all those different things when it comes to making a decision so is that really a practical way to study\n\nIt depends what do you use it for um we do not really expect that we'll just take this data and build a model and and um you know plug it into the vehicle into vehicles and defeated almost vehicles\nUm what they want to do is understand what the public's reaction to it as one of his vehicle crash might be we want to understand um watch what feels needs to be a lead in order to encourage adopted if one of those vehicles\nUm so yeah those those are the primary um the goals of this kind of see that conversation to provide the ground truth for a conversation about almost equal ethics\nOr ... you must talk to everyday people when you you know you you talk about your tests and and and your relatives and friends have been getting a driverless car I mean our let's just just between you and me\nPeople want to get into a car where they don't have the option of protecting their own life they know that the car my Chu who is that they die and that if someone on the street are they gonna want to buy that kind of car or get into one\n\nThat's ... that's actually what what the paper and are there any sixteen paper looked at which was um do people uh people people genetic before to not by such a car a lovely and individually\nIt's it varies I mean it depends on uh sometimes sometimes age or um you know I'm or a familiarity with technology has been known to a an interesting as I've seen a few minutes with the idea with the with the high end and Avi technology um affects these decisions\nI Would think that the car and juniors must be you know as you rightly point out there doing tests about this and they are thinking a lot about this topic\n\nYes ah the the industry is is a suddenly\nConsidering this I mean you know I'm Mercedes I'm One of one of the heads of autonomous vehicles um automation says something back in uh in twenty sixteen about which one was vehicles like that they might have to say if the person in the vehicle if you can see them listen to the vehicle but then there was a backlash against that\nSo um and then you know forward for example though um they they said oh the the chief Ford said that I'm a ton of vehicles and it'll it'll ultimately have to come from a social consensus and um that that's kind of the conversation to seed here\nIt's not going to be a commercial someday we're where the car companies are competing for your business by saying well put you first [laughter] and then in the ...\nYeah I'll tell them a automakers might have different interests than say insurers and\nUh you know policymakers consumer advocacy groups now is the stakeholders with a and of course the consumers I mean the stakeholders with\nWith different interests and they will have to have a conversation to come to a consensus about where to move and that that ... that a consensus my that conversation about ... different in different countries because of the different um\nStrength of the preferences for along each of these dimensions\n... let me see if I get a quick phone call in lay in Tucson welcome to science friday\nEither quickly hello yes go ahead I Am I on here you are go ahead okay\nI guess my question in these ethical considerations in the survey or just in the in the practice itself that your guest is talking about if there was ever actual material consideration I'm just not doing it at all in other words or the surveys including a question do you think that\nJust think about actually just dropping this or not doing it at all and do the people that are the ethics of the whole thing really actually considered just dropping it and not doing it at all and I'm referring to self driving cars AI\nOkay okay yeah you think well maybe this is just a bad idea\nUm that\nI mean we think that that more knowledge is always good\nUm automatically when when self driving vehicles start to come with the market in greater numbers and maybe even what unless vehicles without any manuals driving options there is an issue of whether people will actually take to these and you know for that to happen I mean ... even\nThe insides of spacecraft like the Gemini spacecraft looked kind of grimy and dirty and then I think they were really clean I think that was a directorial choice to detect these things in with the machines\nAre there so that those kind of aesthetic choices that he made but I think overall it's pretty accurate there's lists little bits and pieces that he missed\nFor sure I'm On I'm On a lot of space nerds online or are busy or uncovering all this stuff but um overall I think it's pretty accurate and what did you what do you think of Buzz Aldrin is that a trick\nQuestion [laughter] um actually I don't hear her years so I have my own opinion but we can I\nCan say for sure that this was an exaggerated depiction of puzzled with in in the late sixties I think I don't think he would have said the things he said\nUh but that was a a a choice that kind of narrative choice from the writers um [noise] um so yeah there's not much to say obviously he was he was not like that but we have the story you know ... you agree\nI think they did a really good job especially with the interior and the window like details down to the window marking that they use for rendezvous and docking were there and I I really enjoyed that accuracy there was one sort of technical piece that jumped out to me as a mission designer\nWhen they actually did the translator injection burn they were pointed at the moon which means that they would have missed it because it takes three\nDays to get there the moon's moving that whole time you really have to aim in front of the moon by quite a bit but you it's like during the football in\nFront of the receiver that's running and so that one when I kind of trickled in the theater but I refrain from commenting for my fellow new movie goers there\nWell I you know just just to someone who watched it in real time what had happened that was the media that's how they portrayed it they never really showed you the exact trajectory they just showed you how the thing would you know circulate around the moon and come back [noise] um\nNow let's go to Syracuse New York Hi Mark welcome to science friday Hi Hi go ahead\nA well I remember distinctly watching learning as an eleven year old and uh\nI think so excited and yet we have watched that dilemma touchdown and been in the morning like one in the morning the space walk as I recall was moved up a a a good number of hours\nSo it it uh I uh I remember waking up I ate a one year old sister so hot in the middle of the TV on my head but what they were able to have grabbing like the rest of their life actually watching it but I I was wondering missing from the movie was a\nWhole show a a reason why a lot of course not so much I mean that I Will get some inside of a deal on strong emotions on\n... I'm On a flight of this is science friday from WNYC Studios\nAnd the reaction\nOf asked the I'm a yeah from what I remember the moonwalk was pushed ahead 'cause the guys didn't want to wait yeah but this was a small operational decision but uh\nI don't think it has to do with any kind of particular emotional issue that just moved there were there at let's get this yeah that's good I think they were supposed to take a nap if I if I remember correctly you know I went to sleep\nOn the moon [laughter] well you're on your own here all my guess space there are some kinds and um what did you feel like to see that representation of the landing from the astronaut ... when you go you go to you\nFor hours on the other may see it was so funny I was like I knew I knew he was going to land we all know [laughter] but for some reason I was just like oh gosh are they going to make [laughter] I\nWas nervous I said yeah you know I ... I mean you know this is going to have him but you it was brilliantly portrayed I thought a really wonderfully done or you got a sense of what was happening um through all the jargon and why Armstrong moved ahead from the creator and what do you have to do ...\nI think it was a fairly accurate portrayal my understanding is there was somewhere between ten and twenty seconds worth of propellant left on the vehicle and they actually touched down so I'm sure they were on the edge of the seat after they were doing it um that are standing there weren't a seat but uh it was very well portrayed that that was very high risk maneuver that Neal is executing\nYeah or if I remember correctly and falling all over all the years it was there was chaos going on back [laughter]\nUm which I think will you didn't see as much of because you were in the capsule that much time watching but the the coolness of Neil Armstrong during this whole thing you know hand guiding this down and you see the the fuel ticking down and he's not\nPanicking and he's there he's finding his mind and he puts it down\nI mean it was it was they they captured that very well it was absolutely\nYeah I agree and and then the the first step off the famous one small step now he ... he did not say one small step for a man he said one small step for man you know isn't there has there been some controversy about what he really said\nAs of yet I mean for years yeah but I think we can say that uh you know I think that sentiment is more important than the proposition but yet we're not sure exactly what what he said I didn't say because there were ...\nI think he said at some point after that he's a he was a man yeah that was that was the intention was his pension and we look back at the space race this time when the nation and for the Apollo a landing the world\nWas in Ninety One vision I remember all around they show this in the film I cannot remember another moment since then with the whole world was watching one event\nTogether and it was the sort of a unifying experience I said yeah I absolutely I think people forget that they were actually you know a lot of Americans who might we're not as enthusiastic about the space program in the sixties but I think that one moment in July sixty nine\nI think there was some kind of a cultural consensus yeah\nAnd this was one year after what I consider the most terrible year Nineteen sixty eight I ever have lived through so and then there was to have this kind of event at where everybody was sitting United together because the country was so divided over the war and feels a little bit like that now that's where the same feeling when to take a break and talk\nMore about a space travel and talked with him I guess hear about it maybe if he saw the movie please let us know when I'm ready for for seven to for eight to five five you can also tweet us at science friday we'll be right back after this break stay with us [noise]\nUm I replied oh this is

a a chief flooding technician and the local seven twenty eight so I kind of symbol on ABC accidently just driving around a lot in my car I got a little sick to listen to music and so I sort of spinning the dial and\nI think that the first show I might have heard is air talk ... me because the man is just on top of his game\nI don't think I can deal with the colors and the way that he does he just keeps the show moving and he keeps a conversational and\nHe's just a professional I started listening to KBC maybe five years ago\nIt's just become like a part of my morning routine I'm a creature of habit every morning I wake up turn on Cape BCC and listen to it for about an hour while I'm getting ready to get help me feel\nLike a part of the community actually if you spent a lot of time in your car in Los Angeles you know it's not like Chicago with public transit here not around people as much so it's nice to hear local issues looked\nPolitics all those sorts of things to become a sustaining member go to Kay BCC dot org and thank you [noise]\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we're talking about Neal Armstrong as portrayed in the new movie first man from the personal hardships the astronaut over came to the jarring dizzying process of astronaut training to have that story led to all the missions and since that unforgettable July night of Nineteen sixty nine\nAre my guests are marrying Kramer science editor at a mashable ... human exploration mission analysis lead at NASA's\nJohnson Space center in Houston how's ... professor history professor studying space exploration Ford him his most recent book is beyond her the chronicle of these deep space\nExploration our number is eight for for seven to for eight to five five we have lots of tweets that came in a much see what we get sued just a few of them tweet from Glen who says\nNo one knows how much Russia pull up put the first spacecraft into orbit for the first human we did this knowledge come from having to really get us into the space race I asked you at the beginning of the hour to tell us\nWhat kind of film you would like to see that hasn't been made that I think that's his is an effort at explaining a film he would like to see much go to the phones for another suggestion let's go to Alan in Cleveland I alley welcome to science friday", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Science Friday",
