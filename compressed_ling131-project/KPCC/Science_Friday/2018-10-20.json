three hundred mammal species disappear but what's unique about this study is they tried to quantify how unique these animals were not just the numbers but like\nHow irreplaceable they are so as humid as mammal share a common ancestor they branched out on the tree of life and it turns out humans have been suffering entire limbs off of the tree and in aggregate we've cost nature about two point five billion years worth of genetic final genetic diversity as they call it\nDidn't give me an example of one of those branches that was over\nSure um had young writing in the Atlantic he gave the example of the pygmies law which is a trip threatened species or it branched off from it's common ancestor about nine thousand years ago which makes it a very young\nA species and so a kind of a small tweak on the tree but then there are animals like the ... which is the last survivor in its group and they branched off Seventy five million years ago so that means that if we were to lose those animals\nThat's a thing that would take you know millions of years to regenerate in terms of diversity\nI get it oh let's move on there's a there's an ongoing outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo report we reported on that back in August when it first began so give us an update in what the status as now will\nThe outbreak is still out going there have been two hundred and twenty three cases in one hundred and forty four deaths according to the world Health Organization's latest report\nOr they met this week to determine whether or not this counts as a global health emergency this is a declaration that would mobilized\nYou know more international resources but it also has sort of tradeoffs 'cause company or countries will respond to that by imposing travel restrictions and quarantines which can make it harder to get supplies and so\nHealth officials have to be kind of careful about making these kinds of declarations and they declined to make it a global health emergency they made it a regional emergency and what's scary and just kind of unnerving about this outbreak is that it's occurring in an active war zone\nOh that makes it a tougher to get in there and do something about it yeah there is there any reason for hope then\nYeah this is actually one of the first ah live trials of a vaccine we now have an effective Ebola vaccine\nBut of course the ongoing conflict in the uh north ... region of the Democratic Republic of Congo makes it harder to get health workers and health workers have been attacked in the past and then they had to ask be escorted by armed personnel which in turn breeds distrust among the locals\nAnd there's you know a limitation of how many resources that are going in and so rather than using a blanket vaccination strategy they're doing what's called ring vaccination is where they track infected individuals and then tried to vaccinate everybody around them the caretakers and family members to help sort of contained the virus in a more efficient way\nGreat stuff on there thanks for taking time to be with us today likewise thanks for having me mirror fun is a staff reporter for vox now it's time to check in on the state of science\nWWE really have a\nLocal stories of national significance one year after Hurricane Maria where Enrico is struggling to rebuild itself in nearly every way including a small farming sector\nReporter Bobby Baskin traveled to Puerto Rico nine months after the hurricane struck to see how farmers were recovering after the storm made working the land all by impossible and she joined us with that story now\nBobby Baskin as managing producer and reporter with living on earth welcome to science friday\nI think you you will go ... so what is it a local farming humidity like in Puerto Rico headed Hurricane Maria affected\nWell you know before that hurricane roughly eighty five percent of the food in Puerto Rico had to be important and that of course Mitt very expensive that twenty percent more expensive than down here in the U. S. and after the storm that never shut up to about Ninety five percent in Portage sued\nAnd the cops that they ... on that I think are most heavily damaged by things that made it to target for when you know ... things like that coffee mango oranges that sort of thing\nUm cops that could hide underground cell potatoes and cats they did fairly well but then you had the collapse of the infrastructure there so there were months and months without running water or electricity\nI went on a farm in the mountains where the roads were literally impossible for two months so people had to have supplies airlifted in by helicopter I'm One of the people that I met that was a small scale farmer named Jim ... Amano\nSo this was when she was Ninety percent of our farms destroyed but it was really like a hundred percent because with the hurricane and no one could come here to harvest\nWow so where do we stand now as\nAnd now I mean they're trying to recover back at you know Anthony ... and the government were slow to respond\nOh really volunteers start as us stepped in to fill in the gap\nWhen I was there there was a group of volunteers from an organization called el departmental Adele to me that's the food department\nAnd they organized volunteers just um they send a group of volunteers anywhere from you know half a dozen to twenty people will just descend on a farm for a week and they'll tent out you know the camp out in tents and they'll do anything to farmers and he doesn't do a fix fences plant crops we fix the roof\nAnd um it's that sort of a physical support that helps get a farm back up and running but the emotional support I think she was really\nA crucial to people and you know I did a a five part series on recovery uh on the island after the hurricane and I saw this over and over again you know the government didn't respond so people just you know neighbors and volunteers um you know turned to each other for help and um I think you're going to see more of that in the future\nWhy aren't there more local farmers in Puerto Rico that might help I have a large local food source of this type of disaster were to happen again\nYeah good question I mean it's a you know it's a tropical island plenty of sunshine and rain it it didn't make any sense to me to begin with either but\nUh you could really trace it back to a U.S policies on that specifically operation bootstrap\nWas initiated in the Nineteen forties and it was a series of tax incentives and access to us markets and things like that that discouraged a domestic agriculture in favor of tourism and industrial agriculture so growing things like um coffee and sugar cane that can be exploited for profit\nUh you know and that's fine and dandy but people can eat sugar cane and coffee for dinner or you do see some small farmers markets and things like that so they do exist but it's really a niche market right now\nHe gets a little bit of a lot changed potential that\nIt could happen if they had in mind the ... but um I think that people do ah understand um you know that they need more of that you know for months after the store and people are skipping meals and eating out of the ten can just do that by so\nThey're certainly acutely aware of how vulnerable the food system as there and I think I'm eager to do something\nProbably thank you for taking time to be with us today above you basket managing producer and a reporter with living on earth we're going to take a break and then look at the rising rate of C sections worldwide in here at home what other causes in the jumping the procedure\nDid you have one why did you have and what was your experience like can share with us on our phone number a four four seven to four to five we'll be right back after this break [noise]\nUm I replied oh this is science friday from WNYC Studios\nLie on Christie early host of life from\nHere [noise] you know they see this country has more divided than ever but there's one thing we can all agree on other people just a little bit of meddling oh you'll join us for a glorious evening a musical comedy that just might bring us a little closer together during the Saturday for a live broadcast from a Fitzgerald Theater in Saint Paul Minnesota with again foresaw\nThe Warren treaty Mr Gabriel ...

friday I'm Ira Flatow for anyone having a baby the decision to have a C section is not unusual but what is unusual is the number of the sections happening all over the world listen to this worldwide rate has nearly doubled from twelve to Twenty one percent\nIn the past Fifteen Years and in the United states one out of three per used by C section now a series of studies in the journal the Lancet looked at this trend to see what is behind is up to what are the effects on mothers in babies\nAnd what interventions can be done to decrease that number and that's what we're going to be talking about C section rates globally also what's happening here in the U.S and my question for your listeners is did you or your partner to get a C. section\nWhat factored into that decision what was your experience like you can phone it in or you can tweet us our phone number\nA four four seven to for eight to five five you can tweet us ... let me introduce my guest Holly Kennedy's and author author on that lasted series is also professor of midwife midwifery\nAt the Yale School of nursing\nThe other thing that's very interesting about V. back is that in units in hospital units labor and delivery unit\nWhere have you back as embraced where ... birth is something that devalued it turns out that the primary says there and delivery rate which has no direct relationship to be back up because these are women who are having their first baby and by definition V. backs are not your first baby\nThose unit to have higher V. back rates of even trying to have the facts and supporting women and having ... have lower primary says area and delivery rates\nIt really speaks to this idea of the culture of the unit and really valuing the safety of actual delivery\nSo lots of lots of callers hateful for seven to four to five five let me get to some of the tweets 'cause we have never had so many trees before I let me choose out some interesting ones are are calling rights are three ... three kids the first was an emergency one but my concern now\nOr is that my children did not receive the bacteria from the birth canal and I'm seeing possibly week microbiomes affecting their digestive health a highly Tony what do you think about that [noise]\nYou know as Tony was uh talking about the culture the unit in the back I think the the additional things that are really important for families to know when they're trying to make a decision is is the\nThe value of spontaneous labor and there's there's Nerove physiology that I'm prepares the baby to be born actually um\nContributes to health later in life but that based on population based studies and the the travel up the babies through the debt to through the birth canal does see the baby with microbiomes so\nUm she's right that that that does contribute to long term health I mean I I'm ... ... it's it's a\nUm been worked on we've looked at different things to do to sort of do that with the baby after as you see a C. section but if you can do it just on naturally that that is better\nThe other thing is that babies born by C section tend to have more respiratory distress and particularly if\nAnd have spontaneous labor so there's something about that spontaneous labor that contributes to the nerve and physiology and the health the baby\nI'm Ira Flatow this is science friday from WNYC Studios are so many questions let's go back to the phones to Wendy in Portland, Oregon Hi Wendy\nHi thanks for taking my call so I'm actually an obstetrician\nGynecologist but I I'm working just in a hospital so I'm an obstetrics hospitalized and one of the things that I Do is I just stay in the hospital to manage labor patience [noise] um so I think one of the ways the country\nIs we're finding is that um my type of job is becoming more and more popular so that um there are just physicians that are managing labor and hopefully are allowing the facts and allowing patients to labor as long as possibly safe\nUm I'm from Portland, Oregon and we have the second highest rate of attempted out of hospital birth and we have really the best um data from our birth certificates looking at\nTransport back into the hospital and I guess not my concern is that when I hear you know the\nUh when I hear people talking of the the ... you know very important things that result from from having labor\nI have seen some attempts at labor that really should have never been there and have really resulted in some catastrophic outcomes for both mom and baby\nSo I I ... I Love I think they're great um but I think there are some moms and some babies that needs needs the sections and we need to support that as well\nAnd you know really provide provide it when it's necessary undergoing\nReaction when spring rolls just\nI couldn't agree more Syrian delivery is a life saving procedure and there are certainly a many women\nWho should not undergo a badge and all delivery uh there's a number of different conditions that make that unsafe\nThe uh the important thing I think um to keep in mind is also that ah regarding the example of home births in United States and sort of that being an extension of the health care system and promoting ... birth I'm\nWell home birth in many countries are is a safe option and as a way to promote ...\nWe haven't quite figured that out in the United states or it is important in a health care system that promotes home birth to be able to make a really clear connection between home and hospital\nAnd win a certain threshold or reached than a patient needs to be moved from home to a hospital that's the part that we haven't quite figured out here yet I'm and until we figure that out I think it's it's going to be challenging to really embrace that as an option to promote factional birth\nWe can try to mimic that as best as we can on in the hospital setting and certainly have patients stay at home on for as long as it's reasonable um but home birth is not yet something in the United states that we have a really great system um to some\n... let me you were going to have to take a break lots more questions we're going to spend the other good ten minutes on this so we're going to talk with Kelly Kennedy and also Tony Golan or number for for seven to four to five five stay with us we'll be right back after this break [noise]\nMy rough later this is science friday from WNYC Studios\nScience friday is supported by target presenting future at heart a pod cast on change makers and the projects their championing in communities nationwide future at heart\nAvailable on apple pie calf or wherever pond caster found\nAnd by twenty three and me a personal genetic service designed to help people understand their DNA learn more at twenty three and me dot com slash WNYC\nScience friday is supported by legal zoom dot com offering a network of independent attorneys in tax professionals who can provide the advice needed to get through the daily grind owning a business more at legal zoom dot com slash friday and from the Gordon and Betty Moore foundation more information at more dot org\n\nMy name is Julie ... and I live in harbor city in Los Angeles I'm a big key PCC supporter because I Love the quality programming whether it's about Los Angeles or about our nation or the world I rely on their high quality journalism\nEspecially in times like these I loved that key PCC reports on issues that really affect our public\nSphere and cater to the interests of the public in college students like me whenever I'm away at college I tune into key PCC to feel connected to Los Angeles and not just the Los Angeles not shown in Hollywood but the Los Angeles of immigrants like my parents on my way to work I tuned in to take to with\nA March Madness and on my way back home I Do international\nNews at all things considered I really hope that keep the seat continue this amazing programming in the future joined me by becoming a member a key PCC dot org think you\nKnow\nThese these these supporters include the LA film celebrating its one hundred season with Milky rice and Mahler principle guest conductor Susana ... leads the Los Angeles philharmonic in the premier of the word race composed for its centennial followed by the epic emotional landscape of Mahler\nSymphony November first through force at Walt Disney concert hall tickets and mentally filled dot com [noise]\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we've been talking this hour about the increasing the number of C sections and what that means for women's health\nI guess or doctor highly Kennedy professor of mid were free of the Yale School of nursing the Tony goal and vice chair of quality in a department of of obstetrics and gynecology at the famous for Israel Deaconess Medical center\nIn Boston and lots lots of folks on on the line and let's see we only uh\nGosh can get there but let me ask you how you you worked in research midwifery in the u._k. how does the approach here compared to what we do here in the U.S [noise]\nLive in it differs in several ways and actually when the land this Lancet series on C. section came out the W. World Health organization also issued new guidelines to help help us look at decreasing says Erin's and\nAnd one of the things that they have recommended is what the UK does which is to have a collaborative midwife obstetrician model of care where the midwife\nDoes most of the primary care and that's what happens in the u._k. all women have a midwife and some women have an obstetrician too when it's when it's really needed\nOkay [laughter] [noise] [noise]\nOh yeah it wasn't my proudest [laughter] ah not advantage I had a little that was me I like that in my defense\nThis this turtle was very early and frightening looking massive\nClaws we actually got a clip of of the sound of the clause scratching the floor\n[noise]\nAnd if that's not enough ... this this is a ... wow what it's bigger than you are not the one I picked up [laughter] I don't know it's a huge\nScary looking through what was ... why would he studying\nThese ... so this is where the feud part comes in in the turtle feud I'm Travis and a few other scientists for years they were trying to show that alligator snapping turtles were not just one species like we thought before but a few separate species that be lumped together\nAnd just when they're ready to publish in twenty Thirteen are just they're when they're about to announce these new species\nThey find that they've been scooped someone else has beat them to the punch\nI'm Ira Flatow this is science friday from WNYC studio just as we were\nGetting around\nHere with an electorate that now okay so see being scoop that sounds like a tough\nBreak it is a tough and that in itself would not be a story this is something that happens all the time unfortunately scientists and to journalists but this was a little weird or a the paper that scoop them\nIt it didn't have a method section or results section of the kind of thing usually see in a science paper which meant it didn't describe you know any new scientific evidence\nAnd midway through this paper it hit the pause on the whole turtle question entrance its attention to local politics in Australia which is not what you normally see in a taxonomy paper\nI'm Still trying to take a look at who who wrote this very odd paper\nAnd it's somebody that he's never heard of his name is Raymond hose or re\nAnd Travis may not have heard of ramen has there but other her pathologist who are people who study reptiles and amphibians they definitely have the ... because he has a bit of a reputation he calls himself the snake man that's a nickname he's given to them self and he's actually trademarked debt so you know that is yeah yeah\nAnd he's got a big personality this is a clip from his YouTube channel\nLike men here with more like you just like in my head and a ... foot [noise] story she should know she is not a ... story [laughter] yeah\nThat's the snake man may mean those are and he's published hundreds of papers naming over a thousand types of animals lizard snakes the occasional turtle um but a lot of scientists say he's turning out a lot of quantity but not so much ... so that he's flooding their field with these animal names based kind of on slippery like sloppy science\nSo how's able to name a species without good science backing it up\nFor this surprising a it turns out that ... they had this big rule book for naming animals but the main role as he pretty much have to yelled Dems ah it it doesn't matter if you got any science to back up your new animal declaration you just need to publish first you can even self publish if you want\nAnd so that's kinda what this episode is about in part is how scientists got into this mess\nAnd it's also of course about what happens with Travis and snake man we we went looking for the snake man here and the you know the story got more complicated than we first thought it would be that makes a good story it's a real story oh yeah I I went back and forth on anyway\nBut he went out here in season two it was just the scariest once you've had the effect\nWas it the scares you do have some life and death ah yeah but the stakes were not quite as high as in some other episodes but we definitely got their puts where we

were really kind of into ham radio too you know how to put everything yeah hands on the ... members [noise]\nThree three people driving for that but you\nKnow I I I'm going to hang out with you guys afterwards [noise] so but he made this pocket radio this isn't the actual radio but I I used this or to demo because it's a\nIt won't run out of battery wind wind wind up radio and you have a little more you kind of have on and off here\n[noise] [noise]\nSo I mean cool machine right there I was never for you don't need fancy instrument and\nThen this a microphone that you might just find a at\nThrift store right or a microphone along battery operated an amplifier and\nGreat melodies with feedback and Jimi Hendrix was famous for feedback regular\nSecond Herman sibling\nYeah my my binary on and off as the switch here [laughter]\nThat's cool that's cool that's really cool [noise] at question from the audience on this side [noise]\nI Know I tell you act\nWill tell you the kid that's the best questions so the question is how does the beat no like it has a brain right ooh\nHow does how does it control how you react\nTo it you know Dr mode which say that all of the machines that he created were his friends and it had kind of its own life and when you interacted with it you were kind of like with your friend\nAnd the uh the energy that you were putting into it was coming directly back to you that that's a really cool question\nI'm not sure that's an eternal question I say I'm gonna have to put that in my book okay let's see if you want to play the beat machine later I asked you that's a good idea\nYeah I understand that question but thank you so much first of all for your appreciation of sound in your ... to play with music really pay shed back here\nUm [noise]\nWhat is your parents and our interests in mind these kinds of things to therapy um especially as that goes for his head and chronically traumatized industries\nAbsolutely that's a great question I have an amazing answer for that\nOne of my music heroes was Harold roads it's a famous keyboard the roads piano before it became a fender roads Harold roads invented that electric piano to do therapy for the soldiers after the war\nHe was doing piano therapy at his home and then he realized it would be easier to put a some kind of keyboard in his truck and take it to the person's home or wherever they were and that's how he invented this electric keyboard\nAnd this would be an amazing thing to actually kind of reinstate\nOccasionally I find a broken keyboard a store and buy it and I have a dozen or so just waiting in the wings to give to people I Do I give them to people and I see somebody who is kind of wandering I Would just give them a keyboard to try to mess around with this thing\nThat's great and I'm just so great to have a geek like yourself you just go on the program I you know I'm usually the lonely geek but I'm very happy to have you on stage of the money market musician ultimate geek maker based in Los Angeles thank you so much\nFor joining [noise]\nAfter\nThe break the social lives of these answers\nHuddle and stop moving for a little bit and we'll just a measure how long it takes them to recover from this\nAnd so the ones that recover very quickly we consider as both individuals the one that takes a long time of the ten minutes we consider shy and it turns out that if you look in the colony I'm most individuals are shy but there's a few individuals that are very bold\nAnd so it turns out that these individuals have a disproportionate influence on what the group does as a whole\nSo we can take a group of shy individuals and we can test how quickly they attack pray\nAnd attacking pray ... the way we measure it is basically put a little piece of a paper and they are capture with and we vibrate and so they think it's a and then that caught got caught in it and so they'll succumbing to it and we count how many spiders some of it and how quickly they do this\nAnd so give us all shy will take a long time they won't send as many individuals but as soon as he put just one vote individual in the group also send there'll be much more responsive to this\nPrey is there such a thing as an alpha spider you know so we called them Keystone individually route that really called him because they have a disproportionate influence on the behavior of the group well let's go over to a question overhear yes\nI'm back in the beginning I heard you talking about feeding lard that anything you want in the future and seeing what qualities makes ... what would you do a few hypothetically sounds like a food made a queen I think\nWhat we want to do first is to really show in an experiment that something is triggering a larva to become a clean you really need to do experiments\nWhere you can take it out and separated from everything else and just feed it to a larva and showed it becomes a clean the first of all we want to be able to do that and then we imagine a possible scenario where we can create queens on her own in the lab\nAnd one of the problems with bumblebees is that we really only intensively manage one species here in the U.S for pollination by told you at fifty feces so\nWe would be more sustainable potentially if\nWe weren't moving the same species of bomb will be all over the u._s. for pollination so it'd be great if we could ... new species but one of the limitations of that it's hard for some species that you ... in the lab to make queens and so if we know how it works and we could control it\nMaybe we could develop new species for for pollination that are locals are not shipping them around and things like that\nI'm Ira Flatow this is science friday from WNYC Studios is it true that you want to build a boxing Roebuck\nWe do what is that far from movies you know I think it's so incredible they feed one another and so and the behavior is really interesting is very sort of intimate and social but if we want to study what it is in a few that influences development I we need a system\nDeveloped where a B isn't delivering the food we need to be able to deliver the food\nAnd so the robot that we're trying to develop as something that would actually when I must have like a little arm I meant it could move around and it could just spent little bits of food to larvae\nTo bury them outside of the nest in vitro if we had a system like that we could do things like test um in in with large sample sizes how toxic certain pesticides are\nAt war how certain types of plant pollens impact that the growth and health of bumble bee larvae so there are a lot of questions we can't answer right now because you don't have a a nice sort of standardized delivery system\nInteresting for him and just just to wrap up do what's the practical use of understanding insect for he would help us understand something ... better\nRates so one of the lines of research that I've in my life has been proceeding recently is looking how um the architecture of the nest influences the way that in the dance behave collectively and so\nOne of the things we find is that you know the way that the chamber's are organizing the tunnels organized actually influences how they forage and they're forging behavior and\nI'm a recently I Am collaborated with some architects and social scientists who are also interested in this these ideas of how the built environment um influences teamwork in how humans work together\nUm and so it's interesting even though as we said earlier humans and ants have very different perceptions of the world and that was the answer you know they live in these dark environments and don't see much and humans are very attuned to light there are some similarities that we can draw between those and\nAnd and system is a system where you can manipulate things and it just and and you can move and from one structure to another which is more difficult to do with people and so\nPotentially by using this more simple system you can um learn things about maybe how to design robots to work together and how to St spaces for people to build better team work and\nSo on are we'll we'll stay tuned the what happens follows water is an associate professor at UC Riverside and Noah ... is an associate professor at UCLA\nThank you thank you both for joining us today and we
