about ... playing going oh it's going very well thank you very much we love to have you with a really fun it was but\nUm you know you looked around and and thought we all need a better understanding of how logic works well what what on earth made you think of that yeah\n[laughter] well I have to give credit to my students at the schools the audience that you just should call the because I learned so much from them and when teaching goes well it's a two way process\nAnd my students have pushed me to think about it is a social justice because they care about those questions so much and if you can find what you will students care about and talking to that then you can teach them so much better\nThrough things that are already motivating to them and so I gradually found more and more ways to think about mathematics by asking questions about social justice and then the rebels happened as well what I understood a lot more about these questions by using a mathematical framework\nI my students was so a helpful and doing that I learned so much and so while I really should share this with the rest of the world and that's how this book came up about well\n... well being of eight hundred pound gorilla in the room at least for me is is because we we argue all the time here what is the point of arguing logically if people are bringing emotions to the table and don't really care about the facts and and now we we can't even agree with the facts are don't don't you need to agree on something to be able to argue logically\nIt's a very good question and it can sometimes seem very few tile at the moment as if maybe we're just doomed to take sides and the trouble is that if we think we're doomed to take sides then we will be ... very self fulfilling prophecy whereas\nI have found ways to understand what other people often king from that point of view and to find ways of bridging the gap to show that we're not actually on completely different planet it's not black and white it's usually\nThat that some kind of gray area in between and if I can find that we're both on the same gray area just in different places and it's much easier to think about sliding around it\nThan to think about flipping an entire coin onto the other side\nThis is science friday from WNYC Studios and my ... talking with Dr Eugene Chang author of the art of ... of logic in an illogical world um [noise] so\nThe first things you acknowledged that the real world is actually a logical [laughter] but we had a lot of use but we get we can get a lot of useful work done in the abstract\nWorld yes we can find the logic inside situations even if the whole situation isn't completely no Jekyll and the discipline of mathematics begins with obstruction well you shave away some of the details on completely relevant to the situation to find out what's really going on at route\nAnd when you go to the root it's that that you look at the logic\nAnd when you shave away those details you find that a lot of different situations become the same route and that gives you a way of connecting different situations I'm tapping into some understanding that you've achieved elsewhere and making connections between things but\nI I think that the shape that shaving away process [noise] excuse me is probably one of the most difficult parts\n[noise] it might be quite difficult and it's one of the things that is off putting about mathematics people often say to me I was finally math until the numbers became lapses\nAnd somehow that's a scary step but actually numbers are already obstructions federal ready things where we shaved away the details\nThat two cookies and sue apple well if you ignore the fact that that cookies and Apple's then you've got the concept is too and we can do this with arguments in real life as well where we can shave away details and discover\nThat arguments about say voter suppression have something in common with all these about ... minutes about cancer screening and arguments about accusations of sexual harassment for example because they're all about what do we care about false positives more awful negatives mall\nAnd then we can see that those arguments come up and questions about social services any questions about who should go to university and those questions all over the place\n... what are some of the most common ways that you see people being illogical when the orange\nOne of the basic ones is when they simply use the wrong definitions right to stop and this is one of the key ways in which we might think that people are using the wrong facts\nAnd so for example I've seen arguments on the Internet\nGoodness me there are some bad arguments on the Internet we have a I seen arguments on the Internet where people say things like they they believe that all immigrants are illegal and that is correct or they they they support the Affordable CARE Act but not Obamacare\nAnd they've got the wrong definition of Obamacare in that case or that was a study a survey of undergraduate male students that showed that many of them said that they would have known consensual sex if they thought they could get away with it but they would definitely not commit rape\nWhich means they build their own definition of rape\nSo we have to agree on terms\nBut we do and that's something that mathematicians have I capital about agreeing on terms right at the beginning\nSo then another very common era that people make\nIs when they make a false equivalence between one argument on another argument on this often happens\nIn what's called a strongman arguments with my preferred to ... because I didn't like gender and things aren't necessarily but if you make an argument that seems quite reasonable to you sometimes somebody will replace it with a much more extreme arguments\nAnd believe that that's what you were trying to say and then they'll knock it down because the extreme argument is much easier to knock down\nAnd that can be very aggravating because that essentially painting you in a very bad light and then taking a moral high ground\nI Know that argument well talking with Dr Eugene Chang author of

political races Ken we have better conversations about the issues that get us most emotional talking about how a better understanding of logic\nLogic can help us talk and listen and maybe start to bridge some of those divides or at least understand why we're disagreeing so passionately\nOur guest is Dr Eugene Chang mathematician a scientist in residence at the school of the art Institute of Chicago her newest book is the art of logic in India logical world and\nWe want to hear from you as anyone's logic ever change your mind about something some some listeners phoning in and first one Alex's from Chicago hey along a neighbor\n[noise] neither do I do OB\nGYN previously identified myself as a an aspiring feminist um and I had done so because my logic was that I really couldn't fully empathize with some of the issues that women it's I'm at the mail um and I was met with that logic from a a coworker of mine who um had\nSaid you know out as a black male you know you might be doing things that contribute to a white supremacist system that you might you sold knowingly knowingly\nIf anyone tells you that you'll being too emotional and that that means you're not being logical that that just isn't true that doesn't have to be true anyway so what I say that yes it is very difficult to find the logic in a situation when you're feeling very strong emotions\nAnd that's where I feel that the mathematical discipline of abstraction really helps me because it means that I can look at a chain of logic\nAnd separate that out from the emotion so I'm not saying I shouldn't feel emotions but I put the emotions in a kind of different\nCompartments and think about the chain of logical steps and this helps me to understand another person's point of view even if I disagree with them very very viscerally and I'm very upset about that position if I ... from that I look at that chain of logic step by step\nThen I don't have to feel what they are feeling but I can see the logic that they are using and those two things can be separate but then I can I can actually use the logic to be able to understand that point of view despite my emotional disagreements\nThis is science friday from WNYC radio\nI'm Ira Flatow talking with Eugene Chang author of the art of logic in India logical world I think you know that is one of the hardest things to do these days is to just count to ten [noise]\nYeah that's a very important aspect of it because logic is a slow process and it doesn't happen in the formats that is very popular in the current modern world which consists of a Mike drop or a one line of or some kind of mean that doesn't have very many words in it or two hundred and eight to ... to tweet\nLogic takes longer than that and I wish that we could all take time to slow down our arguments so that we have time to explore the logic and build the logic\nMhm so you it's almost like mindful of you know you have to find a way to catch yourself yeah in a moment it's\nYes it is a lot like that and I think that that kind of mindfulness can help us understand the logic inside our own emotions because our emotions are all coming from somewhere that is something that is causing them and I honestly believe that when I see somebody who is feeling something emotional about something very differently from me\nIf I Do that mindfulness for them even if they are unable to do it for themselves\nThen I can start to understand what that basic belief is\nFrom which all of this is standing and maybe I can see how that basic belief is different from my basic belief and that's why we're different we think different things not because we are logic is different but because of starting points to a different\nWay of about a minute or so left I Want to I wanted to ask you about something you write a great deal about the logic of privilege relating especially to race and gender is that an area especially right for a logical treatment\nYes the arguments are um I get very vehemence and some people get very upset about the whole question of privilege and identity politics and I think it's important for us to understand everyone's points of view\nAnd often it's a misunderstanding about what privilege means because for example white privilege does not mean that all white people are better off than all non white people\nIt means that any white puff and if they had all the same packed with sticks and the exact same life except that they were black as well we would expect them to be with us in society and so some white people get upset because they say things like\nBut I I grew up poor and I had to work really hard so that means that I didn't have white privilege and we need to acknowledge the fact that indeed that all white people who are really struggling and we shouldn't let our discussion of privilege\nIt raised that fact that they're all white people are struggling because if we're raised that fact then they get angry and feel that they have been disenfranchised and that they have no voice but we need to understand that if they were black than they would have an even worse time and that's what the logic and the structure of privileges really about\nDr Chang thank you for joining us again as always a pleasure to have you and thanks I'm Out of luck with the book Eugene Chang mathematicians scientists in residence at the

good at engineering the bacteria and fun guy that are in these developmental chambers I'm In ways that we are hypothesize are good for the developing Beatles\nWhat ... is it healthy or did they give them nutrients in in in the wrong I mean that's they produce the stuff that they the dung beetles eat\nPossibly um so what we think is happening is that you know some some bacteria are bad for beetles but some are good and the sense that they have this\nUm arsenal of metabolism that is um could be useful and breaking down plant material and plant material is not\nParticularly easy diet for any organism to eat but bacteria are really good at breaking down plant material and so the Beatles secondarily benefit from that because I'm the beneficial bacteria are breaking down to the plant material that then the beetle can feed on\n[noise] I'm not old song beetles happening but those were\nNot all species have them um from what from our own studies we found that um some species have them some species don't have them uh the species that have them have them at different levels in different populations so I'm the incidence a\nPopulation that I found in North Carolina the Beatles their ... many more of them have these worms than for instance the Beatles in Indiana\n[noise] people can get worms I re looked in where he wants to help people\nI'm not personally but there's actually I'm a lot of really exciting science that's coming out about how the worms do benefit people I'm so they've been finding that in many cases because\nI'm obviously worms have some bad effects on people as well but in cases where they're not killing people and people are actually tolerating worms um\nThose populations tend to have a lower incidence of autoimmune diseases\nAnd they're actually starting to suss out the mechanisms behind this in order to not be adjusted from humans worms have evolved a way to suppress our immune systems\nAnd so people who are predisposed to having an auto immune disorders like multiple sclerosis or Crohn's disease or type one diabetes\nI'm actually benefit from the suppression of their immune system so\nSo in other words people in societies where people have these parasites in their system are are getting less sick from these other diseases that is correct that so we're not saying go out and get a\nNo no so definitely these words also have bad effects too um but with scientists have been trying to do is find certain chemicals or proteins that the worms are are providing to these these host to suppress their immune systems and just give patients those chemicals or proteins instead of the whole\nWhere did the did you always have this interest [laughter]\n... or follow them as a kid you know on the ground\nI kind of follow all organisms that I can find a catcher see 'em and it wasn't until I I started talking to my ... friends that I realized these organisms that are a little harder to see 'em are actually really interesting and can be found all over the place\nAnd we're just starting to scratch the surface of why they're important to\nHuman health and an ecology in general so where do you go with your research firm here [noise]\nUm that's a great question we um are definitely in the process of finding how widespread I'm this phenomena is by looking at other a species of insects\nBut likewise we were really interested in how their engineering the microbiology and whether it's because they're\nEating certain bacteria allowing other bacteria to grow or if they're emitting chemicals that suppress the growth of certain bad bacteria or enhance the growth of good bacteria on that is a little bit of a black box\nThat we don't really understand yet so we wish you good luck well thank you I Know and you know do you have a lab but full of dung beetles swimming [laughter]\nThey're ah they're very surprisingly easy to keep 'em\nYou're recommending weird home 'cause we've got so many people listening to go out and get some done you know for sure if your\nIf there is a farm nearby um you probably can find a jungle if you're willing to sift through a little bit of ...\n[noise] I Can't top that for an ending [laughter] 'cause we have\nDone a show on dung beetles we have a far away from video up on our website so or we're very happy to talk about dung beetles or maybe they are fascinating creatures right yeah\nI they are incredibly diverse and it's amazing I think\nWell we think your research is amazing to Christina would've done rented system research scientist in the department\nOf biology at Indiana University in Bloomington every weekend thank you won't go and take a break we're going to come back and talk about the search for a distinct moon on an exoplanet so there's some interesting new findings that your space geek who really like someone will get into the weeds on stay with us we'll be right back after this break [noise]\nOn my roof later this is science friday from WNYC Studios\nWhen big news is breaking I understand and appreciate the importance of you're hearing from me directly about what happened to me\nYou're coordinated well funded

dot com slash poisons quieter they're always so great to have you join us\nThanks so much Ira it's great to be here to have you did and it's not a book club this time it's the talk about a new book um [noise] you worry involving poison all the time I I Want to get all your latest books have been about poisoning what what's the what is the fascination with that\nWell I Know it makes me sound a little creepy but I really am fascinated by an often love poisons actually they're fast in these they've just got such an interesting dynamic chemistry if you think about the world we live in where we\nAre constantly inhaling or drinking or eating chemicals are exposed to the most of them do not do us any harm so the ones that do\nAre are very clever and very devious and very interesting to me and I think I'm just kind of hooked on chasing them down and figuring out how they were\nComing letter audience every night for four Seventy four to five five eight four four seven to for me to five five if you'd like to cost you can also tweet us at science friday I'm let's talk about why only\nHe was appointed to the chief of the bureau of chemistry and Eighteen eighty three this was the industrial revolution right can you give us an overview of what was happening then and what food processing was like back then\nYeah and that was one of the things that was really startling to me when I started doing research on the book is that I think\nI'd had this very romantic everyone was pink cheat didn't happy and you know eating fresh smell good wonderful produce at\nIn the nineteenth century and the more I looked the more I realize that was completely not true and you really have two things going on you have as you say the rise of the industrial revolution and\nWith an enormous tidal wave of industrial chemistry all kinds of new and create of different compounds that you can add into food and drink and just about anything\nAnd then you also have\nThis amazing wild west of food and drink because there's no regulation and no requirement to label and it's in that period that you see really food fake curry and fraud and the\nKind of profit use of really dangerous compounds uh be permissible and so businesses who are cutting corners are trying to make a little extra money as you say would put all kinds of\nReally odd unexpected things into food but they just didn't have to tell you and that's where ... came in\nOn my roof later this is science friday from WNYC Studios talking with Deborah Blum author of the new book the poison squads okay so why only comes in and what does he do\nWell as you say there's no consumer protection legislation whatsoever at the federal level and there is no FDA\nSo this tiny laboratory of USDA the bureau of chemistry is actually the only laboratory in the United states government that's assigned to look at food safety in food quality and Wylie had come from Indiana and he was the first professor of chemistry at Purdue\nWas a real sense of mission about\nThe integrity of food and drink kids studied fake county in Indiana at honey that he said had never even seen you know be fly over after I had a nice way with words and and and so this was you know corn syrup died yellow with the little fake honeycomb crumble into it\nAnd he brought that kind of sense of outrage is very\nMoral about science that had to be science in the service of good and so when he came to the federal government\nHe just started that laboratory on investigating food it was the first time the government had done that\nAnd he starts piling up these investigations of dairy products so canned vegetables those spices and cocoa and coffee and when you read them they're called bulletin Thirteen\nThat they're really of food and drink horror story and they horrified consumers when they saw them but they really horrified businesses\nBecause let's say for people to do this without anyone knowing and now you have a trouble maker in the government\nOr this is also the era of what a Upton Sinclair is famous for jungle than regular about the same time\nThat's exactly right so there's the title of my book is the poison squad and it's really about this very wild experiment that widely did in the early twentieth century\nAnd what you get so frustrated about the lack of regulation\nThat he persuaded the government to less let him tests preservatives and other bad things on young government employees\nNow and that's a about a couple of years before\nUpton Sinclair writes a novel called the jungle that is about the way we produce meat yeah and and he was I think people forget it you know we think of the jungle as this incredibly influential novel but what made it so influential\nWas Upton Sinclair was also an investigative journalist he hung out with what\nTeddy Roosevelt used to call MK Rikers and so when he was working on that novel he didn't just invent food right I said\nHe went to Chicago and lived in the Chicago stockyards and because he was a writer and he was so poor literally the people running the companies could not tell him from they're underpaid workers seat was just a shabby and ready lucky and so have you ever had I had a\nChance to interrupt you because we have to take a break but I Want to come back and revisit\nUpton Sinclair and also widely in your book uh we're talking with Deborah Deborah Blum\nAuthor of

was so and after that ... while you're devoted to what I read it I Know why or why devote the tell our listeners an entire chapter I catch up [noise]\nSo this is it gets up it's just an amazing story
