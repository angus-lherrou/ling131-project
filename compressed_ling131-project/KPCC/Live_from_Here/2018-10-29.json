Mendez\nWeeks that's how long Carmen thought it would take for the island to recover enough to start thinking about the again\n\nAfter that first call I checked in with Carmen at least once a month and on each call she told me the same thing there was no word from the government about restarting Zika testing for pregnant women and\n\nSo in the spring of two thousand Eighteen six months after the hurricane I went back to Puerto Rico to find out what was going on\nThere was no she got the sting ever done seen September to south and seventeenth seem to hear it so we have no way of knowing if we are still having transmission are not\nDoctors could still draw blood to testify ... but there wasn't much point to it that's because they were being told the government health lab that performs the test was closed for business\nNot only that this is when officials announced the physique a crisis was over that there were no new cases of vinegar on the island it was like we had been swept away by the hurricane\nThe website of the has the firemen which by the way it's no longer there I check yesterday they do have said by mid website to see whether they had any seek us that these states nothing they have nothing there now it's only they all reports\nCarmen couldn't believe it the government was saying there were no new cases of the ... after the hurricane but Fifteen hundred pregnant women had been diagnosed earlier that same year\nDr she works with couldn't believe it either Dr Cynthia Garcia Cole is a clinical psychologist who spent Seventeen years teaching child development at Brown university\nI mean if you don't test for ... how are you going to know how many people are being infected\nBefore the storm Cynthia spent a year traveling to government health centers around the island gathering data ... babies after they were born the ones that government is following for three years do you feel like they're gonna have\nTo fire you\nOh boy a good one [noise] uh this point the program that I was part of monitoring the development of children\nBorn to\nSeek I expose pregnancies within the department of health we have been stopped\nCynthia tells me the government fired her and took all of the data she'd collected\nShe says they didn't give her a reason for letting her go\nAnd health department would tell us either\nAfter Cynthia stops working for the government she teamed up with Dr ... and they're monitoring children on their own without holding Cynthia is focusing on babies who were exposed to Zika\nBorn looking completely normal babies like Kimberly hanging\nOut okay you're emphasizing the typical oh yeah right so what we're doing here is the baby scale so painful development\nKimberly a seven month old and because today is actually her seven month birthday her grandmother do they're up in a fancy dress and a headband with one giant boat that seems to say I don't have hair but I Am a girl\nNamed Ben\n\n... looks like a kid herself exaggerating her expressions and practically climbing under the table it looks like she and Kimberly are playing\nBut everything Kimberly does how she reaches for the rental how she holds it the way she tries to square off the table it's all a test trying to answer one question is she able to do what's expected of a seven month old now for the most part yes but\nBut I noticed that you know there was a little ... here in terms of self regulation is what I just notice so far\nAs you've been monitoring faded to these asked what is you know just ... yeah\nThere's a very wide range some kids are doing really well and some kids are very compromise I'm noticing a lot of small motor Denise moving your hands\nThe lady ceding the lay walking\nThese kinds of exams are crucial because if a doctor notices that have babies motor skills aren't developing the way they should they can start therapies to help the baby\nStudies like this also help researchers understand how ... works yes they can cause massive problems like microcephaly but it can also cause more subtle neurological issues trouble swallowing walking seeing\nAnd I made that there hasn't been that many studies on this kid and the samples right now thinks that the publisher thirty kids you know forty kids ten\nAnd we have two hundred we have over two hundred so that's why we think this data is really important to publish but\nIt's not clear if this study will ever see the light of day the health department needs to authorize publication and so far it's refused to do so\nI told them that I've made in that we had I said I can really if you're being completely unethical those who were you talking to you and you said your officials from the department of health\nThat were in charge of this week a monitoring system have now I I've never seen politics getting involved on on research\nNo way that this looks like [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nI've wanted to understand the politics behind Z go ever since I started following it two years ago and I did everything I could think of to talk to someone from the health department at first I called [noise]\n[noise]\nI mean when I was at work I showed up at their offices again and again\nWe have the problem is I mean I've been to the office many times now in person and also called was ...\nFinally I tracked down the assistant secretary of health Dr Concepcion can notice long ago we meet in the hallway of the convention center where she's speaking at a press conference about a new lunch program\nAnd just like the doctor said she's quick to give me the government's official line ... that the crisis is over a so far\nWe are not defecting new cases\nA seat that on our faith epidemiology\nThey'll son expect\nTo have cases right\nI asked her why the health department had stopped testing pregnant women physique up this is what every doctor I spoke to told me she says that's not true that the health department is performing the tests and has been since just a few weeks after the hurricane\nGood morning him and help you\nAs the client talks on the phone hands scribbles on a yellow legal pad\nOkay when can you are coming in to do ... what are you\nHearing so nine PM\nI haven't been on this ... this even as late as something you know because they're not talking about the news anymore enemy is still going on\nHands than hearing from a lot of flood victims and decide wanting a place that won't flood again pretty much everyone who called or drops in has one request\nAnd I'm trying to be in a better area for myself for my kid or something like that one\nI have a Fifteen year old child\nLabor or like you know and I would have known as\nOne of those clients is a woman named Denise Taylor she's from Chicago and she reached out to him on line just a couple of months before the hurricane when she was thinking about leaving Denise did not feel safe in her old neighborhood and she wanted her daughter Christina to go to a better school\nTo meet kids from all kinds of backgrounds\nOn the west side of Chicago is just African Americans and Hispanics [noise] that's it and I try to explain that is not normal for the phenomenal what where can I take her to really see it\nLike most of ... clients Denise has something that's supposed to help her get what you are listening for what's called the housing choice voucher also known as the section eight voucher\nA government benefits to help low income people pay rent [noise] about twenty thousand families in the Houston area use these vouchers the program was designed to be this ticket to a better neighborhood\nMaybe a better life it's federal money you can use the voucher anywhere in the country\nOn the last day of July in twenty Seventeen Denise and Christie and I got into their fourth focus hatchback and drove from Chicago to Houston they hardly knew anyone there except ...\nSo I said well you come down you can stay with me why you decided on some\nSome of the world's going to do that I Know her from nobody she could have been killed but again you know say a little ... thing I got here you can have as close but he wasn't slogans blows you left me a key\nMy first day obscene was gone I woke up and that was like she just bust here and there was a key to stay at home\nIt didn't take long for Denise to find a job at a pharmaceutical plant packing and shipping\nBut just a few weeks after she moved in with him Harvey hit and then he says housing search suddenly got way tougher\nHarvey damaged more than forty percent of Houston houses and apartment buildings there was a lot more competition for what was left\nAnd the vouchers expire in as little as two months if you don't find a place in time so she had the phones [noise]\nMy name is Denise out of hiding a reference to your apartments you have ...\nThe nieces voucher would let her rent a two bedroom apartment costing up to fourteen hundred dollars a month with the government paying maybe half of that she found plenty of apartments within that price range and neighborhoods she liked\nAnd my next question is do you guys take the house and Joyce voucher so you do or you don't at all okay that's okay thank you [noise]\nDenise made dozens of calls like this everyone said no amongst after Harvey hit then two months Denise was still staying with him and apartment manager's we're still telling her no\nIn some parts of the u._s. it's illegal to reject or rent or just because they have a voucher it's considered discrimination that's not true in Texas though which are way more later\nIf if the grading and if you're not morally if you're not built up morally it can really put you on a you know a depressed kind of face like am I you know it'll make you put yourself in a category that you're not in\nOne out of every four families in Houston that receives a voucher never gets to use it that's according to the Houston housing authority Denise was worried she'd have to give her back\nWhy don't you say six to me what's wrong with extradite\nDenise thinks this isn't about her voucher she thinks it's because she's black like most voucher holders we ran the numbers and found that almost Ninety percent of families and the Houston area with vouchers are African American most of them live in areas with the city's highest poverty rate\nThe weight and he sees it she's deliberately being steered toward the poorest and most racially segregated neighborhoods [noise]\nLocal housing officials recognize that this was a problem and ... is actually one of the most\nSegregated cities in the country\nA few years ago the Houston housing authority tried to take a small step to address the issue\nIt didn't go well [noise]\nOfficials had this idea to build a mixed income apartment building in a wealthier part of town called the Galleria it's known for this giant glitzy mall with an ice skating rink some of the units in the building would have to accept vouchers getting poorer families access to better schools\nBut hundreds of angry used donations revolted here's voter fraud [noise]\n\nBack in twenty sixteen they showed up in force to a public meeting at the neighborhood elementary school it was standing room only lasted for hours\nAlmost all the people in the crowd were white they complained that the building was too expensive way overcrowded schools lower property values [noise]\nYou both for more [laughter]\nBut\n[noise]\nPeople isn't written comments to one person complained about what they called pollution an upscale neighborhoods with the poor\nOnly a few people spoke up in favor of the proposal\nIncluding a woman named ...\nMotion and this is the really zero G\n... black and she works for a housing advocacy group\nShe told the audience the people who want to live here are your janitors your ... your wait staff\nSo we just want to say\nBut then you're [noise]\n\n\nWhen this whole debate was going on Pamela banks was watching it unfold and thinking about her clients these apartments could have helped them\nIf they could move that neighborhood with a voucher they could get a leg up but the project was killed not long after that public hearing I called him recently and played or some of the tape\nThe part where the guy talks about compassion for people who need affordable housing but also about poison grapes Pam told me\nIt made her think about how after the hurricane people set up animal shelters on that side of town\nAnd the gallery you ... shows just can't be out there for you value your and your name [noise]\nThere's a reason pan is saying we and us here for her it's personal in her late twenties after she and her husband separated him landed in Houston as a single mom she applied for a section ... voucher and waited for seven years to get one\nWhen she finally got her voucher back in Nineteen Ninety seven Pam spent months searching for a place that would take it one day she came across this lifting a brick house with a fireplace in the suburbs in an area known for better schools so she drove out there to meet the landlord\nIt was raining I got out there and it was a young African American later they were going to be inducted she got out toward the house\nPam knew her odds had just gone down and was tempted to turn back but she decided to wait for the woman with a fancy car to leave she went to the door and introduce yourself to the landlord\n... and I have housing you know I Know you may or may not know about housing videos your type image but take this on for about a minute let me know if you want to work with me\nThe guy said okay you can rent this house and five years after pan and the kids moved in she bought her own house\n\nThis is why Pam does this work\nToday and why she's trying so hard for Denise in Cook County Illinois where Denise from rejecting someone just because they have the section ... voucher is considered discrimination and it's illegal\nIt's also a legal and a handful of states including Massachusetts Oregon and New Jersey\nA few years ago Austin, Texas passed an ordinance like this but a few months later the state legislature overturned it and lawmakers went even further they ban any other city in Texas from doing the same thing\nBasically Texas landlords are allowed to discriminate against people with section ... vouchers and they can't be punished for it [noise]\nIn Texas was one of the first states\nIn the country to pass a law like this and twenty Fifteen Indiana did to the same year the needs to know about the law when she moved here\nDoes your daughter she understand that some people don't take vouchers incentive where they take our church and she got that what she she ... to a certain extent\nBut I don't know how to understand uh [noise] uh [noise] the\nDiscrimination or part of it [noise]\nI don't want her to feel stereotype\nBecause of a voucher\nUm I guess the biggest thing would be basically everybody's connected I like to call it connective tissue\nIn my case in this area I'm sitting in right now which is white stock and I went to school with everyone here\nSo we're all connected by virtue of being I'll be honest African American and having the good old ... a church got whole family friends and just together\n... ... ... more than a month after the storm people there are still in the middle of clean up\nKim was away in Texas when the storm hit visiting family\nWas two weeks before she could even get to her house because all the rules were flooded she didn't know what to expect when she got home but she was looking for house sits on the hill\nBy Powell had been out for nine days so there was the ... food but to be totally honest nothing major was out of place it\nWhat about your immediate neighbors devastation she'll tenth of a mile from\nMy home just to test for houses so for two hours of work on ... and again I can stand in my yard and I could see those neighbors\nHead of the few\nIsn't it weird I felt extremely blast but then I said I I didn't question why I was blessed but I guess at that point it's like okay now it's time for me to do what I Need to do to help others I'm looking at their devastation what can I Do to help you\nAnd my church was actually okay so the thing that crosses my mind is okay we need to use our church as a distribution because people around me some access because there are two to three hour drive to get anything [laughter]\nSo what are we seeing right now what were you at right now what do you see\nWell right now I'm ... directly in front of the church and they had set up portable showers or the residents here so we've got a couple of male and female shower\nHot water set up um and that came up about three days ago\nTo what your average day like now that you're out here trying to that you're trying to spread the blessing around what's what's that average day like\nOkay [laughter] um last week has from friday morning the Saturday event idle foreign at twenty four miles on local my four hundred and twenty four and my car well\nI Am picking up I Am making arrangements for delivery\nI Am trying to figure out who can cook food I Am having the food people drop off at locations I Am unloading trailers I Am trying to get all trailers and um and I do have a nosy street\nI was surveilling the area for damages so that way I Know what's in the neighborhood that has any\nOne of the biggest needs right now is getting rid of all the breathe it's possible for loans in streets from homes that people now need to rebuild\nMainly all of this a sheet rock insulation I'm you have a free traders gas stove\nWhere the CNN now they can't get back into their homes where give us a pitcher you\nThey're staying with relatives they're staying in Roger ah I'll be totally honest I have them by Plant City people are living and pop yeah like if you went camping\nAnd what has FEMA's reaction been to St Louis because it sounds to me like what you're describing is a is a ... a flood of you know for lack of better term a flood of biblical proportions right like this was really bad so what have we seen from the federal government from your point of view\nWe do have female coming in and I want to share some of the comment that I have received from red white and western than the county that is we've seen FEMA what\nSo they have a stray showed that there should it be FEMA here all the time of being a person should be down here at least guiding indirect form on that that\nWe check with FEMA and they said their job is mostly the handle reimbursements and to help homeowners would last through their insurance doesn't cover\nThe FEMA spokesman told us the agency's done over ... cells and whom inspections in ... county and distributed millions of dollars of aid they said it's up to the state and county to do much of the on the ground clean up the county rep told us that's happening is just slow going\nThat's why people like Kim are so important to the recovery and said to me have you ever done anything like this before\nI chuckle a little bit [laughter] um actually my position that was a ...\nFor your service director and uh we did have one situation at one point where we had a team of employee that was in Japan and the salami yet and twenty a letter and it was total chaos on a nuclear site\nSo that kind of got me thinking this situation is very similar if not the same it's just water and in his home so you approach the things like okay what are you still want to add three how do you get\nImpact or how do you get donations how'd he get feedback how do you get response smitty all the time\nSo just having me not really that did feel a little guilty but on the flip side of it I was ... or if I'm with an IED blast someone else if I Can't and I kind of took that approach just personally like I say I'm a regular that\nI Would say that you are not regular citizen I Would say the extraordinary says will things where you were okay\nJim ... is one of the leaders of the effort to clean up in the county\nCarolina soon after we spoke to her we learn that FEMA opened up a

people killed and six others who were wounded in a mass shooting at at the tree of life synagogue yesterday Jeffrey Finkelstein the head of Pittsburgh Jews federation says people need to come together at a time like this\nRate over the course of just two days we'll all went from a tropical depression to a category five hurricane that's we're talking from forty miles per hour winds to a hundred sixty miles per hour winds\nAnd and do we know how that or why that could happen so suddenly\nConditions were were just perfect for it it was going over an area with warm water and heat fuels hurricanes it was also in an area is a lot of moisture and there wasn't a lot of wind shear when shares just when you've got wind that different different speeds at different altitudes and that kind of thinking really dissipate a storm\nAnd will it didn't encounter any of those any of that as it was built into a category five but after that it did actually went back down to a category three before it made landfall very quickly\nAlso yes again that was really quite chains are just\nSo there's this sort of a new pattern them for hurricanes to be expected\nIt's hard to say I think that it's part of the pattern of more hurricane intensity definitely so what was actually ... tense hurricane season to reach category four or five in the Pacific northeast it's the most intense sees in that area has had ever on record\nSo um it's it's definitely I mean ... researchers have warned that in a warming planet the hotter it gets the more intense we can expect hurricane season to be\nAnd you know with all the water that these are kids drop now oh maybe we need a new classification people have been talking about well you know the ones we may not just be adequate enough to describe\nI I completely agree to it as a matter of fact most people who died hurricanes they die from freshwater flooding not from wind damage category the category system only really talks about wind damage so I think it is important to talk about flooding so Willa\nHas made landfall moved from Mexico to Texas and apparently the moisture is going to be affecting the mid Atlantic states over this weekend we could be in for our forced first nor'easter of the season and it's getting fuel from this hurricane so it's just affecting in terms of precipitation a big chunk of the U.S\nGoing to get out of here early today [laughter]\nTalking talking about water we're learning more about what kind of life on Mars could support to own your own water on Mars we're always talking about water this\nIt's very exciting that the water there so researchers when they found liquid water on Mars they knew that water had to be really salty because Mars can get very very cold and in order for that ... not freeze it must have a high salt concentration so they didn't really look at whether life might be be\nMight have enough oxygen but a new study has done just that they said well if we have this very salty water at this range of temperatures and at the these different pressures how much oxygen would dissolved in that water would it be enough to support 'em microbes that could breathe that and they found it would be would have enough oxygen to support not only microbes but certain types of sponges lounges\nPunches on Mars while not not the sole you [laughter] know so much this model organism and researchers like it's very very simple it's filtered feed her it's\nProbably one of the first animals to evolved so it's it's it's a great thing for researchers to look at and be like I Wonder if this could survive\nThere may be in those moons of Jupiter we find sponges that would be really amazing it's amazing it's always amazes me how to use every thank you very much would a senior editor of popular science now it's time to play a good thing bad thing [noise]\nHe does every story as a flipside\nIt's become a common sight on social media is growing along and you'll see a post asking for donations to support some kind of medical treatment often because a person doesn't have insurance or they've exhausted their resources these crowd funding campaigns can raise a substantial amount of money\nBut are there ethical concerns\nJoining me now to talk about the good and bad of crowd funding medical treatment is Dr Ford vox he's medical director of the disorders of consciousness program and ...\nThe medical ethics committee happy shepherd center in Atlanta Georgia and coauthor of a short research letter on medical crowdfunding published this week in the journal of the American Medical Association he joins me by Skype welcome to science friday\nHey good afternoon or good afternoon to you\nThese crowd funding campaigns can help bridge the gap financially for people facing expensive medical treatment but what what's the downside to this\nThat's right so the downside is water people are gonna be raising money for you know we certainly hope that it's true insurance gas which there are there are a lot there's a lot that insurance doesn't cover that maybe it should ah extra added cost and people are off work and important equipment and so forth\nBut what actually dangerous is what you're raising that money for it might be something that's not evidence based dangerous\nMe some sketchy kinds of treatment something like that\nThat's right and that's always focused on this paper we looked at five diverse different so called sketchy treatments outcome the most dangerous ones being stem cells and plan for instance central nervous system people raising money to get this done\nDown in Mexico why the China some procedures here in the United states as well and a righty of other things also that are not FDA approved potentially highly dangerous and people in their generosity are donating these campaigns because folks are desperate and about half out individuals that but not really realizing you could be causing some real harm\nYou could be a how much how much money are we talking about here\n[laughter] so crowded hunting and of itself is just a billion dollars has been raised so far on go on the alone\nAnd medical crowd funding is the single largest segment of that as far as the problematic campaigns I Can't say for sure because we just select the kind of a representative sample of five to snap solve the activity\nWe found folks trying to raise about twenty seven million dollars or five of these shady street and that's a and they raised just over six million dollars\nYou know some people would say what's what's the problem here these patients have a right to try and seek their own cures trying new treatments of others have not worked for them [noise]\nYou're right and that's how the libertarian point of view and and it does exist however uh this is a little bit different transactions and uh you have a point that out of your own like accounts were just your own close family or friends now third party is involved and potentially\nHarm to yourself and that ... that that is largely go from me but the other platforms as well and so they do now have an ethical duty and that transaction\nIs there any way to know if you see one to have to find out on your own whether this thing is worth crowd funding for you [noise]\nThere is not and there should be and that's part of the critique uh that we outline a we think that that's the duty of the sites there perhaps filter out some of these campaigns for for them on up to humans are to interpret that they could have for example kind of a medical panel to look at it they could refer people certain key words to the appropriate\nInformation on the website or other reputable websites for example but you really have to be an educator consumer and that's part of what's the danger of these campaigns as they represent people are going around a kind of standard hospitals and clinics and physicians who are trying to help people\nAnd prevent them from harming access the treatments that they need balancing the other ... uh\nWell we've run out of time Oh thank you for making us an educated consumer Dr ... back to Iraq to foreign vox chair of the medical ethics

out of Leeds, England her\nNew book is nine pine said Journey Through the money medicine and mysteries of blood welcome to science friday\nThank you I guess I guess being from the u._k. a pint is the right measurement you would be using for blood\nI Believe that's something we share it with you though so I think is the one thing we have in common along with miles\n[laughter] the very ah they're all these different connotations about by the Romans drank it Homer used it in the odyssey to allow the day to speak one and there's so many almost mystical ideas about blood\nWell slow process so when people started experimenting with removing blood from one creature and putting it in another creature it was in the sixties seventies seventeenth century and it generally tend to be two different types of creatures\nSo because at that point again blood was thought to have the spiritual mysterious quality\nIt was thought that if you transfer you someone with bloated you would get the quality of the characteristics of the creature so cheap blood is very popular because they were thought to be mild and nice mhm I'm cows popular too\nBecause I have to be gentle um dogs don't stop blood was experimented with a lot\nUm with various ah results um some people some some experiments uh died on these ... these which on skis into humans\n... the defense real experiments action with human blood going into another human and wasn't obstetrician called James I'm Down in the nineteenth century and he had about a fifty percent success rate and order the people who try throughout the nineteenth century but because it wasn't understood\nThat there were these types and that obviously you could have a human reaction um you could die so it was not really until ... in the Nineteen a woman\nI'm more or less discovered blood types but even he didn't really think his\nDiscovery was massively important the kind of ignored it for about ten years\n... talking with the rose Georgia journalist based in Leeds, England her new book is nine points a journey through the money medicine and mysteries\nOf blood a science friday from WNYC Studios I'm there had been attempts to create synthetic blood we've I've been following it for years but why is it so hard to do that\nBecause blood is so amazing and because we cannot replicate it even though so much money and so much happened so many great minds have been trying to be safe for decades to try to do it we still haven't done it and we still cutting off\nReproduce something that does everything the blood blood does in the body because it it it's very very busy you know it's ... the oxygen it's removing carbon dioxide keeping warm transporting nutrients\nAnd we just haven't come up with the synthetic um alternative\nYeah there have been asking really good progress but\nAnd that have been um since ... red blood cells which have been used down transfused in fact the\nTrouble is that at the moment they would be so expensive um that that you know a meaningful alternative except in the Hudson wreck cases and so so so now even despite all the ... and there is nothing better than the stuff that comes out all of them\nTell us about hemoglobin how that works in the blood so\nI Am not I do not have a medical background so I don't want to get that anything wrong but I can tell you that when I give blood um\nMy he takes about three weeks to\nRecover and um I Am a runner and I went up hills so I can tell you what I Know about human loving it it makes running up hills extremely difficult for about three weeks so its strength looking um it's just helping your muscles that fuel fuel and\nUh if you give a pint of blood which I and courage anyone who can should do and but it ... you will not you will notice the difference for a couple of days are up to a few weeks\nMhm so those people who give to find a week they must be quite lethargic for giving class not a lot of different\nUh ... not cellular ... you can you can

lynching center in modern day you reaching is a big industry or they're still they're still doing it very very I mean it does is thriving according to your book\nIt is I'm so pleased you asked me about leach has a very fond of them\nI'm although I don't really like picking them up and some leading came back to you so it was it was widely done for the nineteenth century it to the point where the native medicinal leach in Europe was pushed to extinction and um they were widely abused\nRarely um and there was a French doctor who was one of the polio doctors who was known as the ... and he he used almost a preventive medicine so he would prescribe sixty ... even\nBefore he'd seen his patient um but then they found out the fashion once we understood things like during the Reagan disease\nAnd because of that we used to ... lifting was thought to balance the humans in the body once the humorist theory went out the window and so did leeches\nBut then in the um about fifty years ago some Slovenian doctors use them again and found that day was still the best thing available if you have to let this congested because you have a really astonishing anti collective lint\nIn saliva so when they they when they bite they and they give you this on the continent and it can keep blood flying for\nUp to ten hours so if you for example you've had something amputated auto enough and it's the lowest there are lots of tiny blood vessels that extremely difficult to stitch together got knit together really and to get the blood flowing so she doesn't what you need\nTo leach and I'm so
