Tom pop in a statement we call in America [noise]\nThank you Chris I'm about half of live from here I'm resuming my journey across the country chairing the good stories of our fellow Americans\nThis week I was on a road trip traveling down along the northeastern Portland Maine to Long Island sound\nFall is slowly emerging believes starting to turn in the last two summers warmth lingering in the air but the locals know what's coming and could be seen pulling out there's snow shovels and practicing they're unhappy winter faces\nThe first person I ran into was John working at a hotel shining shoes he's eighty six years old and decided to spend his retirement by working at yet another job what else am I going to do is walk around the mall and count my steps that sounds like the way they torture you in a Turkish prison\nI had it down to the war is looking for a lobster role and took a seat in an outdoor cafe overlooking the water I met a middle aged couple who are enjoying a drink in the sun from the playful way they interacted I thought they were on their first date\nBut it turned out they've been married for eleven years and funny enough still like each other\nCarrion Brian met in Portland while attending a mini kiss concert many\nKisses a kiss tribute band made up of all little people [noise] Kerry said I walked in and saw Brian across the room because we were taller than everyone else [noise] I figured I Am wearing\nFace makeup he's wearing face make up we should make out he squeezed her hand while she told their story\nWe don't go out much anymore but we still love kids she showed me a picture on her phone Brian with a giant beer belly dressed up in his very own kissed costume Kerry said I like this picture because Brian looks like gene Simmons if he ate one of the guys from many kids [noise]\n\nIt was time for me to take it over to get my rental car for the journey down the coast I was picked up by Sean he's twenty five and it's been driving for the past three years ever since he lost his job as a moving company\nHe loves Maine but he's not looking forward to the cold he says it's winter was so bad last year they went spring's finally came he's throughout all his long pants and protest\nNow he's in trouble he\nSaid I saw the survivor show and discovery where a guy never wore shoes are pans he trained his mitochondria with his mind to not feel the coal showing figures he's watched enough of the show to give it a shot even though he's not sure how to do it or what might it might have a country it is\nI picked up my mid sized rental and headed down the coast along route Ninety five it was a beautiful ride that ended at the Oregon points ferry across the Long Island sound to the far eastern points of Long Island\nAs we pulled out into the sea I was reminded of how beautiful the east coast truly is and the boats make me sea sick\nI hate but I get claustrophobic I don't like being trapped we're nowhere to go\nThat's why I don't go on cruises it's like paying someone to put me in a hostage situation [noise] have you ever close\nYour eyes and held onto a railing for dear life and when you came to realize you were hugging a man from Bridgeport, Connecticut\nI have\nWhen we finally got to land I found a hotel in Riverhead New York and slept off the nausea\nLater that night I went to a seafood restaurant and sent an extra three white guys in their seventies who look like retired fishermen\nThey wore faded jeans and washed out T shirts two of them at messy gray hair under tattered baseball caps and the other was his bald as a clam\nSuddenly in the corner of the bar a woman started singing karaoke it seemed weird in a place like this but the crowd quickly gathered around as she belted out me and Bobby McGee\nThe fisherman just scout and she ended a strong applause one of the crusty old fisherman marched up to the microphone as if he was going to pull the plug on the whole affair but then he grabbed him I\nClosed his eyes pointed at the D. J. and David Bowie is China Girl kicked in\nI was in shock without even looking at the monitor this gang really old guy was killing it he at a bar filled with people half his age holding up their cell phones and dancing along I looked over to his friends but they kept right on eating buffalo wings as if he does this all the time\nHe handed you a standing ovation and shuffled off and before I knew what his bald friend was up there\nWithout taking his hands out of his sweat shirt pockets he bounced is round head from side to side stopped and Bon Jovi living on a prayer began the entire bar lost their minds [noise]\nEveryone was screaming the lyrics with fears held high as this old dude rocked out with less emotion than a plate of oysters\nI never saw anything like it a very attractive waitress was hugging the tall fisherman and showing your phone case with a picture of David Bowie on it the bald guy was shaking hands with strangers as women's squeezed them and kisses had have you ever thought that\nYou're eating in a seafood restaurant in Long Island but it actually discovered the fountain of youth and ended up singing I've got you babe in the eyes of a salty old fisherman [noise]\nI have\nAnd I'll definitely be back until next time this has been Tom Papa out in America [noise]\nSome [noise] for John he'll be performing here here from Livermore\nArts Center October twenty fifth ladies and gentlemen\nTo join me in welcoming for the first time as musical director the secret to wizard himself Mr Mike Ellis\nWe don't talk to my for his contribution already and we're really lucky to have him with us all\nSeason long and hey we're excited to announce a brand new segment\nThis season one that runs contrary to my nature is a control freak we're calling it three minutes of improv three minutes of improv [noise] we have no idea what's going to happen\nBut I Know that it's one of the great pleasures of my life to play music with Mike Elizondo surfer this first installation of three minutes of improv were to say a timer for three minutes start playing\nAnd see what happens wish us luck this is a beautiful place right\nHow does it sounds in your heart and had to end the ... right now being in this place\nIs is this your first shows me ... move your mouth\nI think you got to take this from Chris I bet you I think you got to take this one that is to tell you\nAll right All right tough tough but fair [noise] um okay\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nA ...\nAnd in\nDon't do it you\nNo ...\nOh\nNo I'm In trouble\nYeah\nWoman you know they are in Maine\nKnow\n...\nOh\nOh\n\n[noise]\n\nAnd we will be right\nA short intermission you are listening to la from here coming to you from Cleveland\nLack of here supported by progressive insurance offering told quote explores the shoppers can evaluate auctions in one place one by go trench custom ... online learned more progressive dot com\nAnd my marriage providing global financial resources market expertise to play in the world over in our WBEZ dot com has more dementia\nAnd bicarbonate offering secure data protection solutions for businesses including automatic back up your servers advanced endpoint protection high visibility and disaster recovery solutions an automated due to migration we're more carbon I dot com\nAnd by ... on my desk prep for the ACP the designed to improve stores students can get video lessons brush question and extra support on line Brett smart go far and enjoy the ride boost dot com slash VCD\nAnd by pay had nation you can learn to play mandolin guitar for the banjo in other acoustic instruments with video courses on pay get nation dot com lessons are taught by instructors such as Brittany harsh Mike Compton course instructor and sign up as a nation picket nation dot com slash\nAnd by Sierra Nevada Brewing Company family owned operated an argued over versus Nineteen eighty reminding you to think for yourself but drink with other\nIf you have some free time go to our website at life from here dot org where you'll find all the info about next week show with the palace theatre in Saint Paul Minnesota with our guest\nDirty projectors bar\nYou can also subscribe to a newsletter for updates on a\nCheck out a full season schedule we interviews warmer cast adjustable rate of life and who merchandise that\nVideo and audio from every show much much more like in his lifetime here's produced by American public media\nIt's halftime and live from here here on eighty nine point three K.
