President Trump confirmed over the weekend that the U.S has withdrawn from a landmark nuclear weapons treaty with Russia the intermediate range nuclear forces agreement or ins\nMore than Fifteen hundred people but there was a problem hundreds of them weren't showing up on the voter registration list\nShe contacted secretary of state Brian Kemp ... office but Helen didn't get any answers so she went public and got a swift rebuke from camp can you walk me back to exactly when you receive that letter from the secretary of state's office\nI'm sure I rent it and I got scared you know um and then test\nComes litter claimed some of the applications for late or didn't come in at all and he turned the tables he suggested Helen May have broken the law by photo copying the applications and keeping copies in Georgia that could lead to a felony charges\nPalin turn to a prominent Atlanta attorney Emmett Joplin bond during the second\nThe vast number of ordinary people are easily intimidated by exactly that sort of letter\nMr pondering is eighty one he's a successful corporate lawyer and also something of a voting rights legit\nWay back in Nineteen sixty three he won his first case before the Supreme Court increasing the power of black voters in Atlanta after Helen asked for his help Banderas wrote a letter to the secretary of state letting him know he'd be representing Helen and her organization\nAnd if you got any questions about their activities you direct from me\nAnd we will respond to\nYour one or two that the OK Corral you came to the right place and you better think about\nComes off his back off and didn't file any charges but he's investigated other voting rights groups including one founded by his political opponents Stacey Abrams Kemp says he's just making it harder to cheat bon during cold these investigations part of a broader playbook used by Republicans to suppress the vote\nSo what happened to Helen came home when I asked her she told me that two years later she went back to check on the people who are group tried to register half still weren't on the ropes\nAnd then we try to phone banks several of them and many of them are no longer interested in working let that are going back to them because they said they'd been turned off so badly\nTheir problem Helen Kim who faced hasn't gone away\nEarlier this month voting rights groups filed a lawsuit claims Brian camps office has violated the voting rights act in the constitution\nAnd issue is a law that freezes applications for name or other info doesn't exactly match other government records even if it's just missing a hyping the people can still vote but activists worried they might be discouraged by the confusion\n... says there's another voter suppression strategy that still has him stumped it first dawned on him in twenty twelve you're reading an article that the number of registered voters in Georgia had gone down\nThis raise serious questions because we knew Georgia's population was growing\nThere had not been the black death to kill off a third of the state's\nAnd so we had to be somewhere else going on\nSo here's what's happening to bond earns missing voters states routinely perch hundreds of thousands of people from their voter registration rolls these are people who've died or moved away or gone to prison but Georgia and at least eight other states have what you could call it use it or lose at laws not voting can get you removed from the rolls\nIt works like this if you sit out a couple of elections you can get put on an inactive list the state send you a mailer if you don't respond and skip to more federal elections your perch and if you don't know your removed you may show up at your polling place only to find out you can't vote\nUnder camp there's been a massive jumped in purges what's going on hair brown\nCamps job is to protect our vote and this is an ad from power pack Georgia its donors promised ten million dollars to boost Stacey Abrams campaign we just can't trust that Brian camp [noise]\nCan't spend on a bus tour around the state talking about his record I went to a stop to south of Atlanta outside spray varies barbecue restaurant just regular campaign stop for Georgia Republicans\nKemp steps off the bus and give his stump speech it's all about putting Georgia first and protecting its values then he gets back on the bus right now\nI get onto I asked him about the allegations that he'd been aggressively purging voters he looks a little irritated\nWell I Would disagree with that statement what we're doing is within the law and required by law\nSo your office hasn't been more aggressive than others in the past in terms of removing voters from the rolls [noise]\nNo I don't believe we have I mean we're just going through the process but you know having secure lessons you gotta obscure voter rolls\nKemp says he's made it easier to vote by setting up online registration but during his time in office there's been a big jump in the number of people who've been removed from the rolls more than one point six million have had their registration cancelled [noise]\nCan't last time in my mind [noise]\nI decided to try and find people who've been purged without knowing it in Moultrie the small agricultural town in southern Georgia\nThis in Tempe size over there in line\nWith Angela ... she's an investigative reporter for a PM reporters we've got to sort of guide a database with the names and addresses of all five hundred thousand or so people purged in Georgia last year\nAnd our analysis shows that in the county where Moultrie as any more than two dozen others they're perjures are disproportionately affecting people of color\nAnd pattern right on that front parkway\nWill treat the county seat we pass white column homes with manicured lawns and lush magnolias in front on the other side of town and we drive over potholes streets long rows of one story ramshackle houses [noise]\n\nWhen we get to the homes of people who are listed as perhaps some are boarded up and the residents had moved away at some of the other addresses we're told the people were looking for have gone off to college for the military\nI Am this woman tells us she doesn't vote for religious reasons\nAre over there and you\nThink yet\nWe're still looking for someone who wants to vote in November but doesn't know they've been purged so we go to see Cornelius ponder a member of Moultrie city council hey how you doing but he's also a businessman\nAnd pastor at the real church that stands for restoration and if ... and love he says his family's lived in the area for generations my great grandparents uh it was small sharecroppers Reverend ponder won his election last year by the slimmest of margins just nine votes\nHe says well he was campaigning he encountered people who've been purged for failing to vote in previous elections\nThat came across a quite a few people then they'll let you an Iranian some of them went down to vote and they could and then um I had to be said that they got down there and they didn't have proper documentation anytime there's confusing like that during the election that's not good\nHe says with Trump in office enthusiasm is low in Moultrie in the last election voter turnout was below ten percent voters are also frustrated with all the obstacles purges confusion over polling locations and long lines\nThe guy raises failing like is no longer worth voting now and I think that's what we're we're we're in trouble with\nVan Angela asks about a name she spotted on the purge list\nKathleen by there oh yeah yeah yeah he lost her sad\nShe's Monti\nState record say Kathleen ponder registered to vote in two thousand eight then earlier this year official struck her name from the rolls river and ponder tells us he doesn't know about any of this but does he can't know that she's been taken off the voting\nList [noise] Angela and I find ms ponder living in a small house just outside Moultrie\nBy ... famous signed\nI'm handle I can say that I'm a reporter went public radio\nStory about people who've been removed from the voter last I don't know if you've heard about this but\nAngela explains how Georgia cancels voters who don't turn out in multiple elections and then in some places blacks are being pulled off the rules at a disproportionate rates\nSo you registered to vote in two thousand and eight years I'm very that Obama is trying to remember a hand\nYou know the book making what I mean\nSo then uh last July you were taken off the voter land a salad event on July twenty eighth as twenty Seventeen and maybe you didn't get any notification that you'd\nHave news from this you know\nDid you know there there is if you say that they take us if you don't vote\nNew\nMiss ponder tells us she had no idea she'd been perch although she didn't seem completely surprised she says she hasn't been a regular voter but she's thinking about turning out in November to support Stacey Abrams\nFor Governor Rhodes there will be back at Reverend ponders office usually gives him the news about his aunt\nShe still lives within the county that she's been removed from the voter last and she had no idea\n... that's interesting is she was never notify or anything\nHe doesn't hear back right away so he gets the cell phone number from rural king the guy in charge of chaos you\nBut the more they talk Logan says the weirdest things get he said that I should probably stop I'm doing this work otherwise people downtown would crush me what did he mean by that\nAt the time I took that to mean a politician's right and I also took that as more of a warning that a threat\n[noise] um no but in hindsight I'm not really sure Logan didn't get crushed by politicians or anyone else though the FBI did pay him a visit a few months later now he's sitting at the center of a\nMessy situation one that says a lot about the state of election security in Georgia and across the country\nAbout a month after Logan first finds the problem Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp is in Washington DC\nI Want to thank the committee and chairman hurt for vi to me to discuss election security\nHe's testifying before a house subcommittee on information technology in and over the past few weeks he's been boasting about the security of Georgia system he's also been calling out the federal government for overstepping its election responsibilities and trying to quote subvert the constitution under the guise of security\nBy the way it kept doesn't know about Logan findings yet and that the hearing he's going off again sure he says the heck on the DNC was troubling but\nThe D.C response to these attacks has been to take steps toward federalizing aspects of the ... election systems in standardizing security measures there is a better way to\nHearing goes on for hours eventually camp starts getting pushback from Jerry Connelly a democratic senator from Virginia Mr Kemp um I Want to make sure I understood your testimony\nCommonly skeptical you basically says so you're telling us that there's never an election situation that calls for any kind of federal intervention ever in camp is like no not really Connelly doesn't buy it what about the voting rights act he says states were actively\nDisenfranchising people than the government stepped in isn't that positive Kemp doesn't seem to understand the question\nI Would say that the voting rights act is still in that\nYes but it's an example of the opposite of what you were asserting it was an example of federalizing something to protect the franchise I don't believe it because of the states weren't doing it in fact states were actively suppressing votes you don't deny that do\nWell I'm not sure I understand what that has to do with the election system\nWhile I'm dealing with your assertion of the principle that we shouldn't federalize any aspect of this and I'm arguing that the voting rights act is it clear exception to your principal and that perhaps\nThe federal government in federal elections at least has an interest that overrides state interest when it comes to protecting at the cyber level the integrity of the results\nWill certainly your opinion on differs\n[noise] are you back much Germany at the end of the hearing campus given one last chance to speak any stance from states have the cyber security stuff handled he says and in fact maybe federal officials should pay us visit maybe they would learn a few things\nI think there will be very pleasantly surprised [laughter]\nThe team in Kennesaw state was certainly surprised in fact slogans email sent them scrambling [laughter] they didn't want to be interviewed for this story but all the emails for public record which means you can get them if you ask nicely\nLet's start on August twenty eight twenty sixteen Logan emails K su he tell somebody found and he says quote there's a strong probability your site is already compromise\nMembers of Cass youth center for election system starts circulating the email around and over the next few days they start to realize\nYeah this is that the school's information security team recommends doing some scans but then the director of the elections team weights and\nHe says wait a minute wait a minute this is our busiest time of year the last thing we want is for the site to become unavailable all these counties Nita [laughter]\nReading this at first it's easy to think okay that makes sense but this idea that you can't make elections secure because you're so busy preparing for the elections the scenes problematic\nBy September fifteenth these scans still haven't been done someone from the elections team says they're struggling with the technology quote we discovered we're a little out of our debt finally the elections team gets the breach fix or so they think it's October twenty seven two months after Logan first emailed them\nThey think the security team and said quote this has been a huge help to us\nReading this email you can basically here this deep sigh of relief like\nThis is over except it's not [noise]\nYou might be wondering what Brian Kemp has to say about all this well despite move inland\nDownloading dreams sensitive information which kept called deeply concerning Kemp also said that Georgia is protected with layers upon layers of security and specifically he's made two arguments number one the voting machines are never connected to the Internet\nWhich makes them safer from hacking and number two breaking into just one wouldn't really do much you need a wide scale conspiracy to actually mess with an election [noise]\nSo there's a good reason to push back on both of those arguments will lose arguments are wrong\nRich Milo is a professor of computer science at Georgia Tech he used to be the chief technology officer at Hewlett Packard\nYou don't need to mount an attack on thousands and thousands of polling places you just need to have a really good idea a word at target your tax in order to flip the right number of votes in order to get above the threshold\nPlus he says because Georgia system is so centralized there are multiple points of entry for an attacker that's\nPart of what Logan discovery proved not only did Georgia leave itself exposed the people running things didn't even seem to understand how bad the problem was or what was at stake\nThere making you know they're scared to death they're making it up on a day to day basis they have no idea what's going on in these systems they have no idea why they work or don't work and they're kind of living in constant fear that this whole thing is going to come crashing down around their ears\nThey also failed to realize something else something really important [noise] five months after Logan made his initial discovery he was hanging out with a friend another cyber security guy I was like Christ I ever tell you about that wacky stuff I found a K issue\nAnd he said no tell me more [laughter] they sit down at a computer and download everything again except this time there's more because it looks like new info has been added since January so were you able to get the exact same amount of stuff the second time a effectively yeah so nothing had changed\nWell they had a tempted to fix it but in such a way that I I actually don't understand what they were trying to do\n[laughter] okay [laughter]\nThose those by my reaction [noise]\nYeah [laughter] I don't really understand [noise]\nKen didn't want to talk for this story but I was able to chat with Kathy Cox Georgia secretary of state from Nineteen Ninety nine to two thousand seven a Democrat she oversaw the state wide roll out of touch screen machines in the early two thousand and unlike every cyber security expert I've ever talked to she's critical of paper ballots\nFrom dead people voting to ballot boxes are showing up in the bottom of a lake um they're just so many opportunities\nLimited truly only by one's imagination to commit fraud on a paper ballot\nShe also said that even though Logan findings for troubling they're different from a problem with the voting machines themselves\nA breach into a voter registration system is not a breach into the voting system in Georgia because those are two distinctly different systems distinctly different security systems\nIt's worth noting that cyber experts disagree with is strongly that\nBernhardt is a PHD student at the University of Michigan he studies the arteries and their vulnerability\nThat says the problem with Georgia system is that I'm like a lot of other states it's all interconnected like a giant tree he told me the secretary of state's office is the roots your counties or like the upper branches and your precincts are like little leads\nSo really you can inject information or inject\nNow we're a virus and part of the street the way to set up is that virus could get transmitted every other part of the ...\nNot long after Logan downloaded all that data second time some election integrity groups filed a complaint against Brian Kemp for violating Georgians constitutional rights to have their ballots counted correctly [noise]\nGeorgia to switch to paper ballots before the November midterms [noise]\nThere was a hearing in September in federal court in Atlanta was grueling took all day you at cyber experts on one side explaining why Georgia's system is so vulnerable one of them even hacked voting machine right there in the courtroom\nOn the other side we're Kemp people telling the cyber experts hey you don't understand how Georgia system works a few days after the hearing\nA federal judge deciding again adopting paper ballots over electronic one for the midterm elections\nJudging Amy Totenberg filed in order in favor of Brian ... she wrote that switching to paper ballots just weeks before an election would create total chaos but she also spent dozens and dozens of pages validating the testimony of cyber experts and scolding the state\nI nearly got kicked out of a New Year's party 'cause I was going on now [laughter] you know people eyes glaze over\nShe is tenacious she's on Twitter she's calling reporters she's finally public records requests she's talking to anybody who will listen so in June twenty Seventeen when Kobach as head of Trump's election integrity commission sent letters to all fifty states asking for them to turn over their voter rolls\nAnd ... was prepared\nOne day last June I'm headed out the door to do some errands and I happened to notice the request for data\nAnd Twitter is just an gas and stop put down my back I sent the entire day saying if you're worried about this you should know your state has been doing this they have been sending this data to Kansas\nAnd I over and over and over to the point where I finally just copied it and was just pasting in response to people so much that day that I got shut out of Twitter from looking like a lot\n[laughter] that that sounds about right with Twitter the like actual human beings could should\nDo right I mean it's kind of funny but she really accomplished something her\nEfforts put crushed chicken news and the department of homeland security has checked into the breach is cross check it shut down this year and other states have gotten the message on that some have dropped out across chat\nBecause of the security problems that indeed uncovered um she did this by making public records requests to the state of Florida she got sensitive data on nine hundred and forty five ... including parts of their Social Security numbers\nAnd the encryption passwords for the cross check system\nIf we were bad people we could have sold that access in a heartbeat for a ton of money a hundred million people's private data could have been we had a key and we had the address we had them both and we could have done all sorts of crap and what we did was that the sort of this so they fix it\nInitially people worried across jak would be used to purge even more voters especially minority voters but I really didn't find evidence of that nor did need a\nShe actually change the narrative about cross check because she figured out that the system that's supposed to help states clean up the voter rolls that what is actually doing is exposing voters personal information\nIt's a sinister marketing effort probably more than anything else but\nThat still hasn't made Kobach give up on cross check and his campaign to market this idea of voter fraud Kobach is fighting in losing his battle\nAgainst is made up problem of voter fraud in federal court no less weight why was he a federal court comic likes to say that he's the ACLU worst nightmare like that clip you played\nBut it's really the other way around the ACLU is really kind of coal box worst nightmare he lost a very public battle to them this summer when a federal judge overturned Kansas is voter id law\nThat requires you to show proof of citizenship an id in order to vote like a birth certificate or a passport or a driver's license\nAnd a federal judge said Kobach not only did not make his case\nThat there's lots of this fraud this judge Julie Robinson said the Kobach showed willful failure in obeying her rulings and his performance in court was so bad that this judge ordered him to take a refresher course in basic civil procedure even though ... used to be a law school professor\nAnd need a partial was there in the court house for the trial\nOh my God I Wish more people had been there for a first trial\nIn at at all I mean I don't think you usually get the kind of laugh track that that had I had a person like I couldn't really watch Seinfeld very easily because George embarrassed me so much I Will be like oh God like ... or ... I had to duck sometimes it was so that you\nGo to a trial you're unprepared your fumbling you're embarrassing you get correct and multiple times you fail to prove your case in any way\nWho will [laughter] as bad when your critics for bears for you\nRight but here's the thing politically this did not hurt Kobach he went on to win the Republican primary for governor this summer by just a few votes here he is on the campaign trail\nI Want to do for care what President Trump has done for America [noise]\nI interviewed in the summer he told me that if he's elected he plans to keep on fighting this opposing voter fraud because the thing is is this is working for him\nEven though he was humiliated in court his federal commission was disbanded having achieved nothing the department of homeland security crackdown on cross check but he still may become governor of Kansas thanks in part to this crusade that he's lead against a problem that doesn't really exist\nThat is a record that speaks for itself safe I think you out with my pleasure those Peggy Lowe of ... you are in Kansas City earlier this month President Trump was in Topeka campaigning for Kobach\nAnd I want to introduce the next\nGovernor of Kansas\nAt the same rally Kobach brought up you get voted for he bragged about the voter id law he passed thing that Kansas has the most secure election laws in America we didn't mention a federal judge turned that law in June [noise]\n\nThis week shows in partnership\nBut Casey you are in Kansas City W.

migrants to remain in their countries\nThe other big a study that also came out looked at mammals specifically mammals that have gone extinct due to human activity um since humans have started walking two years we've seen more than three hundred mammal species disappear but what's unique about this study is they tried to quantify how unique these animals were not just the numbers but like\nHow irreplaceable they are so as humid as mammal share a common ancestor they branched out on the tree of life and it turns out humans have been suffering entire limbs off of the tree and in aggregate we've cost nature about two point five billion years worth of genetic final genetic diversity as they call it\nCan give me an example of one of those branches that was that we're\nSure um had young writing in the Atlantic he gave the example of the pygmies law which is a trip threatened species\nOr it branched off from it's common ancestor about nine thousand years ago which makes it a very young a species and so a kind of a small tweak on the tree but then there are animals like the ... which is the last survivor in its group and they branched off Seventy five million years ago so that means that if we were to lose those animals\nThat's a thing that would take you know millions of years to regenerate in terms of diversity\nI get it oh let's move on there's a there's an ongoing outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo we put we reported on that back in August when it first began so give us an update in what the status as now will\nThe outbreak is still out going there have been two hundred and twenty three cases in one hundred forty four deaths according to the world Health Organization's latest report\nAh they met this week to determine whether or not this counts as a global health emergency this is a declaration that would mobilize\nYou know more international resources but it also has sort of tradeoffs 'cause company or countries will respond to that by imposing travel restrictions and quarantines which can make it harder to get supplies and so\nHealth officials have to be kind of careful about making these kinds of declarations and they declined to make it a global health emergency they made it a regional emergency and what's scary and just kind of unnerving about this outbreak is that it's occurring in an active war zone\nOh that makes it a tougher to get in there and do something about it yeah there is there any reason for hope then\nYeah this is actually one of the first ah live trials of a vaccine we now have an effective Ebola vaccine but of course the ongoing conflict in the north ... region of the Democratic Republic of Congo makes it harder to get health workers and health workers have been attacked in the past\nAnd then they had to ask be escorted by armed personnel which in turn breeds distrust among the locals\nAnd there's you know a limitation of how many resources that are going in and so rather than using a blanket vaccination strategy they're doing what's called green vaccinations where they track infected individuals and then tried to vaccinate everybody around them the caretakers and family members to help sort of contained the virus in a more efficient way\nGreat stuff on there thanks for taking time to be with us today like west thanks for having me in the mirror fun is a staff reporter for vox now it's time to check in on the state of science\nOr you have you got me on the reason I was learning local\nStories of national significance one year after Hurricane Maria Puerto Rico is struggling to rebuild itself in nearly every way including a small farming sector reporter Bobby Baskin traveled to Puerto Rico nine months after the hurricane struck to see how farmers were recovering after\nThe storm made working the land all by impossible and she joined us with that story now Bobby basking as managing producer and reporter with living on earth welcome to science friday I think you You're welcome was so what is it a local farming community like in Puerto Rico headed Hurricane Maria affected\nYou know before that hurricane roughly eighty five\nAnd of the food and Puerto Rico had to be imported and that of course Mitt really expensive about twenty percent more expensive than I'm here in the U. S. and after the storm that number shut up to about Ninety five percent in part is food\nAnd the crops that they do grow on the the things that are most heavily damaged where things that made a good target for when you know so trees things like a coffee mango oranges that sort of thing\nUm crops that could hide underground so potatoes and carrots they did fairly well but then you had the um collapse of the infrastructure there so there were months and months without running water or electricity\nI went up to a farm in the mountains where the roads were literally impossible for two months so people had to have supplies airlifted in by helicopter I'm One of the people that I met there was a small scale farmer named Jim ... Romano\n... Ninety percent of our firms destroyed what it was really like a hundred percent because with the hurricane and no one could come here to harvest\nWow so where do we stand now that\nWell and now I mean they're trying to recover but uh you know infamously FEMA and the government were slow to respond so really volunteer start as a step to end to fill in the gap\nWhen I was there there was a group of volunteers from an organization called el departmental Adele to me that's the food department\nAnd they organized volunteers just um they send a group of volunteers anywhere from you know half a dozen to twenty people will just descend on a farm for a week and they'll tenth out you know the camp out in tents and they'll do anything the farmers need done they'll a fix fences plant crops we fix the roof\nAnd um it's that sort of a physical support that helps get a farm back up and running but the emotional support I think she was really a crucial to people and you know I did a a five part series on recovery uh on the island after the hurricane and I saw this over and over again\nYou know the government didn't respond so people just you know neighbors and volunteers um you know turned to each other for help and um I think you're going to see more of that in the future\nWhy aren't there more local farmers in Puerto Rico that might help I have a large local food source of this type of disaster were to happen again yeah\nGood question I mean it's a you know it's a tropical island plenty of sunshine and rain it it didn't make any sense to me to begin with either but uh you could really trace it back to a U.S policies on specifically operation bootstrap\nWas initiated in the Nineteen forties and it was a series of tax incentives and access to us markets and things like that that discouraged a domestic agriculture in favor of tourism and industrial agriculture so growing things like um coffee and sugar cane that can be exported for profit\nOr you know and that's fine and dandy but people can eat sugar cane and coffee for dinner or you do see some small farmers markets and things like that so they do exist but it's really a niche market right now\nWhat gets a little bit of a law changed potential that\nIt could happen\nIf they had in mind to exactly but um I think that people do understand um you know that they need more of that you know for months after the store and people were skipping meals and eating out of the ten can justify so there are certainly acutely aware of how vulnerable the food system as there and I think I'm eager to do something\nAbout me thank you for taking time to be with us today above your basket managing producer and reporter with living on earth we're going to take a break and then look at the rising rate of C sections worldwide and here at home what are the causes in the jumping the procedures did you have one why did you haven't what was your experience like\nCan share with us on our phone number is four four seven to four to five we'll be right back after this break [noise]\nAm I replied oh this is science friday from WNYC Studios\n[noise] pay for instance lamb marriage Milligan is offended gr pioneered food TV have successful restaurant\nStarted out as two young women in LA cooking food from around the world when all those years\nThe macho French chef there this year's winners of the Julia Child a word we get their story that is if we all the when the table from ... joined us tonight at nine what eighty nine points to ...\n... supporters include dignity health Southern California hospitals including Glendale memorial saint Mary in Long Beach Northridge hospital California hospital in downtown LA St bernadine and community hospital of San Bernardino their doctors and nurses look for the healing effects of human kindness every day\nTo learn about emergency services hard care and healthy babies you can visit dignity health dot org slash so Cal dignity health hello human kindness\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow for anyone having a baby the decision to have a C section is not unusual but what is unusual is the number of the sections happening all over the world listen to this worldwide rate\nHas nearly doubled from twelve to Twenty one percent in the past Fifteen Years and in the United states one out of three per he's by C section now\nA series of studies in the journal the Lancet looked at this trend to see what is behind is uptick what are the effects on mothers in babies\nAnd what interventions can be done to decrease that number and that's what we're going to be talking about C section rates globally also what's happening here in the U.S and my question for your listeners is the you or your partner together she section\nWhat factored into that decision what was your experience like you can phone it in or you can tweet us our phone number a four four seven to for eight to five five\nYou can tweet us ... let me introduce my guest Holly Kennedy's and author author on that lasted series is also professor of midwife midwifery\nBut it traces back and forward to the years that followed sometimes in some cases decades that follow women who have had Syrian deliveries are just more likely to have repeats of their end deliveries as your caller almost did a increasing the risk of life threatening complications\nThe other thing that's very interesting about V. back is that in units in hospital units labor and delivery unit\nWhere the back is embraced where ... birth is something that devalued it turns out that the primary says there and delivery rate which has no direct relationship to be back up because these are women who are having their first baby and by definition V. backs are not your first baby\nThose unit to have higher V. back rates of even trying to have you back and supporting women and having the backs have lower primary says area and delivery rates\nIt really speaks to this idea of the culture of the unit and really valuing the safety of a vegetable delivery\nOf lots of lots of callers April for seven through four to five five let me get to some of the tweets 'cause we have never had so many trees before I let me choose out some interesting ones are are calling rights are three ... three kids the first was an emergency one but my concern now\nOr is that my children did not receive the bacteria from the birth canal and I'm seeing possibly week microbiomes\nTheir digestive health a highly Tony what do you think about that [noise]\nYou know as Tony was uh talking about the culture the unit in the back I think the the additional things that are really important for families to know when they're trying to make a decision is is the\nThe value of spontaneous labor there's there's Nerove physiology that I'm prepares the baby to be born actually um\nContributes to health later in life but that based on population based studies and the the travel and the baby through the that through the birth canal does see the baby with microbiomes so\nUm she's right that that that does contribute to long term health I mean I I'm ... ... it's it's a\nUm been worked on we've looked at different things to do to sort of do that with the baby after as his seat a C. section but if you can do it just on naturally that that is better the other thing is that babies born\nBy C section tend to have more respiratory distress and particularly if they don't have spontaneous labor so there's something about that spontaneous labor that contributes to the nurses geology and the health of the baby\nOn my roof later this is science friday from WNYC Studios are so many questions let's go back to the phones to Wendy in Portland, Oregon Hi Wendy\nHi thanks for taking my call so I'm\nActually an obstetrician gynecologist\nBut I I'm working just in a hospital so I'm an obstetrics hospitalist and one of the things that I Do is I just stay in the hospital to manage labor of Haitians [noise] um so I think one of the ways the country is we're\nFinding is that um my type of job is becoming more and more popular so\nThat and there are just physicians that are managing labor and hopefully are allowing the facts and allowing patients to labor as long as possibly safe\nUm I'm from Portland, Oregon and we have the second highest rate of attempted out of hospital birth and we have really the best um data from our birth certificates looking at\nTransport back into the hospital and I guess not my concern is that when I hear\nYou know the uh when I hear people talking of that than you know very important things that result from from having labor I have seen some attempt fat labor that we really should have never been there and have really resulted in some catastrophic outcomes for both mom and baby\nSo I I I Love I think are great um but I think there are some moms and some babies that needs needs the sections and we need to support that and well and you know really provide provide it when it's necessary undergoing\nReaction thanks but no\nI couldn't agree more and sit there and delivery is a life saving procedure and there are certainly a many women who should not undergo ... delivery uh there's a number of different conditions that make that unsafe\nThe uh the important thing I think um to keep in mind is also that ah regarding the example of home births in the United states and sort of that being an extension of the health care system and promoting ... birth I'm\nWell home birth in many countries are is a safe option and as a way to promote ...\nWe haven't quite figured that out in the United states I it is important in a health care system that promotes home birth to be able to make a really clear connection between home and hospital\nAnd when ... certain threshold or reached than a patient needs to be moved from home to hospital that's the part that we haven't quite figured out here yet I'm and until we figure that out I think it's it's going to be challenging to really embrace that as an option to promote factional birth\nWe can try to mimic that as best as we can on in the hospital setting and certainly have patience stay at home on for as long as it's reasonable um but home birth is not yet something in the United states that we have a really great system on to some\n... I mean we're gonna have to take a break lots more questions we're going to spend them another good ten minutes on this so we're going to talk with Kelly Kennedy and also Tony going or number for for seven to four to five five stay with us we'll be right back after this break [noise]\nUh my rough later this is science friday from WNYC Studios\nScience friday's supported by target presenting future at heart a pod cast on change makers and the projects their championing in communities nationwide\nFuture at heart available on apple pie calf or wherever upon caster found\nAnd by twenty three and me a personal genetic service designed to help people understand their DNA learn more at twenty three and me dot com slash WNYC\nScience friday is supported by legal zoom dot com offering a network of independent attorneys in tax professionals who can provide the advice needed to get through the daily grind of owning a business more at legal zoom dot com slash friday\nAnd from the Gordon and Betty Moore foundation more information at more dot org\n... pie I Am Alex novel and I'm Christian who were brothers we are big supporters of Cape you see the station is sort of been passed down to us by our mother my\nMom passed last year but left a significant request to the station and was a huge believer and I kind of party listener for many many years I'm a big fan of\nWait wait don't tell me and that was because of her she and I went to a live tipping of it when it was in Los Angeles and it was just a lot of fun and it was fun watching how much enjoyed it too\nI think both of us were due to the station by mom and she brought us to the to the table each day\nIt's a it's a wonderful resource for our community it's a great British you can't get rid of those that's right\nBut what you can do is help support the station the way that mom did the way that we're trying to do our own small way so if you want to support the station and maybe have your family do it the way our families try to you can go to Kay PC dot org\nAnd next time on asked me another we're joined by actor Nick cruel from the cruel show Broadway oh hello\nAnd that Netflix animated series big mouth and will play a game called best of the fast where contestants will have to guess real festivals from one we just made up so joined me up your Eisenberg ... our puzzles word\nGames and trivia this evening at age on eighty nine point three ...\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we been talking this hour about the increase in the number of C sections and what that means for women's health\nI guess or doctor highly Kennedy professor of mid were free of the Yale School of nursing or Tony ... vice chair of quality in a department of of obstetrics and gynecology at the famous Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center\nIn Boston and lots lots of folks from on the line and let's see we only uh gosh can cause everybody let me ask you how you you worked in research midwifery in the u._k. how does the approach here compared to what we do here in the U.S [noise]\nIt it it differs in several ways and actually when the land this Lancet series on C. section came out the W. World Health organization also issued new guidelines to help\nHelp us look at decreasing says Erin's and and one of the things that they have recommended is what the UK does which is to have\nA collaborative midwife obstetrician model of care where the midwife does most of the primary care and that's what happens in the u._k. all women have a midwife and some women have an obstetrician too when it's when it's really needed in the Lancet also published a series on midway free very extensive\nThe food they're getting very\n\n\nHappy to hear that song we\nTonight we're going to dedicate this song with Chris and this song is called set my so far they've gotten\n\n... oh\nYou know shit my so long by you know in ... by\nThen my so long by a\n... loan bond hell Michigan\nDollars ...\nMost of those long by\nYou know that much to know why\nYou must know why I'm saying so long I\n...
