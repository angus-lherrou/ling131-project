eagles when they moved out there started to eat the feral pigs are out there and also this rare species of Fox it's called the island Fox it looks like a cat it's a tiny little Fox they're cute they're adorable looking\nAnd the island Fox very curious about people\nBut the island Fox doesn't have it in their DNA to be on the alert for the golden eagles so the golden eagles basically started feasting on them\nPush them to the point of extinction so you had this whole chain reaction biologist looked at this and said okay we need to wrap what a Ireland Fox is we have left we need to bring them in for a captive breeding program to try to save them and so she had this whole cascade of events and so the biologist had to figure out how these things were inter related and they started to fix them\nAnd it's fascinating so what what do you mean they they started to fix them\nSo what happened was they they finally got enough of the bald eagles that they were able to reintroduce them to the islands than the golden eagles move into the islands they did a trapping program they relocated them to another part of California and into into that as well and then the island Fox has had gotten to the point where they could release them onto the islands and and and they\nThey've they've just been growing at Jim ... who's a national park service biologist\nI'm I've talked to him for Twenty years about this project he said maybe in our lifetime we could see the island Fox recover\nIt happens in less than twenty it's remarkable biologists around the world are wearing at this because humans were able to fix the problem but wait there's more there is more because it because there's other non native things out you know there's eucalyptus trees and there's aunts specifically Argentinean ants which you find on Santa Cruz island\nThey went in and they said okay we're gonna desk for these ants were going to get rid of these ants but the problem is ... how do you know that you've gotten rid of all the ants\nOkay I'll throw it out for the I'm Sorry go ahead and you have a little clip about that\nDay at that point that we cannot find any aunts with us in our human ... over fifty thousand dollar flat a plant where we think we did a really good job on the treatment and living out their stock to try to resolve to ensure that we can say yes okay Dianne needed their education\nNow that's Christina Bowser with the nature conservancy so what they did is\nA this group co working dogs for conservation in Montana train this dog specifically defined Arjun finance the only dog of its type in the world it went out it checked out the islands and it said that Santa Cruz island is an free in fact now twice it just checked up into buys he's now looking for clogging muscles someplace or national park\nAnd so he's moved on but did they were able to show that the island is now an free thanks to the dog\nSo we have a happy ending we did have ... let's go as a news director here at K. C. L. U. in Thousand Oaks California we're going to take a break\nAnd when we come back the countdown to the mid term the midterm elections is on and just a month out how secure our our ballot boxes we hear that there's been some new interference in the last election will the house more secure they might be stay with us we're right back after this break\nI'm Ira Flatow this is science friday from WNYC

Kavanaugh will also be joined by conservative commentator Bill Kristol he's\n... started the Weekly Standard and you see 'em on all the different news programs he'll be with us to talk about some of

less than a month until the mid term elections on November sex\nAnd there's a lot of talk about hacking and voters security the federal government has said hackers targeted the election systems of Twenty one states before the twenty sixteen presidential election but reportedly no information was changed or manipulated\nYet for the second year in a row the DEF CON underground hacking conference\nWell it showed how hackers could break into voting machines\nSo what are the real risks to our voting infrastructure how can we security systems how does all of this\nAffect voting behavior and our question for your listeners is what is your top concern about voting security heading into the mid term elections we want to hear from you give us a call our number eight for for seven to for eight to five five\nEight four for ... you can also tweet us ... what concerns you most about voting security heading into these midterms\nLet me bring on my gas Lawrence Norden is a deputy director of the Brennan Center Democracy Program at New York University Welcome to science friday\nThat understand a lot of focus on how do we secure the very selection systems whether it be the machines of the er the voting registration systems there's also the matter of building resilience into the system because we know\nThat at some time it someplace things really to break down like you experienced or you know there'll be mistakes or there will in fact the attacks and so then the question is what what is the backup and was the backup plan and the case of\nIf you have paper ballots um although you might have electronic ballot marking devices that's a backup if the voter registration system is down if you're prepared with I'm In a provisional ballots um\nOr even a paper backup of on electronic voting system um then you can move ahead and um you know if if\nUm and those are the sorts of things where when I look at state and local officials\nNow that's what I Want to know about is what sort of resilience in an emergency planning is going into the operations just as much as I'm interested in well you know do you have the sensor on your servers you have this sort of two factor authentication on your on your on your email et cetera\nLaurence ... is the Brennan Center more concerned about the voting system or the possible suppression of the votes\nIn registration of candidates\n[noise] [noise] yeah I mean we're we're about we're concerned about both for sure I I think and I think both of them um [noise] uh\nContribute to a to cynicism about the process too concerned about the process I I Do think you know we've seen 'em\nAn unusual number of a voter purges uh in the last couple of years since um\nSince the Shelby decision that struck down an important part of the voting rights act in states that were covered before\nI had to get pre clearance for ... for for doing things like purging voters hum we've seen a massive increase in states like Georgia\nAnd um and Texas and Florida and North Carolina and uh you know I I think when people see that that um people that would ... we should be entitled to vote and show up at the polls until they're not on the royals\nUm for whatever reason and it could be because\nThere's there were mistakes programming errors or it could because they were they were improperly purged hum that creates a lot of doubt of in the integrity of the system one thing that I Would say that everybody\nOr in the run up to the election as they should be checking their voter registration that's an easy thing to do on line or if their opinion\nAnd they think they register they may not\nYes absolutely and and in fact that's that's an early that can be an early warning sign for election officials that hey maybe I Need to figure out what's going on here maybe there's a problem so I think that's really important to do for the voter because it'll also remind them of where they should be going to vote and they can feel confident about when they show up on election day but I think it's also important for the system generally\nI'm Ira Flatow this is science friday from WNYC Studios uh Charles you looked at how the public sentiment towards election security when it feels if if they think are voting systems are secure do that [noise]\nUm well actually um they they do for the most part I I did a um I did I did a survey I'm just over the weekend on last weekend which I'm I'm replicate is something I did in may and I asked um representative sample of voters um potential voters um whether they're confident at least that there\nUm that they're on my own county or locality is prepared for um this November in\nTerms of computer hacking and about I'm sixty percent or so of the respondents said that\nThey were at least somewhat confident and um what um what's likely to happen in November I'm with I'm not surprisingly\nMaybe Republicans as being a bit more confident the Democrats and\nUm and that got partisan divide by the way is one of the reasons why I always I'm kind of put an asterisk on any public opinion research being done on public attitudes about confidence and voting whether it be in cyber security or just\nThe vote count in general and that these days everything is partisan and um\nYou know voters expectations about what's going to happen in November and whether we're prepared on cyber security side um is as much um is is likely to be determined by their\nPartisanship as um attitudes about almost any other issue\nIs voting security politically partisan issue [noise]\nI'm a little bit um I mean it's surprisingly nonpartisan in the sense that I mean there are democratic and Republican differences on the cyber security front um but they are you know they're the sort that a political scientist would write home about maybe\nOn everybody else would yawn at when you compare it to you know ... attitudes about\nAbortion or health care for instance um\nBut um when you look at other survey research that I've done Democrats for instance are more likely to be concerned about flip on foreign attacks foreign influence on elections um Republicans are more likely to be concerned about um internal\nUm cyber security problems which is I I think consistent with Republican leaders in general about um um fraud\nAnd other things that happened domestically so there is you know they're all those kind of differences that are kind of reflective of the twenty sixteen election but nonetheless Republicans and Democrats alike are both concern\nAbout cyber security and elections and both of them on a whole are confident that their local officials um are are are doing the right thing\nOr a very interesting topic off to take up more and maybe even before the weeks before the elections and get an analysis when the elections are over I Want to thank both of my guests Lawrence Norden deputy director\nOf the Brennan Center is Democracy Program at New York university Charles
