{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "\nFinally today our visit with another of this year's MacArthur Foundation fellowship whenever\nThe so called genius grants that you have an Eighteen class includes many artists and scientists and performers and the Reverend William Barber the second reference Barbara might be best known for his moral Monday protest outside of the state house in North Carolina he was among the first to draw attention to strategies that he said were aimed at suppressing the participation of poor and minority voters\nHe's let non violent protests across the country to fight poverty and racism\nAnd the Reverend William part of the second is with us now on the line from North Carolina\nThank you so much for joining us congratulations to you thank you so much so how did you react when you first heard this news said you had been awarded this crisis\nWell you know you don't know is anonymous you don't even know that follow you don't know who I'm central Maine man they call me I told him to stop playing it I thought it was a prank or basically notice for real\nOr the next thing for me was two years I've thought about all the things that my parents have done a sacrifice to all the years of just working and trying to serve um it was kind of overwhelming and you know especially when in the work I Do\nA lot of times people are very very nasty in that criticism they say you're doing it for money you're doing it for attention and a big question your motives when the reality is you know you just want people to see justice for the ... you want to see people are voting rights and people have health care\nPeople treat it right regardless of their race color creed their sexuality\nSo a gift like this says somebody else sees what you're trying to do what they want to be a part of you continue to do that work when they told me\nThat the announcement come out I was actually in custody stand with low wage workers and and ... and nurses and people working at McDonald's and that's what I was doing\nWe usually think of this grant that goes to people in the science and art world to stimulate creativity um so so tell me about the role that creativity planes in activism\n[noise] well you know ... in every age we know what works people going to make a difference we know that non violent civil disobedience words we noted protests works we know that voted worst but in every age is different oh you have to face it the way an Eighteen hundred for as they were just trying to get the right to vote now\nAnd then the Nineteen sixties today we're trying to hold on to what we want before and then press on to what we need to see done you know we'll try to hold on to basic voting rights but we also want to get to where\nEverybody Eighteen is automatically registered where voting as a holiday where St day registration devoted just something that happens in every state\nUh you know years ago people were fighting just to talk about getting out today we've tried to hold onto the if I were to a form of carrot and expanded the universal health care or so it takes it requires a certain understanding of the time\nThey had but and I'm thinking about things like how do you get people to see these issues in a fresh way which is the essence of creativity I mean some of your techniques like preaching\nA speaking writing demonstrating those are classics but you've also done things that are kind of ... like you know give me an example of kind of like a fresh way to get people to look at something that they think that they already understand\nWhat you know you read mix I mean James Brown was classic so but the rappers ... so ... so what you do is for instance back in in the day they had freedom schools in teaching what what we did what moral Monday is and what we do around the country we do something to call but imposed a mob political organizing leadership Institute and ...\nAnd what we do is bring people together of all races treats colors\nAnd classes and we say OK let's look at voter suppression as the the real numbers the Iraq will data twenty six states we said let's do same states a hot topic these days those same state\nPassed laws against immigrant people and gay people those same states up to bat\nOr a Medicaid expansion those same states did not union right so if ... if if the same states that passed racialized voter suppression and the people that get elected because of racialized voter suppression then use the election to hurt mostly white people\nAnd most of the poor people and we show people that empirically\nThen they began to say oh wait a minute\nWe're fighting the same people the same people that are checking the immigrants that uh one of the ... just get the same people that are the ones that are tacking voting rights and so if they are cynical about duck to be together we have to be smart enough to come together that is the way in which you read mix if you will what was done in the past and you expand and depressed\nSo before we wrap up here and she mentioned at the outset that this is not a lifetime achievement award this is an investment in you\nTo watch whatever it is you want to do next as you know when the MacArthur genius grant winters previously with Lin Manuel Miranda who wrote Hamilton so you know no pressure um what what what are you going to do with the ... have you thought about it\nWell I Know what I'm going to do with life\nA big record changes I don't see in another reason for me to be a law you have to work on these issues of racism and poverty and ecological devastation ...\nAnd ... and try to be or what are called Marlin Alice ... action\nOf deep diving into the poor people's campaign repairs breached organization I'll leave a landmark church pastor bring the Christian Church and I don't know the ship is what we do will sold the seed of future transformation or if we will see the ... is in the carrot tire which media but what I Do know\nIs as for me in our houses it's good to say we're going to continue to serve this call because we believe the law and justice emerged to those things are important and there's nothing more important than serving\nThat's the Reverend William Barber the second he's the pastor Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro North Carolina He's the founder and president of repairs of the breach as you just heard he's the author of many books and he is now a to have an Eighteen recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship a so called genius grant river Barbara thank you so much

R. A.

[noise] nah [noise]\n\nFrom the center for investigative reporting in ... or ... this is revealed an outlet\nFor telling a story about two men [noise] Prince Albert is in jail and Leon tennis zero is the district attorney who put him to be a can is arrow use Louisiana's three strikes law the ritual offender statutes Alaska Prince Albert for a really long sentence\nAnd reporter ... has been hearing a lot but it's not just Prince Albert it's dozens of people\nBelieve what did the d._a. have to say about this blowout\nThe d._a. promised me an interview for this story but he never gave it to me I asked over and over and each time he declined but I did talk to a bunch of people from all different sides of the courtroom the first person used to work for Kennedy era as an assistant prosecutor Gregory Thompson\nTo how long were you were a da a well\nIn regular years a seven years but India years of job like an attorney\nThompson worked for tennis arrow right after he was first elected I asked him how often the da's office used the habitual offender statue back then\nWhen I was going on and on one of the time I mean it was just it was a standard that was as\nEven lower her job offers relied or a better way of describing either it was when it was\nSo basically anytime that you could use that visual offender statue it was the policy of the da's office in Orleans Parish to use it\nCertainly I Can't think of an instance where we didn't do that\nOne way to think about the habitual offender statute is as a tool like a ranch or hammer something prosecutors can pull out of their tool box when they need it but it's like do you can has their own never puts this tool away it's always in his hand for every possible case\nThere's is minds of the the more before we locked up in the more time than we give people the more we want to stop Iran from foreigners fine as long as ... you know our services are under turns\nNew Orleans public defender Danny ... says Kennedy ... office still uses the ritual offender statue all the time and that makes guilt or innocence almost irrelevant instead it's all about a defendant's past their record\nAnd they are like that\nBut you did an analysis and found the vast majority of guys prosecuted under this law were black\nHe also found there were white men comic could have gone after but didn't in other words ... uses discretion to punish black men more harshly so in Nineteen Seventy five biggie and another jailhouse lawyer filed a civil rights suit alleging racial discrimination they sued comic\nHe loves to gun [laughter]\nYeah I forgot I did that us where but anyway Johnny Was cleaning the motives real so much and people\nWore cool hers\nTo plead guilty with the threat of main mode to build as soon as the life and so a lot of people who would bring your the even if they want to do\nSo be using this law courses innocent people to plead guilty\nAnd out everybody said that still true in New Orleans all the lawyers I talked to for this story which will get back to anyway biggies lawsuit against kind of getting go anywhere but he was a good jailhouse lawyer and after Twenty one years in prison he got himself out on lifetime parole\n\nSo kind of began using this law is a lot of people are most of them black men than whatever\nState after state started passing their own harsher three strikes allies and the prosecutors who came after comic kept going on that note guess who Harry kinda hired right out of law school to begin assistant da\nLimit is Leon Ken is there a bingo I'm\nMr ... was about prosecuting cases he certainly wanted us to be successful\nWhen Kennedy was an assistant ... almost five years then he ran for judge and one and for almost two decades every case he presided over came from ... office these are the legal waters Kennedy era learn to swim and\nOut I told you can is arrows used a lot more than two thousand six hundred times to send people to prison well Ninety percent of these people have been black\nNinety percent New Orleans is only around sixty percent black\nSo what'd you telling me is uh nothing's really change from the time but he was in prison\nIt's even worse now because so many more people have been locked up and from the inside Prince Albert sees what that looks like\n... to ... to the same for George [noise]\nEnded other people mentioned the habitual offender statue\nYes we'll ... for those of everything\nAnd all these other people were they also from Orleans Parish\nYeah [noise]\nKind of hard it was one of princes attorneys he's a public defender also a sharp a dresser blue suit and tie crisp white shirt\nMr Albert because of his car conditions his past felonies and they were on drug charges he faces circumstance where the either decided to go to trial or face life face like if you lose mandatory life basically the epitome of the three strikes you're out\nIt was for six to twelve and we're still come from a job and what it was over\nThere we're going to ignore one of those ... convictions and charged him as a double film you but they also include a number the number of the shows was to flat\nTen years in other words charge prince not for the three strikes just for two double bill him\nThough for was to use the bubble brew of virtual from [noise]\nWas this the first time you heard of that ...\n[noise] yeah those are the uh was referred river\nPrince was hoping for drug court some sort of program to help and kick ass habit and stay with us five kids\n... to Drew Drew\nYou feel like you were being black out more more like drug been corps in particular [noise]\nPrince had to make this decision outside a cramped courtroom people call the addict\nSmall courtroom and you know this is a very narrow hallway so a lot of our conversations we had to have around the corner where there's a little bit more standing [noise] and I remember there were two two women with him and his dad Conrad was there\nEric ... at ... or ... that were drawn from\n... she was very emotional and I remember going back and forth\nBecause I wanted to give him the time that you needed to discuss this with his family and they want to be intrusive\nPrinces sister ran Linda was there to\nHave to use a lot of you know he was only a half I put him in a drug for or something like that to help that silver haired occurred to me\nThere were a lot of tears at one point or recalling him being in prayer about it like literally huddling together really just deciding what to do\nThis was literally all morning and there was one point where I'll go back to resolve and it seemed like he wanted to take the risk and go to trial and then there was some points where like you know what I'm going to take this deal to just try one more time to see if you can you know they were lower and wish I did and they didn't\nReally know where to vote leader more Jews love for for ever loved struggled covering about ... above\n... through ... ...\n...\nI remember him saying in a very fate very defeated very little boys I'm I'm gonna take to do [noise] [noise]\n[noise] one of the things that\nYou have to do when you enter a plea of guilty and missed our we had to do Chris had to do was wonderful\nIs that I'm not into wars threaten or her into him and his plea of\nGuilty and he asked the initial that into their jaws when she asked it back to him yes ma'am [noise]\nWhatever you are faced with clean [noise]\nLife or ten years how is that not curse how would that not forced how is that not threatened but yet we have people every single day stand before a judge\nAnd they are entering this\nBecause they feel they have to avoid a worse consequence\n[noise]\nTwo thousand and twelve the your prince was prosecuted was tennis arrows high point for using the habitual offender statue he prosecuted five hundred people under the law that year it has gone down since then officially but even these numbers of people prosecuted under the law\nThey don't tell the full story ... ... what do you mean well the da's office also uses this law and a different way to get people to plead guilty in cases where the law never appears on the record\nFor example they'll tell someone charged with a misdemeanor crime a petty offense plead guilty or will bump up your charge to a felony which is much more serious crime New Orleans public defender Lauren Anderson sees this every day\nWith a client has for example a simple battery charge which is a misdemeanor\nBut there was some kind of object he's then out we've been told you know well if they don't do it over here\nAnd like all across the street and aggravated battery so they'd be looking at twenty to life on it for ... you're saying that they would change the charge so that they could then and finally the multiple bell correct exactly and there was no record of this\nNone it's behind the scenes part of verbal ... negotiations between prosecutors and defense attorneys\nAnd remember in these cases the d._a. never officially charges that have digital offender statute his prosecutors just say they will if the defendant doesn't plead guilty so all traces of the law just disappear\nSo we don't even know how many people were talking about here\nRight we know Ken is there a used a lot in over two thousand six hundred cases but that number is just the tip of the iceberg [noise]\nOoh [noise]\nOf course Ken is there refused to be interviewed for this story\nWhich is frustrating because he's an elected official\nBut he did offer a statement about princes case here a few parts that stood out to me Mr Albert\nVoluntarily entered into a ... agreement and received a legal sentence under Louisiana law if he believes himself not guilty he could've exercised his constitutional right to stand trial then Kennedy era said my hope is that Mr Albert will apply himself toward programs by which to better himself\nAnd eradicate his substance abuse issues while in prison [noise]\n\nAfter I requested to interview ... he was moved from one jail to another to begin a drug program I asked him if this was the first time in his seven years locked up that he'd been in a program to treat addiction our connection wasn't great\nBut his stores corporate office wouldn't let him he told me shoplifting is a constant problem\nHe still kept his people stealing but now after the police come and arrest them the da says just to let them go with a ticket when somebody does end up in a city residents prosecutors sometimes withdraw their case anyway the guy said one habitual shoplift or came back to his store and stole again so fast\nThat he still had the cheese sandwich from jail and his backpack [noise]\n\nThis summer I ask ... office for some data I wanted to know eight months into his term what were they actually doing with the police still arresting people for prostitution and shoplifting and was his office turning all those cases away his press guy handed me some statistics about five minutes before I sat down with crowds and our for an interview\nSo I've just got this um and I have other questions for you but I'm curious you know what to do\nWith this the first time your office has kind of done it tally of the cases you're accepting and declining in this way\nThis is these are first metrics I have seen\nOr we have general sense of what we were doing because we passed certain policies that cannot help but push us in this direction but these metrics or the first that I've seen and so for example\nThey reflect the fact that we're no longer charging such workers with crimes because suddenly book review them for the most part is victims are we\nOn the piece of paper I could see that overall ... office had declined to prosecute about seven percent of the cases the police brought them that means that the police had arrested someone in each of those cases and each time the da's office had said no let him go or not charging them\nUnder the previous da ... however it around two or three percent\nTwo and a half percent declaration rate is a rubber stamp that means what ever go but we want is what I Will do\nCrafts there's office is on track to charge about two thousand fewer we'd possession prostitution and shoplifting cases this year that's compared to what the da's office did and twenty Seventeen two thousand fewer cases\n[noise] so what about all those people the people ... trying to help find not putting them in jail\nThan I Love you come here\nWe're talking about what it's like in jail\nHi this is Amanda I met her in Kensington a neighborhood in North Philly people are selling buying injecting drugs out in the open I'm just going to use first names for the women I talked to there since they all had outstanding fines and more and\nAmanda says she's been arrested twelve times for prostitution and told me the cops have sometimes been rough with her arresting are so many times also just seemed like a waste of resources I'm a I think on the whole prostitution thing I think it's a great idea with them not charging anybody with anything\nThis is what I had expected here then I ducked into the backyard of a recovery house a place for women trying to stop using drugs to sit down with another woman named Shannon tell I asked ... what did she thinks of ... decision to stop charging most prostitution cases\nAll yeah I don't think that's a good idea\n[laughter] she didn't tell stopped using heroin and moved into this recovery house a few weeks ago but she's been caught up in shoplifting and doing sex work to pay for drugs for years she kept saying that Phillies opioid problem is out of control especially in this neighborhood\nAnd it's it's a big problem and alteration and people don't want to vote you get involved but if we avoid it\nIt's not just going to go away it's not just going or\nIs it does not charging shoplifting and prostitution seem like avoiding the problem view\nYes absolutely yes absolutely as long as they're condoning my bad behavior\nShane tell is very clear she is not saying jail is the answer but the idea of getting ignored by law enforcement as flawed as the system is that feels to tell like people in power are saying we don't care what happens to you\nAnd saying well we just can't keep sending you to jail so here you go just\nTo believe in in like death you know it's cool just living in how everything will be fine with no way out [noise]\nI told ... office which had tell said press person sent me a statement saying they do want people like\nHer to have a way out they see sex workers as victims who need help\nAnd the da's office can help them if somebody's been convicted a few times before for prostitution crashed our policy is to charge them and then instead of sending them to jail put them in a diversion program where they get connected to rehab and counseling\nBut Crowder office also said charging is really not the best way to help people election tell because that can leave them stuck with a criminal record bottom line it should be easier to get help without ever getting arrested or charged at all\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] our\nPresenter maintains that the other crimes he's declining to charge specially marijuana possession just fall into the category of gum\nSlides climbing the prosecution of dumb we can put

chance of limiting climate change to the sort of moderate manageable level which is considered a hundred or sorry not hundred that would be a lot\nFrom one point five degrees Celsius or to point seven degrees Fahrenheit above pre industrial levels um so this is\nOne point five is kind of seen as the guard rail that's like the most we can injure without having kind of cataclysmic consequences\nAnd I'm a leaked report that came out a few months ago actually found that our chance of hitting that is very low um basically unless there is a massive deployment of technologies to remove carbon\nFrom the atmosphere which doesn't really exist at that scale um and so these conversations right now are basically like how dire is the situation um and how would you\nWhat language could possibly express

telescope in Hawaii and the confirmed the repeated observations and it has a really weird lopsided orbit um that takes it like way out beyond most of the rest of the giant planets in our solar system Jupiter and Saturn Uranus and Neptune\nUm and it actually takes forty thousand years to circle the sun and the plane and just work planet it's really exciting to researchers because it's skewed orbit is so weird that there's suggest that there's something out there they call it a massive ...\nUm that maybe as shepherding it and other dwarf planets I'm Around the edge of the solar system and so the

suggestion that it's there\nThose are believing Pluto still apply to call the ... the ... yeah [laughter] that's fascinating thank you for taking time to be with us today yeah thank you Dr Kaplan science reporter at the Washington Post now it's time to play a good thing bad thing [noise]\nEvery story has a flipside\nCalifornia already leads the nation in solar electric generation getting a sixth of its power from the sun\nHas plentiful geothermal power too and it is done them up and down by when turbans but last month California Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill that mandates the state get a hundred percent of its power from clean energy sources that includes renewables in nuclear power buddy you're twenty forty five\nAnd as a state prepares to ... it might do well to remember that not all renewables are created equal according to two studies out this week the environmental and atmosphere impacts of wind power needs to be further considered David Keith is one of the authors\nHe's a professor of engineering and public policy at Harvard and he joined us by Skype welcome to science friday\nDavid on your show I'm Erin how are you very well thank you great to be on the show\nOh thank you I'm Glad you said that again I'm Talking about wind power debt has definitely got some good things going for it right but this is a little cautionary tale\nDavid are you there David I guess we've lost ... ...\nYeah okay well we're going to let me get back there to get back to David a little bit later but in instead of owner bring on the Nobel Prize winner Dr Francis Arnold she's only the fifth woman to ever be awarded a prize in chemistry welcome to science friday\nThank you so much Ira\nIt's so nice to have you congratulations\nWell thank you [laughter] else done or what is\nMore stunning is with the fact that you won the prize or there or is there some part of the fact that I a woman was chosen to win a prize\nOf course I'm thrilled to be chosen I Hope it's not just because I'm a woman but I'm also thrilled to be a woman who won the prize\n... we had Sarah capital and just on the Washington Post saying that I'm twenty nine pain that the Nobel Committee has directed people or or to look more inclusive\nWell that's good there are a lot of brilliant women who do chemistry and do chemistry at the highest levels so I think that's a good thing and Lucy Moore Nobel Prizes to women\nThey think you're being an inspiration to some women are thinking about science\n[noise] well I Hope so ...\nA lot to talk about the ah just ... been a couple of minutes but we'll have to take the break what do you think that you're in your work what your greatest contributions so far has\nBeen\nWell I teach some of the smartest people in the world who come to the California Institute of technology to do science\nAnd over my career I've worked with hundreds of really the smartest people in the world and I would hope that my greatest contribution is the some of their creativity in contributions ...\nUh do you feel like I I Love looked at your career you started out and and and sort of winning all kinds of different directions what finally got through to where you are\nWell sometimes it's important to go in different directions you learn different ways of thinking that you can put together a new ways\nAh finally I stumbled on biotechnology at the beginning of the DNA revolution and\nThe ability to engineer the most complicated things on the planet biological systems the guts and you're the microbes in your gut oh that's where I where I ended up and I've been ever since has just love it\nAll right we're going to talk more with police were going to talk more with Dr Arnold recipient of the twentieth the Nobel Prize in chemistry she is the line is polling professor of chemical engineering bioengineering and chemistry Cal Tech and a board member of a lumina the gene sequencing company\nIn San Diego if you'd like to talk with a doctor on them were very happy to have you can you give us a call for for seven to for eight to five five\nAnd also tweet us at sigh fry we'll be right back after this break [noise]\nI'm Ira Flatow this is

Ira Flatow and you're listening to science friday we're talking with Dr Francis Arnold recipient of the twenty teen Nobel Prize in chemistry\nUm [noise] hey ... a lot of people think you're a scientist but you were a very proud of engineer are you not\nI Am tell us what the differences well I Love\nTo build things I'd like to make new things that didn't exist before of course chemists do that as well they build new molecules so we're we're blending together chemistry and engineering in evolution of new proteins how do you build\nThat I was watching a to a Ted Talk you gave it was quite fascinating and you talked about being able to sit down at a keyboard and type out a recipe for some form of new genetic smell it out and and what a new gene comes back to you\n[laughter] years it's really amazing has changed so much in the thirty years that I've been doing this\nSo that today you really can't type out a DNA sequence now whether it's a recipe is a different story and we can talk about that but you can type out a DNA sequence email it off to your favorite supplier of DNA and they will send you back in the mail that DNA\nAnd we have an excerpt up at science friday that comes slash logic welcome back your junior high thanks for having me back to pan of playing going oh it's going very well thank you very much we love to have you with a really fun there was a\nUm you know you looked around and and thought we all need a better understanding of how logic works well what what on earth made you think of that\nWell I have to give credit to my students at the schools the audience to hew to Chicago because I learned so much from them and when teaching goes well it's a two way process\nAnd my students have pushed me to think about it she's a social justice because they care about those questions so much and if you can find what your students care about and tap into that then you can teach them so much better\nThrough things that are already motivating to them and so I gradually found more and more ways to think about mathematics by asking questions about social justice and then the rebels happened as well when I understood a lot more about these questions by using a mathematical framework\nAnd my students was so a helpful in doing that I learned so much and so while I really should share this with the rest of the world and that's how this came up about\nWhat would be the eight hundred pound gorilla in the room at least for me is ...\nBecause we too we argue all the time here or what is the point of arguing logically if people are bringing emotions to the table and don't really\nCare about the facts and and now we we can't even agree with the facts are don't don't you need to agree on something to be able to argue logically\nIt's a very good question and it can sometimes seem very few tile at the moment I've if maybe we just doomed to take sides\nAnd the trouble is that if we think we're doomed to take sides then we will be ... very self fulfilling prophecy whereas I have found ways to understand what other people often king from that point of view and to find ways of bridging the gap to show that we're not actually\nOn completely different planet it's not black and white it's usually that that some kind of gray area in between and if I can find that we're both on the same gray area just in different places and it's much easier to think about sliding around it\nDown to think about flipping an entire coin onto the other side\nThis is science friday from WNYC Studios I'm Ira Flatow talking with Dr Eugene Chang author of the art of the ... of logic in an illogical world I'm so one of the first things you acknowledged that the real world isn't actually logical [laughter]\nBut we had a lot of use but we get we can get a lot of useful work done in the abstract\nWorld yes we can find the logic inside situations even if the whole situation isn't completely logical and the discipline of mathematics begin with abstraction well you shave away some of the details on completely relevant to the situation to find out what's really going on at route\nAnd when you go to the root it that that you look at the logic\nAnd when you shave away those details you find that a lot of different situations become the same route and that gives you a way of connecting different situations I'm tapping into some understanding that you've achieved elsewhere and making connections between things but\nI I think that the shape that shaving away process [noise] excuse me is probably one of the most difficult parts it\nMight be quite difficult and it's one of the things that is off putting about mathematics people often say to me I was finally math until the numbers became lapses\nAnd somehow that says scary step but actually numbers are already obstruction federal ready things where we shaved away the details that two cookies onto apple will if you ignore the fact that that cookies and Apple's then you get the concept is too and we can do this with arguments in real life as well where we can shave away details and discover\nThat arguments about say voter suppression have something in common with all these about ... minutes about cancer screening and arguments about accusations of sexual harassment for example because they're all about what do we care about false positives mall or false negatives mall\nAnd then we can see that those arguments come up and questions about social services any questions about who should go to university and those questions all over the place\n... what are some of the most common ways that you see people being illogical when the orange\nOne of the basic ones is when they simply use the wrong definitions writes stops and this is one of the key ways in which we might think that people are using the wrong facts\nAnd so for example I've seen arguments on the Internet\nGoodness me there are some bad arguments on the Internet ever I've seen arguments on the Internet where people say things like they they believe that all immigrants are illegal and that is not correct or they they they support\nThe Affordable CARE Act but not Obamacare and they've got the wrong definition of Obamacare in that case or that was a study a survey of undergraduate male students that showed that many of them said that they would have known consensual sex if they feel they could get away with it but they would definitely not commit rape\nWhich means they've got their own definition of rape\nSo we have to agree on terms\nBut we do and that's something that mathematicians have I castle about agreeing on Tom's right at the beginning so then another very common era that people make is when they make a false equivalence between one argument on another argument on this often happens\nIn what's called a strongman arguments but like the south Dakota store puffing because I didn't like Jen during things I'm necessarily but if you make an argument that seems quite reasonable to you sometimes somebody will replace it with a much more extreme arguments\nAnd believe that that's what you are trying to say and then they'll knock it down because the extreme argument is much easier to knock down\nAnd that can be very aggravating because that essentially painting you in a very bad light and then taking a moral high ground\nI Know that argument well talking with Dr Eugene Chang author of the art of logic in logical world joined a sunny for for seven to four to five five eight four foresight talks you can also tweet us at scifri if I were going to take a quick
