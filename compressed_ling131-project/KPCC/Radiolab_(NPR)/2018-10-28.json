{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "I'm All right you know and it was almost this way of trying to convince myself that things weren't\nAs desperate as they really are\nAnd then I Would go into my room [noise] late at night and I would have thoughts of\nYou know ending my life [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nSo I sat there that night beside a bottle of pills with a pen and paper in my hand I thought about taking my own life and I came this close\nTo doing it came as close to junior and I didn't\nSo that makes me one of the lucky ones one of the people who gets to step out on the ledge and look down but not jump one of the lucky ones Who Survives fly survived and that just lives with my story and my story is this\nFor simple words I suffer from depression unfortunately we live in a world where if you break your arm everyone runs over to sign your cat\nBut if you tell people you're depressed everyone runs the other way that the stigma\n\n... time as you were experiencing some of this you were trying to like launch a career as a standup comic\n[noise] yeah and the absolute mecca of show business and Victoria, BC Canada yeah totally so well like we're struggling with crippling depression you were trying to [noise] funny to um like people in comedy houses\nA Josh yeah I Know it's just sort of cliche so many away but yeah it is yeah I Know exactly I you know look I think this is part of it too right is there's this big idea that kind of says you know everyone and who does comedy or anyone is a comedian is this sort of sad clown and\nYou know they have all these issues and you know and sometimes I Do feel a little bit stereotypical kind of living in to that idea\nBut for me you just got to think about it this way which is that when I was really recovering during that time might constant sense of\nFeeling better was watching comedy I was obsessed or you\nAre you comfortable like joking about depression and mental illness or is there like a ... as in like a pretty like draw a line at it I'm\nIt's difficult because I Would never want to make a joke that would seem as though it's demeaning those experiences but one of the most interesting things as we kind of put up these walls in her mind around certain topics right and we go we can't laugh at that that's not funny\nAnd when you were saying that what are you really sad\nLike that's too serious to laugh at that is too important to laugh at and I really thought about that question for\nA long time and then realized\nBut that's one of the best ways into these conversations\n\nWe don't know what it is to hurt\nKnew what it is a pain in her heart and we all know how important it is to heal\nThe right now depression is society deep cuts to working tend to put a band aid over pretend it's not their relatives there\nIt is in there and you know what it's OK\nDepression is okay if you're going through I Know that you're okay I Know that you're ... you're not reach and it's an issue not an identity because when you get past the fear and the ridicule in the judgment and the stigma of others you can see the pressure for what it really is [noise] and that's just a part of life\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nYeah I mean it's almost like that pain is a source of material like it's like you have to have that pain to [noise] to have something to be funny\nYeah and I think in my perspective on that would be not even just to have somebody to be funny about to know why it even matters to be happy\nTo look at it passed just oh that's you know a good laugh and just see what that really means to someone on a spiritual or emotional level and I think that we live in this world now\nThat is so serious and so many ways and we're so plugged into our technology and we're so plugged into these external realities that feel like they're constantly you kind of knocking on the door of our mind and just begging for our attention and\nTo laugh is to find yourself back in the moment to laugh has to be free and so many ways\nAnd so for myself that's just something that I think about all the time and I try and bring into my work is just that's what I'm really here to do if I'm here to serve someone that's the way I'm serving them and that's what means the most to me\nI had this moment when I was Seventeen years old and I can remember this so clearly where I was really asking myself this question of am I going to pursue this you know is this gonna be the path that I follow and I one day saw what what's the definition of laughter\n[noise] like I don't even know [noise] and I went and I looked it up in the dictionary and it said the definition of laughter is the tangible evidence of how [noise] and\nTo me that changed my whole life because I just sweat yes like that's what comedy gave me was this tangible sense of hope this not just an escape from my problems but it's completely different reality in which I Would be so overwhelmed with the present moment with laughter that I couldn't even remember what\nThis struggle that I was experiencing on the day to day was\nAnd that changed everything for me [noise]\nKevin briel that comedian and author of the book boy meets

I'm Robert Krulwich uses radio lab and today we have a legal case\nWell it's actually it's ... it's really more than just a legal\nCase this case it's it's a what my husband and I refer to as a mental magnet once you start thinking about it it won't go away that it gets under your skin this is Lisa ... I'm a law professor at Catholic university\nAt the Columbia school of law where she teaches legal ethics and she said I'm not too long ago with me and our producer Brenna feral who brought us this story and under whose skin it also seems to have gotten\nThat was a lose lose case there's no money in it you know the prosecution had three eyeball witnesses they had his car at the scene of the crime and they had a two week flight was he was guilty and I said\nI'm a I'm not going to try to prove you didn't do it or when we were going to say the difference maybe Guerra murdered this kid but maybe it was because he is temporarily gone insane plenty he's crazy he really believes this I'm telling you that my ...\nAnd then on top of that our money tells in most of the skin with big case we pull this off of which were made to take your while but eventually he says I'm ...\nNow we're into a late August Nineteen Seventy three so we went up to the hospital\nWhen they got there they went up to ... up on the fifth floor of the hospital police are standing guard they walked into the room\nAnd seen them in a while and we read as each other and we talk\nAnd just a picture this gym told me that the room they put the arrow in was what he described as a training observation room which meant that it had a big window that ran alongside girls bed so they could keep an eye on them and the cops are stationed right outside just watching [noise]\nAnd according to a gym and I should say I've heard differing accounts about this but apparently the cops had brought in a liberator to try and ... I I don't think you can do that right I mean that's not legal yeah I I think that's probably not okay um but from the cops perspective\nThey think that he's involved in a recent murder\nAnd a missing girl and they think that girl could still be alive so they want to know absolutely anything they can that's going to get them closer\nTo solving that murder and finding that girl but at the same time the defendant has to be able to share absolutely every thing with the lawyers and know that they're in that safe space of that relationship\nBecause we have sixth amendment right to counsel and the Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate oneself\nIf you judge freely speak ... journey than you have no real Justice Souter\nAnd army in ... they need as much information about what Gary was done as they possibly can get so they can start to build their defense\nI don't like surprises I'm the kind that wants to know everything\nWhile so so that as a lawyer you're in a strange spot here\nMhm he needed to get from Gary out his story and it needed to be just that me didn't want the cops in on it yet and\nYou don't know of dirt track tuna rumor was\nSo their turn off the TV turn up the fans but uh he was playing games you know talking basically about anything but but the case has kept saying he couldn't remember he couldn't remember and\nThey're trying to convince him like you've got to talk to us if you're going to have any shot\nIs like a Lynch mob both the police pretty much have you cold there's witnesses and Guerra knew he could be going to prison he could be going to prison for a long time maybe twenty five to life and pet it found prison you have to be careful things get rough\nBut they tell him if you talk to us maybe we can get you not guilty by reason of insanity that was only two friends to help get Guerra into a mental hospital instead of a person that was the goal is if you have anything to say you know\nIt took several conversations to get good at this point but finally Darrell Puerto solo\nAnd what he said how he said it that's that's waiting on the other side of this very brief break we'll be right back\n[noise] Hi my name is David David over and I'm calling from the Netherlands radio lab for five to ... an online service that lets people send and receive money internationally and their borders accounts\nLess customers hold and concert multiple currencies at anytime lord ... dot com and the\nStandard of characters and trade are really around the corner\nPreventing future her a new podcast that explores the work of change makers across the country and highly project from cities like Miami Washington DC and New York city ... heart available on apple podcasts or wherever\nContests are found\nAfter Hurricane Maria leisure Puerto Rico declared does equal crisis was over so far we are not defecting Neal cases of the time\nBut it turns out the government just stopped looking for ...

[noise]\nSusan pets was from Chicago She's a girl I mentioned earlier cops are already looking for her hoping that Carol might have some information\nEarlier that summer her boyfriend had been found murdered the two of them are dead and camping and Susan had been gone ever since at least you're how she was a high school girl from Syracuse she had gone missing just a couple of days before Susan everybody thought she might have just run away but Guerra told the lawyers\nThat he had killed them and where he had left their bodies one odd thing about arrows description of the incidents he doesn't say I killed her she says she got stabbed with mine nights\nShe stayed with my life\nLike it wasn't even in doing the stabbing right like this is what do you do first and foremost you have to ask yourself is this true\nYou know your client is obviously severely mentally ill this could be a dream he had it could be a delusion\nIf you're going to go and um you know craft an argument and present a strategy you need to know uh what actually happened they'll do you walk out the door he grabs Frank and he says he says let's go so they they slip outside they get in the car and we take off to go\nLook for the bodies Guerra told the lawyers that Susan pets was in an era event of a closed up mine shaft\nThe mind is up ... about an hour south of the hospital ... federal runners and in that moment were you scared were you excited like oh you're you're up high it's high\nBut you're scared you're concerned yes fear\nYour food if you do in fact at one point looking in the rearview mirror they got a little bit we thought we were being followed by the state police\nSo eventually they pull over get out of the car\nAnd went into one bar where one of France's bell jeez I'm lady friends was hanging out\nFor about thirty minutes bells you talk to her then he asked if he could borrow a car\nAnd then we went up to the back door [noise]\nTook of\nDriving the lady friends car to try to lose too\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here this measure\nAs far as we walk up to this old abandoned mine [noise]\nWent out there last February\nWith reporter Lauren that chemistry and towns supervisor of Mariah Tom's 'cause if I have a system a road that goes to the mind is what is your after their minds [noise] it was this sort of hilly area off the side of the road to visit\nTrailed around or you're just a very icy that day this hair is used to be an overall\nWe're walking up a very wooded hills is fairly the there were no leaves and all the trees were black and I'm Sorry skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that are many and this is the only way they came in\nHere for ... right up there so here we are in our Sunday suits and rebuild trudging choose for is looking for\n[noise]\nBut I couldn't tell him Andy thing\nIn Iran he just he says no I Can't tell you there's nothing I can tell you\nWhat do you remember trying to reassure him that look I've got a meeting set up\nAll I can say is it's a state investigators and the prosecutor on the case\nThey could have some information for trying to give them hope that we were brings to conclusion I thought he would return\nSo then when Mr pet sleeves is Romani he loses it needs through a bunch of books because for basically just you know destroyed his office\nJust trying to really much\nThat I couldn't help the ...\nBecause he's looking right at this man knowing exactly\nWell imagining what he's going through like our money had lost a brother\nYes was much younger you for your ...\nHere's an air force pilot or three kids and in Nineteen sixty to his plane went down and he was lost at sea\nSo after that Armani said his mother she'd be up at night crying she would like go to bed at night\nAnd my mother would wake up screaming ... reading um\nYou know she could liberal recover from it\nBecause you can't you know you just you don't really know but you know it's\nSo I can understand\nAnd that's you know that's partly why this was so hard for our mind because when that ... deal fell apart that was his chance to try to get this information to the families when the police all through he didn't have any other options for sharing that information he stuck\nWhat so what happens next so they have to go to trial and that means that our money and Dell gee out the knuckle down and try to present an insanity defense\nMeanwhile our money he said he couldn't sleep he was having nightmares\nWake up to thirty in the morning or the sweat running on your back\nDoes it at the kitchen table drinking coffee and just waiting for the morning paper to come because he was just alone with that he was alone with the secret and he knew that moment the police\nAre trying to find these girls he knows that the parents are holding out hope that they might still be alive you\nAre you're questioning yourself very\nHurting people so you begin to wonder am I in the right profession you know your\nFor and you're looking for ways to give the information you know ... coal\nSure\nWell [laughter] if I'm going to do and then we'll do it openly\nYeah uh I Know\nTo do you ever have you ever break\nKnow according to him now you know in my mind was doing was thought was the proper ethical and legal moral moral thing\nTo do and then\nIn December of Nineteen Seventy three five months after the girls disappear their bodies happened to be discovered within two weeks of each other students bodies discovered by two kids were playing up in the mines Alicia um I guess it's I think a student from Syracuse University which is right next door to the\nCemetery is walking through and stumbled upon her and so she's discovered than to and then six months later in the summer of Nineteen Seventy four\nOpening day of the trial might be one of the most significant even though\nRobert ... trial for the murder of gulp and blue ski begins\nRobert ... primary line of defense or apparently the not guilty by reason of insanity\nSo in order to make that case what they decided to do is is to put ... on the stand and you just get the facts\nAnd Guerra would tell his whole life story through a shock the jury's mind including all these murders and all these rapes ... at the time he was nuts Sharon Smith gentle flicks news in like ...\nSo the trial opens um the courtroom is jam packed prosecution starts they have a really good case they've got a good lawyer from Syracuse that joined to help the guy from Hamilton County\nAnd then it's time for the defense to start their case to Belgium stands up and he calls his first witness Robert De Niro to the stand\nGuerra gets on stand and he starts telling his life story and it's horrible\n[noise] severe beatings and abused by parents very little education basically gets\nSent off to a farm to work like as an indentured servants when he's seven you know slaughtering bowls and he's eight years old weird stuff like that he started drinking blood I'm having sex with the animals and then he starts admitting to a series of rapes throughout his adult life and he\nAdmits to killing Alicia and Susan and what happens next and nobody's quite sure if it was a slip up or maybe it was on purpose but when Garrett was talking about Susan pets bell gee says is that the one I found\n\nIs that the one I found so the cat was out of the back then\nThe next day Belgian Armani will to press conference to try to explain why they haven't told us\nFor ...\nHours before the service because they have a duty to protect our clients secret ... or ... you know but\nEveryone is disgusted with columns written editorials written letters to the editor\nOr just no way in the world you're going to prevent your average non lawyer everybody turned against them but this has anything short of shabby version of the law of justice\nPretty soon one of the prosecutors let out that our money and Dell jihad actually tried to use these dead girls as leverage for Guerra\nThe headlines in the Syracuse papers would say body's used as pawns on a game of war bedrooms\nOr money was getting death threats in the mail or just as crazy phone call people calling saying stuff like how can you live with yourself I'm going to kill you really good at one point he finds a dead fish in his car his wife\n... Molotov cocktail in the back yard he started to carry a purse through my bag he kept shock on in the car he kept on in the house so recruits leave\nThose those are the worst moment to or [noise] or some horrible for\nHis marbles floats\nJune twenty seventh Robert ... rose convicted for the murder of ... he's given the maximum sentence he's given twenty five years to life in a maximum security prison how ... how did that feel for you\nRelief you know it's over would\nBut then it is up to the grand jury itself in their investigation to determine which charges they bring again to eternity\nPretty soon after the verdict our money and build you learn that they could be facing criminal charges no one's really sure exactly what those might be but it could be something like tampering with evidence obstruction of justice or\nState public health law and religion that says the body must be given quick in decent burial and on top of that\n... ... worms or group or a beer or where\nThere was an ethical complaints filed against their money in Belgium so basically they were then facing disarming an investigation into the ethical complain that would drag on several years\nSpelled you started drinking heavily abandoned his law practice and moved to Florida or money toughed it out but he suffered\nA no one wanted him as a lawyer anymore or it was like well what else can\nI Do to make a living\nHe was just barely getting by for a little while I think the ... all over the stress and pressure to choose to do in fact he has a heart attack\nUm while this is all going on but eventually the criminal charges are dropped and the ethical complaint is dismissed and the reason in the opinion of the court and the the state bars the\nBelgian or money did was write\nWhat they did was good exactly according to the law and my view is Frank our money is a you know real life hero I always say you know people so admire Atticus Finch and the difference between Atticus Finch and Frank our money is that our money is a real person\nAt least it told me about this penalty organized\nBack in two thousand seven it was for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility\nAnd there were about four hundred people in the room most of them lawyers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was a love\nFeast does what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed the uh\nI don't go was here are just was a lawyer to do this\nJob a ... I was a good lawyer research\nThought so art everybody\nUm and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about\nAnd what our money in Belgium did a good body is case it's taught in all schools across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone what people think what if\nWhat if what if you will face so I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham just stand\nUp um I agree um his duties to his client who represents his client's best interest if you've been sitting in on these", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "28"}
