I I decided to do it and I go in the cabin I came here yeah and that's a very useful to distinguish these different kinds of ... of actions but it doesn't mean that the experience of election\nCaused the action\nAnd it doesn't mean that ... behavior doesn't exist of course it's a thing and every action that we experience is voting tree is shaped by a whole history of previous violent reactions um that we've\nExecuted during our lifetimes about social and cultural context of a developmental and and even our evolutionary heritage indeed do all of these factors play in to every action that we do whether we experience it as ... well not\nSo interesting about consciousness is is that what makes us us right like like that's what makes us human but there are a lot of people in the world who who believe that we are not that far off from like AI becoming conscious right and and behaving in responding in thinking as we do\nThat's right I mean but I think that belief is driven by a couple of factors one factor is just this this cultural a phenomenon ... we've had this throughout culture of robots developing intelligence and then becoming conscious refer you to see is right and we see this for me just read this time and I said we see this Blade Runner\nI'm In very different ways you know I Love Blade Runner I'm a bit frustrated by the ... view of\nOf ... technology and write books we see this in a beautiful film ex mackinaw which I think really interrogate specifically issues behind this\nIn a huge interesting way but yet that this cultural trucks that intelligence and consciousness go together and that I Will develop awareness at some point um the other factor that's playing into it and this is the one I think is perhaps a bit more\nDamaging is what I have come to a quarter punishes ... and this isn't the idea that we humans we say well what's special about as we were trying to find out what's special about us maybe it's not that we have a soul and other animals die\nWell maybe it's that we're intelligent maybe we have minded is somehow different an order of magnitude different from the minds of other creatures or or of objects its intelligence that set says ... makes a special and we're conscious\nSo does this tendency we have to say that these two things together like well you know we're intelligent and we're conscious so intelligence and consciousness should go together\nBut actually that really doesn't have to be the case you certainly don't have to be very intelligent in order to experience pain and suffering and so we can imagine that that plenty of\nOther animals that may not school very highly you know a very human centric measure of intelligence but nonetheless have they've been conscious experiences\nSo to me these things why against the idea that that ... is headed on another ... tree towards being conscious but yeah certainly possible that the near future we'll see as being able to build up to facts that give the impression\nOf being conscious and that somebody picks out a very interesting space in the future\nWhat will happen to our interactions with each other and with other animals when our environment support he liked to buy things that give you the ... of being conscious of being intelligent but for which we have no\nWay really of knowing whether they are not sending their confidence in saying that they all countries [noise] is that going to change the way we do you have to things that are actually conscious\nI think that's a definitely a worry\nAnd now says he's a professor of neuroscience at the University of ... you can see his full talk at Ted that income\n[noise]\n\n\nHe\nThinks listening to our show this week what makes us I guess\nIf you want to find out more about he was on it go to head that NPR dot O.

Robert Krulwich radiolab and today\n[noise] they're gonna start this show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times we've had on the show before than say something high [laughter] [laughter]\nOkay I think it's good\nAll right where we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning yeah start getting ill is what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nIs growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and\nKilled when that became a national\nStory [noise] there was a lot of belly aching and press how many people do we see killed in the United states about why the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nWe are Fifteen and I don't I don't know Marlene story I don't\nMarlon is three years my age I'm thirty in the morning and he was\nAllegedly being thought or not when you see now\nI guess I'm kind of community control we supposed to be home by\nHe's on probation for drug charge been caught with some painkillers so he ran in immediately the cop car followed them in and then the Marlins flip pelvic ... hidden costs when\nAnd so on and on the car for about\nYeah yep crystals neighbor's got out to the scene and\nWe sat and late at four or five hours until they were able to get the guy [noise]\nMine was pronounced dead [noise] until ... when I talk for a little bit and I are\nOr just walking around started induced myself people were you guys from Florida Tampa, Florida are you from Tampa okay so we just made the drive and I don't quite know what I was expecting I guess I just thought it was you know going to be a local event for this one person but\nAs I started to meet people I started meet people from all over from Tampa from Palm Beach whereabouts in New York I mean there were people from all over the country is slapped by Strickland Chicago Georgia in\nThe last time\nI started seeing these people who win the T shirts in check and then you had to do with the big picture of a young black man's face or a name that they represent aim to watch out there was one woman with a picture of her son's eighth grade graduation photo on her shirt says capping down\nAnd read he was fourteen years old when he was killed he was buried in the same cap and gown met another mother\nIs going on for years so I have maybe about six or seven where the\nName of her twenty three year old son Rodney Mitchell on her shirts\nAnd we actually have the right to black and yellow and\nHalf to Jamaica tell her what\nI certainly shirt after shirt after sure and I think by the time like forty people had shut up and they're all these different shirts I realize like\nOh this is not just a thing for one person this is a network\nLike almost everyone there had lost either a cousin or a brother or a husband\nLike even even daughter to police violence and in fact when I spoke to one of those women you just heard at one with like wait a minute and touch a Clinton had twenty four year old son rocky Mitchell he was shot and killed by police during a traffic stop we're actually going to get into that story later but she told\nMe that I've met about four hundred other mothers they've reached out to me and I were a hundred oh yeah really yeah through like traveling around through Facebook I've met four hundred other mothers would love to your children while [noise] and so I was just seemed\nLike a fraction of that occurs community center got the scales rising rate and the other thing for me was how you see these stories\nPop up thirty seven year old Alton Sterling forty year old is parents ... I'll be the ones that get pulled up to like a national level and you see the family members come out and man\nWho oppose holding\nFor like two days you see them on television that big bad\nThat big fat and do\nThen they kind of recede mhm\nAnd they're gone I guess what I thought it you know probably they have these long drawn out legal battles and then [noise] you know they go back to their lives whatever like whatever that means\nBut instead it's like oh no what happens is they get like folded up into this network\nSo one of those ... several incidences of\nAnd so at the community center there was a moment of prayer where the forty to fifty people sat down at these big round dining tables he\n\nWants to do\nHarmless or is it hot dogs you know we're just for the for the students\nAnd so after the prayer Christel House back in the room for everybody to eat so everyone stood up\nAnd then by just totally changed in somebody put on some M. J. and a lot of people started crowd around these two big picnic\nAnd they didn't find a I'm not going to make one\nWhich is where I met this woman I mean the only comment I was looking for it was just described for me what we got on the table because I'm just ah what not to have you had just went from the I mean this this cable right and so I think you have you have to have on you\nYou've got to ask you got your breath and you've got to bake it you've got you got everything you want to\nTo get nice good old on day [laughter]\nOh a Geneva read beyond the mother Sandra Bullock in case you don't remember [noise]\nFor South is she didn't\nGive me a few minutes aren't senior plan\nIs pulled over in a small town in Texas the cop runs or information comes back to the car\nMine for not your cigarettes please\nOr no you don't have the right out of the car and I have the right thing to do that do have a right now\nMold for a man out for our movie I'm giving you a lawful order hit hard\nAnd you know mentally seem to get out of the car what you're doing all of it as well [noise]\n\nMuch\nInto was eventually taken in jail for days later in that jail cell she was found\nDead hang with the plastic garbage bag the debt Israel to suicide and centers family disputed that ruling\nYou've got everything you want to have to get nice good full day\nI got to get him a show in Geneva Greenville I'm the mother Sandra Bland rain coming from chatter I Want to let you are you one thing I Would have to have you come to come to that was like this before Oh yes sir quite a few of\nUs in Missouri last week we go all around we try to avoid if many mothers that we can because it's important that exactly like is that what it is it really just like us more Yes sir it's really support because that mother\nWho has lost their baby needs to be able to see somebody else who looks like them in the same situation that they are as opposed to someone walking up to them and saying I Know how you feel but you really don't [noise]\nWhich made me think about something better than I had talked about a lot which is in getting to meet these women and talked to these women\nYou get the sense that their their experiences is really unique\nSort of law it's up to lose somebody that cancer I've lost a friend of cancer recently in fact\nIt was a horrible thing at a very you know ten ten times a hundred times worse for his for his wife children than it is for me\nI think it's a different thing when you're a person is killed by another human being in that human being is returned to the streets with a gun in a badge in a you know in a position of authority\nAnd it's something you do see embed numbers even though the numbers and so they they can't really tell you whether or not a shooting with legally justified what is clear is that over eight hundred plus shootings even the shootings where the person was unarmed only one police officer\nHas ever been charged ... so it's it's this weird sort of like double grief yeah it's like past and present at the same time\nLike you can't put it away because it's every day is another insults greater right\nSenate soon as I'm having plug in cars to brown somebody\nVeins something happened in you know here in Florida\nSay this is the club that\nHim feel like\nMm\nSo after the event ended up community center crystal took a bunch of them on\nTheir on their cars and drove over to this like little gem shop\nJust like you guys do this every every event or a no no no just wanted to know them and has been telling everyone about them\nThis is the energy to her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nThough no we didn't know anything about this but they must be part of the different types of learning as part of just hoping for you right you're right we all just simply trying to find a way it was a crystal\nGathered like probably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because you wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with my grief\nYou can either get the um the largest age at the Lincoln was talking to these two women and she's had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a like a like somebody\nThat I open my windows and I just knew will go through my house and she says his age comes down you know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over to Christel House\n[noise]\nShowers you got your name is Mike ... or you know just yeah just to make it [laughter] okay he's a police chief of Daytona Beach\n[noise] known for its wild ... spring break scene [noise] or they have bike week to trust five hundred thousand bikers from all over the\nCountry [noise] they told the international speedway\nOn top of that the permanent population there is like sixty two thousand people and over that six year period they've only had four police shootings\nAnd that's low yet Frisbee like that that's really low Jesse\nI Need to break down once the and in fact what we were there by race of tickets at a rest\n... assistant print out these spreadsheets there were others their stats they get to do the math and nice but she's actually kind of fascinating 'cause if you look at them you know you just go right down here to get them up for things like her readers aggravated assault theft shoplifting a speeding\nOr arrest ratio and our ticket ratio basically mirrors our city in terms of racial demographics yeah we're we're roughly a sixty forty fifty sixty percent of white we present African American\nAnd so when you look at these numbers it's pretty much what you see that tickets for speeding about sixty forty arrest for theft about sixty forty\nThat's the way we are supposed to in theory approached all and so what are they doing differently well a whole bunch of things first of all when all these these incidents were occurring in or\nAround the country which ... and everything else we did a ration policing mandatory training for the entire P. D. and basically what we wanted our officers to do was number one to learn the history of the country was history of the country is that we are courageous nation number one look at it started with moving the Indians\nOff of their land for manifest destiny\nOr when you look at Jim Crow laws when you look at the civil wars yoga slavery when you look into it Bull Connor for example\nOf turning the dogs and fire hoses loose on civil rights marchers so important for officers to understand that that you may go into an African American community and you may think enacted talk away where you think you're being respectful and understanding but in reality you're not\nBut let's not for a moment think that there is a biased in in policing because there's bias we all have biased in is a an trick is it I don't know what to trick at a I don't know if any of us knew how to contain that how do we stop that bias from coming for when you make a decision\nAnd I think in a yeah I've read a lot about implicit bias and always seems like um\nJust feels like a kinder way to say here like a fear of a black person and that fear is greater than what you would feel when you're encountering a white person when you're out on the job as a cop when\nYou look at some of the shootings you record on video and I and I think of the poor\nSchool janitor who lost his life in Minnesota the clinic still shooting yeah there's a guy who told the officer in no uncertain terms I'm a good guy I have a gun permit you can't get a gun permit if you're a convicted felon you can't get a gun permit if you're a drug dealer\nSo with the minute that young man tells that officer I have a gun permit for some unknown reason that officers threat level with a baby in the car and I got a guy in his ... his kid his girlfriend at the cornerstone has gone from an older this is this is an easy cost up\nFor some reason in and the reason is because of the color of the man's game all those things never registered black Irish shippers by his pocket\nAnd last year and and I would like to tell you in all my years in policing I Would like to sit here and be not even tell you that we don't you don't want people to twenty eight year practitioner law enforcement a second generation cop I'm appalled when I see when those videos I could not believe that my profession in some cases is that out of control\nSome of them I understand what's going on I mean you're wrestling in the ground for your life and and you know there there are times that we have to use deadly force but the incidents in South Carolina the incident Minnesota I mean are you kidding me and you look at what are we doing\nI mean how do you how do you train that out of an officer so that when they make a traffic stop they're not already operating at this level of heightened fear or the perceived threat\nIn my opinion number one you have to train tactically sound you have to train using in real life scenarios\nThat take that extra split second before you fired your weapon\nAnd I'll give you an anecdotal rubbery quickly when I first joined the Philadelphia police department we were shooting people at a crazy rate on an accidental discharge the officer had their finger on the trigger when they would go to grab that person if that person pulled removed you would jerk back and it was a natural reaction to squeeze the trigger\nSo they sent us all back up to the police academy and we all had a ... trained on how to keep your finger on the side plate the weapon not on the trigger so that that happened you wouldn't accidentally tripping fire and shoot somebody and you would have thought it was an Armageddon oh my God they're gonna get killed one reality\nWhat it did was it slowed down your field division it's slow everything down that split second didn't make a difference that blood given I didn't make a difference it made a difference in your knock shooting because that split second let you see what you thought may have been the color of my glass coming out of my cell phone was a cell phone\nSo you buy yourself a little bit of time and this is the thing that you have to come back to again and again is this idea of time\nIn certain situations slow down when you're dealing with the mentally ill person slow down\nLike whatever you can do you cover just create some space to buy yourself another thirty seconds that extra thirty seconds maybe the difference between saving your life in somebody else's life another interesting thing was in Ben Ben found is that also through some of the reporting with other police chief is the idea that some ... cheese don't like to hire kids out of high school like Nineteen twenty year olds in part because\nThere was there was this the text last that's only know how to communicate is like this and then when when they look up and go to talk to somebody and I'm Serious about whether the drive through at McDonalds and they get pissed off the person order and cheaper how how did you do it it's just their demeanor just the way they act\nIn fact been told me that you touch it and police chief who told him the young people who are coming into the Academy of past years\nHave never been in a physical fight which the problem because when they get into a fight their hearts stretch the race in their muscles tense up and they don't really know what to do so they freak out and then way more likely to draw a weapon and use the weapons uh you know\nTo to end the confrontation huh so how do you ... you can't ask her how many times have you beat somebody up or been beaten up on you know so that then says that that's why the police chief told him he looks to hire bouncers icy bouncers or for chip what he said\nFrom just my little myopic world that I live in we have an awful high number of men and women who served in the military they were my best officers they are level headed there well trained they know how to follow the policy\nBasically you know how to not freak out during the confrontation and lasting promises lasting one of the most important things to it says\nIs you have to get into the community and I'm not talking about the the good stuff over there for Christmas gifts or they cook Thanksgiving dinner I'm Talking day to day\nYou have to get to know people yeah for sure and so to make this point chip which got up walked me down the hall to another office had\nSent me down on the computer the sound comes out of us when he says okay to show me the video to video starts\nIn silence and body cam video it's a body cam on the cop who is driving a squad car and he's got his body cameras mounted to his eye on his glasses to the cameras going where his eyes go next to him as you said is a partner both cuts are white also it's night so [noise]\nCause for a guy who's running around with a knife tried to stab people off his meds I think he was on a crack cocaine binge if I remember correctly they park neighborhood street and you can see down the street half a block away\nFrom this shirtless black I Want you to show\nThat the cop talking to them cop were in the body can end this black man goes on race pretty big knife in his hand any walking towards the ... once\nYou start learning from crazy [noise]\nLike I get closer and closer and closer and finally the cop when the body can pull out the taste of the other officers out it was a refrain is behind him with his firearm out and the guy\nDown is approaching\nApproaching approaching approaching you get within like ... to the cops and then [noise] the guy was\nA buddy Kim Myers is he's the guy holding the night he falls onto his back on to this like cement driveway still got the knife in his hand\nYou're going to get it\nAnd the cop who's got his gun out he hustles over a kicks the knife out of the guy's hand grabs him by the hand turns them over\nAnd then he changed central called for a cup and then\nThere may not have it's not a smart idea to have a knife coming out of the probably\nThe officer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at me you're\nLucky you didn't just shot I Want to learn from your best shot you want to die if you want to die you came back\nHe tells the officer was um Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police bullets can't kill\nMe [laughter] [noise] I have no fan of our counseling on T.\nV. to pick 'em up walk them over to the squad car [noise] put 'em in and the UN's ...\nSaid this is the thing that you guys will you use this video for\nWhat I was one of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things you know and and that's the points we at home or the officers used time in distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the the guy leans unicorn judge that one I mean you know you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal commands first warn them\nLet them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\nAnd it's important 'cause there are guys partner was holding a gun and have you heard this hot you might have just instinctively reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest in communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city":
