says that we all might need to eat\nBugs have necessity myself ... planes why I'm Ted stage\nHuman population is growing very rapidly as well drove to about nine billion in two thousand fifty how are we going to feed the world\nWe have a third more mouths to feed but we need agricultural production increase of Seventy percent and that's especially because this world population is increasing\nNot only in numbers of rules for getting wealthier and anyone who gives wealthier starts eat more meat meat in fact it's something that\nCosts a lot of our agricultural production\nBruce other moments Seventy percent of all our agricultural land is being used to produce livestock that's not only the lens where the lifestyle is walking a feeding but it's also other areas where the feed is being produced and being transported we can increase should've been\nAt the expense of rain forests of there's a limitation very soon as you remember that we need to increase agriculture production but Seventy percents we're not going to make it that way because much better change for me to insects [noise]\n\nIt's easy in fact not only is he a good alternative to meet but as the future of food a set of the nation\nAnd insects are an excellent they'll turn of it because they need much less a lens than producing regular life stalk and livestock is so inefficient because for one kilogram of beef that you will get on your plate you need about twenty five kilograms of feed\nInsects are doing a much better job you need only about two point to get a runs a feed for one kilogram of crickets a mate so if we are going to be forced to produce food in a more efficient way\nThan switching from regular meat allies talking to insects is very logical thing to do\nThat as a big if of course out of this if insects produce meets that is a good quality what I've been all kinds of analyses and in terms of purging affects a victim in ... it's very ... in fact it's comparable to anything that we eat as meat at the moment and\nEven in terms of calories exerted one kilogram of rice has has the same amount of calories is ten dogs are six big Macs [noise] so we have to give you the idea of eating insects some things well they're not\nYet available well they are there and for nurse in the ... the produce them maybe by\nTwo thousand twenty Joe Biden just knowing that this was an insect as your groceries so why not eat insects you should try yourself a couple of years ago we had Seventeen hundred and fifty people's altogether on a square in monitoring of time and the age insects at the same moments and\nThese were still big big news I think soon it will not be big news any more than we only been six because it's just a normal way of doing\n[noise]\nProfessor began I see one pretty significant problem with all the what's the problem that you see it's gross stent disgusting how could you eat an insect\nUh yeah that's that's the thing that comes to mind most often and um if you really think it's very serious and you look as an insect you take a locust or crickets and you take away the wings and the the legs fame and then you put that next to 'em an eye shrimp if you look at them they're they're basically the same\nAnd even from a biological point of view they're very close relatives and so if you love to eat shrimp then why would you not love to eat um locust which in some countries you learn all the the the sky shrimp ...\nI mean I still want to make this work in my life and in the lives of the people listening but ah but I don't I Can't even I Try to be mindful and imagining biting into a lot of gas and it just I Can't get there\nWell then that for you at this stage it might be an alternative to eat pasta in which the crickets having grounds and are there that distribute it into the pasta and so he was anything out again it's a fortified specify which cricket meal\nI understand that it takes a while to get over this that's when the first sushi was being on the markets in the United states eating raw fish was not something well accepted you know you can eat sushi anywhere\nYeah so there's all kinds of foods that maybe initially might not have are the odds rights but still make it\nSo if if actually you know let's say we can get over this sort of cultural immersion in the last two or eating lots of insects and and let's say we just ate so many insects that really reduced our consumption of chicken beef and pork and you know lamb what would happen\nI think we would have a world population that would be able to sustain every one way of animal protein ... ideally be also so that we would eat less meat but there will be good if we at least for ... part of its brand new meats and with this I think what we would see is that\nOur dinner table would be much more diverse and I think you should look at it as how do we overcome this gross things I Know how can we make in life even more enjoyable by having a more variety of what we eat

I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about what we can say and what we\nCan't [laughter] and uh in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode or contain some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship about the pressures that lead you to say no don't don't see that we have to say that over don't but we have to do and so that tension exists throughout the show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping [laughter] so we might as well we've done is is on the radio yeah so you got kids with the you may want to mention went on it yeah anyway the story comes to us from producers Simon ... so let's start can we start in two thousand they sure about what the song yes please check\n[laughter]\nLike you would see you know a twenty five year old woman and a teenager looking boy right and like what the hell is going on there\nOh yeah it gets really weird if you like start entering into like child age and it wasn't even going to bring that up because it's kinda gross [laughter]\nIt's like breastfeeding porn is that the other sites like ...\nAnd so this team they realized they needed to have a new to the rule that are allowed for breastfeeding but also had some kind of an age cap\nSo so uh so then we were saying okay once you've progressed past infancy than we believe that it's inappropriate but then [noise]\nPictures would start popping up on the screen and they'd\nBe like wait is that an infant like where's the line between infant and toddler\nAnd so the thing that we landed on was if it looked like the child could walk on his or her own than to old big enough to walk too big depressing\nThat can be mom yeah that's like a year old in some cases yeah\nAnd like the world Health Organization recommends breastfeeding until you know like Eighteen months or two years which meant there were a lot of photos still being taken down\nWithin you know days we are continuing to hear reports from people that their photographs were still being targeted but\nOffer a statement saying you know that's where we're going to draw the line merging policy\nAnd keep in mind through this whole episode is is perhaps the next big thing and the Facebook dot com company was growing really really fast and it\nSeems like almost everyone in on it and in and they're just got to be a lot more content\nWhen we first launch we're hoping for you know maybe four hundred and five hundred people and an hour and a hundred thousand so when those are\nOur now ... more people are joining Facebook everyday sixteen million users so far the projection of two hundred million\nBy the end of the era now walking on Facebook than the entire us popular not\nJust within the United states but also it was growing rapidly more international\nYou know you were getting folks in India is going to ask for the U.S and turkey\nGetting big throughout the EU so they have more and more content coming in from all these different places in all these different languages\nHow are we going to keep everybody on the same page and so this small team at Facebook got a little bigger and bigger jumped\nUp sixty people and then a hundred and they set out to create rules and definitions for every huh\nCan we go through some sort of the ridiculous example we let's over here today so Gore Gore you mean violence kind of Gore yes so the Gore standard was headlined\nWe don't allow graphic violence and Gore and then the shorthand definition they used was no insides on the outside\nNo good snow blood pouring out of something led was a separate issue there was a an excessive blood rule to come up with rules about bodily fluids\n... for example would be allowed in like a clinical setting but like what does a clinical setting mean and you know does that mean if someone is in a lab coat\n... at one of my favorite examples is like how do you define art\nBecause as these people are moderating they would see images of naked people that were paintings or sculptures come up and so what they decided to do is say art with naked in this can stay up\nLike it stays up if it is made out of what made out of metal made out of\nStone really yeah because how else do you define art you have to just be like is this what you can see with your eyeballs\nAnd so from then on as they run into problems those rules just constantly updated what your constant amendment yeah constant amendments\nNew problem new rule and other new problem updated rule\nIn fact at this point they they're amending these rules up to twenty times a month wow\nReally take for example those rules about breastfeeding in twenty Thirteen they removed the attachment clause so the baby no longer needed to have its mouth physically touching the nibble at the woman no end in fact\nA one nipple and or aerial it could be visible in the photo but not to only one then twenty four team they make it so that both nipples or both aerial last may be present in the photo\nSuited what happens in American walk all the time it was very thing yes yeah\nYeah you know it sounds a lot like common law [noise] so ... is\nThe system dating back to early England where individual judges would make ruling which would sort\nOf be a law but then that law would be amended or evolved by other judges the body of law was sort of constantly fleshed out and face that fact [noise]\nEvery time this team that Facebook would would come up with a rule that they thought was airtight\n... some things I don't think we're just show up that they that they weren't prepared for that and that's a rule had an account\nOr as soon as you think yeah this is good like the next day something shows up to show you yeah you didn't think about\nThis for example sometime around twenty eleven this content moderator is is is going through a cue of things\nThat [noise] which act [noise] [noise] ... [noise] it's sad\nAnd she comes upon this image [noise]\nMake\nThe photo itself was a teenage girl African by dressed in skin breastfeeding goats of baby goats\nAnd the moderator throws her hands up and says what gives this and we Googled breastfeeding goats and found that this was the thing it turns out it's a survival practice according to what they found this is a tradition in Kenya that goes back centuries that in a drought\nUnknown way to help your her get through the drought is to ah if you if you have a woman who's ...\nTo have her nurse the kid the baby goat along with her human get ... and so there's nothing sexual about it's good for business student and theoretically if we go point by point through this list it's an infant\nIt it's sort of could walk so maybe there's an issue there but there's there's physical contact between the mouth and the nibble but\nBut obviously breastfeeding as we intended anyway meant human infants and so in that moment what they decide to do is uh remove the photo and there was an amendment and ask direct under the rules dating animals are not babies we add to that so in any future cases people would know what to do\nWith it but they removed they they they did was culturally appropriate and the thing that people do and they decided to remove the photo yeah that outraged individuals are editors foreign wheeler\nWhy why did we make an exception because because when a problem grows large enough you have to change the rules if not we don't this was not one of those cases the juice wasn't worth the squeeze\nAnd like if they were to allow this picture then they'd have to make some rule about when it was okay to breastfeed an animal and when it wasn't okay\nThis is a utilitarian document it's not about being right a hundred percent of the time it's about being able to execute effectively\nIn other words we're not trying to be perfect here and we're not even necessarily trying to be one hundred percent just or fair would just try to make something that works\nOne two three four five six seven eight and when you step back and look at what Facebook has become like for two thousand eight to nap in Japan years'\nTime in\nChair how're you I'm In LA I don't know is it is one\nOf the idea of a single set of rules that works that can be applied fairly you have just a crazy crazy concepts\nBecause\nThey've gone from something like Seventy million users to to point to ... billion\nI Can't say it's about eighty\nFloors and they've gone for twelve folks sitting in a room deciding what to take down or leave up to somewhere around sixteen thousand people\nThere is a floor in the building where in states such as sources content moderators itself\nAround twenty ten they decided to start outsourcing some of this work to places like manila where you just heard reporter or a home in drawl as well as\nI mean I Would guess of their building Dublin where we sent reporters Guerra stack scene where the ... the treat everybody fever English and we sent them\nThere to try to talk to some of these people who for living sit at a computer and collectively click through around a million flag bits of content to pop up on the screen every day wow well we ... I'm just curious like what's what's that like\n[noise] well I'm\nWe found out pretty quickly the none of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do\nUm so there's a lot of reading I mean happening\nAnd not certain about the good work [laughter] so now I don't I Know you work in um\nI mean like you just came out of there [noise] I Know you're lying in fact most\nPeople wouldn't even admit they worked for the company like what's a as if something's wrong about being in like in India that they find\nWell yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing [noise]\nAre willing to do you want\nTo be named her you know where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather do that that's the only find you know I just got an victory I don't want to have a\nFix plain that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements dating they weren't allowed to ah admit that they work for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nActually ... ... ... ... that's\nWhy there's several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worth of that they couldn't be gamed or at the same time it it creates a sort of separation between these workers\nYou from doing well thank you so much for being little videos or\nNot long after sitting down with Marsha Facebook invited me to come up to their offices in California and sit down with a cut of just get\nYour your name and your title and I'm Monica bigger and I leave the policies for Facebook's\nMonika bigger is in charge of all of Facebook's rules including their policies on hate speech and so after like why would there be a rule that protects white men but not black children\nWe have we have made our hate speech policies let me let me rephrase that are hate speech policies have become more detailed overtime but our main policy is you can't attack a person or group of people based on a protected characteristic characteristic like race religion or gender\nSaid this takes a couple of decades to explain but the gist of it is that or the Facebook borrowed this idea of protected classes a street from us anti discrimination law these are the laws that make it so that you can't not hire someone say based on like their religion their ethnicity there a race\nAnd so on on Facebook you can't attack someone based on one of these characteristics\nMeaning you can't say men are trash nor could you say women are trash a because essentially you're attacking all men for being met oh is it the all can I say Bob is ... you can say Bob is trash because of my sources explained to me the\nDistinction is that in the first instance you're attacking a category in the second instance you were talking a person but it's not clear that you were talking that person because they are a member of a protected category oh so Bob\nMight be trash for reasons that have nothing to do with him being a man yeah he just might be annoying right okay so that explains why you take down ... but why would you leave up black children or ... why would that not get taken down\nSo traditionally we allowed speech once there was some other word in it that made it about something other than to protect a characteristic\nIn Facebook jargon these are referred to as ...\nYeah or a non protected modify it\nJust means literally nothing [laughter] give us an example\nOf this so traditionally if you said I don't like this religion cab drivers\nCab driver would be the non protected modify or because employment is not protected category huh and so what the rules state it was a when you add this non protected modify or to a protected category in this case the cab drivers religion\nWe would allow it because we can't assume that you're hating this person because of his religion you actually just may not like a cab drivers\nSo in the case of black children children is modifying the protected category of\nBlack uh-huh and so children Trump's black their child ness Trump's their blackness you can say whatever you want about black children whereas in the case of white men uh you've got a you've got gender and race both protected you can attack them that's just a bizarre rule\nI Would think you'd go the other direction that you the protected class would\nOutweigh the Marta fire well they they made this decision as they explained to me because of their default was to allow speech they were really trying to incorporate or not to the American free speech tradition and so there's a whole lot of stuff out there that none of us would defend is a\nValuable speech but didn't didn't rise to the level of stuff that we'd say this is so bad we're going to take it down and in this case their concern was were all members of like you know at least half a dozen protected categories like we all have gender we all have sexual orientation\nAnd if if you if the rule is that any time a protected class is mentioned it could be hate speech\nWhat you were doing at that point is opening up just about every comment that's ever made about anyone on Facebook to potentially be hate speech then you're left with anything right\nNo matter where we draw the line there are going to be used to have some outcomes that we don't like they're always going to be casualties that's why we continue to change the policies\nAnd in fact since marshes debacle they've actually updated this rule so now black children are protected from what they consider the worst forms of hate speech\nNow our reviewers take how severe the attack is into consideration\nBut despite this there are still plenty of people\nThat is flawed because you are a social network\nIncluding Marsha who who think they still just isn't good enough\nThere are not systematic efforts to eliminate white men in the way that there are other groups that's why you have protected groups\nShe thinks white men in heterosexual should not be protected\nProtect the groups who are actually victims of hate speech makes sense\nWell yeah because you sort of hate speech or are thinking about hate speech there's this idea of of privileged or of historically disadvantaged groups and that those historically disadvantaged groups should have more protection or because of\nBeing historically disadvantaged ... ... and the challenge with that uh that was presented to me was okay\nTo thousands Japanese reinforce or in the Nineteen forties front office either use if\nYou had Japanese soldiers tens of thousands of Chinese killing millions of Chinese during World War two\nAt the same time you had Japanese American citizens\nOf the hundred thousand persons of Japanese ancestry\nSeeing put into internment camps and so we had to ask ourselves that question like are the Japanese and historically advantage or disadvantage group huh Japanese Americans pretty easy to make a case that they were disadvantaged but in China it's a totally different story in this happened\nAt the exact same moment if they've got to different places to different cultural stories in ... when you have a website Facebook this trans National Community they realized they decided that ideas of privilege are so geographically bond\nThat there is no way to live where do you weigh in consider\nWho is privileged above who and decided therefore that we're not going to allow historical advantage or historical privilege or into the equation at all\nAnd I think it's very important to keep in mind here in America these moderators only have like four or five seconds Republican not come to make a decision ... and ... and beyond and even the news in those four seconds it is there enough time to\nTo figure out where in the world someone is particularly given\nIdea dresses can easily be math do back where you came from is it enough time to figure out a person is ethnicity white children are better on black children are on top of that we often don't know an individual's race ... people on the other categories or even less clear like sexual orientation\nAnd they they just realized it would be next to impossible to get anybody to be able to run these run these calculations effectively\nWhen we were building that framework we did a lot of cat and we saw some times that it was just too hard for viewers to implement a more detailed policy consistently they just couldn't do it accurately\nWhat Facebook's trying to do is take the first amendment this high minded lofty legal concept\nIn converted into a an engineering manual that can be executed every four seconds for any piece of content from anywhere on the globe and when you've got to move that fast sometimes justice loses\nThat that um that's the tension here [noise]\nAnd I just want to\nMake sure I emphasize that these policies they're not going to please everybody they often don't don't please everybody that's working on the policy team at face but but if we want to have one line that we enforce consistently been it means we have to have some pretty objective black and white rule\nWhen we come back those rules bake it toppled\nThis is Danny from Denver, Colorado radiolab supported in
