before he could follow through\nThen two years later he met someone I'm going to call them push push is part of a team of community paralegals that works for environmental justice on the ... coast who explain for Ravi that there was a law on his side\nWho is translated into ... something Ravi had never seen it's called the consent to operate it issued by the state government and it allows the factory to run only if it complies with specific conditions\nSo together they compared the legal requirements with reality they collected evidence and they drafted in application not to the courts but to to administrative institutions the pollution control board and the district administration\nThose applications started turning the creek the wheels of enforcement\nPollution officer came for a state inspection and after that the company started running an air filtration system it was supposed to have been using all the law\nIt also started covering the one hundred trucks they come and go from that plant every day\nThose two measures reduced the air pollution considerably the case is far from over ... learning and using law gave levy hope there are people like push walking alongside people like Ravi in many places\nToday I work with a group called ... the number the helped convene a global network dedicated to legal empowerment altogether we are over a thousand organization in a hundred and twenty countries collectively we deployed tens of thousands of community paralegals\n[noise] I mean it seems to me that this idea of of of helping to establish community paralegals can really\nMake change at scale at at at a big scale is just to create more and more and more and more of them like all over the world basically people who are not lawyers but that are just as good as lawyers in terms of how they understand the law I Do think that that's part of what we need to do to achieve this transformation in the relationship\nBetween la and people is to open it up and to embrace the role of these sorts of intermediary\nPlayers I mean in healthcare for example we we never would think that all you needed doctors have a whole network of people you have doctors nurses midwives luck with your community health workers\nAnd so the folks that we we focus on and we we work with are sort of the equivalent of community health workers comp community legal workers and they can play this vital bridge role um even in some of the toughest circumstances\nWhen people know invoke the rules\nThey can get traction some of the time not not that we went every time but they can get they can get traction in in in in really powerful ways I\nI see the beginnings of a real movement\nWhat we're nowhere near what's necessary not yet [noise]\nIn most countries around the world governments do not provide a single dollar of support for paralegals like push most governments don't even recognize the wool paralegals play or protect paralegals from heart\nI also don't want to give you the impression that paralegals and their clients when every time\nNot at all that cement factory behind Ravi village it's been turning off the filtration system at nights when at least likely that the company would get caught\nRunning that filter costs money Ravi what steps photos of the polluted nice guy but he says the air is due unreasonable\nTrying to squeeze justice at a broken system is like Ravi case hope and despair or neck and neck\nAnd so not only do we urgently need to support and protect the work of beer for lawyers around the world\nWe need to change the systems themselves\nThat must be so many examples in cases that you come across\nWhere it's just you don't when you you you you face these enormous odds and you face these enormous forces and they and even though justice is on your side and you don't win how do you how do you stay optimistic about this\nI don't think there's another option I we you know we we take inspiration from the kinds of long term movements that have managed to change things in various places whether it's the\nSouth African freedom struggle um or whether it's the struggles freedom here in the United states it takes time it takes patients who takes perseverance takes creativity and um those are qualities that I see in the paralegals we work\nWith and watching them gives me hope yeah equip the people themselves to make

article for this great website called ... dot org about being a foreign reporter and working with translators and all the mishaps you know when you have to go from one language to another\nBut there's actually a really good example that I didn't use in the piece about uh the failure to communicate I can tell you that story you're yeah so so there's this word and you wouldn't think of it as a translator but it's the word serious and\nWhen Syria does ... serious like okay All right all us okay I'm In my experience when you hear this word serious in East Africa does not mean solemn or thoughtful are are stern\nIt actually almost never has something to do with your mood\nFor serious tends to me is are you just talking to me or are you serious are you doing something and usually doing it's like some kind of transaction usually a financial I've been asked by you know many East African officials are you going to be serious with me and\nIt obviously means are you going to pay me abroad\nOh usually I Pretend misunderstand that they came home and I said yes I'm a very serious international journalists and um but the story that I Want to tell you and\nGood afternoon everybody I'm I'm really pleased to be back in Africa Secretary Kerry ... visited Ethiopia and city of enormous energy and the ... just a\nFew days before carry visit nine journalists had been arrested under this relatively recent anti terrorism law that basically says that any criticism of the government is illegal\nI had a series of very productive meeting this morning with my foreign minister

in prison and I firmly believe that the work of journalists weather is bred journalists are in the Internet or media of other times\nIt makes societies stronger\nYou know he said all the things that he's expecting to say that they believe that free speech and open dialogues important to the economic development of country buffet blah but\nWe remain committed to our partnership with these ... with his comment was also wrapped up in a lot of praise be up yet and\nI'd be delighted to answer your questions I'm not sure how that's going to do that\nThen came time for questions he took some vetted questions from the Ethiopian journalists to more from the traveling press and to carry\nCredit gives us John I Want to give it a shot I Know he was very impatient I'm\nSort of four he left the party and he was like you know what we're just going to try something different we are going to like call on an Ethiopian journalist I Want to make sure I got a fairly distribution yeah here Carrie pointed

statement about Best Buy these things out of this keep happening every piece of repeating very much so then he asked this question is the lip service or audio seriously\nBecause of the double it's ... it's just lip service or are you seriously concerned [noise]\nAt this point everybody is just not ... they're all looking at these journalists who obviously had to take considerable personal risks in a place like Ethiopia in a crowd of journalists including state run TV station\nThis guy's on camera asking this extremely sensitive question about the arrest a journalist ... we really ... ...\n... and Teri looks at him like well [noise] you got to be kidding\nWhat I stand up in public and I and I say something um I I Try to be serious about it and I think the fact that I'm doing that is serious and when I raised him by name in my comments today\nI carry it sounds to me like he's sort of insulted by the question and and you have to remember\nHere he is the word serious in East Africa can be translated very much in are you doing something preferably a Lincoln financial transaction right and so was this journalist is saying is you are you just talking\nAbout this or are you doing something may be threatening you will be a who is withdrawing eight are withdrawn just pouring in Kerry says I Am very seriously talking about\nWe have previously called for the release of these individuals and that is the policy of our government and it's a serious policy thank you all very very much appreciate it\nAnd it seemed to me maybe you know you can judge but it seemed like he was almost like look I'm like the most serious politician that's out there I mean I lost the presidential race in two thousand four in part because I was deemed too serious by the American public you know like what are you kidding me if not being serious\nWe put it in a number of request to speak to John Kerry or someone in the state department but there was no response do you think he was aware\nOf the misunderstanding who carry or this or this fellow oh yeah no I followed him out afterwards [noise]\nMy name is ... he's a young guy in his twenties and independent journalist yeah I used to work in different newspapers and um\nI was like you know when you when you\nListen what happened there and stuff like that some kind of cultural a guide me\nIs that Americans think serious means\nThese are the casualties of us got in\nTrouble than mine men who aren't damaged emotionally\nAbout guys with what they were then calling battle fatigue and the reason they were calling it that was because you didn't necessarily see it right away\nThen around Vietnamese as we realize you don't just see this on the battlefield you see it with guys you aren't necessarily directly involved in battle right and so the question became\nWhat's the source of it and she said well it's nervous exhaustion said the human nervous system can only take it for so long and then everybody's nervous system shuts\nDown hence the term operational exhaustion or that's example again when you're trying to enrich it you're saying the guys are cowards and not in the state of shock they're behaving the way all human beings do\nAnd then you get more concerned about them and you say the real problem isn't there just their experience on the battlefield the problem is is that they're in a constant state of disorder because it lingers on long after you think it's over you can't just get these guys and go hospital for six months and\nThink they're going to be better there permanently you post traumatic shocked and then once you have a a a\nWhole apparatus to deal with it then you become Pete DSD my point is just that it's perfectly possible that the language of euphemism grows and becomes more abstract as ... as
