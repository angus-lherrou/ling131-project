{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "\n\n\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm David Greene and I'm Rachel Martin the founders of this country designed Congress to constrain presidential powers\nAnd when it came to board the draft or is that the constitution did not want that consequential decision in the hands of just one person among them was James Madison presidential historian Michael Beschloss says when Madison became president himself\nHe learned that war is can we political benefit Steve Inskeep spoke to bash last about his new book is titled president for\nMadison was the one who said men are not angels he was so worried of a president who had bad judgment or would try to get us involved in a war for political reasons he was trying to slam the door on that\nBut once he was president and Eighteen twelve he's the one who opened the door to a president go into Congress than saying I think there should be a war and if you hadn't had Madison do that it might have been a much longer time before presidents could make were almost single head what was the situation that the United states faced in Eighteen twelve\nThe United states had ships that were being harassed by the British are a lot of Americans wanted to grab Canada so there was a group and Congress Canada then okay absolutely so they said\nHow about a war and Madison said well you know maybe there is a a good rationale for having a war and Madison sort of like the idea of being a war president himself exactly the opposite of the way he was in Seventeen Ninety seven in Philadelphia\nI'm thinking of that old saying that where you stand is determined by where you sit when he was sitting in what we now call the White House he started seeing things differently than the horrific way of\nPutting it in Madison also knew that it would be politically useful to him and Eighteen twelve he was running for reelection to have a war that he was the biggest advocate of sounds pretty modern doesn't it\nSo James Madison is one of the presidents who gives the president a role in war making although they're still asking Congress at that point festivals let's go ahead a few decades to James Cape Polk is president of the United states in the Eighteen forties what did he do\nWell James Cape ... was a liar and achieve and a boy and he wanted the United states to have a big war with Mexico and his hidden agenda was he wanted to get New Mexico he wanted to get California which were owned by Mexico at that time a lot of other land and added to the United states\nEighteen forty six he sat American troops down to the Texas border to provoke the Mexicans and Mexican fought back and poked says look there's been this terrible attack on us\nBy Mexico we need a big war Congress gladly gave it\nTo I guess we should just explain this a little more he sent troops into disputed territory between us and Mexico right\nHe did and the result was Polk had essentially fabricated an incident would allow him to go to Congress than say we need a big war with Mexico\nBut wait a minute here he's still like to ask Congress Congress still had to act how did senators respond when they were challenged by this guy was essentially taking their authority away\nMany senators sad that poker is trying to cheat him they question the reason that we were going to war but they voted for this war overwhelmingly and set the pattern for the future why did they do that\nThey knew that the war would be popular they knew that many people would say the Mexicans attacked us why are we fighting back would be very hard for them to say no and that was a pattern that lasted in the future\nOkay but still at that time in history Congress was declaring war the president would ask Congress would do it if we go I had a century to around Nineteen fifty Harry Truman is the president of the United states what happened to Nineteen fifty I Love ...\nBut he did just terrible thing in Nineteen fifty the north Koreans attacked the south in June of Nineteen fifty and what truly should have done under the constitution he should've gone to Congress and said I'd like a war declaration they would have given up to him but\nTruman was terrified that there'd be a big debate where he might be criticized that might undermine him in the mid term elections\nOf Nineteen fifty so trauma didn't even bother going to Congress he said\nI'm doing this as a police action under the United nations I don't need a declaration\nAnd the result of that was that Lyndon Johnson in Nineteen sixty four when he wanted his war in Vietnam said dream and didn't ask Congress I don't have to do it either and we've never had a declaration of war sense not since Nineteen forty two and that is totally in violation of the constitution what\nAre some of the consequences of this evolution increase really in presidential power when we look at the last I don't know twenty Thirty years\nThe result is a modern president nowadays can start a war almost singlehandedly and most of them are tempted because they know that if you've got political problems and you get the United states into a war that is popular your poll ratings will rise you writes\nEarly in this book where the founders to come back they would probably be astonished and chagrined discovered that in spite of their ardent striving Z the life or death of much of the human race has now come to depend on the character of\nThe single person who happens to be president of the United states\nThe founders knew but almost anyone could become president and they didn't want all of our security to rest on whoever happens to\nGet that job when you wrote that line recently did you have any particular individual in mind\nPresident Trump has often talked about starting wars for political reasons in two thousand eleven he tweeted\nPresident Obama's going to start a war with Iran in order to get reelected president before Dick to President Obama would do that that is in the nobody makes the connection between war and politics at the founders never wanted to see a president make\nThe other thing is that like other presidents President Trump is mark remarked on the fact that oftentimes if you want to be considered a great president it's easier to do that if you've been commander in chief during war that as they thought that our founders would never wanted to hear from any president\nOne of the recent episode I Want to ask about presidents Obama and two thousand Thirteen seemed on the verge of launching an attack against Syria because of Syria's use of chemical weapons\nI'm ready to act in the face of this outrage today I'm asking Congress to send a message to the world that we are ready to move forward together as one nation\nAnd specifically said I'm not going to do that without the approval of Congress it's seen as a serious mistake and foreign policy had left ... out of Syria with much more freedom what'd you argue that it was the right choice even though it seems to have been a mistake\nI think it is always the right choice for president never to get into a war unless he's got Congress in with him on the take off he belatedly saw that that was not going to be possible and that's why he pulled back\nMichael Beschloss is the author of presidents of war the epic story from

unclear as to whether he to act on it\nThe right to know we're talking about just a freeze but what are the chances that it could be discontinued just stopped altogether\nI'm not in the speculation business when it comes to politics but it does seem unlikely given that we haven't heard many democratic cause for even a freeze let alone an end to motor voter I I Would say that motor voter looks like it might be here to stay\nIn the meantime Brian but what can voters do to make sure the registered before November six\nSo you would want to go to the secretary of state's website there's little

effect Wednesday around the historic at ... area downtown where new shelter had been operator has been operating since September the shelter is part of ... era guards said his plan to build so called bridge homes in every council district\nIn the early hours yesterday outreach workers sanitation employees and law enforcement went from ten to ten talking homeless people about plans to clean up the area\nEnforcement was expected the mayor did promise to step up police presence and sanitation workers in all areas where new bridge homes are going up\nThe idea is to improve public health and prevent sprawling tent encampments and you're homeless shelter still do people are calling it a crackdown Christina Miller's here to talk about this she's mayor or city top homelessness advisor she was at the shelter yesterday morning Christina was going to take to\nGet mornings now as I mentioned this was not entirely unexpected what's the ... here\n[noise] I mean the end goal really is to provide people opportunities to get off the streets status first and foremost what we want to do with our average home program and that is why yesterday's efforts were outreach lead and Ninety five percent of the engagement with the folks on the streets were through outreach workers\nOkay now wondering ... you know there's been an increase in encampments around that particular facility when reporters went down there and counted Seventy tents are wondering if is it getting is it getting more a crowded down there\nActually now I Would save the islands out there all day yesterday I I actually walked through the ... area every morning from Union Station and I would say it's quite the opposite and we counted at twenty two encampments maybe roughly forty people\nAre in the in the public area yesterday and so I Would say it's it's definitely the opposite Avon also outreach workers reported that\nAt just last week six people moved into permanent housing directly from the streets\nAnd and then also more importantly there the forty five people who are on the streets prior to the al published author opening are now inside after they are also no longer a in camps in that area and with the people\nThat are outside of the idea to to get him to fold up their tents and and not be there\n[noise] the idea is to get more than anything to get them linked to services and yesterday what we saw and wet fat that outreach workers went out and talk with folks three people went to a shelter as who who otherwise you know I'm not sure I'm not sure that they would have\nBeen given an avenue to get off the streets that because of the ... you know for lack of a better word surge of outreach that was there yesterday in which ... who was there today and people were actually able to get a link to services\nFor those folks who are I'm Still in that process because you know the the road to housing is it's not always a quick one and the goal is just to keep it is to educate and make sure that day and you know are in voluntary compliance with with a lot that we have on the ...\nOf course you know but he isn't the game plan the overall game plan is if in those areas those specific areas and then we are talking about is the Pueblo air a facility um is for if if there is a homeless person he needs to he or she needs to be inside not outside not surrounding that area\nI mean I think collectively that's what we all want right we all went to the people inside and and and again that that really is the goal of the program is to create those indoor spaces for people to go\nAnd continue to provide that education and that message and frankly that opportunity and ... to get linked to services and housing and there were and there are folks who had opportunities yesterday at I witnessed firsthand on who I'm not sure I otherwise would have had that\nThat opportunity if we had an again resource the area and with a service led approach\nBut where do they go though 'cause the ones that don't get in where do they wind up\n[noise] I mean essentially\nThe work continues and the outreach workers you know those folks and and continue to work with them on a housing plan that looks really different for everyone and and the path of housing you know it isn't always linear and sometimes there are there's progress and sometimes their setbacks\nAnd ultimately we're not telling people that they can't they can't be on the streets we know that this is hard stuff and we're still working towards um enough solutions and that we want to balance the needs of uh of cleanliness and and and have you know I'm passable sidewalks\nOr understand there's forty five beds and that a particular facility or is it full right now is a room for anyone else right now\n\nWhat a critic shoot carbon or took the show though for a spin this week and she brings it was a story\nNow you're toggle switch to the right to drive to the reverse and other than that you're ready to rock

of our travels done single passenger and the majority of it is done in the commute hours in the morning\nWhich most of us know from personal experience makes for a lot of traffic [noise]\nThat's the solo which takes up about a quarter of the space of a typical SUV and look well sort of like a car at least it does from the front the usual hood ghrelin headlights but take a look for the vast and cheaper [noise] there's just one meal it's top speed is eighty two miles per hour [noise]\nTechnically the cello was a motorcycle at least that's how it's registered and insured in California\nThat means that can be parked parallel or perpendicular with its back we'll at the curb and it means the cello isn't subject to the same regrets crashed testing as a traditional passenger vehicle so even though it's fully enclosed and has a seatbelt enroll bar it doesn't yet has built an airbag [noise]\nTurned to your right to it does have a lot of the controls drivers already use like accelerator and

strong reception here in Southern California especially in the LA area\nAnd he's right California is the largest market for electric vehicles in the country or traffic is bad and getting worse and air pollution is a chronic problem so let's go\nWe're trying to close the less gas station and\nThat's going to take a while with a starting price of Fifteen thousand five hundred the cello as inexpensive for an all electric car but it's going to take a certain type of driver to buy in someone who's willing to squeeze into an ultra compact vehicle that if she rolls down the windows and sticks out her arms she could almost touched the traffic\nWhen I first saw the is so low vehicle I literally gas because I couldn't figure out where the rest of it was\nRebecca Lindland is an industry analyst with

California roads it actually might be okay in terms of size because you're crawling along and some of the nation's worst traffic\nStill in this era of distracted drivers and large SEVs and pickups to
