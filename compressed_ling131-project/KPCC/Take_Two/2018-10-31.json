and I'm Rachel Martin earlier this year the Centers for Disease Control and prevention released a stunning statistic estimates died of drug overdoses in twenty Seventeen\nThe huge increase in deaths is largely due to heroin and powerful synthetic opioids like ... you know there are many reasons why the opioid crisis is so hard to confront one of them is social stigma and that stigma often extends beyond users themselves to their families NPR's Shankar Vedantam reports\nThe what stigma has its origins in slavery it comes from ancient Greek and Latin and referred to a brand that was seared into the skin of slaves\nBut over time stigma took on a different meaning now it suggests an ugly mark you cannot see a kind of invisible brand society often place to sit on whole groups of people\nLike the mentally ill the homeless and drug users\nA lot of people say they're just junkies\nThis is Karen met her she was an advocate for families coping with heroin addiction and other opioid abuse in Maryland Miller says for many years she herself had a harsh view of people addicted to drugs\nI Would be like oh my God I Can't believe that such and such as daughter is on heroin\nBut then one day it was her own son Lucas he'd gotten hooked on pain pills in his early twenties and then started shooting heroin\nMy son never thought that it would go as far as it did\nMiddle watched as our youngest child came close to dying\nThere was times when he was so great and frail I didn't know if he was going to make it stay at all I wanted to pause myself\n[noise] she was sick [noise]\nBut [noise] um [noise] of fighting mama and I was to anything to say\nOne of her biggest opponents in that fight was stigma Miller says many people no longer saw her son as someone what saving\nI actually got into a fight with a security guard at a hospital I said if we don't get much some some help he's gonna leave here it he's going to go use drugs and he could die and the security part look to be reading my face and said oh well\nIt wasn't just strangers who wrote off her son\nI actually have a neighbor who still doesn't talk to me because of that and we were friends she she's so does your son to an addict and if my son had cancer should have been broken make cookies and you know sending players\nA son with cancer is worthy of sympathy a son with a heroin addiction as a character flaw why do many of us think of these two cases differently research I see one reason is that many people view drug addiction as a moral weakness\nAnd in many ways this maps onto some of the political discourse around personal responsibility versus coddling and enabling\n... is a professor of law and health sciences at Northeastern University he says the argument over whether a drug user should simply just say no this argument pocket for the ... party political distracts us from what needs to be the top priority saving lives\nLook if you want the person's take personal responsibility you have to give them the tools do that and unless you've revived a person who is dying there are going to take personal responsibility for anything\nThe problem is not just the political conversation public health experts say stigma seeps into the whole framework of how we think about drug addiction\nEven the language we use is often implicitly pejorative urine tests and users are called clean or dirty depending on whether they test negative or positive for drugs\nAnd the stigma around drug use is often compounded by stigma around race when it comes to heroin the idea that some lives out what's saving and some are not is not new\nFor a long time the face of heroin addiction was poor and black many advocates see little was done to help out an opioid started to make inroads into white communities\nBut black or white stigma and judgment in different communities obscure what the science says that drug addiction is a chronic illness\nMany people don't understand that at all ... they think you can say okay I can just stop and you you cannot just stop it is a life long struggle\nHook trucks ill and her husband Pete living the western Maryland city of Frederick last year the thirty four year old daughter released shut died after overdosing on fentanyl a synthetic form of heroin\nShe was seven months pregnant hope says before her daughter died the family often felt the weight of judgment so many people\nLook at these ... that are addicted to drugs they colon ever name in the book there junkies there are these\n... says that after his daughter died even relatives still under way\nI Am nobody from my immediate family as cold as a stopped and said hey how you know when I Know you were going through some rough times can can I help you can not one phone call not one visit from mommy the family uh\nIt's almost like the world is telling him your daughter didn't matter\nShe's just not another number while she just another addict did no she's somebody to us maybe not to nobody else but to us she was everything [noise]\nThe\nTrucks will step into the back yard to show me the memorials they have built for their daughter ... truck so such a few have combined visited just as they didn't come by when at least show was in the throes of addiction\nPeople just stay away and I'll say well do they think I have some kind of disease is what it feels like\nStigma she says feeds on itself\nOf course then we pull white because you know your daughter's doing something wrong she shouldn't be doing it so you had that problem there too\nBut not really sure died she says something changed\nEspecially after she had passed I said no I'm not holding back in ... ... make because say somebody\nThey attend meetings and the community they reach out to other families who are affected by the opioid crisis the trucks have gone to learn that fighting stigma [noise]\nIt's on all of us\nShankar Vedantam NPR News\nI'm\nShankar is the host of the hidden brain podcast you can hear more reporting on the opioid epidemic

Eighteen percent compared to last year for more with the current dip in home sales really means for housing market we have Richard green he's director of us sees ... Center for real estate to Richard welcome back\nThanks where it's always a good thing for people to want to buy a home\nWell yeah I mean for people who can't afford a house they want the price of housing to go down and so yes for them it improves the portability\nSo seeing these prices go down and wonder if you can maybe wait it out a little bit for it to go down a little bit are you running the risk of prices going back up\nWell I think the issue is it first of all people just shouldn't treat houses like investments they\nTreat them as long term durable goods that there should be for a long period of time so I always tell people that if you're gonna live in a house for at least five years and you can afford it and that's how she like they were like just don't worry about the upside down just do it because you're buying a good to consume\nYou're buying a school district for your kid to go to and so on so if there's a house he really liked it you could afford it and it's where you want to live that just don't worry about these sorts of up and down fluctuations up but if you could be strategic about it if you're um [noise] I'm\nParticularly not worried about getting into a particular school district right now then yeah I Would wait a little bit before I bought\nSo then why is it right now getting more difficult for homeowners to sell their properties right now\nWell it's you know it's it's a cliche but it's\nLike a lot of cliches true is when interest rates go up it's just harder to sell houses and we've seen a pretty substantial increase in mortgage rates in the last year or so if you go from the hearts raised the heart force\nA that means your interest costs is going up by thirty thirty three percent and it means a house that you might have felt comfortable with supporting a year ago you're can't afford it All right now\nAnd when it comes to interest rates and the cost of construction or what's the connection between the two because I Know that that that has a little bit to do with uh the prices of could of fluctuated like they are now\nThat's right so if if you're a home builder uh you don't have cash that you use to put up those houses that you will ultimately cell what do you do as you borrow money from the back you gotta construction lung and you\nBorrow that money for the four five six months of pictures of built the house and so if the banks charging a harder interest higher interest rate and they do because the Federal Reserve is truck back higher interest rate then that just goes directly to the cost of putting up the house\nStarting to Richard green he's USC director of us he's ... for real estate so what do you think coverage or I mean our our home sales you're going to continue to decline or they just going to plateau\nI think they're going to go to a I mean again the market has been\nVery hot I I I think we could see real soft as for the next couple of years for for a bunch of results\nUm I actually think of all things a trade war\nCould make a difference in terms of how the housing market goes and the next couple of years because if you didn't win suppose capital flows their port interest rates and materials prices [noise] uh I don't expect to see anything like what we saw in two thousand two thousand eight this time around because the stuff that led to that which is\nToo much construction too much borrowing I'm ... ... we don't have any of that right now\nAre we turning to a more\nThey would stop their conversation and stare at me and they would keep staring at me and tell me would\nHurry up and turn and face of all terrified and hoping that it would be morning Mm\n\nI never told anybody because I didn't want to get made fun of by my sisters and I was sure that it was in my head\nFlash forward to high
