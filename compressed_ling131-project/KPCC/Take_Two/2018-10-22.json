{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "So basically just another crazy Newsweek in Washington\nThis is MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm David Greene\nAnd I'm Steve Inskeep years ago the writer ... Audrey brand you work in a clothing store he worked in a holiday season which peaks on Black Friday and that experience and forms the short story collection he calls\nFriday black Audrey brand new this book makes its points by exaggerating race and class divisions and consumer culture or is it really exaggeration you spoke with no okay\nYou write in this field of of speculative fiction or dystopian fiction whatever you want to call it but one thing that separates you from other authors I've read in in that genre is that you were writing seems to be explicitly political\nAnd I wonder um as a black writer do you feel that that is partially a responsibility to have a political take on things\nI don't want to like suggest to any black writer has any particular thing they have to do I mean that said I myself do feel compelled to write about certain things um it's pretty much unavoidable that my work um engages subjects that are highly politicized I think that\nMost identities or where they intersect with the culture that they come out of 'em there's this this politics involved sometimes just existing in space and proudly Miley is somehow political so I think\nUm if you write fiction and anything that's not a vacuum on some level I think it's political and so because no one writes in a vacuum and no one comes out of a vacuum you're kind of doing some of the political and if you and I think it's a great privilege to think you are not\nMany of your stories are are filled with brutality but there is also a wide vein of dark humor running through some of them which I think might surprise people the story that gives you a book it's titled friday black\nThis short story takes place in what we as soon as a department store and it's a it's a Black Friday the Friday after Thanksgiving which we all know is is kind of a nightmare of consumerism you're protagonist as a young man working in the store selling fleece\nJackets you have these just vicious scenes where people consumers shoppers storm\nThe entrance of the store and there are so overwhelmed at the idea of getting a deal that they trample each other they when they trample each other to the point of debt they they show bodies out of the way that is a heck of a way to look at at Black Friday [laughter] what were you saying there\nTo talk about the humor in it for me it's important to\nTry to laugh when you can because I think it's healthy but also I think for me it's a way to help me say exactly what I wanted to say because if I don't add celebrities um humor I probably won't get through on some level for the reader I think it's like the sugar it's health and medicine go down sometimes\nUm you kind of get to a story where there's like ... the state of humor and sometimes I think the punch line is it actually it wasn't a joke after all but with on that story friday but\nI did work in retail I really have seen a like a woman step one another woman's like cash for genes um we all know for a fact that pretty much annually someone gets killed because people in ... to try and get TVs in my mind the first thing that happened everyone the country the world to the ... well\nYou know maybe we've I'm taking this thing too far but it's that's a scary thing for me to think about what's scary like think how how we can know that happens so regularly still sort of casually participate\nYet the main character in that story and friday black as a young man who wants to get the sales record because he will win a prize and the prize is a coat that he intends to give to his mother\nAnd at one point of a colleague it in the unmanned confront them and says you know seeing seeing the body string about hearing the yelling and screaming he says this this is just not worth it your mother knows that you love her she doesn't need to ...\nAnd you know what's what's funny about that moment and I didn't have that moment ... ... if you believe that originally really like the original draft and I'm surprised I\nYeah and actually I'm prior to the book being caught fire blackout a previous title and after I made that editorial change after Ira buys it and made that moment I was\nFinally like okay this this can be the title of the book because you absolutely need that moment the moment of self implication in which the somebody said like you know you think you're not in this but you are and to just the same line of logic I'm going to participate in this craziness\nBecause I'm going to get my mother a thing and the ... and again for me it was before because like I said I really didn't work in retail there was a contest in my story through and giving us more money or something whoever's made the most sales we get um a north face jacket\nAnd I got it from my mom I really did wow I really did do that and um\nYou know I don't know that she wears it any more\nYou are the the son of of immigrants from Africa I'm from ... yes but my parents are from Donna how how do you think that informs the way you see race in the United states and in particular racial tension which makes up so much of of your book in in the United states\nI'm sure it informs me and a lot of ways I Can't even really perceive you know my parents are\nThey're very decided we um they're African there I mean and they would sometimes even ... I had a built in thing that I had to work doing sort of just about even my distinction from black Americans which they were like you know you're not from here and I don't think you can act like these people here\nAnd because of the way our started again in Queens New York I was I I understood you know block is different and all you know but because of the way like the sort of pride associated with with my parents come from and I didn't have to default to a feeling of\nWhite is the best which I think it's really hard to escape and America and you mentioned something before like some of my characters [noise]\nA lot of them it's explicit that some of them they're not but in my mind that all black\nYou know I don't accept the sort of white ... in in the literary world it's almost like if you don't say they're black or white\nI definitely like sort of try to resist that and especially because in ... often the way they're racist revealed his do some type of traumatic incidents happening because of their race and I don't want that to be the case where I'm readers are owning seeing characters that are of color\nHaving that matter of fact in some kind of pain or trauma for them\n[noise] none of climbing Ajay ... thank you so much for coming in to talk today we really appreciate it I appreciate it thank you so much [noise]\nAs new short story collection is called friday block [noise]\nAnd this is MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm David Greene [noise]\nYou've been listening to MORNING EDITION on eighty nine point three K.

southern Mexico about the caravan of people heading north from Honduras building thank you very much\nA little bit closer to home now the county of Los Angeles just launched an audit looking into the fire departments overtime costs\nThe audit is expected to be done in December but the Los Angeles times ran the numbers and published its results over the weekend\nThe times found that over time made up a third of the average fire department employees annual pay last year in other county departments overtime was just six percent ... and writing about this for the LA Times ... to\n... ready to be here now give us an overview of your investigation numbers do crunch to come up with these overtime costs\nRight as you mentioned there was an audit and we wanted to get into the bottom of payroll at the fire department so we pulled a database of of everyone's paychecks for the last five years to something like a hundred thousand employees in the county\nAnd we found that by far fire department um employees were more likely to make high amounts of overtime and something like six hundred and forty firefighters made a hundred thousand dollars in overtime last year\nAnd that's um many more than anyone or any other department at accounting\nIncluding the sheriff's department which obviously we're you know requires some overtime and more than hospitals public hospitals with doctors we also found a couple of dozen employees who made more than two hundred thousand and overtime as firefighters last year the numbers were kind of um eye popping how much of a difference between other departments [noise]\nSo a big difference so we had um twenty eight employees at the LA county sheriff's office you made a six figure over time and again there were six hundred and forty five at the fire department might know what's the reason for all those overtime pay\nThere are multiple reasons one is that they're you know we've been through a period of drought in severe wildfires and so the fire department not only fight wildfires inside of LA county but they also traveled to northern jurisdictions to help out and also traveled to other places like Puerto Rico to help out with\nWith hurricanes and when that happens there vacancies and they have to be filled by people in overtime shift so other employees will work extra to to make up for the vacancies there are other problems where they had a hiring hum\nA spur of hiring in the eighties and those folks are retiring now some of those are vacancies and then there's also sort of uh the\nThe typical problem that you see in large urban fire departments where you you're you have um constant staffing that's required on on each apparatus three or four firefighters and each station across the jurisdiction and there's the little strain on the department to fill all those positions\nTo just be clear it's not just fighting the fires here locally it's it's fighting other things in other places it's causing all the hours to pile up\nIt is and it you know there there are also issues inside the department in which people can take leave or take time off and that requires other firefighters to work they have a pretty a generous um you know employment package at the fire department\nAnd they're you know again there's this question of whether allocating the resources correctly would it be ... you know ... ... smarter to hire more firefighters more rapidly as opposed to paying extra to the ones they have on staff\nNow what is the fire department said about all those well they\nPoint to obviously the important role that the fire department place both in LA county enter in state and and that puts a strain on their resources they also say they're working to try to get back to the staffing levels at ... they'd like to have after the economic downturn forced them to to stop hiring about a decade ago\nThey're doing their best they don't believe that there's any malfeasance or people budging the numbers they just feel like they have a duty to protect the entire county and the region and that that's expensive\nBut do these overtime costs then filtered down to all of us\n[noise] they do and you if you think about it in the last fiscal year the department budgeted already a hundred and sixty million dollars just for overtime knowing that it's a part of the cost of doing business of running a major urban fire department they went over that total by forty six million\nAnd so that's forty six million could be could go to other county priorities including you know mental health probation it can help with homelessness so if there is a priority of the department to spend money on this end at the county and uh you know you get the government that you pay for\nNow the times that its own audit or the county's official audit isn't expected until December what do you think the audit will reveal about to actions that county need to take\n[noise] we don't know a new one ah one thing that they are doing is looking at the top overtime recipients to see you know to check their time cards and things like that I I presume\nTo make sure that uh they're they're staying in compliance with department procedures they do have rules to to protect firefighters from working too much and to protect the public from fatigue you know set in by by too many shift for the firefighters another thing that we might see\nIs a an increased focus on the county getting reimbursed when it helps other jurisdictions so if they go to northern California do those counties are cities reimbursing the there's the fire department for the work that they put in\n... county for the times not thanks a lot thank you [noise]\n\nYou could come to our department and file an application and that would allow us to begin the process of\nTalking with you looking into your background so that we could determine what your criminal background maybe um we also ask for permission to look into other matters like your health and we do a survey of the home to make sure the home is adequate\nAnd so that process combing aids and a full review and should take between three and six months\nThree and six months do you think when people hear that they don't realize\nThe steps that are required in some I think it's invasive\nSome might consider it and they said uh what we try to do is to make it as a comfortable process as possible but I'd have to say that um we owe it to these children who have already been hurt\nAnd we have taken them into care for them the very worst thing that could happen is for us to place them with a family that again hurt them\nTo once I'm a family qualifies or they're going to have a foster kids in their home they're paid per ... eight hundred a month roughly\nRoughly around nine hundred that figure is roughly what the USDA says is the cost of caring for a child in the United states today than this payments can increase with higher levels of need for children um like medical needs\nTo outside of the money what other resources exist for potential foster parents\nWe have a one line that we have just developed which has a twenty four hour day\nResource that allows foster parents to call in should they need something we also provide for the child or any kind of medical needs that they have including any kind of psychological needs and we will bring in in home therapists are an wraparound services\nTo serve the child as well as a foster parent if they needed\n... director of the LA county department of child and family services\nI mean this brings us to recruitment so that in terms of recruiting more people to become foster parents are white protecting started\nWe are reacting in part to emotion that was filed in this week we're supervisors to direct us a as a system to recruit through our church is the faith based organizations in a community oftentimes are those that helped to bring in people to the system\nNow I Can't help but wonder um how kids might be matching the situation because that's we've discussed in the past there are a lot of kids in the system will identify as el GB T. Q. but\nThere is no faith community they tend to maybe be more conservative about gender identity issues some might not want to open their home to a gay child how do you plan to deal with that potentially shirts\nYou know that's a very difficult issue and I think as a nation the way that we've dealt with this historically is to try to place children with people who are accepting\nOf children as they are then there are other opportunities to recruit him the gay and lesbian community I Am a member of the LDP de Q A community and I will be making a specific effort to recruit LDP teach you foster parents and adoptive parents so that\nWe can provide good homes for these children and homes that really understand the kind of uh problems that these children and counter that\nOnly people that are eligible for each you can understand\nWhy let's switch gears for a minute talk about Georgia where were you ran the child services system before coming here they're the number of kids in the system jumped us I'm forty percent during the time you were there what happened why was that the case in Georgia\nThat was in the throes of a um a opiate crisis and Georgia was one of the states that were hardest hit in the nation during the period that I was there and that was put between two thousand fourteen two thousand seven the\nUh were kids that were coming as a result of opiate abuse and um that problem is one that they did is continuing there um but it was definitely one that was about to overwhelm the system\nAnd you were ... you try it after that to standardize the way workers took and complaints ...\nAbsolutely prior to that Georgia's a state that has a hundred and fifty nine counties there were a hundred and fifty nine different ways of doing in Haiti in child welfare cases\nWe did standardized that I think the um easier way of reporting from people came right on time the cause that would be a crisis hit almost simultaneous with that\nWondering when we first spoke awhile back ... you know exactly what you were going to do specifically for LA county or try to compare George and out but now that you get on the job a little while wondering anything from your time and Georgia that you've been able to use or implement successfully here in LA yeah well\nHave not done anything as far as major overhaul staff um I've taken ten months to really study the system to make sure that whatever I bring your is something that actually since the system there are some things that we are doing that we have not waited on\nUm one of those is our revamp of some training in the investigation of cases for children have died\nIn the aftermath of the ... a case one of the things that we did was review over a thousand cases\nWe took the information from those and expanded samples where we needed to to make sure that the quality of the work was good we also have been a part of the prevention after care network\nOr to provide funding to community based organizations who engage with us and provide services on a voluntary basis to those families that may need it but don't rise to the level of a child who is being abused or neglected\nBody one more thing before we part you mentioned Anthony ... it's a child who died earlier this year his mother and her boyfriend had been charging his death than earlier this month prosecutors that they may seek the death penalty wondering any word on whether social workers looking into abuse claims at the home will be held accountable\nWe had been out of that case for nearly two years\nAnd so the work that was done up to the point that we exited the case was the kind of work that we want social workers doing I think there is no I'm sure way of assuring that a child will always be safe\nThat is not the state of the art in social work um and so what we do is try to do everything we can to avoid this outcome um and in that case I think we did the best we can do under the circumstances and then for two years didn't have\nBy the ... he's the director of LA county child and family services Bobby thank you once again for your time thank you very much [noise]\nHalloween is here no not the trick or
