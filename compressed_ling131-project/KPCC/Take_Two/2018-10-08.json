says Trump will talk about the work his administration is doing to protect American communities and his push to secure the border\nI mean he's been campaigning campaigning much like an incumbent in the sense that he doesn't feel at least she hasn't bus far felt the need to engage in debate if you look at the way he's running he's running like an incumbent does she puts a lot of his time and energy and money and resources and his campaign to helping other Democrats around the state because he sees\nThat you know it's it's a foregone conclusion released it was in June that he was going to be elected but I you know I think maybe a you know as we get close to the finish line here that nuisance starting to think that it's not enough just to win that you've got to win by enough of a margin so that you come in\nTo Sacramento in January with a you know some some power some some notion that uh you're you're a legitimate statewide candidates you can you know actually engage in in tough issues like homelessness and housing and these other kinds of issues so\nYou know as the race has tightened up and it actually has in the last few months I think it's it's actually knew some seeing you know he's not going to be on TV but he's going to at least to say that look like I showed up to a debate\nAnd political joke is I think love debates because we just it's kind of like fans how they love things that happened in sports ... you've experienced some of these challenges firsthand\nYeah you know you mentioned that congressional races and I've been in touch with several of the campaigns for those key races here in Southern California and let me tell you there has been a lot of tension around debates\nAnd just a couple of examples in congressional district twenty five that's in northern LA county Republican incumbent Steve night against democratic challenger Katie held their\nWhen their debates made news when one of the chambers of commerce hosting the debate a band any audio or video recordings so that was a really big deal uh and then in congressional district forty eight that's down in Huntington Beach area in orange county a that's with a incumbent a Dana Rohrabacher and democratic challenger Harley ...\nThere's been a lot of controversy there over the settings for the debates you know whether the public will be allowed it looks like they're going to need at least twice but there's just so much tension around this and I have to say you know talking with voters there is a sense of frustration at you know sort of every level what these debates whether it's for statewide office\nUm or otherwise a feeling frustrated and confused and you know some people feeling like there's just not enough public access to these candidates to get a sense of how they might govern ...\nReady for the governor's debate between John Cox and Gavin Newsom we're doing it with the PC senior political correspondent Mary Plummer jak course or visiting professor of government at Claremont McKenna College and also ... political reporter for Kiki we'd be in San Francisco\nI'm ... the way we watch debates is also change especially after the spectacle that was the twenties extreme presidential election based on what you've heard from people in San Francisco what voters want to hear from the candidates today\n[noise] oh you know I mean I think the interesting thing about all of this and what Mary's talking about too is that I think a lot of what we're seeing on the national level with the partisanship has led down to the local level so I think it would definitely depend on if you're a ... vote or and and you know there's that\nSeems to be less and less gray area these days but you know in general I think the biggest issues in LA and San Francisco or housing homelessness affordability right I mean it's such they are such visible problems in such a visceral ones and they really do cross party lines\nSo um you know I obviously I think there are people that are very involved in the climate change men who are going to want to be seeing answers about that I think you know people have their sort of niche areas but I think if you would we're to talk to any average person\nThose are some of the issues that are going to come up because we're all facing a minute's not you know it it is not going to go away no matter who's sitting in the governor's mansion\nMary Plummer you've been on the ground around Southern California what are the voters here want to know from the candidates\nYou know it's interesting I'm certainly the topics that um recent mentioned are of interest to voters here in Southern California but I have to say\nA lot of voters I'm Talking to her just frankly not all that focused on the governor's race and I think that's reflective of the split along party lines you know many folks already know who there'll be backing based on whether they prefer a Republican or Democrat\nAre running the state when we look at on the recent ... poll 'em and top issues for California and you know jobs in the economy and was number one number two with immigration\nAnd number three was housing and but that alliance pretty closely with folks here and then of course as we've been saying that Trump factor is so huge um I think really at every level of the political spectrum President Trump is motivating but voters are for and against various candidates dressed up and down the ballot as we head towards\nNovember ... I think you know there's a huge report on climate change release this morning by the United nations' scientific pedal and it creates a pretty bleak future if we don't get greenhouse gases under control soon ... extreme drought wildfires reserve when it comes to the environment what are the candidates stand on the environment\nI Would say like pretty typical sort of Republican democratic lines you know you have John Cox who's really made this campaign\nRailing against regulation and California he ties that to the you know bigger affordability issues um and so you know he talks about trying to repeal or change the quo which is our environmental law around developments\nUm and so I think he's staked out a pretty you know typical sort of Republican anti regulation position\nAnd then new you know it comes from San Francisco\nUm I think has always been environmentally minded is not something he talks about as much as Jerry Brown it does not\nLike his pet issue but I Would imagine that he would be pretty much in line with what we've seen from our current governor and a lot of those issues I think the question is how much political capital would use to continue pushing these things especially with\nThe federal government really stepping away from this issue and and again I mean that has really been Jerry Brown's kind of clarion call these last two terms I'm outside of a couple of other things that's what he's been focused on towards that course\nI already know that we're just going to attract people from other city and then they're going to harvest\nThese facilities should be an industrial area because they are not looking\nSpend a lot of money to buy homes get our kids to school and you know just to leave the Americans feel like our safety and\nWell being being compromised knowing thinking about\nAnd nine us they feel compassion for the homeless Stephanie tells me she hands out McDonald's gift cards to homeless people she encounters around town\nBut they're concerned about their kids' safety and maintaining the quality of their good middle class lives they're not the only ones several dozen people showed up to a city council meeting in June to rail against David project\nOr do what people do need security and mental health services living this close to my neighborhood we have enough going on with the homeless that are leaving their needles their drugs the masses\nAre we're not going to stand by and watch you ruined neighborhood more and let this coming year how\nSome people still in support of the project too but they've definitely weren't as loud or as angry\nFullerton like cities throughout Orange County is under pressure to how homeless people the county has an ambitious new goal every city built its fair share of twenty seven hundred units a permanent supportive housing David project is the plants first big test so lots of people are watching it\nI started reporting the story in June that's when Fullerton city council told David to try and win over the neighbors the council had planned to vote this month any day now actually the first step is pretty innocuous a yes or no on moving forward with an exclusive negotiating agreement\nBut even that feels beyond the reach for David right now so he's pulling pathways request to move forward you might try again and twenty Nineteen\nWe didn't get into this was going to get out of it is that everything was just\nWoke up at the border to help at all by telephone\nIs home to more than thirty thousand people who are chronically on sheltered if no one wants to have them in their neighborhood how will we ever get people off the streets covering Orange County I'm Joe replicable\nSo Joe joins us now in Studio for more low Joel I started reporting on this in June why did you want to focus on this one project\nBut you know I've been covering the homeless crisis in orange county for a few years now you know there was just a fiction of hundreds of people camping along the Santa Ana river earlier this year and then some really fierce fights over where to build shelters which are not over yet and I got interested in this proposal in Fullerton because people want to hear about solutions you know not just the problem\nAnd a lot of people are watching the fate of this one project closely and that's because the county recently adopted a plan it was first put forth by the associate association of California cities Orange County to build a twenty seven hundred units a permanent supportive housing across the county for chronically homeless individuals\nAnd families and with the goal of ending chronic homelessness in orange county and so back in June it seems like Fullerton city council was going to start pursuing this proposal from packed with of hope and this is to build sixty units a permanent supportive housing for chronically homeless individuals in Fullerton\nAnd you know the neighbors showed up at a city council meeting and then the city council backed off and here's what councilmember Greg ... said to pass away CEO David lenders after he heard the neighbors complains\nBrinkley it's done rather than most of the neighbors or at least ... a lukewarm support or if this thing goes for your job I'm convinced that but you need to convince everyone else with it too\nSo I knew there'd be a big fight and I wanted to document how it unfolded\nLot's happened since then ...\nYeah how do we knew they needed to educate people in the neighborhood about their plans and make the case that supportive housing would be good for the neighborhood right so they health and community meetings they lobbied the faith community to get involved they took neighbors on tours and you'll hear more about this my reporting this week\nAnd those efforts went okay but they didn't seem to be moving the needle enough and just in the last few days I learned that pathway is has decided not to move forward with the proposal right now anyway\nAnd I think that's what started the votes on Fullerton city council weren't there\nYou know elections are coming up and just a few weeks and uh one observer observer of a local politics remark that it's political suicide for elected officials to advocate for homeless shelters and housing is this unique for tuna weren't Shelley no it's definitely not you know and I want\nTo know debt Fullerton actually of the city has done more than ... to address homelessness\nBut you know these nimby you're not in my backyard fights are happening all over Southern California\nWe saw recently in Sherman Oaks where some residents rate threatened to recall the LA city councilman David ...\nThat was also over a proposal for permanent supportive housing\nAnd we thought earlier this year in orange county where counties are supervisors were met with a massive public backlash when they proposed open shelters in several cities\nAnd you know it strikes me is that a lot of local officials recognize at this point the need for supportive housing and emergency shelters and that includes conservative politicians from Orange County here's Jennifer Fitzgerald she's the city council member who represents the ... where the ... proposal ... would have been built\nI'm a conservative and I believe that people should work hard and that we make choices and there are consequences to those choices but we all have help in our lives and I am fully cognizant of the fact that there are people with out that support\nPermanent supportive housing to me is a logical place\nTo have local government be part of that solution\nAnd that's because ... cities have the Landry and yet as we're seeing there's still a big disconnect between local officials and at least what they say about permanent supportive housing and their constituents willingness to embrace and and that obviously circles back in the ... affects how local officials and vote on these kinds of projects\nThat you know the supervisor Andrew Do told me earlier this year it takes real political courage to push back on these kinds of you know proven solutions to homelessness against the people who can vote you out of office\nHere's the thing because everyone says they want people off the street and we want a solution to ...\nYeah but it's it's pretty hard to find people raising their hands saying please do this in my neighborhood and at the same time a lot of city officials I've talked to throughout Orange County say the largest volume of complaints that get from residents is related to St homelessness and here's what David from pathways says about that\nWe have an idea how to help your choice of committed choice will be\nDo we activate all those opportunities that dog [noise]\nDo we wait for some sort of golden record fly in and fall homelessness\nAnd affords me he says you know we have an idea on how to help with that he's talking about permanent supportive housing\nAnd I also want to add a real quick that you know we're starting to hear a lot that housing is a solution to homelessness you've probably heard that and I think some people here that and they say well isn't the solution to homeless is actually not letting people fall into homelessness and the first place and you know I think that's a good point and organizations like half way\nIt's also do prevention work but we're really in tree our mode right now in Southern California in terms of getting people who are already on the streets into housing job really quick uh what else can we expect from Sears yeah so I mean it's basically an anatomy of this one battle in Fullerton and I hope listeners will go away understanding more about chronic homelessness and permanent supportive housing\nAnd also how hard it is to get these projects off the ground and why and then nothing about Fullerton is there's only around two hundred and fifty people living on the streets by recent count\nAnd that doesn't seem like a lot of people to house when you compare it to LA you know the city of LA has more than fourteen thousand residents who are chronically homeless LA county has almost forty thousand people living on the streets without shelter\nSo it's ... I Can't even get the small project do you know we have a huge challenge on our hands\nLet's keep easy Orange County reporter Joel rabbinical job openings lump\n[noise]\nAre too high profile movies came out this weekend one has been a darling of the critics and it did well at the box office but not as good as another film who those same critics absolutely hated I'm going to find out which movie was slated to bomb but actually blew up the box office to head one to two continues\nIs eighty nine point three K PCC News Good morning I'm heady lint herpes at nine forty as you may have heard earlier this morning to met hoping to be California's next governor about face each other for what to expect to be their only debate at at the November election and we'll be carrying the debate lives starting at ten\nBetween Republican John Cox and Democrat Gavin Newsom\nThen it'll ... host alive state why call in show featuring analysis and voter reaction to the debate this programs in collaboration with the California Dream project\nWell if you find yourself irritable and ... when it's hot there may be a scientific reason\nA team of researchers and mapping California's heat waves in comparison to self reported symptoms like stress anxiety and depression they found the correlation is strongest during strings of warm nights my two Lee Roma chadron is one of the researchers from UC Riverside\nNighttime heat wave you know are an additional a stretch factor because the sunshine contact with each time he isn't that it's just too much\nThis is part of a larger research project looking at the health effects of climate change around the country MIT recently found more instances of fatal car crashes and food poisoning on hot days citing a slump in public safety worker productivity when temperatures are high", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Take Two", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "08"}
