Greene so in the final season of a hit Netflix series house of cards Francis Underwood is dead in the spotlight now turns to Claire Underwood the first woman president of the United states you've played by Robin Wright\n[noise] my first one hundred days president have been difficult\nYour husband and I had an blamed Francis is dead or may not by me here's the thing whatever friends have told you the last five years [noise] don't believe a word [noise]\nNow the death of her husband was a rewrite the show runners Frank pool you as a and Melissa James Gibson had to re envision their Emmy Award winning show after Kevin Spacey who played for instance Underwood was accused of sexual harassment and assault last year they weren't determined to continue house of cards without him\nRobin Wright frankly as a militia James Gibson all\nSat down together in our studios in New York City to talk with Rachel Martin\nRobin if I could ask you about the allegations who told you or did you find out in the process\nYeah here we all found out through the press and [noise] you know of course shocked and surprised and then you're polarized as a team with the moral and ethical thing to do and they made an executive\nDecision and Marcy a Netflix and and all of us deciding to close out this beautifully operatic show and what it also would have meant to shut down\nIs that we would have been putting almost two thousand people out of a job in the state of Maryland where we shoot and that was security that people were dependent on\nDid you essentially have to go back to square one I mean how much had you already started to think about the upcoming season or even I think I read you'd started shooting at right Melissa put you on spot we had started shooting it and we we thought it through um really quite just about the whole thing [noise]\nBut all of the DNA was was there at you know she's in five ended with a rabbit character Claire turning to the camera and saying my turn so that was indeed what we continue to serve and explore and I will say just because\nThe character Francis Underwood is not on the screen doesn't mean his absence is not on the screen and that doesn't mean that is not still being dealt with and in his options became dramatic opportunity to see who would try to fill that space\nRight we knew to deny the existence of Francis Underwood would be dishonest you know to the history of the show um there's no way that Claire isn't in dialogue with her past with him as she's forging a future for herself and she may\nBe comfortable in this position but others around her or not and there's this scene early on when ... character this D.C powerbroker\nHe has ... old Clare president Underwood into signing a bill and when she finally agrees he physically grabs her hand and covers it with his as she signs it and I found this so disturbing to watch\nMaybe because of everything else around the show but like this idea that\nHe feels he could manipulate her what was that seemed like the ...\nThere's a lot of discussion around that remember where I live in which she had for\nA man and the decision behind saying yes let him do that ... was because in politics and what's so much of the backbone of the show is about is you always have to sacrifice something to get what you want\nI mean we always knew that we wanted this season to be an exploration of who owns the White House so no matter what and this was a physical ... benefits station or a of a a theme we were working on\nAnd you know and also is this country [laughter] you know within the world of the show ready for a female president for [noise]\nUm if I could ask you Robin just about your relationship with Kevin Spacey you've talked about it before as something that was a it was a professional relationship um you didn't really know him socially but you told variety last month and I'm quoting here that you feel sorry for anybody who's life is in the public arena that you hate that part of the industry\nAnd you also said you believe in second chances do still feel that way about Hollywood writ large in about\nAbout Kevin Spacey um yes I hate what the media does with our sentiments in our words um [noise]\nAnd I didn't say just that sentence this is the problem with being extracted [noise]\nUm you know that's one sentence out of a paragraph that I said I said I Believe when people do the work and they reform I think everybody has the ability to do that\nDo the work and reform and that's what I said and in that instance then you should be given a second chance in life\nIf they're true change that occurs so I wasn't pinpointing\nAny specific human being I was talking about humankind and their abilities so when I was paraphrased um I've just decided to not common anymore because I'm I'm so sick of\nAh being taken out of context and then then that's being insensitive to victims out there that I'm not insensitive to\nAs you all move away from this project what have you learned from this show these characters\nNormally you're making a movie for six eight ten weeks and then you say goodbye or those people this was a six year relationship that we had we we spent more time with each other than we did our own families and people\nWould come on said and they walk off and they were like wow it's palpable how close everyone is you can feel how everyone has each other's back they just want all of you to do the best work I mean we would crack up after a certain\nScenes lines that you guys would write and\nWe were like we just actually so [laughter] we line came out of my mouth I Can't believe it it was fun the last day of shooting I imagine was full of a lot of emotions\nIt was of jumping up and down and sobbing at the same time it's good to put characters Tibet I'm sure it's the same for you guys as writers right\nYeah but that night nobody wanted to go to bed don't nobody will do not want to leave was that it was until they break the people actually finally left because well didn't want to go [noise]\nWell it has been a pleasure talking with the three of you making new [noise]\nThat was our co host Rachel Martin speaking
