balls strikes a video board or sky camera but the vast majority of football players end in violence in football if roughness weren't necessary there wouldn't be a penalty called unnecessary roughness\nBut the NFL has come to realize it must redefine its governing monitor of acceptable violence player health is no longer something to be taken lightly with the same time the NFL has rightly come to believe that for football to remain high scoring entertainment\nThose gun slinging quarterbacks need to be special we cared for clay Matthews would say coddled and successive weeks\nThe Green Bay Packers delivered hits on quarterbacks that wouldve earned a player praised from pop Warner level to the pros instead Matthews hits were met with appropriate for the NFL said that Matthew tackles were violations because he had put quote most if not all of his body weight on the opponent\nWhat'd you say the NFL seems to have to find an illegal tackle by defining weren't tackle and then saying that the middle\nThe NFL had gone too far and was attempting to appreciate if we enforce rules that wouldn't just soften are safe and the game but would confuse it\nAs societal acceptance of violence changes and as our knowledge of head trauma expands sports obviously must change to\nThis change might come in fits and false starts in the NFL but there must be progress however hooky jerky toward a set of rules that balances the old roughness with the new sensitivity this last Sunday rough in the past or penalties dropped true true from thirty for the week prior\nI don't know if the true with turkey where the thirty four with jerky but it's an indication that the NFL is trying to get the balance right\nNFL tough died of course like seeing fewer flags for crunching quarterbacks but the

Emily hey guess driving and seeing that ... would have been one way or not driving\nRight what about when you had writing the science I did see it on my ... yeah All right so why did California want to do this to begin with\nOkay we have really bad air problems in California we have eight of the ten smoggy US cities in the country according to the American lung association so the air quality problems are just more severe here than they are in other states and they're even you know they're like the most severe and greater Los Angeles because we are number one on that list\nOf the ... cities in the country as we had been for most of the last Twenty years\nAnd last year twenty Seventeen the air quality in greater LA was so bad\nIt violated federal standards nearly forty percent of the time a hundred and forty five days and ... cars and trucks because cars and trucks are almost Ninety percent of the problems so it has to do with our with the tailpipe emissions right and what comes out of the tailpipe so it's hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide steak it emitted from tell types\nBut then there's this process where the sunlight bakes them and turns them into ozone which is just the scientific word for smog\nNow there is also power plants and oil refineries and other smokestacks but really most of the problem is what we are driving\nThe ironic part about this emily's that so when those signs were up on the freeway people's slowed down a bit to read them really quick and then they beat up and when they're young up what are they doing they're putting their foot on the gas yang laid off comes out so ironically that's what happens or\nNot clear to ask to California to take a pledge to clean up the ... what's the biggest thing a person can do to help reduce air pollution\nWell given that as we are saying uh most of the emissions come from our cars and the top three pledges understandably all have to do with how we use our car so you know number one on a pledge last was leaving your car at home today you know working from home biking to public transportation maybe car pooling\nMaybe instead of driving when you go out for lunch take a walk\nAnd number two has to do with the way we use our cars so avoiding idling turning off your car when you're waiting at that Starbucks drive through when you're picking up your kid at school when you're at the car wash\n'em hunting a parking spot to\nJust sit there it is true or or like if you get in your car and you need to check something on your phone do that first before you started up the car and then the third one is if you can switch from an older you know possibly less fuel efficient car to a more modern car like a hybrid and electric car or maybe even a hydrogen vehicle\nSo what if you can't give up your gas guzzlers right away what what else could a person do\nOkay so this actually just happened to me I was driving a ten year old car got about thirty miles per gallon and I really wanted to switch to a plug in hybrids that the car with a gas engine and electric battery cars like on the environment reporter I should live my values\nBut and I'm sure many renters can relate to this my landlord said no I could not charge a car at my apartment and this is actually a really big problem for rent or is as we have largely been shut out of electric cars because we had nowhere to charge\nSo I ended up getting a regular old Prius which still gets more than fifty miles per gallon and that's a lot better than what I used to do because the less gas you use you know the less you are and meeting the use gasoline related combustion emissions so I'm Still making an impact even though it's not as much as I Would have liked\nBut if you can't afford a new are cleaner car right now they're still smaller things you can do like if you're online shopping you can try to group all your Amazon purchases at once so you know don't order Monday Wednesday and friday I think about what you need for the week ordered them at once\nHopefully they'll come you know in one delivery and then if you're using ... choose to car pool option\nI Know someone to commute to work to and from using leftover\nYeah and and if you're using carpal then they're not making a single trip just for you yeah\nAll right so what do you say to people who liked the idea of clean air but just aren't motivated to make those kinds of changes I mean sell me on it how how my personally affected my poor\nAir quality okay so air quality is it's really like a leading cause of death worldwide it's ... very very and if I Need to this day and it really gets me is when I think about some other research on the long term health problems\nAmong children who grow up breathing polluted air in Southern California
