Inskeep\nAnd I'm Noel King good morning celebrity chef Carla Hall grew up in Nashville where she was raised on soul food\nShe celebrates the food of her childhood in her latest cookbook it's called Carlo halls soul food everyday and celebration whole spoke to our co host David Greene and she shared a few recipes with him starting with the classic feared okra\nAnd you can just take this Oprah and slice it in half\nAnd salt and pepper and place it on the grill\nAnd it gets the smoking is that is so wonderful and then you don't have to worry about the slime which I think a lot of people of course misunderstood it can get slimy right\nI think a lot of people don't like it because I think oh it's slimy and it's true you use those pods to thicken gumbo and soups and everything so that is one use for it but\nYou can also roasted you consider it you can grill it and it becomes this other textured\nThing so am I right I mean when I think of soul food I often think of of stuff that might not be that healthy ... chicken may be fried okra to\nAre you giving us like a healthier version of soul food or soul food misunderstood I mean I Know that fried chicken in your book we should make that clear but got those fried chicken but they're more vegetables and fried chicken so what does that tell us about so I think\nThat it is misunderstood I think there is a small piece that people know a soul food when you go to a soul food restaurant\nThe people who own that restaurant again to give you those celebration dishes that are going to bring you in\nWhen you are around the table and people from the outside come into your home you're celebrating so of course you're going to have Mac and cheese and some other pork chops and fried chicken and ribs and all of these things because that's what you do even in other cultures that's what you do\nSo I think that soul food got stuck there because this is what people are eating because they're celebrating and going to restaurants but people were having fried chicken every day because they couldn't kill their chickens I needed the eggs [noise]\nOne of the the real smile moments I'm reading the book was you're distinguishing between soul food and southern food [laughter]\nCan you remind us with a different losing your mind\nBlack people okay [laughter] so [laughter] black people um\nI think it's also the difference between a him and another girl spiritual okay you know you can sing the same song\nBut even if\nIf you were doing a no like oh and then you have some other ...\n\nOther notes that are being song or not on the paper but it is something about stealing that song and where that emotion came from so that is like our food it is it's a and I don't want to say is stains on it but it's a study on it you know you're putting that heart and it is\nComing from some place deep in your soul that you are getting out and and just wanting to pull somebody in and say I see you I feel the pain that you've been through that's a nigger oh spiritual\n[noise] well speaking of\nOf pain that people have been through um I I Know you you took a journey through the south of for the book and in one of the stuff you made was a mother Emanuel one of the oldest black congregation some itself it was the churches hundred Ninety nine birthday but this was also as so many of us know where a gunman opened fire on\nWorshipers just over three years ago in interest on the men's tragedy for for a whole country what what was\nThat experience like we had second thoughts about going there um because\nIt was there was so much pain but then because we were in town um we decided to go in Charleston so in ... in Charleston South Carolina\nAnd they were having a celebration and it was so beautiful and we went to the kitchen and we're in the way [laughter]\nWay because you're like a ... of the famous celebrity chef and she didn't care but the matrix that catch it was like I'm trying to get this re past\nFood done and you all are in the way um but they had all of these pots going in\nAnd then just this huge kitchen and there's a hierarchy that happens in the kitchen especially at these churches were these these women are getting the food out and then there's this one woman who's the best cook who was doling out a task\nTo other people and it is serious it was really beautiful and it was it was about the congregation coming together and there was a tragedy but there was also\nYou knew that they had each other and that anybody who came into that church that day was part of that family and it was just a beautiful thing one\nMore recipe from the book I wanted to ask you about um hot water corn bridge this is not your average corporate Carlos says something different\nRight it is not your average corn bread if you're not from the south [laughter]\nPeople under ... exactly what you're talking about I I I've certainly have much of cornbread and loved it but how would our vote of having a so what what what what what would I be doing to merge with\nHot water corn bread um you start with white corn meal you boil water and the corn meal there is salts and there is a little bit of baking powder and the hot water actually cooks the corn meal and then you make it into little patties and I always remember\nMy grandmother's fingers being in those patio so she would make little oval once my mother makes round ones whatever ... whatever shape and size you want and then you fry it and that\nBut it doesn't mean seriously it sounds like this recipe really carries a lot of the the larger things that you were learning about yourself through this project I must say that this was a\nPersonal journey with this book I\nSet out to tell the story so that African Americans could appreciate the food more and people outside of the community can understand what it is and and sort of maybe be inspired to\nNot only cook this food but also to look at what their personal ... is and what their food from their culture looks like\nBut I got more from it I think I appreciate other\nCuisines more I realized I was carrying a a chip on my shoulder about my food and wanting it to be special and and having this this moment\nOr not just a moment but to be realized at and what it is but I had a chip on my shoulder into it come out sideways and and you know\nUh and now it is just a law for this food and a deeper appreciation for other cuisines\n... love talking to you thank you for for coming back on and best of luck with the book thank you so much this has been such a pleasure [noise]\nThe book\nIs

K. through twelve public schools we have the fair employment and Housing Act which protects transgender people from discrimination in employment and housing prevent you from being fired or denied a job simply because you're transgender and then we have the unrest civil rights act\nWhich prohibits businesses from discriminating against ... against\n... people and including transgender people are when they're doing business so\nThose protections are at our state level will continue to protect transgender Californians what we're worried about is protections at the federal level for people in the more than half of our states that don't have similar protections for transgender people from discrimination\nAs soon as you're not worried if this becomes a law especially here in California and you're just worried outside of California\nWell we're worried that this is just another example of the Trump Pence administration going after our community and specifically targeting the transgender community and the impact that that would have on people across the country by denying them the opportunity to be protected under federal civil rights\nLaws and it's important to have those federal civil rights law so I don't want to downplay right um you know the\nThe frustration and the reaction to this proposal um but I what I Am confident and we will remain vigilant on is making sure that California even in the absence of federal action California will stand with the transgender community and continue to protect the transgender community\nThat Samuel Garrett paid communications

subterranean tunnel will open on December Kim but at least that's the plan\nTo my chest tunnel built by the boring company has poured a must underground transportation project which people in their cars from point a to B now\nIt's all quite mysterious most of the announcements about and have come in the fall of tweets but LA Times transportation reporter Laura Nelson got a peek at the plant Laurel welcome\nHi thanks for having me our first let's review the whole point of these titles I mentioned cars being shuttled but explain that you know a little more detail what's supposed to happen when this total is functioning as planned\nShore so um Illinois mosque envisions a transportation network that would stretch all across Southern California um through a series of tunnels much like the one that he's building in Hawthorne\nUm that would carry a an electric platform that mosque causes skate that can reach seeds of up to a hundred and thirty miles an hour inside these tunnels and he said that these platforms will be able to carry someone in a car or maybe someone on foot or on a bicycle who can board a kind of a pod like\nAlmost like a bus like structure on top of the platform well yeah and they you would be able to enter the system he has said through I'm basically a number of small elevator shaft that are the size of these uh states dotted across the city you can just drive on to one and it will lower you down into the tunnel network\n... hard to picture but you actually got a hold of the blueprints that were filed with the city and I know this is radio but described as best you can what he's pleasant to detail about the tunnel\nSo yeah the blueprints are not for the tunnel as a whole but it is for a small piece of the tunnel plan that\nThe company which is called the boring company is working on and that is um [noise] the blueprint shows a garage or in a very modest house near the Hawthorne ... airport and inside the garage the company is planning to build a forty foot\nDeep elevator that would lower cars in and out of the tunnel which is running nearby and it would basically give the company an opportunity to practice one of the key parts of their system which is you know being able to raise and lower vehicles out of the tunnel without anyone being able to see what they're doing\nTo see or even hear it right they say that the elevators are electric and they're you know no louder than any other electric motor type of device you would have in your home\nMothers first lego that's supposed to open in December is about two miles long uh well the public really be able to see and do when it opens I mean with the streets we actually working then\nThere's a lot of unknown still about what a must meant when he said the tunnel but open to the public and the rides to be an option for three of hot or an approved\nA two mile tunnel but the tunnels actually shorter than that they um the boring company told the city last month that they chose to shorten the tunnel so it's actually closer to a mile to a mile and a half um and\nThere's only been a limited number of images released by the company but one of them shows kind of your standard garden variety inside of a tunnel it has you know\nWiring lived along one side and a modest railroad track running along the bottom I'm which the company has been using the shuttle equipment and dirt and et cetera out of the tunnel as they've been building it\n... ... ...\nThe question is what kind of convenience our people are going to be writing through on this tunnel if it does indeed open to the public in December I'm of the company has not responded to that question\nIs are the lord Nelson tragedies reporter for the LA Times or you mentioned I mean yeah ... no one can see it it's very mysterious why all the injury I mean I guess it's just for us right we're talking about it and we're all three by it\nI mean I think that you're just describing this network really captures the public's imagination this idea that there would be a new way to move through Southern California that we don't currently have I think people in LA commuting is one of the most important things to all of us and the idea that there is some different better way is\nReally intriguing to people an addition to that I mean you must really has this\nYou know he he created tests like credits face facts he's created a number of kind of visionary creative companies and the idea that that skill set could be applied to commuting and moving through chopped traffic choked Southern California is appealing to people\nSee the belt Laura what safety protocols have been put in place\nSo the tunneling itself is overseen by um a sub department of ...\nShow which is the California workplace safety agency and they keep an eye on whether the tunneling work itself\nAnd the mining that goes along with that is being done safely there's still some questions that the federal and state level about what agency it which officials will be in charge of regulating the transportation\nSystem itself so the loop and the platform skates that I described earlier um but it still seems that that technology is a ways off from carrying you or me\nSo there's time left [laughter] it may be resolved those questions\nOr what do you think though I mean does this project have eight legs I mean could it ever become city wide all over the place something that is kind of a normal part of our lives\nEvery transportation innovation has skeptics at the beginning and I will say that um this tunnel is a special case because it runs through one city um that was\nExcited to become the first place where this technology could be tested for the city of Hawthorne has worked very closely with the boring company to make sure that they have what they need\n'em when Musk announced plans to tunnel through the city of Los Angeles it was a different story um there were there was a lawsuit filed against the city that first project has now stalled and\nHe's meeting kind of more of what you would think of is the traditional\nUm impediments to infrastructure project in Southern California so I think the jury is still out\nReally quick Laura after this two mile tunnel is built what happens next\nWell a mosque has said that he envisions a network of tunnels across Southern California but they envision this tunnel in Hawthorne continuing to be the type of place where the company can work on research and development so lowering cars in and out of the tunnel through our garage but maybe testing other types of engineering work or other ideas that they ... as well\nLord Nelson is a ... a reporter for the Los Angeles times or thanks a lot for having me\n[noise]\nOne", "show_name": "Take Two", "year": "2018", "city":
