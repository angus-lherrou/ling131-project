of hardworking and oftentimes impoverished people\nLooking for that boat across dark waters you\nChose to make your characters African American and the illustrations in this book where and why was that decision made\nWhen I first heard this story I heard it from a woman of Cherokee dissent a woman named Lorraine she had a pet crow and she was a kid on her dad's form\nAnd this crow used to steal everything and bury it all around the farm they'd find the little bits of string or or um cellophane or ... or so in my mind Lorraine was a hillbilly girl of Cherokee descent\nNow it took a long time

fifty sea levels rise up\nSomewhere up to three feet or potentially much higher there's a lot of uncertainty ah just because we're not exactly sure what will happen\nWith an article on how that will contribute to see all of our rise in the end of the century or the one\nBenefit of sea level rise being a relatively slower responder as we have time to adapt and and think about what we can do to help mitigate the impacts from sea level rise a and also a lot of what the\nState of California has a suggested in a lot of local agencies and penny not using what's called a trigger approach and so once the lower rise hits a certain level it triggers to\nTake some agitation measure and so it's this approach that there that is planned in its laid out\nBut at the level does right people are reacting a in a way\nTo Julie okay so we were just kind of went through some kind of former news out what could we do to change things is there is there anything the top of mind for you ... or ... maybe some of those\nSo I I wrote down three things to think about what we can do um one that you hear a lot but I think is really important especially with elections coming up is make sure to vote a and a lot of adaptation and greenhouse gas reduction\nOr policies do happen at the local scale and so voting in local elections and understanding what's going on at the local level is really important even though climate change is a global issue that anything I Would add is\nAnd I think we don't always think about that but there's a lot there's a strong connection between the water and the energy use though the more water we use them more energy we use the more greenhouse gases often are produced and so thinking about what\nIs that your especially irrigation and outdoor irrigation in Southern California if you can plant plants to use that or you know ways to reduce your outdoor irrigation can actually have a big impact on the amount of energy we use in our region and another one that we often hear\nAbout is how we can use just drive less so what can we do to use public transportation to go to a village to walk somewhere or ride a bike um you know so as they become more prevalent that are using electric cars if if that's something that you were able to do so those are always that I think we\nCan hopefully at least one of those ... and think well I can do that um and we can all built so that I think that's one that we should really think about without collection bird\n... with the Scripps Institute and a contributor to California for the most recent climate assessment Julie

there any restrictions on the alcohol or drug\nKnow if we've seen in the community and it's causing a problem with the violation then yes it would get ran a we don't go in and do check\nOut this does not go over well with Christina Britain\nReally what I'm hearing from this is that our tax dollars ultimately are going for supporting that if\nAnd that they're using drugs on their own little thing that's their business we don't see it if you know about it you try to help them but don't force them to help get help so they can and you just sit there and\nHousing they lived there for the rest of her life and use drugs in their privacy\nThat anyway\nDanielle from Jim Murray tries to explain that rock would innocence is just like any other apartment building you can't just barge into someone's unit and you can't kick someone out for suspected drug use\nPlus the idea behind this type of supportive housing is to get people off the streets first and then help them address their addiction or
