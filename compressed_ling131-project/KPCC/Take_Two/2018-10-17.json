Inskeep actor Jonah Hill grew up in the age of irony for many young people in the nineties it was cool\nNot to care about anything those who did were mocked one definition of nerd is just somebody who's really under something in the world of a new movie directed by Jonah Hill caring can mean you're not manly Rachel Martin has the story of a film about which hill cares a lot\nJonah Hill didn't want his first directing project to be just anything you wanted a story that matter to him personally mid nineties isn't a story about his life per se but it is about the universal longing of a teenage kid who just wants to fit in\n[noise]\nFigure pretty cool new [laughter]\nGo just a little [noise]\nIt's about a group of friends growing up in LA yes in the nineties and skateboarding is at the center of their universe Jonah Hill was determined to treat it with that kind of reference\nSkateboarding has always shown is like ... and like you know\nAnd it's offensive into skateboarding is really sensitive even when they heard oh it was a kid from Superbad going to make a skateboarding movie you know like some down that was the reaction oh yeah skateboarding is the most protective insular community which is why it's so difficult to make a film involving its butchered you know it's misunderstood imagine if there was like ten movies about NPR hosts\nAnd none of them have economic us right [laughter]\nThat's my next off Iraq but none of them had ever set foot in a recording was interviewed anybody you know so it's like any\nReally proud subculture so that's the backdrop at the center of the story is a Thirteen year old named Stevie things are bad for him at home his brother beats him up he is lonely and looking for some kind of connection\nStevie sees this group of kids hanging out in front of a skate shop and instantly he feels close to their tribe it's the kind of closeness you can see from ten thousand miles away\nIt's sort of a idiosyncratic perverse closeness haired with a lot of toxic masculinity and\nOn the surface cruelty but such a deep connection and family situation did you have that did you have that group of skateboarding friends I did I've had it in many various ways whether it was skateboarding film\nBut I definitely felt like an outsider I definitely felt like I didn't belong and\nThere's a certain person that skateboarding draws ... you know skateboarding now is such a it's gonna be the only big sport for God's so mainstream but when I started the boarding it was cool and society really look down on you as a nuisance\nOne of the things I loved about it was the nonjudgmental missed in certain ways escape orders and I think that\nCreated a lens that I saw life through whether it was sense of humor musical taste cinema taste it really wasn't ethic anesthetic for me that I carry with me to this day\nThere was something about maybe it's just me but it was the Potter of how the guys talk to each other and maybe that's universal like this is how adolescent boys are with each other they are stupid\n[noise]\nYeah and the only thing that's ever even come close it's been such a magical experience showing this film because it is my heart it is my heart and my soul\nAnd the point zero one percent were someone views the toxic masculinity or the homophobia as me thinking that's funny right has been heartbreaking because\nIt was done so intentionally to hold a mirror up to how people in this generation grew up in the changes we're having to make in the wrong lessons we've learned to me they speak so aggressively about women and gay people that it's it's\nThat is how it was and I felt it would be way more disrespectful to change history than to show it just as it was and let the audience see how ugly feels\nOur pop culture critic here at NPR Linda Holmes said this about the film quote it felt like a salute to how toxic masculinity makes boys feel included which is true she writes but not sweet as he'll seems to find it how do you respond to that\nI just disagree I found that it was connective tissue which is unfortunate I still think these people were there for each other even though they had a lot of behavior I don't think is cool the point of the movies that nothing's black or white I'm not a moral list I'm not here to like\nTell an audience how they should feel I think the way they speak about women and gay people is really messed up way to go about that\nAnd then at the end of the film they still are there for one another so I don't think anyone is purely good are purely bad I Hope to create complex characters that constantly are challenging what you think of them\nCan I ask you about the casting because they're not a lot of names that people would perhaps recognize I mean the acting is pretty phenomenal especially the star the film and the guys who play the people in his boarding tribe [laughter] oh\nThat's really nice I mean the singular most moving experience in my life was casting first time are not actors\nAnd they became these people and became actors in art is one of the kids all in the woods along curly hair who's very like light and fun and funny at lunch I was you know we all the kids were joke around talk trash and stuff and I thought he looked really offensive and that was abnormal\nAnd you feel kind of big brother leader protective over them so I was concerned and then I looked down and he had his like rumbled up script under the table and he was rehearsing his lines during lunch you know and as a kid who had never thought about acting before\nWhich is so funny right because the guys the characters are playing are struggling to be perceived like they don't care about anything it's not cool to care\nIn the nineties especially it was the lame is thing ever to say that you cared or tried at least in the culture I I grew up in and what I Love about spending time with these kids now is that they are motivated and these kids give such naturalistic performances\nI I'm just so proud of them it's very moving\nYou got the directing but now\nYou know my whole dream my whole life was to be a writer director I fell into this Fifteen your acting career where I got to learn from a lot of my heroes and it's something I wanted to do and would have done sooner [noise] it's just that\nYou only get one chance to make your first film and I really wanted to wait till it was something that really meant something to me I Love this film I stand by it and I hope to just keep making things that I care about that would be a great life I should be so lucky\nThe film is called mid nineties Jonah Hill is\nThinks much for talking yeah it was a pleasure thanks for having\nMerger\nCared enough to to them to MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm

all seem to stem from problems with the DMV ... aging technology to dig deep into why this happened and what's being done to fix this we have ruled Laurel Rosen hall from Cal matters welcome\nHappened to be here no it's an old joke for the NBA is slow and inefficient but it's an apt description for what's going on with the computer system and the DMV has blamed software issues for the voter registration problems remind us what you'd has said about sort of that\nIn may they reported that there were certain Seventy seven thousand voter registrations that got messed up they said that wasn't software problem in September they acknowledge twenty three thousand registrations that got messed up that they said was um\nBasically human error DMV workers where certain toddling between computer when windows and then early last\nWeek they acknowledge another Fifteen hundred errors basically they said these were sort of cases where people had input in data and information and then gone to the window to correct it and the DMV worker corrected it but somehow the corrected information never got saved in the computer\nSystem the original mistaken information was saved instead\nNo rural given what we know about the weakness of the DMV system helper appeared were there to roll out such a massive\nVoter registration program\nThe big revelation for me came when talking to some advocates who had sued the state a few years ago for not complying with the um federal law on voter registration and this law this program is now rolling out with all these problems with the response that lawsuit\nAnd they said that when they just found out is that when the state launched this system in April they didn't actually have one integrated computer system\nThat could do everything you know could do the driver's license transaction and the voter registration all at the same time with the horse is envisioned by this program and instead that they sort of launched with a bunch of separate systems that required a DMV worker to kind of make critical connections\nConsidering all the snake got the ball rolling on all the sudden twenty Fifteen how many resources a where the DMV given to make all of this happened or didn't even ask for more resources on this\nProgram was approved a bill that passed in two thousand Fifteen\nAnd the legislature alec heated you know money in order for
