I Am I'm also it's a short if it's a short distance it's faster than driving\nYou know get into my car trying to find parking dealing with other costs that actually takes away more time than you think\nSo bikes can also just be more nimble in rush hour\nI also went to college at like magazines best bike city number eight uh Madison, Wisconsin so the culture is very familiar to me\nNow were you in the magazine say about to LA or what you guys are your own opinions how do you back it up though\nYou had totally these are my own opinion people will totally disagree with me I bet you my handle is at least have the cats and your ... weeks there\nBut here's one example from downtown I remember a last February we toured springs street they were going to redo it yeah I'm so they actually just finished it last month a short stories that they\nUm re configured the street lanes so it'd be friendlier to bikes and the idea that sounds good the city's invest in infrastructure it solve some problems but I think it's actually introduced new new ones like what okay you have to imagine springs street it's a one way street\nThe bike lane was originally on the right side they shifted it over to the left side of the weight looking out so imagine you're in traffic on from left right it's curb bike lane roads parked cars and then traffic\nThe way the the reasoning for this is that it's supposed to insulate bikes away from that moving traffic so you know they are less likely to get hit this is phase one so that by claim it's actually about as wide as a car lane and recording myself earlier this week on the way home and well what you're about to hear something that I've actually seen every day since this thing debuted\nAnd here comes another hard that just arriving directly into the bike lane price what is\nWhat are you doing [noise]\nThat's not going to see it happening every single day ... owns arriving in that lane now in fairness to the car is actually there's not enough science that it is a bike lane nothing or not there's nothing there that says they can't park directly against the ... they were able to before the bike lanes aren't even grain to differentiate itself\nWhich by the way that's actually a result of a deal between the city in Hollywood we said the Greenland mess with me when they're\nIn downtown so there's so many of actually in the number of lanes that can be painted green so drivers can see them\nOr so it's been street actually hasn't had like ... for years and you also have an issue with a crossing okay so this is actually like maybe it would make sense to the city does not make sense to me how he said the bike lane was on the right side but it's now in the ... yeah okay\nThat's actually true for the entire length that's only for between a third and night streets\nAnd so I really hate the solution so I'm biking biking hiking on springs street I'm a second street where I'm On the right side once I hit third street I'm actually supposed to cross the intersection diagonally to the left to get to the left\nAnd uh there was a special light install to trigger adjusts for bike so you know while cars aren't supposed to have the rat cars had the rat I Am the only one that gets the green but I ride defensively so don't trust hearts actually follow the rules and it was proven right when this happened\nHave the great I have the grain right I'm going to go\nThere some guy who is trying to say OK some guy in a way vans and try to run the red when bicyclists we're supposed to have the great like me I Can't believe that if I think I I Love the recording that I thought I thought I wanted to happen just for the recording but not really\nI Know [laughter] I didn't wanna veggie and so and then you have to switch diagonally again at night straight wow\nThat's amazing that OK outside of downtown LA though outside a lot of ... a lot of people is it any better than\nUh I definitely want to hear from Cape you see the listeners about this because obviously haven't traveled every mile but here to things that don't make a biking in LA pleasant first signage I had no idea where to go sometimes because the signs aren't big enough\nOr there aren't enough road science to tell me which direction this bike path continues on to having more way find or is it important I mean that's what I think actually the downtown interchange is a mess for car sometime we talked about the you know I just don't tell you where you're supposed to go until the last ... sailors shifting right away\nOr what about what about the ... better roads I mean that's a problem for all of the city as we often hear from our infrastructure reporter Sharon mcnairy however to get a sense to give people a sense of what it's like for bicyclists I hear something from my ride\nI make my wire bike that his thinking here every time the road is not good it can hear that they\nYeah well\nThat's every time I hit a bond it's actually not that bad compared to other places I was between ... downtown it was like I was mountain biking so rough it's an editorial problem city of LA paid out more than Nineteen million dollars just like looking families last year because of injuries and deaths on local streets\nAnything though really quick you can set it's encouraging about five you know like\nIt is really tough I don't want to play any punches because if you're new to cycling it's rough but if you're going to do it I think there are some areas that are better like Long Beach in Redondo Beach personally I think they're better maybe people will disagree but I think there's a little bit more better infrastructure out there but please I really sweet me if you have a different take or if you had more opinions on this on at", "year":
