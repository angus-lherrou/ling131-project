I was ...\nYears you know going to hear that you feel bad and she feels\nThat way because of this little really that's not right and that's why I was a long drawn out for a while if I recall right why he's seventh year\nI mean this is fascinating she is being interrogated by a police officer who's telling him it's good to hear that you feel bad what does that tell you\nWell I mean what really they should do it how good Larry Nassar is at manipulating other people and and how overwhelming on an individual\nLevel that can feel you know what is more likely in this situation that one young woman as far as this detective is aware as miss understood a valid medical technique\nOr you know this Olympic doctor who's been doing this for so long and who's so many people love and he's the best at this that he abused one girl I mean it's just hard on a human level to not get sucked into this kind of manipulation\nThis is Lindsey he does this over and over I mean we've given you one example Noel but he does this in a multitude of ways of this two and a half hour long interview and he also layers and\nI teach this I lecture on this any sort of doubt you might have had about his technique than his legitimacy he's really doing everything he can to build that up this is Kate again\nHe gets cleared to go back to work after that they put him back into the clinic and we know that at least Seventy women and girls say that they were abused after that twenty fourteen case and and when he returned to treating patients\nSeventy yeah eventually another interrogation and this interrogation leads to his arrest I Know you have some tape of ... tell me about it as well\nSo this is an interrogation from twenty sixteen or another accuser has come forward the same her name is Rachel ... also comes forward publicly in a a newspaper article in the Indianapolis Star\nAnd she also decides to call police about a case of abuse that had happened to her Fifteen Years prior and this call goes to a different detective at MSU police it's detective injury among offered and she definitely takes a different approach\nOr she is working ... can you just don't\nGo up in your car or would you ... if I'm not sure he was pushing off\nHer look I I'm again this was something that you're just trying to me is very different than how she describes in her ...\nWhat is the important difference in this interrogation why does this interrogation lead to interact with the other one did not\nI mean to put it probably to simply does that give them an front comes in believing Rachel she also has the benefit of knowing that this is the second complaint\nAnd Rachel has brought a lot of evidence with her that this abuse happened journal entries medical records and so Andrea believes Rachel and she's able to go into this interview and put the pressure on Nassau\nIt's not about well why did it take so long for this woman to come forward or maybe she was confused it's very much Nasser needs to be able to answer very simple questions and you start to hear that he can't he just starts to fall apart\nThere was a arousal is is is very much because of over ... ... your ... your own is\nActually ... you know you're just saying that you know you you you um [noise]\nAnd when we interviewed this detective Andrea month Hurd when she talks about looking back at this interview is that she herself was kind of an sure why NASA our we have so much trouble answering such a simple questions like\nWhy would you have interaction during a medical appointment\nI was thinking should ask questions a different way from the opportunity to answer and then I thought that was his answer he doesn't have one he doesn't have an explanation\nHe doesn't have an explanation so you guys in you're digging you learned that it does make a big difference if if police if parents start by believing the victim worth the very least sharing the victim out\nYeah well I mean fundamentally ... this is how guys like this operate as they know that you don't want to believe that somebody you love and trust and who seems like just as great guy\nCould be hurting somebody as humans were not good at thinking that can happen to the people that we work with or who are family\nBut the reality is that guys like ... don't operate in a vacuum it it takes a lot of people to be manipulated and to fail these women and girls for so long\nKate Wells and Lindsey\nSmith are hosts of the new podcast believed from Michigan Radio and NPR thank you both so much\nThanks Noelle Noelle thanks for having us\nYou're listening

bombs addressed a prominent Trump's critics across the country NPR's Ryan Lucas has more\nThis so I mean I think the best we could hope for in terms of how this will change the narrative between now and election day is maybe you know a a a message of inclusion and and sort of you know bringing more civility tour a politics and\nTried to calm some of the rhetoric is we had until election day but I think that's pretty unlikely frankly\nWe're talking state of affairs with the corps we're visiting professor of government at Claremont McKenna College also ... political reporter at kick you in ... and just to be clear reports of the name of the suspects are just coming out so we're waiting on still a full confirmation will know more as those details come out\nOf there was moving on several Republican are represented in the state or feeling the pressure ahead of them in terms of what books on two of them starting with a dino Rohrabacher\nHe's been taking a very interesting approach to re election with a brand new ad or what's the ad and how is it a break for maybe what we've seen from him in the past\nInteresting might be a charitable description um so he has put out a campaign ad where I think at no point as he mentioned being a Republican and he's standing next to his teenage daughter who fought leukemia as a young child and talks about his support for covering preexisting conditions\nYou know critics have rocker and other uh Republicans I think we've seen Mimi Walters do the same thing in her Irvine distract\n... feel like this is pretty rich considering these are people that voted not just in twenty Seventeen to try to repeal the Affordable CARE Act but probably more than a dozen times in prior years when President Obama was still there to veto those were appeals\nUm and so you know I think it speaks to the challenge that these especially Orange County Republicans are facing reelection um you know there's always been a a guy that sort of walk to the beat of his own from or libertarian I'm\nVery pro Russia has actually partnered with Democrats around marijuana I'm sort of lifting some marijuana restrictions\nBut he seems to as you said sort of be in trouble in this race against I'm hardly rooted who I think is running as smart campaign for that pretty affluent coastal district and read it as a former Republican so it's just\nYou know it's the end of the campaign things have gotten a weird day\nIs it weird though that a Republican would be standing up for preexisting conditions considering that is one of the big headline from the Affordable CARE Act\nI mean yeah I I think they're trying to have their cake and eat it too right this is like the this is the same party that has repeatedly tried to undermine the law\nYou know you could argue the centerpiece of which were these protections for people who had preexisting conditions and the fact that now\nYou know he's trying to disassociate himself I think more broadly with the Republican Party or at least trying to you know they don't look over there I don't think about that think about who you know um it it's it's kind of crazy and and I think it speaks to one thing that we've seen this year which is that\nThe plan that Republicans wanted to run on which was the tax cuts is not resonating with voters and they have completely abandoned not messaging\n... what's the value thing for someone like war bunker to blur the line a bit\n[noise] well it's the hope that he can sort of wiggle out from\nHas long history as a Republican in this district that's shifting into his district voted for Hillary Clinton it's moderately Republican at this point it votes about four percent head for Republicans in general but\nThis is very much a toss up seat now I'm Nate Silver is giving him a one in three chance although some polling recent polling a couple of days go shows him up a couple of points so he's trying to do everything you can to sort of see the middle in this race I mean even though he voted repeatedly to report to repeal Obamacare\nIs now saying or the campaign saying that those actual larger symbolic and they were just trying to highlight problems and I I think that's going to be a hard sell going into this the question I think the bigger question here is how much of this was about ... and how much of this was a referendum on Donald Trump because I think that's a theme throughout the midterms particularly for Republicans in the suburban districts suburban women\nIn particular are very unhappy with Donald Trump and I think\nYou know ... trying to recognize that and reach out again to the middle but you know as Donald Trump you know\nContinues and it gets louder as we had to election day I think it's going to be harder and harder for a war bacher and many others and these kinds of districts to say oh no no no I don't support him I don't I'm not really a Republican I'm kind of a kind of do my own thing over here\nOr no one more Republican congressman Justin and we spoke to him back in may when he tried to force an immigration vote in the house that didn't work out but back then we wondered are we so if the fact that he tried would matter much to his district so Latino voters or do you think that people remember that\nThe I think that again I'm to the next plane about robot current Trump like that's the challenge I think that\nHas been a more moderate Republican he's in a district where Democrats do have an advantage but have repeatedly especially the Latino population really not shown up in their numbers and exercise their power\nUm and so I think that like while you know there are areas where he has been um you know very friendly to the Latino community that the larger narrative that a lot of people understand especially if they don't follow politics super closely and you see this in some of the coverage of that race\nIs that they tie Republican Congress with Donald Trump and if you're a Latino and you feel like the president's policies have been racist or you're angry about what's happening at the border\nYou're probably not going to give them the benefit of the Dow unless you kind of had a long standing relationship or understanding of him um you know but again as everywhere the real question for Democrats is going to be turnout\nWas that because if I were Jeff than if I were in his political shoes I Would try to remind people say remember what I tried to do back then remember how I tried to fight\n[noise] true but I mean this is kind of Mission Impossible I mean ... basically trying to go counter to I think the message that made Donald Trump made him successful in the primaries for the presidential election\nA most young people in most counties in the state or unregistered so we still have to close that gap we want to build more partnerships with school just cross state and we want to be able to do these similar events we've done which county registered here in Norwalk so for us there's definitely a lot of sounds like you're grinding all\nOh we're we're going trying and and partly but most importantly like well we've learned is if we really want to make changes where young people we can't just do voter by voter there has to be an institutional element to it so that's why for us building relationships and partnership which is just like el USC we could do without them\nThose we

be announced but the proposal is raising legal issues for more we have ... Baker on the line he's a professor who says\nTwice as and human rights law at Pepperdine University Jeff welcome good morning alright an executive order to close the border what would actually do\nYou know it's hard to know the president is ah not all the time predictable in constant in this um the the proposal as as the news is reported is that he could potentially tried to stop all immigration proceedings\nOr to receive any migrants across the southern border and to try to stop people from applying for asylum or there have been other suggestions that he would potentially deployed the military and somehow seal the southern border which is practically impossible but probably his law his power extends to immigration enforcement\nOkay 'cause I was wondering I Know that there's a lot of people that work in Baja that go over the border to work in San Diego I'm I was wondering if that apply to them to\nCertainly what we don't know what it would apply to until it comes out a until the president decides to move on it and uh the issue that you raise is going to be one that's coming across the border\nWith people who have who travel who have business who have contracts and companies that depend on them the movement of commerce so probably what the president could do with an emergency orders only limited to\nA receiving a immigrants without documentation or or new immigrants or new applicants for asylum\nOkay now historically has the U.S ever shut down its border before\nOr not to my knowledge not at all and then of course it's it's practically and literally impossible to seal the border so so the the only way that you could possibly do that is to close borders stations\nAnd theoretically de ... in the military or border patrol but um it's practically impossible and a historically has never happened to my knowledge\nIn what situations though does the president at least in theory at least in theory have the authority to close the U.S Mexico border well\nAs it relates to immigration the president does have a significant executive authority that he can use a largely it has discretion but to actually seal the border and especially if that were to and including the military would require declaring some kind of national emergency national security\nA development and to deploy the military within the United states uh for for most purposes requires congressional approval to so he has limited authority to literally seal the border to try to um but he does have pretty expensive uh authority or around immigration matters um at least I'm", "show_name": "Take Two", "year": "2018", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "26"}
