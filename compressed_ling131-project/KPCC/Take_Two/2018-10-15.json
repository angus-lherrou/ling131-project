{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Every Monday through Thursday we have all the latest developments analysis and updates on the racist America on the line national conversation about how [noise]\nMonday through Thursday at seven PM in eighty nine twenty three ...\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin Neil Armstrong was meticulous calculated\nIn the Apollo eleven mission where everything could go wrong Armstrong's thought of every contingency plan but the one thing he didn't prepare for was sitting at the kitchen table to tell his boys he might not make it home\nTo me like I said when you mean\n[noise]\nWhen we're not sure we're going to get on to them a\nLot of things have to go right before that happens coming that we as a real confidence in the mission and are\nWe have every intention of coming back that you might not\nLying golfing plays the ... Neil Armstrong and the new film first man it's directed by Damien ... out they also did la la land and whiplash\nAnd in the first man ... brings new whereas right inside the loud claustrophobic spacecraft that carried accrued to them or seemingly impossible journey that purged on reckless\nI think it was one thing that struck me the most when I saw some of these aircrafts in space capsules in person was how\nSmall and rickety they looked they looked like a sardine cans you know and and um the technology is so crude looking and so analog I'm so there's a beauty in that and there's also something terrified and that and I think it actually uh by by honing in on that uh we really wanted to\nHopefully remind the audience is a you know that this was in the sort of gilded easy sleek high tech space travel that um they might have been sold to the public this was a really a\nHard and dangerous a labor insanely risky yeah I mean you know they said we're going to go to the moon before they had the technology to do it and they just had faith that they would catch up in time\nAnd the film makes you realize how little the public actually knows about Neil Armstrong the man and this particular law that you learn about early in the film his infant daughter died of cancer years before he ever went to the man\nI mean it it's the unfathomable tragedy uh but but but in some ways what's even more striking about it is how many people that Neal worked with didn't even know he had ever had a daughter I mean that's how close to the best he\nHe kept that event he and Janet were fiercely private and um I think in many ways the movie especially as we did more and more research the movie kind of shifted in in my mind and I think in ... and all of our minds from\nFrom a you know sort of mission movie about the race to the moon to a movie about grief and and coping and Neal's case a man who suffered such a profound loss that\nIn some ways you understand that his thoughts wind up just go into space go into the broader universe and and uh and maybe searching for answers that he just can't find here on earth\nShe Neil Armstrong in their homes for trade as a man pretty typical of his generation in his ability Kim ... mental life his emotions plus that truth him\nI I think it was and and um we had to really rely on on people who knew him behind those closed doors people who knew the non public Neal because the public Neal yeah it was pretty reticent I'm pretty uh even seemed reclusive um of course once you get to the private Neal\nUh he was a actually a immensely complicated you know he was capable of\nGoofing off you had a really sly sense of humor to dry wit he was also capable of a of a real you know almost sort of a scary intensity when it came to the passion with which he attacked his work and his passion for aviation I think we wanted to try to get at that vulnerability that human qualities so that you you know because\nI think he's become and the collective imagination such a poker face to almost marble statues hero but I'm\nThe people like his kids he was just that you know and to people in the neighborhood he was you know he's the guy down the street\nSays you know the movie has gotten some criticism from some on the conservative side of the political spectrum who has taken issue with the fact that the film doesn't show Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin planting the American flag on them in\nSo let me ask you about that was that an intentional or mission\nUh well you know we we don't let the American flag on the moon you see it clearly in several shots and I think this conversation about the sort of a mission has been happening or exclusively among people who haven't seen the film [laughter]\nSo I'm just really excited that the movie is opening and and that people can start seeing it and see for themselves what um the tribute I guess that we we try to to pay in the movie to what was undeniably an American enterprise and a a group of uh just American heroes I'm\nThe one other thing I'll say though is is that it's it was really important to us to try also to wherever possible focus on the untold story and and things that people didn't see and didn't know and take a very personal subjective angle on these sort of big historical events\nAre in between the things that you read about in the history books and you were actually seen the sort of stuff uh that again hopefully helps tell the human story and help show that you know these were human beings and not a\nMythological figures these were a\nA ordinary people doing the heap as\nWe've been talking I became a hero and an icon but you've stopped the story before we see that happening in the chronology why did you make that choice to to end the phone where it ends with him coming back but we don't see him um urge to like the throngs of cheering crowds [noise]\nWell it's a um we we know about the sort of a\nTickertape parades and whatnot um I was really surprised to learn about this time in quarantine that the astronaut spent right after coming back from from the moon and to get to actually visited that quarantine and see how small and on glamorous bedrooms word that they stayed in and and uh you know those government buildings and\nYou come back from the moon and suddenly you're thrust right into the\nThe epitome of the mundane um and I just found that fascinating and it was this tremendous moment of hope that the entire world was given by the moon landing\nBut also just a reminder of the loss that it took to get there\nUh it didn't actually feel appropriate maybe is the word to end the movie with just nothing but cheering crowds and and people getting their pictures taken it felt that there had to be some acknowledgement in a way of um just the men's sacrifice and and a law that will never go away\nBut without which you know we wouldn't have had this tremendous game that the whole world got to benefit from\nAnd he never went up into space again\nNo he didn't um yeah I mean in some ways you know it's ... ... Ryan had an interesting way of of referring to when we were kind of trying to figure out how to frame certain scenes in the movie and in the shooting of them\nHe would talk about how you know to him this wasn't a movie about a guy landing on the moon it was a movie about a guy landing on earth um and it's that journey to actually truly come home in every sense of that word and to land on the ground and to and to be a one with your family it's a much longer journey in a way and the journey to them and\nThe film is called first man we've been speaking to that director Damien says al Damian thank you so much thank you so much for having me [noise]\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep\nComing up next it take to with the Martinez in a conversation with one of the candidates who went to lead the California public school system and it can on air talk with Larry mantle analyst tell you what's happening with the stock market and what it means for the economy stock indices right now are mixed to lower\nAt eleven o'clock you'll delve into the mystery and significance of the downtown LA public library fire Thirty years later\nAnd at noon on fresh air Terry Gross talks with the Robinson the co host of the pod cast to dope queens about her new book everything's trash but it's OK\nOkay BCC supporters include good night natural natural inorganic mattresses and Betty flush comfort in pressure point released without chemicals phones or synthetic near the\nWell the third and Marcel learn more at good night natural dot com [noise]\nThis is eighty nine forty three K PCC Pasadena Los Angeles for community service of Pasadena city called World War two hundred programs offer students the ability to dream come do learn more Pasadena dot edu [noise]\n... to me were seen as a local stalemate could be on the verge of a tipping point so for mediation has not worked between LA us the teachers' union try to hammer out a labor deal\nIf thirty thousand teachers go on strike what happens the districts half a million students plus last week we heard from Marshall talked today Tony Thurman on why he wants your vote for California superintendent of public instruction head on take to stay with us [laughter]\nIf you need to get rid of an old car O'Bannon motorcycle an RV a yacht a pickup truck or what have you Kais BCC would love to take it all you have to do is contact us will come over and pick it up whether it runs or not and deal with the paperwork proceeds from the sale help keep independent news on the air\nPlus you get a tax deduction go to Kay BCC dot org slash car [noise]\n\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Lakshmi saying the president and first lady you're on the ground and Florida's panhandle they just arrived to see firsthand the destruction hurricane Michael inflicted on Floridians last week NPR's Quil Lawrence reports on the difficult recovery confronting those directly affected\nRegulations for magnet programs but it's possible that the biggest issue here is actually that the two sides mistrust of each other has been dominating this process and that's just judging from the rhetoric I mean the district right after mediation was over came out with a formal complaint against United teachers Los Angeles\nSaying you guys shut up to the first day of mediation saying the whole process was pointless and so they filed a formal complaint saying that the union was negotiating in bad faith\nAnd the other hand the union turned around and it was like you guys are the one who said we don't think that mediation is is going to result in a deal that something that's superintendent Austin Buettner said in public on multiple occasions that he didn't think that mediation would make a difference so\nI definitely a lot of bad blood in addition to whatever differences on issues that we see\nAre sort of probably wipe mediation didn't work when it comes to labor negotiations both sides are pointing fingers they're not putting pen to paper\nYeah you know well I mean but I I think this is important to note as well like part of that this is part of the brinksmanship for both sides both sides are trying to\nPlay up fears of a strike and use that to their advantage to leverage better term so I mean I ... I keep saying like you know trying to correct my home thinking about this because it's it's like it does look\nReally bad just judging from the public statements\nBut both sides I think are looking at the the sort of fear of a strike as as the biggest leverage that they have to make a deal that they want if this fact finding doesn't work because it seems like a last ditch effort if it fails I mean a strike is right around the corner\nWell here's what happened to the fact finder issues this report that I mentioned they they offer their opinions about what you know they think that the contract should look like now that could be the blueprint of a deal or the two sides can just ignore it and move on\nUm it doesn't automatically mean after fact finding is over that the that the two sides co their separate ways they the two sides could go back\nTo mediation if they felt that that was a good next step it's possible for them to go to a binding arbitration where where you have a judge that I mean the fact finder is just sort of offering this\nA in a non binding way well let's put it before an actual judge and and have a judge decide um but there are the sort of nuclear options that become available after fact finding and that's why this is important I mean it is kind of last ditch because the district can just say that last best and final offer that we put on the table that's\nNow in fact that's now your contract and the union can respond to that by saying All right we're going to go on strike so\nWe it is a little bit last ditch ... though there are other options if fact finding doesn't results in the blueprint of a deal\nIt it it is pretty close to the end here but it's at a slippery slope fact finding areas where you kinda can't call yourself back out of it or is it just kind of I think people here in like oh great I Know I Know I I mean it's hard to sort of dispel the the fears that was talking to a a labor experts you sort of walk me through what the ... process is and he said\nYou know the mere fact that they had more than one mediation session is noteworthy\nUm and so you know I mentioned this formal complaint that the that district filed against the union for not really showing up to mediation believe in a bad way well but they they um they didn't show they showed up\nTo mediation at all so I mean which is which is a good sign according to this labor expert and and also I mean fact finding means there's still time for them to make a deal so I mean I'm trying to inject just a little bit of into this process because\nWith labor negotiations I've covered it teachers strike before everything looks bad until the very end and at the very end everything is all sunshine and smiles so it it's really not over until it's over ... recall if a strike happens worst case scenario for kids students the the probable outcomes that that buildings would remain open\nA but district officials say that it's very likely that attendance would go\nWay way down so a little bit of a TVD on what kind of programming would be available it probably would vary depending on your school um but certainly district officials expecting that that it had tendons would go way way down even if buildings were to remain open not staffed by teachers but by administrators and AIDS lots of parents with jobs that are relying now\nMade a contingency plans man is the education reporter ...\n[noise]\nTurning now to the November sixth midterms fall election season is part of the key piece of sea voter game plan we're looking at the top issues in so congressional districts\nWere hoping to help voters understand where the candidates stand so that they can make some smart decisions and today the PCs Austin cross takes you to district twenty five which covers northern LA county at a part of Ventura County the latest polls\nShow Republican incumbent Steve night almost neck and neck with democratic challenger Katie Hill and one is you could tip the scales

and a boon for the economy lifelong seamy valley resident de ... agrees\nAbsolutely this whole a crumb that eye ear Nancy Pelosi talk about but yet they're so eager to take it back\nBut when I talked to a thirty year Palmdale resident Andy guys at a debate last month between ... hill he wasn't convinced\nYou know because I Know we're all the tax benefits are going they're going to the wealthy they keep saying trickle down and we're down and nothing's trickled to us you\nCongressman night's vote helped push President Trump's tax plan out of the house he says it's improve the economy and the tax cuts meet a lot of people in the district\nWe've seen it benefits for the last six months and we keep getting better and better news about this [noise] so the people that\nHad the highest death rates in the city\nBut those very poor and vulnerable neighborhoods that had a robust social infrastructure wound up being even better protected than the most affluent places in the city and you don't think enough of this exist right now in the country\nHardly a we're so far behind the rest of the world when it comes to developing social infrastructure I have a spend time doing research and places like Singapore the Netherlands which have made massive investments in physical infrastructure systems that protect you from the storm but also\nPromote quality of of life all the time and and the Netherlands for instance they're public plazas\nThat are a amphitheaters parks sitting areas uh skating arenas and they are fun places to be and they help people connect a and B outdoors\nAlmost every day of the year and when the ... a big storm comes you put the walls up around them and they convert into water storage facilities in Singapore they do similar things but the the water storage facilities do something that California could use\nBased they track the water they store it diverted underground and the water can get treated and then re used so if you live in a place that's prone to draft\nCapturing water and managing it more intelligently is one of the most urgent challenges you can face it turns out\nYou can do that while building social infrastructure to preserve era climbed Burke is a new book is called palaces for the people have social infrastructure it helped by inequality polarization the decline of civic life\nOr you mentioned how you've seen this in other parts of the world and we don't have enough of it in your opinion here in the United states you you're right about how efforts to revitalize the LA river itself is seen as a social infrastructure project new explain\nIt certainly can be because the LA river revitalization projects can be a way to\nProvide more and better access for communities and the city\nThat currently have ecosystems that or to gray around them uh the currently don't have park lands and good access to\nThe healthiest and most pleasurable outdoor spaces so river revitalization is one of these incredible opportunities to change infrastructure in a way that's not only good for the water\nUp it's good for people in communities as well where else in the U. S. is or is this happening well\nOne of my favorite examples is Columbus ohio which doesn't get a lot of attention and the big national media but it turns out to have some incredible programs to support\nThe library infrastructure they've passed voter referenda to provide more taxpayer dollars for the library system so that the branch libraries can be updated\nA can have longer opening hours and that means more people will be able to use them you know one problem that cities across the country faced with the library is that it is now taking on so many different kinds of responsibilities because young people are using them in in droves older people go there for companionship\nAre immigrants people trying to learn English as a second language people with mental illnesses homeless people or people with opioid addiction they're all going to the library because it's a safe and welcoming environment\nAnd yet the physical plant of the library is just out matched and it's incumbent upon cities now to update these systems\nThey're they're not luxuries there not obsolete there are places that are doing so much vital social work and if we don't repair them if we don't invest in them they won't work the way that they could\nHow do we pay for all this though is considering you know as I mentioned with all the issues that have us thinking about climate change in an all the dangers are going to bring up to this and all the money we're spending on this how are we going to pay for that as well for social infrastructure well we\nAre inevitably going to spend tens of billions and eventually hundreds of billions of dollars on rebuilding infrastructure because frankly\nThe infrastructure systems that we rely on in this country just to be part of the modern world are willfully out of date in my view if we understand what social infrastructure is we generate a new menu of possibilities that allows us to build the the hard systems we need to\nBe part of the ... century world while also a improving longevity health are dealing with all kinds of social problems here at the same time\nThat's sociologist Glen in ... new book is called palaces for the people have

selecting a new California superintendent of public instruction is the highest office overseeing public education in the state watching more than a thousand school districts and making sure the department of education follows California's laws\nThere are two candidates left in last week we heard from Marshall taught former president of green dot charter schools today we hear from Tony Thurmond he's an educator and a legislature representing the fifteenth assembly district in the bay area and we spoke recently he talked about what he sees as the biggest challenge facing California schools\nWell you know certainly funding if you look at what California spends per pupil\nCalifornia fall somewhere a around forty six in the nation and per pupil spending then that's been that way for many many decades and so we need to correct that and spend more on our kids is not to say that it's just about money\nBut when you look at the places where we need more support like special education and closing the achievement gap including a teacher shortage resources matter what action can the superintendent take to address that specific issue you know the superintendent has to work closely with the governor and the legislature to\nReally generate more revenue for the state you know the superintendent it's it's a the position is different it's part educator\nA it is part public official and politician you got to know how to move things in a system\nTo get it to the hundreds of school districts in our state\nThe campaign for the office of superintendent as often characterize as a fight between charters against unions and clearly you and your opponent don't agree on everything but a YouTube aren't that radically different when it comes to your views on charter school so
