immigration in tweets and public comments President Trump has claimed that the caravan of Central American migrants making their way north through Mexico poses a security threat to the United states\nThat Trump has requested a new round of US military troops be moved to the border as a precautionary measure we've seen this play out before so we thought we'd bring in key piece refuse military and veterans' reporter Libby think's going to find out what's happening this time around a low Libby\nHi a parts of how many troops are we talking about here and what will they be doing\nWell we've been hearing about this troop deployment for a few days now in a lot of numbers had been flying around but the Pentagon held a joint press conference with the department of homeland security yesterday and we got some basic facts confirmed\nThe mission is called operation faithful patriots fifty two hundred active duty service members will deployed to the border by the end of this week eight hundred soldiers are actually already on their way to southern Texas\nAlong with a few see one thirties and a lot of equipment there will be members of the Army Corps of engineers in this group some cop combat engineering battalions medical teams\nMilitary police they're all supposed to help hard in the southern border and there'll be bringing a lot of Jersey barriers and concertina wire\nA razor wire uh to do that along with mobile housing units and strategic capabilities for example there are three helicopter companies with high tech surveillance equipment that will be part of this uh the Pentagon says that they can spot groups of migrants and deploy border patrol agents to intercept them without surveillance equipment\nAnd his deployment is starting in Texas than Arizona and finally California\nOr will be in California okay so Trump has talked about this care of him as a threat to well the military actually be arresting immigrants we\nDon't believe so there is an Eighteen Seventy eight law on the books called posse coma taught us and that prevents the U.S military from engaging in law enforcement activities with in the states or general parents have shown as the commander of us northern command said yesterday that the new deployment would comply with poppy come and taught us\nBut this will a heavily beef up department of homeland security and customs and border protection capabilities now\nThis is not the first a military response of the border we saw this back in April with the last migrant caravan with the national guard right\nYes and that mission it's called operation guardian support is still in place\nSince April of this year there have been about Twenty one hundred National Guard troops from Texas Arizona New Mexico and California helping out border patrol agents along the southwest border but there are key differences with this new deployments\nFirst for sheer numbers this is a significant ramp up of military forces at the border it more than triple the number of us troops there the Washington Post said that this would be the largest US military border presents for at least one hundred years since the Mexican revolution and you're like oh yeah and\nSince these additional fifty two hundred service members are active duty they're under the command of the secretary of defense and ultimately the president not states' governors like the national guard is so Governor Brown is in charge of this deployment in California as he was for the last round\nOf white matter well back in April a after several days of negotiating with the White House Governor Brown authorized up to four hundred California National Guard troops to head to the border you probably remember that wrangling\nBut that order came with a strict limitation the cow guard's mission does not include enforcing immigration laws those troops are supposed to combat criminal activity connected to gangs drugs and human trafficking and in September brown just re ups that order for another six months\nBut it's not clear if that firewall that brown intends is holding up\nVoice of San Diego report in August that they had a pain to court documents that show ... guard members had located some groups of migrants and alerted border patrol to their location and CBP winning arrested those migrants which it seems like could be violating the limited scope of Brown's order\nNow about a caravan though to a group is still a ways away from the U.S border what can you tell us about the status of those people\nYeah it's about nine hundred miles away the caravan has dwindled to about thirty five hundred people still mostly moving on foot through Mexico\nCritics of the president said that this move to send troops at this time in our election cycle it's not but it's ... it's a move that will motivate Trump's base ahead of a pivotal mid term election which is just a week away as you may know\nA but customs and border protection say no way this is about enforcing US laws and national security\nOur number ... before we let you go and ask you about what happened last night to hear right where we are in Pasadena you were here at work when the building was evacuated because of a special device report at a nearby the whole block was clear it as a precaution and uh we're obviously back you're in this building here in Pasadena keep you see this morning but can you tell us briefly ... ended up last night\nIt was a little stressful last night a I was working late in the newsroom when we got the call to evacuate as opposed to Nick Roman to
