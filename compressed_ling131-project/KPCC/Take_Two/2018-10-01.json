physically hurt at one point oh you have ... times young people throwing heavy objects that your bottles or a show yeah oh\nYeah definitely they lived in Japan though\nYes they did and it was mostly girls to\nWomen were looked at as they are I guess around the world is sort of second class citizens and um so the girls were responding to what they perceived\nAs our power I suppose thousands of girls rock in our car and stuff it was um\nQuite a juxtaposition from which there is a shame\n[noise]\nRoughly a year later you decided that the band had just gone in a different\nDirection and you had to leave what was that decision like\nSo horrible it felt like defeat\nAnd um\nWas offer stupid reasons why I thought and you know it was really it was ... wrenching for me because you the runways

stay in a free trade pact with the United states and Mexico President Trump is delivering details from the White House Rose Garden\nBut of course this is coming the video releases coming at the same time the investigations um will allow be allowed to be released and I'm One of the issues that they had with with opening those records is that\nYou know basically they're needed there didn't need to be actions because the the process was fair and was conducted with integrity the d._a. comes in and reviews these investigations to see if a climate occurred\nSo it was their point of view that due process was working here that they're there didn't need to be that exposure and the more exposure could actually um harm um law enforcement or the officers themselves by giving out too much information to the\nPublic in one more thing because in addition to what you do hear a key piece as you as an investigative reporter you're also the host repeat that's her pod cast looking into a police shooting a big part of that story was the difficulty and accessing a police officer record so how to use new laws change how are you able to report on thing\nI Know a there is really never been a state law that is has that impacted my life so directly um [noise]\nI mean just full transparency you know I have requested records that are like this over the years and repeatedly been denied um we talk about that at length and the podcast about how um the secrecy around these types of incidents can really shield officers and their departments from being held accountable from the public\nAnd so my plan is is to look back at some of those police shootings you know we covered the the one sheriff's deputy it shot up for people and seven months I couldn't get all the records to those investigations and you can bet I plan on requesting those as soon as this law goes into effect\nSo there might we might be going back to things that you've already done\nThat's right I mean this is an ongoing issue an important to um Los Angeles and the greater California community it's about how well our officers are being held accountable and in in some cases of use of force are there are steps departments can make to make sure that our communities and our law enforcement are safer\nAnd a yogurt soon as the PCs investigative reporter talking to us about two new laws calling for police transparency fantasy anything for granted too happy to\nReturn to Washington DC where the White House agreed with FBI check into the sexual assault claims leveled against a Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nThere are many questions surrounding the investigation and not just what really happened thirty six years ago lawmakers themselves have been unclear about the terms and scope of what agents will look at the White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders says agents will have free reign\nOf the White House has not micromanaging this process this is the Senate is dictating the terms or they laid out the request and we've opened it up and as you've heard the president say there were any to do the FBI this is what they do a and we're out of the way and letting them doing exactly that\nBut then again the New York times with the Washington Post report the president gave the FBI list of just four witnesses to interview and California Senator Dianne Feinstein has requested that the White House give senators a copy of its director so that they know what's being investigated\nTo help you follow along with all that and what will be uncovered and who's in charge will do a one on one on FBI investigations joining us now is Patrick ... retired FBI agent and see all the national security investigator from Franklin global based in Los Angeles Patrick welcome\nSalary to good All right so a lot of people are weighing in on this or just remind us who ultimately does the FBI answer to\nThose ways or executive branch leading up to the president so it's just the ultimate she as a matter of\nOkay now how big of a team usually takes part of these kinds of investigations and who are the exactly\nThey'll be a case manager that oversees the background\nInvestigation for an appointee that could be a team of anywhere from three to five folks that are working as an English and then you have interviews that will be conducted based on that person's background\nIn those interviews will include interviews of marketing ploy ers family neighbors friends a social clubs are involved with anybody who can give us match out of the individual and those and it is very um Japan\nOr a hundred depending on the no why it\nUsed to having to use the conductor all over the country as a person had a history that included different address was across the country\nNow this is being from a limited background check not of criminal investigation and during last week's hearing senators I kept going into the FBI doesn't come to a conclusion and report this kinds of Africa in the end what could this report read like\nStrictly it's the old just the facts ma'am it's going to be a little back on the individual being interviewed so it was\nJohn Smith XYZ address pessimist Russia who that person is and then as a a a review the writer of us actually what that person said and typically the background investigation interviews are focused on character integrity loyalty or have they had\nSecrets are passed that someone could use the leverage against them to capitalize them those type of things that the investigations into\nWe're talking about her collie retired FBI agents CEO of national security and investigator from Franklin global based out right here in LA Patrick this this process so far to you it has it been unconventional conventional is that how the way it works\nWell clearly this whole process is very unconventional unfortunately the whole process has become politicized\nI mentioned earlier how the presidents of the FBI has free rein New York times reporter the White House has limited the witness list to all only look at allegations of sexual misconduct for example the FBI hasn't been directed to look into judge Kaplan I was drinking habits even though his former classmate said he mischaracterized\nA clerk with the da's office and I fell in love with the idea of\nProtecting our community and doing something for our community one case in particular stands out\nThe victim was had just come home from work somebody knocked on her front door she answered it and somebody asked to use the phone because her car and broken down\nShe indicated no I won't let you use my phone but I'll make the phone call for you when she winter phone to individuals broke into her house assaulted her injury or quite bad and proceeded to violet or in an assortment of different ways\nThat was a very sad case for me I luckily the person was caught and we were able to convict them justice is is very important to me protecting our community and our victims making sure that justice is done not only for victims but the community the defendant\nAnd when I become judge I'll make sure that the right things done all the time there are several different characteristics that are important and become and the judge one you need legal knowledge experience temperament courage to make difficult decisions and empathy being able to understand that the people who are coming to court\nLeave either done something bad or something bad has happened to them\nWell my personal background my parents are immigrants from some of them a call I have a three brothers and three sisters I'm married with three children\nYou can't separate someone's personal background from what they do specifically as a da or is the judge and I bring several different life experiences to my profession currently and I'll bring it to the bench\nOne is a sense of understanding as to people who may not have grown up in the most affluent areas of town\nAnd that are sometimes leads into making bad decisions and I bring that type of understanding of that drugs for example new ability to cope with trauma looking to escape a lack of education sometimes are hanging out with the wrong people and not having the tools in which to\nOvercome some of those obstacles and I think we in the justice system should try to provide some of those tools or justice system should work better we should strive to make the justice system work for everyone I think it's our obligation not only to hold people accountable for the crimes that to commit\nBut when appropriate try to resolve cases in a manner that we will help does that offend that's not to reinvent if that means put him in a drug treatment program anger management courses\nSome type of community service\nIn order to incentivize them and help them not to ... when people don't ... not only do they benefit the community benefits Hi my name is ...
