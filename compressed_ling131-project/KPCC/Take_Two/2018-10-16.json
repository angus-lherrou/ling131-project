dinner in London Tonight they learn which of them received the man Booker Prize for fiction those off for the award include Canadian se a do jog whose novel is Washington Black\nYou know when you're starting a novel you really playing with character and and you're letting them interact and you're seeing what comes of it and at least for me as a writer I really have no idea where my story is going at the outset of it\nAs her novel starts it seems the narrator is not going anywhere if the Eighteen thirties and he is a boy and slave on the British controlled violent to Barbados he seems likely to be worked to death and sugar cane fields then Washington Black has made an assistant a visiting white male who becomes as friends in a way\nAny true friendship between them is impossible because of a power imbalance in the relationship but it's just too great\nYou have to white Englishman teaches Washington Black to read and draw he's revealed to be an almost super naturally talented artist soaking up knowledge that he was denied as a slave the novelist says she didn't plan for the store to turn out that way\nPart of what I was wanting to explore with this idea of I guess black genius as being something that obviously would have existed back then than you would have people with great gifts but that this is something that would have been snuffed out a very brutally in without much thought\nA friend of mine said that you know we tend to think of slavery in terms of the loss of black bodies [laughter]\nBut you know we don't really stop so much to think about the loss of of ah [noise]\nOf potential of blacks greatness of black genius\nI have to ask because I'm hearing you saying that you start the novel um don't exactly know where it's going I don't think it's giving away too much to note that\nThis young man and his older white companion are going to skate Barbados they're going to get out of their uh did you need to get out of there get out of a slave situation as a novelist for your on Saturday\n[noise] it wasn't so much that is that I felt that with this novel when it really wanted to explore was his life posts slavery and to show how [noise]\nYou know by being physically see we think of that as being kind of the end of sleep very well she's not in chains he's gotten away he physically free but I really think that you know there has to be a huge psychological ramifications staffing than a slave\nEven while you are free and body that obviously you're carrying with you a great trauma and probably a great sense of B will come into your place in the world that I really wanted to express that\nI'm thinking of two ways a comes across one of the young man is constantly thinking he's going to be recaptured her church tone or another one there's a there's an observation late in the book when it becomes apparent that\nIn a way he resents being freed he resents the white man of freedom a obviously you gave him so many opportunities but also took away from everything that he knew and dislocated him in a way\nYeah but I also think I think the main thing that he represents is the feeling that the man who freed him did not\nRespect him as an equal and this is really the crux of what what starts to eat at him is that this man made this great gesture of of helping him be free\nAnd yet he really has the sense that do this man thought of himself as an evolution is and and your great crusader for good in the world that he didn't actually recognize the humanity of of Washington [noise]\nWhy does this feel like a irrelevant story to you and two thousand I think\nI think we're still dealing with a obviously a lot of the themes in concerned that come up in the book [laughter] things like racial injustice racial inequality the idea that some lives are are more worthy than other lines but also this idea of um people\nKind of being galvanized to do something in the world if you think of the abolitionists and um and how they [noise]\nThey really had to [laughter]\nNot only is sort of\nChanged their own thinking about slavery which would have been just a very sort of ... in everyday thing I mean the sugar arrived on your table\nIn the mornings you put it in your oatmeal you understood that this was the product of slave labor but it was going on in a part of the world that you would probably never and you're like see a you know done by people who you really had nothing in common with\nSo to be able to change their own thinking about that and then to galvanize a whole society to\nChange public thinking that this is something huge and an amazing\nSo I was interviewing American voters or the other day in the state of Kentucky and there were a couple of folks and heavily wide areas who brought up black people a couple of times and expressed baffled unfair centrally said I don't understand\nWhat it is that black people are complaining about I don't see prejudice in my own life\nAnd they're they're saying I don't I just don't get it I don't get this black lives matter thing what would you say to somebody who here's a little bit of the history that you're laying out and find that to be old news\n[noise] [noise] [laughter] that's very disheartening to say that but of course I Know I Know that to this exists um to me that's it's quite shocking because I mean how can one watch say\nVideos of I'm a police officers gunning down unarmed citizens have anybody watch those videos and still contend that there is not a problem and and some that we have racial equality and fairness that this is baffling to me [noise]\nI feel that there's been regression that there's been steps backwards in terms of people wanting to understand each other's experience and really being open to it and I think one of the things that novels can do is to bring a reader into the characters experience\nEspecially a character who was nothing like them you know we're dealing here with a boy in Eighteen thirties\nBarbados a who's a slave but if you can read that and start to see maybe how you were like him a similarities ah and and also\nTo feel for him if he's going through these hardships if you can do that or perhaps that can be the beginnings of of some kind of empathy\nBessie or do drugs is the author of Washington Black a novel that's been short listed for the Booker Prize which we find out about today like so much\nThank you ... where\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin coming up next take too with a Martinez was interviewing Dianne Feinstein ths challenger and if

Educational Fund here's what he said\nIf you're getting ... from somebody and you're thinking that the nonprofit or whichever organization is actually endorsing this person but in reality they're getting money to be able to put them on this newsletter sort of format a mailer will something that you know most boaters wouldn't know necessarily\nAnd these weight mailers are getting increasingly popular so you might be getting a lot of these\nThe biggest hit here is to follow the money here is how to do that on every sleet male or you get that printed notice to voters somewhere in the pocket saying who was prepared by so definitely look for that\nAlso I this is a really interesting Ted any candidate or a ballot measure that paid more than a hundred dollars to be included in this late mailer must be designated by an aspect so look for that aspects that will be your clue to know that money was involved in the endorsement\nIs always late mayor so some critics pretty crazy names or at least the organizations like citizens for good government or something very vague like that right right right now are honest and vote by mail questions people have been asking how to fill in their ballots is it okay to mark your ... with a pencil\nNo pencils no pain\nNo pencils and this is a commonly asked question we've been getting and the answer is no pencils we've talked with election officials in orange county and LA county ball tell us you'll want to use a pen that has a blue or black ink and the LA county vote by mail ballots how the symbol that actually kind of looks\nLike I said that that can you really want to use ten blue are black ink LA county ballots are different for this election right\nThey are and vote by mail ballots and LA county have been totally changed for this election they look very different in the past we had those ... those are no longer and so they switched over to a new system if you have any questions at all about that do let us know\nOr you can reach us via email the email is human voter guide at key P. C. C. dot org ah we've been hearing feedback from folks and it's really helpful I Will try to answer more questions as we go along getting closer to the election\nOkay another vote by mail ballot question this one comes from LA county resident Barbara beneficial she lives in Windsor hills but her grandson goes to school out of state and she had a question about that\nMy grandson is going to school at NYU and his mail in ballot is coming to his parents here in California because he's registered in California and the question is can they get his decisions fill out the ballot sign it and mail it in or does\nThe ballot need to go to him in New York for him to complete and find himself and mail and from there\nOoh I Can't wait to hear the answer to this when Mary we did we did some research on this a lot of kids are out of state for a school or college students are out of state\nIn this case it's best to nail on the ballot to the out of state voter and they will need to sign on blips themselves and then mail it yeah and that's the key everyone has to sign their own vote by mail ballot\nAnd another option if you know you're going to be in the same place for college for all all four years you might want to change your permanent vote by mail address and you would do that by going to register to vote dot C.

C. S. D. C. F. S. and other county officials are tapping the faith community in LA for help\nAnd that's the topic of a town hall event in Inglewood tonight it's hosted by the chronicle of social change a news site focused on vulnerable youth in families\nAnd you'll ... is the publisher thanks for having me All right the chronicle of social change has done some reporting on the national foster housing crisis which inspired your upcoming about can you tell us about some of the major findings yeah so\nWhen you look nationally I think one thing that really sticks out as if it weren't for relatives relative caregivers the foster care system across the United states would be in serious crisis seen\nA loss in overall foster homes and Fifteen states where they've lost actual capacity\nTo care for kids and they're increasingly relying on relatives to do some of this work but in often oftentimes they're not paying relatives the same amount that they're paying non relatives stranger foster parents so that's one thing that sticks out another think sticks out is while\nIn California and federally everybody has decry this concept of a group home as a place to keep children were six more kids are living at a at a time and really focused on family type settings\nOr many states across the country have seen an increase in group home utilization California's actually dropped\nThe past few years but nationally that's on the rise as well so those are some of the things that that really stick out\nWhen it comes to a number of foster care homes in LA that are declined do we know why well a lot of it had to do with the decline and overall numbers have kids and care so there was a time when the number of kids and care dropped as they lost the kids you know they lost\nCapacity you that you couldn't keep home open if he had no kids to center that home so during that time it dropped since then I think across the country we've really struggled with how to how to recruit and retain foster families\nBut the number of kids in the foster care system has gone up right so how do we square that with the number of foster homes going down\nWell that's I think create the urgency and the reason why we're doing this event the reason why we look nationally to try to understand what are the the big broad friends is that there is\nA need for caregivers on all levels you have on one side of push away from institutional settings for understandable reasons uh but that creates a strain on the family type settings and then you have\nA as we've seen in LA county referenced the numbers that you've you've seen a dip in overall foster homes and um that that hurts the capacity so you turn to relatives okay you turn there but you still need\nNon relative caregivers and so what LA county is trying to do is really tap into the faith based community to ensure that they're able to recruit families and also\nA help foster family or even a biological family stay together by virtue of the community that church and bring\nThem to understand to motions that were passed last month that are focused on developing faith based programs to help a foster family recruitment tell us about that\nYeah Katherine barge or had a motion which really county supervisor LA county supervisor Kevin ... Dr emotion um which was really focused on how can that community in the is the fifth superb is oriole district do kind of what the south LA churches are doing which is\nWhat are the ways that they want to step up and help in this so not very prescriptive\nAh wasn't saying we're going to give you money to the churches to recruit a bunch of foster families it was\nA let's get a consultant to work with you to figure out what you need and go back to DCFS and figure out where you guys can help and so trying to engender the faith community to help on all levels of foster care in Pomona that area\nAnd then the other motion by supervisor so lease was really focused on how can the faith community be helpful in reducing the disproportionate number of black children that enter the foster care system\nIn general how easy is it to be a foster parent because I can imagine there's probably a lot of parents out there that would make great foster parents but maybe they're thinking this process too much I Can't do it\nYeah I think that that's been a historically a big problem you have very long wait times to become a foster parents got to go through background checks you know if you move from a different state", "show_name": "Take Two", "year": "2018", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "16"}
