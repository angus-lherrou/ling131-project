enjoying life to learn more visit Huntington Hospital dot org slash fourth though\nThis is MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm David Greene\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin in the Nineteen thirties a New York prosecutor brought down lucky Lucy on out the notorious head of the New York mafia it made the prosecutor Thomas Dewey a household name and set him up for a career in politics\nLess remembered as the staff lawyer who made it possible an African American woman named Eunice Carter\nAnd her story is the subject of a new book that is called invisible the forgotten story of the black woman lawyer who took down America's most powerful mobster it's by her grandson the law professor and prolific writer Stephen Carter who told Steve Inskeep that he knew his grandmother growing up it was never told about her accomplishments\nShe did all these things she was a prosecutor for years she was a big power Republican politics for a long time and yes I grew up without knowing any of that but knowing it now I think the story is quite a remarkable and\nI Want to underline that named Thomas Stewart people know it because of the famous false headlined Dewey defeats Truman he was a presidential candidate was supposed to win in Nineteen forty eight and last but before that was a noted prosecutor in New York City what was the task he was set to in the Nineteen thirties\nNineteen forty five New York experienced what the press called the runaway grand jury when a local grand jury refused to work anymore the corrupted district attorney's office would just make no effort to break up organized crime\nSo the governor of New York for the New York just beat attorney to choose a special prosecutor who ended up being Thomas Dewey and his job was to clean up organized crime in New York\nBy hiring people who have never been prosecutors would never get involved with the prosecutor's office which are seen as entirely corrupt so we hired what he called the twenty against the underworld Nineteen white men plus one black woman Eunice Carter\nNo matter how many pages of your book I read it still seems somehow a little surprising to me in a time of such prejudice that first that your grandmother became a lawyer that you became a successful lawyer and then that she got hired by this white prosecutor how'd that happen\nWe don't know exactly why you hired her but higher her he did the downside was that after do we hired her he set about again trying to investigate ... but do we want it to investigated for murder\nOr some ... what do you considered a serious crime but at the same time the only woman and only black person on his staff my grandmother Eunice or do we assigned to look into prostitution even though he made clear that he had no intention\nOf prosecuting Louisiana for prostitution because do he said he was not going to be a male crusader\nWhile and Eunice Carter faces the task along with these other lawyers have tried to find some way to work her way up to the top man to lucky Louisiana where did you began\nSo after Eunice was hired she was banished in a sense to the furthest cubicle in this special office do we had a set up and when do we asked citizens of New York to come in and talked about organized crime in their neighborhoods\nTurned out that most of the letters and complaints were about prostitution\nAll these much come in they had to be dumped on somebody's desk and they're all dumped on union says there's a sense in which was sidelined during the investigation\nBut she didn't want to hold her back in fact from the beginning she went over to the attack she actually put together the first evidence anyone who's ever had the mob was involved in prostitution because there was an article of faith among the police\nThat prostitution was run by small time operators and certainly the mafia was not involved Eunice set herself the task of proven otherwise and against considerable opposition including her own office she succeeded improving it\nI guess the method here as you start at the bottom work your way up\nSomething like that once you begin to gather the evidence she persuaded do we go to a range of police raids which ... was in charge of\nOn eighty a bravo one night they brought in the prostitutes the women who worked in these ... there was a reason they arrested only the women because the women were accustomed being bailed out by these men called the Sixers but the rest of the ... to ... there was no one to bail them out\nVideos to keep the women's they would turn against the fixers then to pressure the fixers so they would turn against their bosses are trying to get their bosses of hope to only turn against I'm Lucy on oh enter every one surprise\nUnisys idea worked wow and how did the trial turn out\nThe trial was actually a lot of fun for the press precisely because the main witness was against Louisiana were prostitutes and one of them for example the one the press had the most fun with was a woman known as Cokie flow brown researchers noticed Cokie flow was because of her cocaine\nHabit or when she arrived on the witness stand to testify that she'd overheard Lucy I Know several times discussing with the prostitution business with his aides\n[noise] she was so jittery apparently having withdrawal not having had a fix in several days that the judge three times what for interrupt her testimony in order to have a sip of brandy ... to calm her nerves\nAnd finally the defense counsel that as Lucy on his lawyer\nDemanded that she be tested for drugs to see whether she was high during her testimony\nSo kooky flow was taken to another room with a couple of doctors and Eunice Eunice was the only woman on the prosecution team in Louisiana team had no women so she was there when the doctors examine term return to pronounce that she was a drug free and the jury obviously believe your testimony was the jury voted very quickly to convict [noise] so how does learning\nThis story changed your understanding of New York city and the Nineteen thirties or America the Nineteen thirties\nOne to take away from it\nIt's how similar in a sense America's done was to American now my grandmother was on the commission was appointed by the mayor to look into the causes of the New York city riots of ... going in Harlem\nAnd the commission's report if you read it today it sounds like it'd be written today it talks about mistreatment of black men by police it talks about suspicion of black people to go into stores and talks about employment discrimination all the sorts of things that people talked about today but at the same time I think part of our forgotten history\nIs that there were people who are against all odds in that era and even earlier made really remarkable lives for themselves there were people who built\nA society a with in the segregated world in which they could live and move and have their being as a fan of wonderful was even at a time when so many evidence we're close to them\nStephen Carter is the author of the new history invisible thanks so much it's been a pleasure do you think you\nAnd this is MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm David Greene and I'm\nRachel

three thousand people in the field ready to assist\nIs he expected to be the deciding vote here the swing vote\nI don't think so I'm On most issues this term and and for the indefinite future that chief justice is really going to be the swing vote thrown in terms\nOf median John me okay if if Justice Roberts the chief or decides what the plaintiffs chances are good the plaintiffs are going to win if he decides what the defense chances are really good the defense is going to when he's at the center point of the court even if he's not the center and so\nWe're really going to see more about how this court works by following the chief\nWhat's the timing on this when we hear decision\nSo cases being argued today I'm normally there's at least a month or so before any decision and that is if the decisions pretty easy so I Would say the earliest we're likely here is is mid November but that's really\nIf if all of the court finds it quite straightforward if some of the justices or don't know what they think or want to think about it more some of these cases can take months even into next year\nAnd it just didn't want to look ahead for just a minute I understand there's a big case coming up it has to do with a presidential power tell us about that\nYet so this is one of the other cases that people are looking to to try and see where justice Kevin I was leaning fly it's a case called gamble versus the United states\nAnd it's essentially about whether state and federal governments can prosecute you for this seem affects um the doctor and has been for many years that if a state has a crime in the federal government criminalize at the same conduct that each sovereign state government and federal government can prosecute you without regard to the other\nUm this gamble case is going to test that it's going to be about whether if you were acquitted for a federal crime whether the state government can reach try you and vice versa and the reason it has to do with presidential power as\nThe pardon power if the president something much in the news lately now am deals with federal crimes\nRight now if the president issues a pardon for a federal crime and the state crime covers the same conduct the state can still go after you and that is something that certainly the attorneys general are in New York and some other progressive states have held out um should the president\nPardon some of the members of his administration who've gotten in trouble with the federal government\nIf this case comes out a so that it to say that the federal government state government cannot try you for the same crime that it's got to be either or not both that makes the president's pardon power a whole lot more powerful\nJustin Levitt professor and constitutional law expert from law school Justin thanks a lot\nThanks [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWe turn out to a story inspired by the newest Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh is long and contentious confirmation brought a number of issues in the spotlight including the idea of consent\nDespite being the headlines for weeks consent can still be a confusing concept for children so one Silverlake teacher decided to address the idea head on with an age appropriate lesson for third grade class\nLiz climbed rock is her name she teaches at citizens of the world charter school where she joins us now so if you hear students in the background that is why I was going to say to\nYou so much for having all so how'd you get the idea to take this ... you know this national conversation it's been in the headlines for weeks about consent and turned it into a teachable moment for eight and nine year old kids\nWell I Try to think I think it's a practice and I sold anything that happened in the ... on the line by what we can do is try to keep ... strategies and language tasks that are better equipped to deal with the racing emphatically based on live far away I ... I was like\nSuch an easy access to about ... about things like ... because they're already so many teachers who are already\nI'm In Portland is going to notify families this is a big deal the county put a moratorium on on the face back in two thousand nine but they never notified families that they didn't need to pay them any more so\nI'm a so those are the three main things that it does\nWhere there's some families continue to pay even though they didn't have to\n[noise] uh yes there the county and the last year for which we have data uh except that about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in payments on and so that's part of what spurred this action\nWho sounds I mean that could be a really big burden for a lot of families\nWell yeah and and and that's a good point and I think it goes to the the rationale for the action yesterday which is that these days aren't good for anybody um there's now research some of which we've done here in the clinic and others nationally that show that the fees undermine you through their location an increased risk citizen\nOr by putting additional financial pressure on families they're aggressive and racially discriminatory falling hardest on low income families of color and I'm as we just discussed they generate little net revenue um as I said the county noted that it collected about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars last year on outstanding fees among those Ninety million dollars\nThen what was the argument Jeff are charging families in the first place\n[noise] uh it's interesting the space to merge in the Nineteen sixties um\nCounties charge them it in relatively low amounts it was really in the Nineteen nineties you you may recall discussion about the super predator era and you know there are all these youth or out of control and so the state legislature increase both a number of these that could be charged in the amount that could be charged\nA and the argument was both increasing juvenile caseloads and and the budgetary pressures interestingly juvenile caseloads have been dropping\nA consistently actually in California over the last Fifteen Years um and as I said the net revenue is low ... I'll just give you another example from a neighboring county um Orange County which continues to aggressively pursue\nMore than thirty eight million dollars a seat at the last year for which we have data from the county\nUm they collected about about eighty five cents on every dollar that they collected they spend actually pursuing other families\nSo they essentially take money from low income families of color almost solely for the purpose of chasing other a low income families of color so it also turns out that as a budget matter this is not a particularly a beneficial to counties\nOne reject the LA county still would have to pay to house people though how how would they get that money\nWell I'm a ... ... what the county set in motion was is that it was spending more administratively to keep these stays on the books then to get rid of them so the county um well actually I'm more money at it after passing this resolution than before it\nAs a county has lots of sources of revenue by state federal and local um for the system and I think that the\nArgument in LA and in California and nationally is that\nThis is a public good I'm actually rehabilitate in youth and that that should be something that falls on all taxpayers not just on the people in the system\nReally quick Geoff you mentioned the Orange County still pursuing or some of their fees are could LA county decision do maybe start a larger trend around California\nWe we hope so so at this point I'm of the fifty eight California counties thirty to have actually stopped us both assessment and collection of these sees all the all of the counties actually we're we're required by as the one Ninety\nTo end assessment it just didn't do anything about the old fees but thirty two counties have stopped collecting\nThe old fees there twenty six left there are three big ones in Southern California uh orange riverside and San Diego to continue to collect fees and in fact between them it's about a hundred and sixteen million dollars out of the hundred and forty four million dollars that's outstanding\nOr so we hope that the LA action will spur the other counties or to take the sensible stuff\nMost just sell been law professor at UC Berkeley and faculty director of their policy advocacy clinics ... thank you [noise]\n\nRight and the words of one of the greatest bands to graze the
