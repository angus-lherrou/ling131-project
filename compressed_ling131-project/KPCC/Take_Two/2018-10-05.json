I. T. Y. between the side sit in the election is coming up that could change things instead we go into full throttle Russia mode\nAnd free democratic presidents especially Clinton and Obama constitutional law professors were late getting started nominating people they took their own sweet time while they hadn't majorities and then were found themselves incredibly blocked\nBy Mitch McConnell's very strategic ways of doing things now McConnell has the whip hand and he's using it very strongly and Democrats will come back inevitably with a whip in their hands and as you said this has parallels to the middle east ...\nUh deep and profound issue for Republicans to change the kinds of people that were nominated as judges and as you point out it's not just the Supreme Court vitally important as that is it's lower courts as well and President Trump has\nMoved an awful lot of them over the last couple of years let me ask how much that matters um\nConservatives will say the conservative judges or just interpreting the law obviously they'll interpret differently than a liberal judge but there's still the law and especially in the higher courts judicial rulings our collective decisions of multiple people who serve an institution should we think that that much changes really on the way\nI think we probably could see a court that's more conservative than any court in at least a\nSixty Seventy eighty years going back to the new deal I'm not sure of course and the Supreme Court has always in modern times anyway had the respect of the public much more than the other two branches of government\nI Would be very sorry if I ended up covering institution that was viewed as just political but we are in danger of people are going to their corners on the court and right now it's just the Senate and the basis but you don't want\nTo you know the the crown jewel of the American democracy as the late shift justice rank reset is our independent judiciary and we don't want to lose that and the respect for that\nHasn't achieved justice that you've covered John Roberts spent years trying and various subtle ways to reinforce the seeming neutrality assuming into ...\nAnd a lot of people thought that his vote to uphold the um the ... CARE Act was in essence an effort not to inject the Supreme Court into the politics of the moment\nAnd essentially say the president wants this so it's what I ought to go along\nWell not just the president that Congress passed it by Israel alone I actually go along with\nNina thanks very much for your inside really appreciate it\nWe've also been hearing from NPR's Ron Elving NPRs to medical mountain are we've heard from many other individuals Kelsey Snell Scott Detrow Brakkton Booker and others through the last couple of hours of special coverage let's just briefly review what has happened on the Senate floor today by a final vote of fifty one to forty nine senators\nHave decided to advance the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh that is simply ending debate what next happens likely tomorrow is a vote to actually confirm Brett Kavanaugh and fifty votes would do the job fifty votes plus vice president Pence so he can afford to lose only won\nA handful of votes not entirely certain you can be sure that will continue covering this on NPR dot org at all things considered this afternoon and in a special report on your local member station this is NPR News\nYou're listening to eighty nine point three K PCC the final vote on the Kavanaugh's confirmation could come tomorrow and this morning's cloture vote may get clues as to how very few undeclared senators might be leaning so stay with key PCC for take two next and air talk at ten o'clock for more reaction\nHe'd be the the supporters include universal pictures presenting the new film first man from Academy Award winner Damien ... director of la la land and whiplash historian Ryan Gosling in ... in theaters in IMAX October dwell\nTorrey pines bank offering business banking solutions to small and midsized companies through his offices in downtown LA in Beverly Hills Torrey pines bank is a division of western alliance ... member FDIC Torrey pines bang bang on accountability\nThis is eighty nine forty three K PCC Pasadena Los Angeles community service of Pasadena City College World War two hundred programs offer students the ability to dream come\nDo learn more Pasadena dot edu [noise]\nI'm over I guess are the stakes ...

best this morning until he finally came out a as a yes vote he's been watching he's been watch very closely to see someone that we might have to also watch very closely tomorrow well of\nCourse flake was a senator who was hailed as a hero and he set the final chapter of this into motion by demanding that FBI investigation a witch was subsequently dismissed by Democrats is a sham in the end a lot of people said he did it to give coverage of the Republicans\nAre the fact is he he does appear to be leaning in Kevin us direction he said it produced no corroborating evidence uh so I think I I I go with a jak on this I think Congress probably yes I think flake is probably yes at this point\nAnd by the way coming up a little later on today on KBC on air talk Mary mental open the phones to hear your reaction to Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination advancing to that final Senate floor vote tomorrow that's coming up at ten o'clock today all\nRight ah one of bringing Randy Parsons for some contacts on the FBI investigation he's a retired special agent for the FBI ready willing to take to\nThanks good to talk to you know\nLeading up to a Thursday there were allegations that the FBI had the scope of their investigation limited uh yesterday morning Senator Feinstein said this\nIt looks to be a product of an incomplete investigation that was limited perhaps by the White House I don't know\nRandy does the White House have the power to control the scope of an investigation\nOr in this case as I understand today that they were the request or that to have an update to the investigation done so yeah there are certain parameters they could set\nIt if you look at a situation like this which is an administrative review is how the information is collected as as opposed to a criminal\nAnd suddenly you know like this there's little to no physical evidence so if you're gathering information from people\nThat could involve a dozen interviews several does interviews it could involve a six months so\nIt wouldn't be unusual to expect or request or to say look we're we're going to give you till the end of the week to some middle report and the the White House the president has the authority to do that [noise]\nThe FBI will tool their investigation to work within those parameters\nReady as a former ah FBI agent I'm Wondering you said the word parameters in an investigation when you're conducting one is that the same as limits\n[noise] ... yeah I think you could easily understand it that way so parameters limits on what we need to have this wrapped up by a certain time um the focus of the investigation should be on\nThese issues so yeah that's a that's not an unusual thing from our request or at that level of the FBI\nWhen there aren't time deadlines like we saw in this case does that influence effect or somehow steering investigation maybe in a direction that it wouldn't have gone if you had maybe more time\nSure it would um it would it would drive it because it would put a lot more focus on being I'm\nA ... effect Dave and and the big part of that is timely on what to do\nSo it would be more of probably a a an initial surgery few reviewing information and other reports that were there\nAnd picking who you're going to interview while you're not a who you're not going to an interview [noise] it it really does generate a priorities scheme that's going to drive the strategy of how you complete in a in a week or so\nAnd just because it had to be ready by by Thursday or some wondering the writing of it all it may sound like a very narrow in the we've got a question but is it being written while it's being done or does the investigation finished then it's written up and handed over to the senators\n[noise] ask your question and it's written as it's done you just have to uh you have to do it that way so that um and it also helps to put the information down on paper no other investigators may come up with um ideas are folks they interview that you didn't think of [noise]\nBut this will be um an effort that that won't read plow I'm old information they'll be trying to find new information possibly new people to interview I Know there were there was some criticism of not um re interviewing the professor and\nThe judge hum the this is obviously a very high priority effort for the bureau any Supreme Court nomination\nIs so your strategy has to focus on a key issues and the other thing has mentioned is the makeup and make an issue out of there were seven\nHer six previous by an investigation says seventh [noise] background investigations and build on the previous work it would be\nAn anomaly it would be unusual to go clear back to the to the very beginning of the original background investigation so that also helps focus\nAnd and frankly puts a little more pressure on the timeline to get it right as to who you talk to you don't and try and generate new information\nAround new from your perspective on the outside looking in here any idea why the accuser and your cues may not have been spoken to in this case\n[noise] well I my again my best guess but based on some previous experience with this and reviewing the um probably extensive interviews with those\nAbsolutely a Twitter has been so effective for him he doesn't seem to care that he used a in some respects ramping
