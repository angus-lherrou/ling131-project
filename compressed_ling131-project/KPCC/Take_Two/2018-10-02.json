I wore a pink shirt to work or I I held my girlfriend's per se while she ran into the bank\nOr I ordered a drink at a restaurant and when it came out to me it had a little cocktail umbrella in it and my you know my friends tease me so it's like it's just mundane things like women don't say oh I wore the wrong shirt\n[noise]\nWhy would men make such a big deal over trivial things the familiar explanation is massage any more I'm a phobia that is what Boston and talk to other she began to think about the different messages that boys received from a very young age are you a real man or they say man up\nBoston built on the inside and conducted a series of research experiment into why men behave the way they do a conclusion\nMy collaborators in I argue that the male gender role itself is kind of conceptualize as a more precarious status so manhood is something that hard to earn an easy to lose relative to womanhood\n\nManhood is something that's hard to earn an easy to do so\nMany fewer pink shirts and pushes because they're defending something fragile\nIn terms of why this would be the case or why would you have one sex essentially have a more limited repertoire we'll have more policing around us boundaries or why do women take that femininity for granted in ways that men do not take their masculinity for granted\nThat's really hard question to answer but I think it has to do with um [noise]\nHow men their social status is more hierarchy ugly organized than women's is\nSo men are kind of more interested in or motivated to attain social status and that kind of then translates into what we propose is kind of a chronic anxiety about their status and that translates into a concern about whether once seen as a real man or not\nMen worry about what other men will thing what women will think well they themselves from I think Boston has some ideas on how to get more men into nursing she argues that the way to do it used to come up with a new set of stereotypes\nCould spin nursing as a very masculine occupation it's dangerous to physically grueling our stereotype of the nurse you know you could modify that stereotype and turn nursing into a profession that does seem masculine or male appropriate [noise]\nSomething along these lines happened to Robert ... when he was considering whether to become a nurse at twenty three he just finished for years in the navy\nHe wanted to go back to school his wife's dad had a suggestion\nMy father in law who's a respiratory therapist said hey you know you should really look into nursing\nVon didn't immediately take his father in law's advice\nLike a lot of guys I think the first thing that went through my head was well that's a woman's job\nBut on did get a job at a hospital working as a security guard and one day something happened\nThat up to and has stereotypes about nursing\nWe had a couple guys who came in to the emergency room and they were just very belligerent fighting there was blood all over the place and the nurses in us and the sheriffs were holding them down and it's a dating and and restraining and other man this is the Supreme Court [laughter] the actions of the nurses were saying was pretty exciting for me\nYou know you think of nursing you think of someone sitting at a [noise]\nA bedside and being let me hold your hand and and you see what it is realistically there today\nAnd for me it was\nWhen it comes to fighting stereotypes we often imagined that the right approach is to explain why stereotypes are wrong [noise]\nBut Robin Williams live and Jennifer Boston's experiments suggest a different solution that perhaps a more effective one\nStereotypes up powerful because the stories we tell about ourselves are powerful they shape how we see the world and how the world sees us but in the end [noise]\nThey're only stories and stories we can rewrite them\nShankar Vedantam NPR News\n\nSoccer is the host of NPR's hidden brain podcast and

vote this week\nThe states step in if the federal government up the case it's response ability to protect its citizens\n... department of justice lawsuit to wonder it's rounds pursuing California\nSo it was a key argument is that the FCC went it adopted the um when it eliminated net neutrality it also said that it's going to prohibit the states from adopting that own net neutrality rules\nAnd so basically in the last ... the department of justice points to that decision and says as long as that's valid California and other states can't do that on that and your child she lost\nThe problem with that argument is that the states say this preemption decision the government the FCC saying states conduct their own and neutrality law that's in valid\nAnd that's because court cases said that an agency that does not have the power to regulate also doesn't have the power to prevent the states from regulating either\nAnd what most people don't know is that when the FCC adopted at ... ... when the FCC repealed net neutrality it didn't just eliminate the net neutrality protections\nIt also systematically dismantled all of its sources of authority and then concluded that it now has no authority over broad than left and so since the FCC now doesn't have the power to regulate broadband providers and adopt net neutrality loss\nIt also doesn't have the power to stop the states from doing\nSo I'm not really really quick and about thirty seconds Barbara what comes next up with a lawsuit and what can we expect in the future\nSo right now this is going to be briefed I Would say people need to keep an eye on the price in looking to um DC where people fight the repeal of neutrality rules and that's the actual case in which the validity of this prohibition on the states\nAnd

fight against homelessness it sounded sixty nine percent of Angelenos welcome housing for the homeless in their own neighborhoods here's what CEO at least you were told us that we should be\nProud and excited and and clearly the voters are to have this housing in our neighborhoods\nBut since that time several housing projects have been proposed in different communities in one by one they been met with protests have been in Korea town\nWe're not going to sit back and allow this to happen\nA raucous town hall in Venice\n\nAnd less than two weeks ago in Sherman Oaks [noise]\n\nSo when it comes down with Angelenos really willing to accept the construction of homeless housing near their neighborhoods today we welcome back you know ways Elise Elise glad to have you on again thanks for having me All right so you heard the series of angry voices and what is your survey wrong\nWell we just did another poll in June and the numbers are still hold their own so I can tell you I've personally been involved and some of these neighborhoods siting projects but\nWe have to take a step back because I think sometimes we are giving the opposition too much credit too much power on boys and what we're learning a is not the loudest voices are not always the most representative\nOr at least you have those voices were very very loud but you still have to pay attention to them do drew\nOh absolutely so I was probably the most closely involved\nIn Korea town they felt like they hadn't been consulted they felt like they had a lot of questions that were on the answer so once we sat down and really talk about how we would move forward we were able to get the flu shot and I agree\nWith you I think we do need to hear a voice says but I think they have to be productive voices that are really moving toward flu shot and\nSo when it comes to Korea town did officials stumble on their outreach or her ... city councilman in that area mayor Garcetti who's the mayor the entire city did officials stumble there\nWell I Will say I was actually at a press conference hotel for president lesson with the Korean press and he stood up and he apologized to the Korean community you know I think the electrodes are on a tough spot because there's an urgent thing to get things done I Am still a big believer in the process I just think\nWe have to get the right people who want to get flu shots on the table um convened and we have to really pay attention to ...\nKnow Indian Korean activist and Korea town agreed that the project but only when it was pushed so far east to an area that's more predominantly Latino is there any way in which you call that a success\nWell I Would say this now what we're talking about as permanent housing and I'll tell you in that project we looked at a lot of pieces of land and we have a lot of constraints in terms of\nPublic land and what's available how big of a lot\nBut while the loud voices I think perhaps or some of the headline the story behind the source for me as bad on that\nIs there still room for centrist candidates in politics honestly I think their time\nIs coming to an end really yes most definitely\nI think with the new progressive way that's coming in like those are actually issues that common people care about you know like free college tuition college students like all over the country or like having to pay like a massive ... you know and this was just going to crush us like in the foreign\nThere's people out there they're like well into their seventies and still paying their student loan debts like it's ridiculous that's one issue that\nModerate Democrats just don't seem to get\nBut here's the thing if if if you're a dance and you've got people in a room and if they're all on one side and the other is on the other side no one reads the middle no one day and says so how could there not be any more room fights I didn't cash in ...\nShe I think what the main issue with that is I think most people are a lot of people just don't get the message that progressives have\nThey just you know go forward and you know continue thinking oh like politics is he going to change politics is all gonna be the same the country's gonna change we are going to vote for the person with the most experience for you know the corporate Democrat\nI just feel like people just don't know the positions you know that oh like this candidate is actually in favor for your you know principals and actually favors you more than the other candidate\nWhere'd you guys didn't know what a dance was what I was\nA little worried about that because we're so sorry he'll stay on this for a second because last year assembly Republicans ... voted for governor Brown's cap and trade program even face intense backlash from colleagues and then you would later stepped down as is simply a Republican leader given the whole the Democrats happened here in California\nShould Republican so he'll maybe be more willing to work with Democrats on certain issues\nI think they are I think you see a lot of moderate Republicans coming forward Chad ... is a very specific example because\nCap and trade itself the specific policy was very contentious among the Republican Party but if you think about it look at people like John Cox he beat out Travis Allen who was the only candidate for governor who actually voted for Donald Trump\nA and was the firebrand but we chose John Cox a more moderate a more stoic representative of someone that could provide stability\nBut you don't see a lot of room for moderates on the other side of the aisle because when you look at someone like Alexandria Ocasio Cortez you look at Elizabeth Warren you look at Keith Ellison they all look different but they think exactly the same way you know there are only three or four moderate Democratic senators and all of them are being pushed out of their own party\nI Would talk to you guys for a long running out of time so I got one last question for all of you in one sentence what would you say to convince your fellow Jens ears to vote this November ... your first and if you ask the females in politics but for the females in politics All right how ... have you want to see\nActually change your government go out and vote for progressive so he'll you got the last word if\nYou want motivation you need to know that what it takes us for someone to walk into the fire don't be afraid because there are more people that think like you then you believe ... okay there's\nA strong ... county treasurer for us the GOP how your moral ...
