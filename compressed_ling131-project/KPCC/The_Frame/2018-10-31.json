F. happy dot com [noise]\nWelcome to the frame I'm John horn thanks for joining us for many of us peak TV means too many good shows and not enough time to watch them\nBut as there are also a darker side to the scripted content boom Scott Johnson a senior writer at the Hollywood Reporter talked to several stunt performers and they told them that the massive increase in New shows and demanding production schedules\nMeans that some producers and start coordinators who oversees stunts onset are cutting corners when it comes to safety\nThere's some terrible evidence to back that up\nLast year to stun performers died on the job one was a motorcycle race or doing her first ever stunt work\nHere Scott Johnson I reached him on Skype today to talk about his reporting\nWas John burgers death on the set of the walking dead in the spring of twenty Seventeen it was the first onset stunned related deaths in the United states in Fifteen Years and then just a month later a couple of months later I'm joy Harris on the set of dead pool too\nIn Canada was the second death so all of a sudden after you know a significant time of of would appear to be relative safety this tent community was faced with uh the reality that that there was something a foot and um these two deaths were both notable in the sense that\nThere were experienced on coordinators onset in both places and yet you know something went wrong in both cases\nAnd it's not just the death there have been a number of injuries some where people have lost limbs some traumatic brain injuries so before we get into why this might be happening because of the number of productions\nI've always thought that visual effects had a ball to the point where people didn't need to do physically dangerous things that you could use computers to essentially put somebody in the most dangerous situation even if they weren't in that dangerous situation\nAnd that certainly does happen there are lots of very big budget productions that use visual effects to to great effect\nBut there are still with the advent of all these news streaming television programs a huge ah there's a huge demand for real stunt people doing real things on productions from New Hampshire to Los Angeles and everywhere in between\nAnd so what we're seeing is that the the huge glut of content is is leading to 'em what many people in the community say\nA a kind of more permissive environment where less experience ... and also less experienced and people are doing more dangerous things and that's leading to more deaths and injuries\nWe often hear stories of actors who claim falsely that they do their own stunts what does that create in terms of the dynamic for stunt performers about their ability to speak out about what they're doing to say that they actually have done the stunts\nIsn't part of the problem that stunt performers feel that they don't have a lot of voice to talk about their own work\nAnd to ask about safety conditions\n[noise] yeah I mean in a sense they're sort of a catch twenty two at work in that\nThere is many people told me that there is a very real fear that if they don't display enthusiasm and an immediate willingness to do the work that's being asked of them they might not get work in the future they might get blacklisted on the other hand\nThere is no within the ... union there is no set of qualifications\nFor stunk performers or stunt coordinators so\nThey like actors fall under the sag union and they don't really have to produce any tangible set of you know qualifications in order to get jobs they don't have to take tests they don't have to pass any kind of exam\nThey don't have to demonstrate to producers or productions that they know what they're doing or that they can prove that they know how to do you know a back flip or a slide or you know a a hit against the wall or anything like that and so the onus is on them to sort of\nDisplay their resume or beef it up as they see fit and oftentimes that leads to problems down the\nRoad for everybody you say in your story that Harris's death was quote an eye opener according to court has for who's the chair of sag after it's done and safety committee what is that after his role in all of this\nThey're in a little bit of a tough spot because as many of them told me they have been deliberating and working on issues around safety for literally decades and one of the problems is that it's very hard to get agreement among all the members about\nWhat should be in place you know should sag be the policemen for qualification process should it be up to the production um should there be some sort of independent agency that monitors this kind of thing and they've been unable to come to any definitive answer\nAfter Harris is death I think a lot of them sort of took a step back and said okay this\nYou know we really need to address this and think about this and some sort of new way that is going to\nHelp us all as a community and so a couple of weeks ago they passed and new measure the board passed a new measure which essentially it's a it's an online registry for stunt coordinators um and so stunt coordinators who have five hundred or more days\nUh of working we'll hear on this list and sags position is that productions will view this list as sort of the de facto reference point\nHowever the problem is that it's not mandatory and there's nothing there's no qualification built into the registry so essentially productions are are still free to hire\nWhomever they want or wherever they want and and you know they they can essentially do whatever they want and so ... taking these kind of piecemeal steps little bit at a time but there as they told me they're far from\nHaving you know a very clear cut answer to the issue of safety in the community\nScott Johnson is a senior writer at the Hollywood Reporter he's the author of the article stunted how Hollywood content boom is leading
