I mean that's how far back it was fine [laughter] there was no Google\nThere was no YouTube with a you know it was it was really nowhere to be found [noise] so I wasn't particularly looking to see this in mainstream media but you know time passed and the Internet grew in the access to resources grew and more people started to advocate for you know more transit ability and the working and better representation in the rose\nA you know the work that they had a ... and the liver and Cox bringing real stories and that's not really start to feel you know just like deeply encouraged that okay we're moving in the right direction in this level of visibility as the kind of thing that will really change lives and maybe make people remembered that trans people are people\nPeter Brian brought up the fact that some narratives about trans characters like any other characters are sensationalized so how do you make sure on the fosters that you don't go there how do you cast your writer's room where the checks and balances that you put in place to make sure that you're not doing something that some people might consider sensational\nWhat he mentioned a Nick Adams a cloud in every skip we have that even mentions one of our trends characters go straight to Nick\nAnd who gives us really direct really clear feedback um we don't actually have a trans writer in the room but we try to build our narratives out of\nAuthentic voices we try to build her narratives out of things that the stories that that uh the trans people are actually telling us or telling the world through through prince we try to be an absolute lease awful as we can and then the the main thing is we check ourselves and we listen\nAnd is it now more possible that you can cast trans actors\nIn leading roles that there are more people from whom you can choose decorate\nYeah slowly at first casting goes I mean I think that actors access and you know all of the casting databases that we use are beginning to denote trans actors that there's actually easy ways to search for them\nUm I mean we do a lot of specialty castings we look for very specific things like for example Mara the protagonist of transparent we're trying to cast a young more ah a child actor and we wanted the trans factor\nUm and finding a young trans girl to play more ah was you know really challenged saying\nCan I ask for more understanding the idea to do that so we met more emphasis male who want it to transition that's how we came into the show\nSo in my mind as assist now I'm thinking oh if you're casting younger more ... back when he was Maury ... you would cost us this boy but the idea being ... thought that because of the transition is that the emotional authenticity would be more honored if young more he was a trans yeah\nAbsolutely I mean it was really a creative decision on behalf of the writers and they think are lady Jay who's also a trans woman was the writer and that episode and I think that was important for her\nTo situate more as an adolescent as a transportation because we are virgin in our in our adolescence we identify 'em\nI say that all the time yeah we're not that we all started out as a kid I I think there's been this big notion that we had a huge push back on the fosters when we did the youngest same sex kiss and I was like we have got to stop pretending that gay adults didn't start out as gay kids we have to stop that that's a damaging damaging\nLands that we're putting on the world and and I absolutely understand that yeah they just I find it really falling really fascinating I Know you guys are always very thoughtful which which I still respect\nWell yeah I mean I think that we're also really restricted and repressed by respectability politics right now just to kind of add on to what you're saying it's something that we're kind of like a harness to buy with specially with trans representation because we're really starting from\nA new ... whereas before the representations were so destructive\n...
