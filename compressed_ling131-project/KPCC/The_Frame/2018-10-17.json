country are you going to everyone on Brian Loader in for Jonathan Capehart again tonight every Monday through Thursday through the mid term elections this program as bringing you the latest political news and analysis\nAnd listening to your thoughts and questions and feelings about the issues that matter most to you know later in the hour we will linger on the feelings part of that equation when we talk about five common scenarios that people are presenting with in psychotherapy related to politics over the last two years\nSome are coming from troubled individuals\nSummer coming from troubled couples and we'll take your calls whether you're in therapy you need therapy or practice therapy and this is not a joke people are stressed out relationships are getting frayed and we'll talk about at all including with you coming up\nWe'll start on the news though with the president now comparing Saudi Arabia to Brett Kavanaugh the justice must love that\nAnd we know what he said about Megyn Kelly and what he said about Ted Cruz's why and what he said about ... the arena and we could go down that whole litany of inappropriate by almost anybody's lights comments about women's looks another very personal things I\nJust want to ask you one thing before we go and we just have thirty seconds tend to think that Trump is not out of control when he does things like this he knows what he's doing and he's doing it for a reason things like this toward\nUm Stormy Daniels making so Kelly Carly Fiorina many others that got him elected mocking Christine Bugsy for the other week was a key to cabin or getting confirmed many analysts say\nSo as offensive as this may be to many people I tend to think it's not a gaffe it's a midterm election strategy for Republican candidates do you think so too and we have thirty seconds\n[noise] sure I mean I just I I think this is not very different from what we've seen from President even before he became president\nWhen he was on the campaign trail and he called all his opponents you know names you know some would say nickname feathers were the you know more more harsher than that criticism so this just seems to be the way he uh acts\nAnd communicate and yet they may lose some voters um it may also turn off others\nWe thank ... a pie national reporters thank you so much for joining us on America on the line\n... thanks for having us\nAnd with us now is David Greenberg political columnist and author of the book Republicans spin David thanks for joining us on America on the line glad to be here is the Trump play book comparing Saudi Arabia to Brett Kavanaugh and calling the woman horse race and gender gap election season spin\nLion gas lighting what would you go\nWell I think from at different times does all of those things um I think above all Trump is a very sort of instinctive intuitive a politician and I think he\nI I wouldn't call it quite a strategy here I think he does have some sense of what has worked for him on the campaign trail and what he thinks has worked for him as president and so he kind of follows this guy and he knows that\nLashing out seeing what comes into his mind or even if other presidents would have to walk it back in and have it be labeled a gaffe he knows he can kind of bluster and find his way through those kinds of statements because of the persona he's established for himself\nPeople often say that we're living in an unprecedented time but historians like yourself usually push back on that\nAnd say no this has happened before I Know you wrote that a Teddy Roosevelt invented spin do do you think it's completely unprecedented away Trump is using spin and out and outlaws and whatever else you want to label a to achieve his goals\nWell during a that doesn't succeed campaign I got a lot of calls from reporters saying this unprecedented and I did push back I Would point to figures like George Wallace there Joe McCarthy who would engage in the kind of demagoguery that that was working for Trump\nNo president now he's been active for almost two years I think we do have to acknowledge there's something unprecedented year uh I thought of with my book Republican spin which came out into the sixteen adding a chapter beyond spin\nTo to deal with Trump because I Do think ah the dynamics that we had gotten used to through the Clinton Bush Obama years you know now do feel a little dated we are on into some very different terrain\nAnd I know you've drawn a distinction between the Kavanaugh hearings where each side have their own truth versus yesterday when Elizabeth Warren as Trump to pay up the million dollars that he said he would pay her if she took a DNA test than it did show some Native American blood\nAnd he just said I never said that well why do you make a distinction between the Elizabeth Warren and be a cabinet situations\nRight so I think in our politics today we have plenty of good old fashioned spin if I can call it that\nThe competing sense sets of part isn't talking points the different frames four interpreting the political situation uh and that's what we saw on Kavanaugh the Republicans were essentially interpreting\nThe charges one way Democrats were for the most part interpreting another way and individuals kind of had these two are you know interpretations to choose from\nWhat Trump is doing really does recall\nYou know the propaganda of the communist or the fascists without saying that he deserves those labels himself but it's more of a brazen attempt you out of George Orwell to say that what you saw with your own eyes what you heard with your own ears is false\nAnd that that's different from saying I Do believe her I don't believe him\nThat's what we call ... isn't it\nWell I think gas lighting is a term that's kind of getting use now in this broader sense it's sort of originated well first with the angel as ray film and so on but kind of with relationships in psychology so yeah you could apply here ice ice it he I think\nPeople think that they're going crazy right as opposed to believing the truth is are the facts or the observations that they see with their own eyes 'cause somebody's planting death to make them doubt their own perceptions\nRight what I'm not so sure about is that Trump is really making anyone think they're crazy those of us\nWho heard the tape of him you know daring Elizabeth Warren to take a DNA 'cause know full well that he simply lying or ... retailing false hundreds\nSo I don't think he's really confusing anyone he is just counting on his loyal supporters in the media and in the public to take his side\nSo it's a little bit different but it's in the same family of breaking down the traditional categories of truth and fall so\nIt's in the category of nothing matters as they might say on Saturday Night live\nA little bit I mean this is the other phrase we heard in recent years a is post truth\nOr a a sense not that there isn't truth but that it doesn't matter that once political loyalties are other tribal loyalties and attachments override the empirical questions of\nWho said what's the significance of X or y and it's fair that I think Trump has taken us into some some uncharted waters\nCan you give us a little thirty second history lesson on how Teddy Roosevelt invented spin\nRight well I I well it's a little strong and say he invented it I'd say he\nReally began the process of building the machinery of spin as it's attached to the American presidency so before the twentieth century\nPrisons really weren't out there all that much making public statements trying to mobilize the public and it was Teddy Roosevelt who in holding press conferences staging publicity stunts hiring PR officials in different agencies really recognize that swing public opinion through\nWhat's now this vast apparatus was part of the president's job\nDavid Greenberg political columnist and author of the book Republic of spin by the way my crock fact checkers say on the really important stuff that it was an angel and it's very it was Ingrid Bergman in the movie so just\nPutting that out there um and when we come back we will kind of go down that gas lighting where do you feel you've been gas let the Trump your and your mental health David Greenberg thanks a lot\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] sometimes it seems like the news cycle is one big runaway

shows\nBut that doesn't mean that the shows aren't saying something about the issue a new study from the U. S. C. and a bird Norman Lear center and the immigration advocacy organization define American examined the portrayals of immigrant characters on scripted TV series\nThey looked at one hundred and forty three episodes from forty seven different shows in the past couple of years what they found was that a third of the immigrants portrayed on those shows were associated with a crime even though native born Americans actually commit more crimes than immigrants\nFurthermore while Seventeen percent of immigrants in the U.S have a bachelor's degree and another Thirteen percent have some post graduate education on TV only son\nThe steam of people but it exists and it's important and uh I think it ripples through our society when a group of people don't have that and so it's very helpful to see herself portrayed and positive ways on television", "show_name": "The Frame", "year": "2018", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "17"}
