Sanders and Karen and Karen Finney to get your reactions\nTo the two calls typically I'm\nKaren or this idea that Democrats are to basically Democrats are too nice\nWell my\nStory so how so let me let a narrow the focus here I'm In the mid term elections and also think about this uh from your vantage point Kristen in this in this midterm election and certainly in twenty twenty easy at vital for Democrats to\nGo at these races fighting [noise]\nAnd I ... and Jonathan you know that I Am a firm believer that you have to do both though I think on the one hand particularly in this cycle and I was communications director of the DNC and the two thousand six cycle which was the last time we\nWe actually had a big victory on the Democratic side and I think you have to have to sort of if you will prosecuted critique about what is happening in the country um that is a ride or stray from where it should be so in this instance and as we've seen in the past\nYou know it is a culture of corruption the way that the president President Trump tends to use the administration and the levers of government kind of\nAs his own some would say criminal enterprise I say for you know it's the party of me I think is or it's you know it's about me but you something I think Colin Powell said a ... somewhat recently instead of being about the country\nBut then at the same time you have to be able to have a critique because particularly at this moment Republicans controlled everything right so House Senate now the Supreme Court they have a conservative majority as well as the White House\nSo at the same time if you're a democratic if you're a challenger or if your income and you've got to have an argument that says here's what we would do differently and I and I do think that as something of democratic candidates I've done a good job of you know they ... they were for the people and what they talk about is\nYou know let's let's do things let's get that infrastructure build John and create jobs and talk about raising wages and how do we bring down health care costs\nAre and and instead of having you know ... Republican members of Congress spend their time protecting President Trump from various investigations let's get back to the work of the Congress and the job that we're supposed to do so I really believe you have to have\nBoth so Chris and given ... just said I'm just wondering um\nYou know she argues that Democrats need to say here's what we will do differently will that work in a midterm uh mid term election campaign that is defined by rage as defined by the the president's outspokenness\nBy the Senate majority leader outspokenness\n[noise] I think there are the basis of both parties are quite frustrated and angry right now but I Do think there are voters in the middle who are not necessarily full of rage and anger but instead\nThey feel like things are going okay in terms of the economy but they feel like we can't go on like this in terms of our national tenor of our discussion so it's not that they themselves\nFeel rage more concerning an anxiety that it just feels like this can't be right this can't be how our country is going to function from here on out\nSo we don't necessarily know that at least those voters in in the broad middle are looking\nTo sort of have their rage buttons pushed I think what they're looking for is for someone to present\nA way forward for the country that that seems both uh that that has to be bold and I think you know you have to you have to paint with bold colors not pastels in this case you know but I I think simply being\nYou know trying to out Trump Trump\n... dangerous path for for Democrats to try to take now it may be one that is quite appealing you know you see for instance I I Believe there was a Twitter exchange between Michael ... and Cory Booker recently that kind of spoke to this debate where I think Michael ... to use the hashtag fight fire with fire or something to that effect\nAnd that may well get a lot of applause lines and a lot of engagement and a lot of you know clips on social media that go viral\nUm but I still not confident that you know when I go to focus groups and talk to swing voters that they're looking to turn up the temperature um I think they're looking for for someone who will be passionate about the country be passionate about what they believe in is it someone who's going to be unique and mild\nBut can bring about what feels like an end to this moment that swing voters where they sort of say a pox on both your houses to the parties can I just\nAdd to that John Irvin quickly so because you know I'm seeing the same things in focus groups as well and when I say that people you know you want to make your case about you know what's wrong I'm not suggesting uh\nActually that it's about rage I think it's about making an argument that says and here's why we need to a lot more Democrats if you're a Democrat right this is why you need to elect me and I think one of the the most important things that we're seeing from voters as they want to know how will my life be different because I think people are really exhausted\nBy President Trump and that sort of uncertainty that has the tone and tenor has created and so there's for ready to hear more about themselves and how are you going to help make my life that are that's what I elect you for that is what I send you to Congress for\nAnd I agree absolutely with Christian that people are actually looking not wanting to see the bombastic rhetoric and I and there are many candidates that I can think of who are campaigning that way I'm Mr ... maybe you know doing that from the outside but that's different than if you're out there on the trail and say\nWell we're going to be talking about more than ... I use the word rage where do we talk more about that in the next block when you're talking to ... and Cory Booker and we're going to be joined by Jill Smith\nA who's going to join us from Miami to talk about Florida politics and more from you on the question what do you want in a candidate someone who fights hard and take the prisoners or someone who is fires and tries to unite us\nOr can you

twentieth Nineteen sixty nine Neil Armstrong stepped out on the letter of the Apollo Lebanon spacecraft which had landed on the surface of the moon as he talked with engineers back at NASA and the world watched on TV or like me listen on the radio Armstrong became the first person on the moon [laughter]\nSo how do you make a movie about Neil Armstrong and his journey when everyone already knows it's ending\nThat was the challenge for director Damien ... and screenwriter Josh Singer when they set about making first man the film stars Ryan Gosling as Armstrong I spoke with ... and singer at the Telluride film festival where first manned premiered in the states here's Damien ...\nWe wanted to tell the story behind that story is basically a we know that he landed on the moon but\nDon't think people really know or perhaps appreciate how he got there and how difficult it was and how costly it was not just to him but to his family to the people he knew\nAnd then I think by extension to the country into the world I mean this was not a a an achievement that came easily so I think what really fascinating to me at the outset was\nTaking one of the most famous achievements in history a one that we just think of as a success story is sort of fed accompli you grow up you see the photos and are you sure the one liners and you kind of a soak in the mythology\nBut try to take that rewind to win none of that stuff that happened we had all seem to actually quite ludicrous and crazy to a bunch of people um\nAnd trace step by step how this fantasy was turned into reality and and and just what the sacrifices in Baltimore\nJosh neo was famously private he didn't like talking at all about himself but he did cooperate with one author about a book James Hansen on the book first man\nAnd that gives you a lot of information but where do you go beyond that what does the book leave out where do you go to do additional research that builds on what he shared with Hanson and that biography\nYeah so I mean gym really did humans work in his book is is encyclopedic\nAnd what's amazing is as you dive deeper and deeper there are just incredible chest Nazi uncovered that a lot of people to know most of the people who work with Neal never knew he had a daughter most of the people working in the old didn't know that you know he struggled a bit with the excess teen right around when Karen died so there there was just they were right off the bat\nGyms work was just an incredible starting point but it's true we wanted to go deeper and first of all we a gym himself\nHe had a ton of knowledge he had his own original notes from his conversations with\nNeal and Janet and all sorts of other folks but he also put us in touch with a ton of people I think uh\nThe first month I started working on this I took a trip up to Edwards to what's now Armstrong flat Research Center which at the time is just you know the NASA flight Research Center ... flown the access team you know within five minutes I was sitting down trying who's one of the engineers who worked closely with me on on the fifteenth\nAnd NASA and Jim just open the doors for us it at Johnson tons of former astronaut we met this fella Frank Hughes who turned out to be invaluable or he retired as head of training for the NASA astronauts and basically was our head of training\nA and taught us a ton about the Gemini crafts at the Apollo craft and then you know family and we got to sit with Janet we got to talk to June and your sister who is probably one of the closer people in the world to him\nAnd his kids are ... are just incredibly supportive and you know all these people are not only gave us primary information but then read draft upon draft draft and give us notes which was incredibly helpful\nDamien a lot of people who have paid attention to the space program over the last twenty or Thirty years imagine that it's really dangerous because of the challenger and Columbia accidents but until the challenger accident in Nineteen eighty six no American astronaut had died in space the Apollo fire that killed Roger ... white\nIn Nineteen sixty seven was on the launch pad but test pilots\nWere really risking their lives every time they got inside a vehicle and I think a lot of people don't really understand what Neil Armstrong was doing before he became an astronaut\nWas far more dangerous than what astronauts were doing\nYeah I mean uh though I mean I I think again it's sort of a you have to look at the percentage you know obviously there's less space flight so less percentage of I mean it's hard to say that being a test pilot at that time was actually more dangerous than than being an astronaut basically I think the key is just that it was a next one was an extension of the other that\nThese were all these were all former test pilots are almost all former test pilots these also we're all former almost all former a wartime\nPilots so it's true that everyone not just Neal but everyone around him in those first groups of astronauts in the early sixties um they came to that program with the great awareness of\nTheir proximity to death at all times uh on this job um and I think that became really fascinating to me was just how they cope with that how they dealt with it felt like a lot of them dealt with it by by modern standards by not dealing with it\nBut you know how do you kind of do a day by day job that you know whether you're an astronaut or test pilot that in many ways could seem like a normal middle class kind of job these astronaut and their families lived a seemingly normal middle class lives um\nWith the exception that every time they went off on on on the flight or a mission or off in training we also we often forget how many just how many astronaut to dodge training some of which we go into a in the film um you know how do you deal with the fact that you may not ever come back how do you deal with those odds how you deal with that how does your family deal\nWith uh with that yeah I mean you know the whole point\nOf training you know there's a there's a great engineering saying which is that engineering has the obligation of failure which means you failing failing you fail so that eventually succeed and that's all playing training is failing down here so we don't fill up their butt failing down here costs lives\nNear news in the second ... group the new nine ah there were nine guys two of them died\nRight and those two turned out to be the closest with um which again I think not many people knew but those aren't great outs you know so a short you know test pilots there were some brutal years but they're also planning for years and these guys [noise]\nComing up white director Damien ... and writer Josh thing or didn't want to show Neil Armstrong and his fellow astronaut stocks Hollywood heroes and their movie first man [noise]\nFor a year after Harvey Weinstein seen me to New York is an acting

Egyptian the Newtown\nWelcome back to the frame I'm John horn let's get back to my conversation with director Damien ... they'll and screenwriter Josh Singer about the Neil Armstrong film first man the movie it's not only about the moon landing but also Armstrong's personal life\nAnd the death of his daughter at a young age director Damien ... explains why that laws became a central part of his movie\nOne of the things I find the most fascinating about Neal was this reluctance or even failure to to express or talk about\nHis emotions are things you know the traumas like this that he that he had been through um\nThan the culture of of the astronaut some test pilots and I think it's one of the coping mechanisms that they sort of relied on especially people that era there was this on unwillingness to go there and the way you sort of managed those feelings was the kind of took them away and put them somewhere in the attic of your brain\nUm but to me actually there is something profoundly tragic poignant and cinematic about someone who the only way he can cope with those feelings that he talks the way up in the attic of his brain is through his work\nIs through flying is through the sort of a word lists pursuit of of of things that he can't even quite articulate I Love the fact that you know if you if you were to have actually been asking Neal why\nDo you do test pilot and why why are you going to the moon he would give you answers that were very much you know sort of engineers answers I'm a it was always about problem solving and about you know kind of trying to figure out how things work\nI don't know what space exploration well\nUncovered but I don't think it'll be exploration just for the sake of exploration\nI think it'll be more of the fact that it allows us to see things that\nMaybe we should have seen a long time ago\nI", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Frame", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "09"}
