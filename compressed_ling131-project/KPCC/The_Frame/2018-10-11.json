O T L\nDo you do what Bernie Sanders wants to do and have a single government plan you know that's the debate they're having and will continue to have but that's a very\nDifferent approach they basically want to keep going you know provide everyone with comprehensive insurance even if that means you know having a bigger government program more government spending more regulation and the Republicans they don't want that they want less government spending they want less regulation\nAnd the way you do that as you just kind of let the market go back to the way it was an insurance will be cheaper but not everyone will be able to get insurance and people who have it will be vulnerable when they get sick\nBut nothing as a last question and I want you to try to explain something to me now that we discuss what's happening with the short term care plans and all the problems with that in congressional races across the country both Democrats and the Republicans\nAre taking out as about health care they're both saying that they support 'em safeguarding health insurance for people with preexisting condition and then as you just discussed that is open for debate as to who's really trying to protect that but what I'm Wondering is it\nAre you surprised that Republicans are running for office focusing so much on health care um and not on the\nCuts for even the economy which Republicans good on very solid ground argued that they've done a good thing from their bases perspective\nUm I I'm not surprised because I think they are facing the political reality I mean look I don't even Republicans want to be talking about health care right now they're talking about health care because they're getting hammered over it\nBecause the Democrats realize this is now a winning issue for them and you know you look at someone like Claire McCaskill\nIn Missouri which he was in a very I mean that is a tough state for Democrats to hold and but her opponent Josh Hawley uh he also has his name on that lawsuit we were talking about he has you know very clearly tried to take away protections for pre existing conditions and she has absolutely\nHammered him over that time and time again and it seems to be working and so you know Republicans are on the defensive the problem is you know\nThey're guilty as charged this is what they're they've done and so they're only recourse is to run these ads which like Trump's op ed lie about what they've done and you know they just they're hoping I think basically the voters don't winds up\nJonathan Cohn senior national correspondent for post thank you very much for being on America on the line thank you for having me\nAnd joining me now in Studio ... Catherine Rampell Washington Post columnist on politics and economics and also with us Brian Lehrer host of WNYC use the prime Lehrer show and remember we're taking your calls and your thoughts about Medicare for all at a four four\nSeven four or five eight to five five welcome Catherine that to be here Brian as always thank you for being here identifying\nSo I went to pick up on the last question I asked Jonathan and throw it out to the the two of you and I'll start with you can thread why aren't the Republicans talking about the economy and about their tax cuts and instead focusing on health care where they are on squishy ground aren't they\nAre yes they are on the ground but they are on much squishy or ground on tax cuts arguably the tax cuts are phenomenally unpopular and they had then basically since they were introduced last year and if it's something that the donors wanted and maybe some of their base\nBut among the general population they are not popular give away to the very wealthy to corporations are there some packs pack that went to middle income people lower income people but they're so ... that people haven't really noticed that you know lots of things affect your paycheck\nAnd week to week for a month to month and so the fact that you get to keep a little bit more of your money or because you're a tax rate went down you may not even notice\nSo the tax cuts themselves are not a winning political issue\nA repealing Obamacare also they learned not winning political issue precisely because people finally learned what that meant right they were all born with repealing Obamacare when they didn't when when the public did not know what was in it but now that they know what's in it including these protections for people with preexisting conditions they want us to stick around so\nBrain is what what the Republicans are doing is this sort of like a latter day three card Monte like they're trying to do the right squishy ground on the tax cuts their squishy ... really squishy ground on health care and yet\nI'm as Jonathan Cohn was just saying I'm In Missouri the Republican Josh Hawley he's running ads touting healthcare\nYeah I mean here's my whopper of choice from the president's USA Today a bed and Jonathan called referred to this to Trump says he kept his promise to keep pre existing coverage even while dismantling Obamacare well today\nThe very same day as the op ed Senate Republicans voted with Trump's support to allow low cost health insurance plans and guess what insurance companies may make them lower cost\nBy not covering pre existing conditions so on protecting preexisting conditions what are you going to believe Trump or your lying eyes\nYou know what I mean that seems to be a sort of that the the ... of of the Trump Administration but when you are I mean that's the president's saying if you've got a again I keep bringing out Josh Holly in Missouri because really playing his ad in in the next segment but it's I\nKatherine helped me here because I don't understand how Republicans are able with a straight face run ads touting their support for health care when there is demonstrable proof that they are trying to take people's health care away\nBecause they know that this is an issue that Americans care about ... again I I keep coming back to what was what was in a bomb it or what is in Obamacare\nAnd is popular for the most part there were a couple of provisions that were not that was the individual mandate in the employer mandate but everything else all the other key provisions in the law\nIncluding and especially the protections for those with preexisting conditions are quite popular people just didn't know that those things were in the law so Republicans ran against it for many years and one elections by running against it now that people realized that those protections\nFor themselves for their loved ones for their neighbors might disappear Republicans have no choice but to claim that their record as something other than what it is\nAnd it's starting to look to me like Trump is running one kind of campaign and the congressional candidates are running another if they're talking about health care and not the economy Trump is talking about the economy now he chose to jump into maybe an advisor\nWrote this Medicare op ed today I don't know out of some you know party organizer strategy but Trump is out there touting the lowest unemployment rate since Nineteen sixty nine which is now in fact\nUh he talks about you know low black unemployment Latino unemployment female unemployment I mean he is running on the economy as part of his populist message it's interesting to me if there's a disconnect\nBetween what he's doing it as big rallies and what the actual candidates on the ground who he's trying to support or doing to get elected a reelected\nAnd real quickly in the in in thirty seconds the the import of the president taking a whack at the Federal Reserve chair because the stock market dropped eight hundred points today Catherine\nAwful awful ... there are tons and tons of research suggesting that it it is critically important to have an independent central bank or not only in the United states around the world because if the central bank is not independent or its its independence is questioned even if it is independent people don't believe it\nAnd you run the risk of people thinking that inflation is going to grow on that there will be pressure on the fed to keep rates low just like Trump wants them to do\nUm and that again people will respond to those expectations and and you can't keep inflation under control this is this is very bad news for Trump to the job on the facts\nAre we we've got to take a break will probably

bought Time Warner and then renamed all of the F ... at that time Warner own Warner Media that includes HBO and include TV networks like TNT TPS CNN cartoon network and then the Warner Brothers studio and this new streaming service starts with HBO\nAnd then they're going to offer all sorts of different services and movies and TV shows on top of that so you can already buy HBO over the Internet soon enough they will probably make it so that if you want to pay an extra two dollars a month or four dollars a month you can add on these other services\nNow the details of this are still being worked out Warner brothers' movies are already on HBO but a lot of Warner Brothers TV shows are on Hulu or Netflix and eventually you think Warner Media can let them bring those back to be a part of whatever this offering become\nAnd how does that affect HBO as a premium cable or satellite t._v. service\nHBO will continue to exist as something that you can buy as part of your cable or satellite package
