T. L.\nSo about that nightmare scenario I mentioned earlier\nHope ... are you still there Nate was saying he was voting his hopes and his fears\nAnd I'm hoping his co workers call will come back so they can find out what they are All right we'll we'll we'll try to get Nate because I really want to know what its hopes and fears are there in Milwaukee but let's go\nAlex calling from Rockland County New York Alex thank you for calling into America on the line\nHey thanks for taking my call 'em something I'll tell you a question it's more like fear ... for the men resent which I told your screener I feel that we don't have a check and balance says right now that everything is controlled by one party if they decide to do something crazy is that's how\nI mean every day right now nobody has control um my parents around philosophy it's more like leaning Republicans but they do nobody can control of their control that you know the house set up a White House and basically the Supreme Court so\nUh what is the check and balance on seem out democracy\nAlex ... what do you hear from from your friends and neighbors and colleagues do they share your\nConcern or do they do they think they know where\nI live it's um mainly I call it like Tom planned I say that's mostly for the war like a body ... voted for Trump by now you walk in the city and\nI work in a hospital and most people are like they they can't even watch the news anymore and being so the point that we we don't know what to do\nIt I don't want to sound whole place but it's like you can't keep up with the news you know what that\nThey've had better than Alex there's about ... going to be another breaking you said I have money to read it on the phone was excellent\nAlex I'm I was gonna say oh I hear you I'm not being able to keep up with the breaking news but I'm the one way to to fight there in hopelessness\nA and to entertain hope is to go out and vote on November sex Alex thank you very much for calling in nature is back Nate from Milwaukee, Wisconsin before your call drop you said you're voting both your hopes and your fears now and I want to know what they are\nSure um well it's a form I stayed a specifically whether or not we actually have a functioning democracy in Wisconsin a we are one of those states that has been very heavily gerrymandered so our state legislature actually doesn't represent the people\nAll that well because the people can vote for one party and the other one's still holds power I'm Scott Walker if he loses his coming election uh will not be in the ocean to sign on to\nAnother bunch of gerrymandered Baptist which she's indicated he will do if you get the chance and that means that will actually have\nUm the other candidate will put together a sudden you'll put together a neutral party to re district but that means we actually have honest ... elections again which means that a lecture civil Wisconsin would actually be accountable to the public which I think would be great um\nThere was actually a lawsuit about this it's still going on in the courts a guilt versus Woodford ah and\nIf anybody else wants to look at it um they're a lot of attorney generals\nWho I think like rigged elections got in on that too I'm from places like Missouri from Ohio and Georgia which are in the news already uh because they filed a brief saying it's we should let states basically regular election so there are people going to have a say which I think is horrible\nI'm for anybody who basically was honesty and the people's will to prevail\nNate I Want to thank you very much for calling in from Wisconsin and that was actually one of the states that I talked to a former attorney general Eric Holder about in terms of his efforts to your point about redistricting\nUm the efforts that his national democratic redistricting committee is is working on a NATO thank you again for for dialing back in and letting us know what your hopes and fears are I'm going to come back to Dave and Kevin uh Dave ...\nWe were talking about you were talking about\nRaces in California um where slow vote counting could delay on the outcome help delay the outcome of the midterms are there other races um whether through so vote counting or whatever that could delayed the outcome of the midterm\nWell close races in general we have a much larger battlefield of house races than we've had\nA the last several cycles we currently right Seventy three races as competitive as a cook Political Report found like that many out of four hundred thirty five foot ... double the number of\nA competitive that we had at this point two years ago or the caller who who talked about the walk away and ... that are that Trump referenced in his tweet or or the other day um you know based on the evidence I'm thing democratic voters aren't really walking away from the party they would crawl over broken glass\nFor ... for vote this fall and Republicans haven't walked away from from Trump either are there still with him and the question is are they is energized that they were in twenty sixteen because after all he's not on the ballot and neither is Hillary Clinton and Hillary\nClinton a spoof to a lot of Republicans into voting in twenty sixteen so we're just not seeing that sense of urgency from the Trump base or as we did two years ago and that that is what's pushing a lot of these races towards Democrats\nAnd Dave I'm so you're at the cook Political Report you guys work in a crystal ball so when do you think you'll have a good idea of how the night is going in terms of the balance of power in the house are there specific\nRaces that you're looking at that are that would be bell weather's you give our listeners them some inside\nThere [noise] I think we may have a pretty good idea of how things are going up early on in the first couple of races all be watching our Kentucky ... congressional district in Lexington, Kentucky oh that's a district Trump won by\n... points but the Democrat and a graph\nHas been a tough running very close and impose with a Republican incumbent Andy far she became a viral fundraising sensation with the video um and then the other two races I think that will give us a\nPretty good early indication of what's happening are Virginia second and seven districts are in Virginia Beach and the Richmond suburbs respectively and the seventh district has a toss up between Dave Brat a Republican who beat Eric Cantor four years ago and a huge\nUpset ... same Abigail and Eric Cantor this was a big deal because Eric Cantor was the house majority leader correct ... Ryan ... than he\nWas he was thrown out as a result of a challenging him on his wife\nI'm saying he was soft on immigration rights so Brad is now up against a very strong challenge from a Democrat\nAbigail Spanberger former undercover CIA officer who wrote her diary and code when she was a kid a district first run for office but she's a she's raised a ton of money just running as a pragmatist and the irony here is that uh\nProbably Eric Cantor's old voters who are going to the side yeah come about race and tell us how the nights going pretty early\nOr write a med Dave Wasserman thank you very much for being on the show Kevin you're going to hang around for a little bit uh when we come back we're still take your\nCalls and remember the question is will you be voting your fears or your hopes\nThis election you can give us a call at eight four four seven four or five eight to five five\nAgain that is a war for seven four or five eight to five five you're listening to America on the line [noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nOne year ago the me too movement drew attention to the widespread problem of sexual harassment now the movements power is tested at the ballot box\nI'm not willing to compromise my values over election time that\nSome lawmakers have been accused now face voters and the next MORNING EDITION from NPR News\nWeekday mornings on eighty nine point three K.
