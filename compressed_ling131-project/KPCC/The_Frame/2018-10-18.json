proposition will take them in numerical order you can follow along with your sample ballot all the bond measures the gas\nTax repeal expansion of rent control extension of prop Thirteen benefits to homeowners next house Burgess and permanent daylight saving time\nOr donor crabs session gets underway right after the news [noise]\n\n\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm jak sphere researchers have issued the first report on hurricane Michael's impact in Florida last week\nNPR's Greg Allen says will be used to revise building codes along the panhandle\nHousing I'm Michael you want to start us on this ...\nThis this is another attempt by the state legislature the legislature put this one on the ballot to try to deal with our of housing affordability crisis that we have in California it's it's a bit different than than the general vacation kinds of bonds of revenue bond and there's already a dedicated stream of funding here and so the funds to pay the bond back\nWill come from the the revenue that already exists\nAnd is there any controversy about taking money that was designed for mental health services and transferring that into a pool of money for housing\nYeah absolutely that was that's a the even the road to get here this is essentially a bill that was a senator Kevin daily owns in two thousand sixteen and was challenged by a lawsuit saying you know that's not the intention of prop sixty three which is the money that is going to be used for this specific a bond measure\nAnd so there are people who are saying that you're taking money that is meant for mental health services and now creating a housing program out of it\nAnd for for mental health for national health right yeah just remember this was a millionaire attacks that we passed proposition sixty three back in two thousand for this is not new money this is just saying that money we can now use a hundred and forty million dollars of that money to build housing for it for a mental health patience right\nAnd the other point I Want to make is reiterate what Michael said\nIs that all these initiatives there either placed on the ballot by the state legislature or by signatures and this is one that's placed by the state legislature to change the law that was already voted upon the voters that they cannot change but they need your permission to be able to spend the money differently not new money to spend it differently\nSo you want to weigh in on this because it is a little different than prop one\nWell it it one there's the the same issues that that play that the that this will ultimately costs close to four billion dollars a\n... half of that will go towards the these housing programs the other half will go to interest now one thing to think about is that that's that's over a billion dollars I could have gone to mental health services that voters intended to go to mental health services that ones that go to pay off interest\nUh on on a program that they did not originally support and that that money that was taxed for people that's now money that's not going to go to McDonalds or is it that's going to go to a brand new program with results that we don't yet know what that what that is um so I think that's something that has to be kept in mind that\nThis is something that's going to be it's gonna end up costing double what what is it what it is up front it's a brand new program is taking money away from services\nAnd this is ... ... the mental health services act has already been under fire for ... for ever since it was passed by the the state auditor by legislative an oath office this money that's already being under used as it is and so now do we want to take that money and waste half of it on a ... they're talking about proposition to the bond measure melody\nRabbit just jump in there and say absolutely there have been a lot of controversy over the spending on a prop sixty three but I Would add that the author of that measure uh uh Darrell Steinberg who's now the mayor of Sacramento he said that it was always intended to create a program that stabilizes homeless mentally ill\nUm homeless people All right so that's proposition to next up or the third bond measure on the ballot propositions three which issues nearly nine billion dollars in bonds for water related infrastructure and environmental projects who'd like to start is on on that\nOrr yeah I can say um if you think you voted on a water bond before you have [laughter] I'm about the third one we had one and twenty four team that was for seven billion dollars and the governor came out very strong for that one there was one in the spring that we voted on for four billion dollars and that was actually an effort by lawmakers to keep this\nProposition off of the ballot they were trying to I'm sort of doing ...\nRun around that up but they were not successful this one would be for watershed treatment habitat groundwater management a whole slew of\nA different water projects but um it's not we don't see the governor jumping in and supporting this one as we have in the past there is a feeling that the government the legislature and the government is not the ones backing this\nMeasure and do we know how much of this money would go to providing a more reliable sources agriculture water in California versus urban residential uses that been delineated anyone's knowledge\nIt seems like most of the water is for um uh\nPeople people are saying that one of the criticisms is that this is a give away to agriculture businesses and that they they are the ones that would benefit most from the Senate specific ah water projects water districts what\nWant money for their projects than they should find a way to find them we shouldn't be making everyone in the states pay for projects that will only benefit specific places All right\nMike lovers anything quickly I think the other thing about this one is and again I I I spent the last couple of weeks rooting through this um and and trying to figure out the details of how this money is going to be spent\nAnd it's it's really unclear exactly what kind of trends parents oversight we as taxpayers will have with the expenditures under this under this measure the as I understand it the money basically goes to agencies to state agencies are going to allocate the phones and it's really not clear to me exactly how you tracked the money was one of one of one of the concerns I ever\nAlright that's proposition ... nearly nine billion dollars water related infrastructure and environmental projects the final bond measure is proposition for one and a half billion dollars in bonds for children's hospitals a melody yet again Sam that\nNow I mean this one is one of the ones that doesn't have a lot of opposition its funding a\nCutting edge technology for children's hospitals that's probably a hard thing to run your opposition campaign on\nOn this but you know their argument is that they treat children from low income families they're not being subsidized for some of that care and that this money is needed for seismic upgrade equipment um you know the one thing I Would add is that if like Katie said if you feel like you've voted on this before you have\nUm there were two different bonds for similar improvements ah seven hundred and fifty million bond or in two thousand four and a nine hundred and eighty million dollar bond in two thousand eight so these are things that are going before voters a you know several times know\nRetrofitting issue was a big thing for a lot of hospitals I Know because uh just the cost of doing it to these large facilities is is a major south your thoughts on this bond measure\nUm so to take a stand against children's hospitals [laughter]\nYou know they you know this this is one of those measures that sounds sounds good uh who who's anti giving children hospitals money\nA while I Am a [noise] uh\nSo now again so there's one point there's one point five million dollars is gonna end up costing double that uh how 'bout how 'bout is just an idea\nHow about the state if if children's hospital retrofitting is is so important to have at the state just take some money out of its massive budget that ... and and the massive increase in revenue has every year and put some money to children's hospitals retrofitting\nWith existing revenues they could do that if they want it to the state legislature could do that if they want it to instead we have this measure right here which is one point five million dollars that's going to be\nCosting double that it's going to be at the expense of taxpayers and when I asked the the the president\nOf the California children's hospital association if if money was necessary she said uh yes it would be nice to have we do a great job of fundraising but this\nWould be nice and help her out on this is the two thousand Eighteen voter ... from the California Dream project every statewide ballot measure the pros
