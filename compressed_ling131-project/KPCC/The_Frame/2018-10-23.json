from WNYC radio I'm Jonathan Capehart and this is America on the line alive political news and call in show about the midterms from WNYC and public radio stations across the country every Monday through Thursday night we're here with news analysis and your calls\nWe want to hear your opinions on the issues that matter most to you know coming up we'll be joined by one of the Democrat's biggest funders Tom Steyer is best known these days where his knee to impeach organization it's not winning him a lot of popularity contests within the Democratic party in fact\nParty leaders seemed to be running the other way but let's start though with the political news of the day and for that we're joined by the Washington bureau chief for her post Amanda Terkel Amanda welcome back to America on the line\nGreat to be here so ...\nAs we speak actually the president of the United states president Donald Trump is in Texas is\nDoing a rally for a man he used to call lions head but now he calls him this\n[noise] excuse me of why the president is zeroing in focusing in on this caravan that is making its way up from Central America through Mexico trying to get to the U.S Mexican border why is the president hammering away at this and\nPushing this notion that there are people quote middle Easterners in the crowd\nYeah if if I can I'd like to try and divide that into a which may be impossible when when you deal with all things Trump\nI'd say on the one hand ah he's as we knew he responds to what he sees on TV and images I'm pretty strongly and and my sense is um we're going to hear from a lot of voters especially\nUm in those border states in those border districts um but also then throughout the country who see this in the imagery that they don't like that they see\nA large groups of people who are in their minds are intent on coming across the border um regardless of\nYou know any legal process um that we have that we set up for for immigration and so forth and um entered Mexico illegally for instance as well um put to the second point as to you know why that may and I think that'd be fine and reasonable\nI'm pleased to have I'm not comfortable with a lot of the imagery that I've seen well one of these migrants to be treated with with respect and dignity as well um that that brings in the second part of this which is the president's rhetoric about noon Middle Eastern Easterners and and so forth\nAre they good fortunately this is you know another\nExample of where Donald Trump takes the most extreme language you can to try and divide us the the imagery that we that we've seen a Arctic will have enough of effect politically I'm certainly on two Senate races Texas would you were just talking about\nI'm In Arizona as well um to where I could play to the president's advantage taking of the one or five steps for the Trump often does\nI think is what causes you know a real problem with a lot of Republicans who are made re with some of the policies but for the rhetoric only divides us further\nAnd in ... Maria the rhetoric includes and this is more of what I'm White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said today she said quote we have ten individuals suspected or known terrorists\nThat tries to enter our country every day now the president didn't say terrorists he said middle Easterners but it's the blending of the language here that sort of adds to the ... as the discomfort\nOr about the way the president is is talking about this issue\nSure there is no question about that and it's not an accident I mean he does this specifically because he knows what that imagery will bring up I mean he is the most bigoted racist president I think that we've had\n'em and he is somebody that um is absolutely willing to use all of that kind of imagery because he knows exactly what it will do\nLook he won the Republican primary hands down on this issue of immigration and it was a big reason why he won the presidency and and the way that he did it was not to\nThrow out there and really talk about commonsense bipartisan solutions no in fact completely the opposite\nHe used to fear and he used it to ... to bring up these these images to frankly his base many of which are white and nationalistic\nAnd do not like uh the changes that are going on in this country the demographic changes and President Trump knows that and he's using it to the ... advantage you know Murray\nAt one of the the the storylines that's been picking up steam lately is the fact that Latino voters voter Latino voter enthusiasm is not nearly as high as people headaches\nThat that is is this rhetoric and the way the president is talking about immigration in general and the caravan in particular is that what is dampening enthusiasm among Latino voters\nNo I think I think it's the contrary and and I I'm not convinced that that is actually true uh what what is out there is that there is a study that uh that my friend I have to do a lot of guys from the national association of Latino elected officials put out there they're having a week to week tracking poll which is very interesting\nBut what it did was measured the percentage of Latinos who had been contacted by a party or a candidate and it was very high meaning that no party or no candidate had contacted about fifty five percent of Latino voters\nUm as of about two weeks ago but it also measured the intention to vote for Latinos and it was in the mid seventies which is pretty high in the mid term election for Latinos\nSo I think that the the the polls that have been talking about measuring Latino enthusiasm I don't think are right on the mark but I Will say Jonathan we should assume as a party as a Democrat\nWe should assume that those are correct so that we do everything that we can and the next two weeks to make sure\nThat Latinos understand the importance of this election to mobilize them to energize them to get them out to vote but I think that this rhetoric actually does a lot to mobilize Latinos because they see it as a personal attack against them whether they're here with documents or not\nAnd they see it as a personal attack against their families in the community\nSo so Christina the president President Trump is out there talking about immigration but the former president President Obama is out also on the campaign trail out in Nevada are talking about health care here's what do you have to say I'm today in Las\nVegas let me say something as the person who actually passed the law\nPeople with preexisting conditions for the whole here that [noise]\nBut no way for existing conditions when anything for both they're just they're just\nSo Christina I'm people clamoring for President Obama he's out on the trail people have been saying that the Democrats have no they have no issues yet\nHealthcare we've talked about on on the show for weeks now health care has been the issue that even Republicans are running on ... ... is what the what President Obama is what he's doing is that going to help is that going to\nWork I I think it really does depend on a on a geographic space I think you know local politics matters I think it also depends on what types of races Democrats are in across the country the problem is the Democrats don't have a consistent message\nSo yes we are talking about health care yes we're saying that what Trump is doing at the border and how he talks about immigrants is inappropriate races and Senate phobic you name it I'm yes we're sort of talking about climate change yes we're talking about school and we've got a lot of issues on the table but it hasn't come out as like a coherent\nNarrative that says this is what we're clearly for and this is what we are steadfastly against\nWhat is it is not a an the nature of geography I mean they couldn't it be that in Nevada healthcare is the issue in another place yeah I'm In is is ...\nAnd I think that that's specific this is why we've seen a bomb in certain places right because Obama doesn't necessarily need to go to certain places in the south nor do a voters necessarily want to see him in the south or particular states this may be a very targeted effort for him to go there\nBut I think that you know part of the larger problem with the Democrats right now is that\nSo many elected officials are focusing on Trump is the Trump is back\nBut they're not necessarily putting forth a vision healthcare has passed in you know we see the Republicans consistently trying to think\nOf we well we've got less than a a less than a minute we're all coming back in the ... in in the back half of the show will pick up all of these things because I also want to ask all of you why is it that President Trump's approval ratings given everything that's happened\nHas ticked up to forty seven percent in the NBC News

cards [noise]\nNetflix series about Frank Underwood a roof what's southern congressmen willing to do anything for power at is equally ambitious wife Claire debuted on Netflix in two thousand and Thirteen house of cards help trends for Netflix from a video company into a producer of award winning original series\nBut Netflix halted production on house of cards last year when\nLead actor Kevin Spacey was accused of sexual misconduct\nSeveral house of cards employees also came forward to say that's basically had created a toxic work environment a former production assistants had the actor had sexually assaulted him\nAnd ... who was an executive producer of the series was fired Robin Wright who played opposite Kevin Spacey is Claire Underwood is now president of United States in the series\nTV critic Daniel find birds had seen the first five episodes of this final season\nWhen I called them at the Hollywood Reporter today\nStarted with the decision to continue the show after spacey was gone\nI think they were already deep enough into the production or pre production process that it was hard to turn the ocean liner around and I think also that they felt\nA certain responsibility to finish the series I guess on somewhat resembling their own terms I mean very clearly this is not the way that they charted out but I think that if you look at where the show was last season it was pretty clear that the ... was going to be very very clear centric\nAnd so it's just become perhaps more clear centric but on the other hand as a critic who had become\nGenuinely sick and tired of Kevin Spacey is heavy performance\nIt is to some degree the best thing that could have happened to the show\nItself obviously not to the production clearly not the best thing that could have happened there but uh to the show creatively I don't think it hurts the show\nIs her character now as important if not more so to what the series can become\nI think without any question her character is just a more interesting character and now a much more interesting reflection on power one of the problems with\nA Frank Underwood with Kevin Spacey performance is that it had become this one ... hand me scheming thing where it became completely and totally impossible to\nBelieve that anybody would have dealings with this man that anyone could ever taken as anything other than I can I didn't crook and that was all that he was ever playing was okay I'm going to be some army okay I'm going to look like I'm about to you know go down to the count but then guess what I'm ahead of you at all turns whereas\nThe performance that Robin Wright has been given really the entire time has been a much more complicated edgy Shelley brittle performance where you can't always read what she's thinking and and that's a tremendous relief is to watch\nHer and to watch Claire Underwood and not at every turn no where she's thinking and where she's going I think it gives the show a sense of ... surprised that really it hasn't had probably since the first or second season\nSo I'm going to remind people where things left off at the end of season five the very final scene but they're Claire in the oval office are refusing to take a call from Frank and she looked straight into the camera and says\nThis ... so where does these insects pickup\nPicks up a little bit later because they have to basically allied what happens\nWith Frank Underwood and I'm not going to spoil it except for to say that he is no longer with us and he is no longer with us under circumstances such that gets\nDiscussed pretty much constantly and this is not an example of a show that's moving on and leaving things behind it a little bit like the way the the first episode of the ... was pretty much everybody the entire time talking about the absence of Roseanne uh there there's a lot of discussion of Frank but I don't think that that's necessarily\nInappropriate or wrong or the reason why Claire is in the White House is largely because of the things that Frank Underwood did over five seasons so\nTo show has moved on except that it's still very much in Frank's world and it's about Claire trying to figure out how she can govern how compromise she is and whether she has any power even though she finds herself in the most powerful office in the world\nWe know how the Connors got rid of Roseanne how did house of cards get rid of Frank Underwood\n[laughter] um and things are being unfolded that is the easiest way to put it is not under clear circumstances and there are various different versions of the truth and the show was very hung up on treating certain things as\nMysterious and I don't even know that I could actually\nTell you and then there are a lot of the things that were left in the aftermath of things sprang did at the end of last season that are important and then there are new plot lines so the seasons big mane new thrust is\nInvolving the idea of American oligarchs a the idea of the families with vast business interests who are moving from media in the industry and beginning to shape politics in ways that would scare ordinary people and so the representatives of that family include\nNewcomers Greg Kinnear and Diane Lane who are both very very good\nWhen house of cards first came out in two thousand and Thirteen it really did establish Netflix as a new home for original programming even though you have not been a fan of house of cards for a long time is it worth people coming back\nIf he were curious I think that the show is\nA much stronger show and has a good deal more to say that it\nDid in recent seasons and I I think you can\nYou can see a show where the writers are interested in what they're doing for the first time in a couple of years and and as you say the the legacy of the show goes so far beyond whether it's actually a good show or a bad show and how many years that had actually been a good show or a bad show the legacy of the show and how it\nChanged the TV landscape and meet the streamers into basically the powerhouse that they now become ... it is a hall of fame show regardless of its quality because it is so important to what the industry has become that I think\nSeeing it off on its own terms there's a lot of validity to that\nDaniel find burn a TV critic for the Hollywood Reporter Daniel as always a pleasure to have you on
