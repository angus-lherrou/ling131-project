{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "[noise] um yeah you you know yes I mean magic has definitely has a plan as to what we're doing you know when when magic came in and took over basketball operations\nWhat I felt was and why I had to make the change from our existing general manager and my brother Jim who oversaw basketball was that there was no identity of Laker basketball\nThey're really interesting 'cause liquor basketball's like a brand name\nExactly and and you can't establish anything when you're changing coaches every eight months so we've had three coaches and three years\nYou know and each one a great coach in themselves but you can't change your roster overnight and so everything was not matched up right and we were struggling with no identity\nSo this goes to something which are marketplace of all the time you were in uncertainty and and and not only does regular business ... show through those the sports business in sports teams and the woman running loose sports team right uncertainty was going\nIt was killing the brand and it was you know when my father passed away than commissioner David Stern called me and he said\nJeannie don't let the team fail like don't let go do run into the ground who said oh yeah oh my God like\nIt it would break your dad's heart and so you know and it was difficult because I wasn't in charge of basketball my brother was and I ask him how long is it going to take you to\nGet the team on track and he gave himself a timeline which\nAs as time went on and I realized it wasn't going to happen and that's why I had to make the change that I did but I you know I took that to heart and I wouldn't I wouldn't let this you know my dad had six kids and I think the Lakers were his favorite cat [laughter]\nPeople ask me\nAs a a word here about your family right I mean you talked about your dad you and your brother who worked with and then and then had to replace\nYou talk a lot you talked about it in your book you've talked about it in interviews about how this is a family business show those first couple of years when the commercial lead culture and says don't blow it with a family business and then you have to file your brother what's that was\nIt was very very difficult um you know my dad kind of set it up for us but ultimately he gave me the authority and the power\nTo make any changes that I saw a necessary one of the key components of that decision making process was a conversation I had with Kobe Bryant he said what a player\nSample or an hour and a single sentence like I was hoping you could go out to act is the way that most salary negotiation scout know PowerPoints involved you make the request and then he stopped talking that that\nEnsure you might be asked to explain why you think the job of your work justifies nor the should be prepared to answer that that that means a few sentences not a whole presentation\nAnd there's no need for hard sell tactics are sneaky tricks you can treat that's like any other business conversation frankly it's not that different from asking to attend a professional training or to purchase a piece of software to helping your work\nIt certainly feels more emotionally charged we're talking about your monetary worth after all and that's your personal but it doesn't need to be\nHere is hoping that more hassle push past our fears of asking for money and just ask there's a lot more money coming our collective way if we do\nThis is Alison green for the b._b._c. world factor [noise]\nVery our own dangerous territory here but do storm straight at Raj you have you um have you ever ask for more money or I have a wasn't really a\nFairly for more importantly I think a out some experience is totally true in the U.S uh in several jobs I've had people both men and women are increasingly come and say we think we're much more there is a risk for network of how much people make in the pro those numbers have to you\nAnd in some cases in digital newsrooms for example in the U.S there or allow unions and unions make pays a lot more close friends so there's a little bit more sharing more of that so I absolutely agree with all of them I think asking\nIs always a good strategy I worked for you that's that's the key point in the ... not as much as I Would like All right okay I'm Sorry but now you're a mom I guess shoes aren't sure you must have off for more\nMoney on on occasion well I have I mean this is very interesting or you know my daughter just graduated from university and she just started first job and you know she and I talked about well you should be asking for in terms of SALT I mean the first thing to say I'm\nOn your on your correspondent was actually buying all the money or don't be afraid to us but also learn stuff because there's an awful lot of stuff out there\nFor example is very easy to find on line ... graduates on average in particular industries and find out what that is educate yourself and don't be afraid to ask for it\nUm there is evidence of course the women are less comfortable with asserting themselves the men\nUm uninfected or you know I Know at least one psychologist you runs courses in helping senior women be more aggressive in terms of what they all school I'm a ... ... if you're on but facts and if they want you they'll pay you ... they ...\nI think it was the second thing which comes out of well I just heard which is when you're in a job and you've ... you deal don't start comparing what you're running with other people that would just make you miserable Don Ross about it right from the ... you can and then get them and then leave it leave\nIt but it was very interesting stuff not not regime I mean have you been off her people come to you too off for a pay rise in the polls\nIt's happening a lot more ah Roger in mostly with young people are and the interesting thing is the idea of an annual raise which used to be very conventional does not apply actually I've had people coming out to be raised as a you know the times and the year are you saying that I'm doing more or seeing\nMy peers and other news organizations are getting paid more\nOr I just think that I Need more money and do you in reply I mean do you just consider their value to use that value to the company or do you say well yes fair enough someone else is getting paid that you should be paid that as well [noise]\nI think it's a combination of the value of that person brings but often times you really don't want the conversion to be only about money because the end of the day if that's the game you're playing somebody with all this coming off a little bit more and you'll lose that both young\nSo the framing has to be we will pay you but here all the other things that you're getting and he is like a progression in your carrier so good managers I didn't know how to balance the ask and then make sure that it's not just ... I can hear Simon ... coming in the background you you can cover that what\nYou can but but but but but I you know when I'm fully people actually make it a condition of employment that they're not allowed to disclose their salary or any of the new one to anyone else within the organization because you get situations with whatever reason you have to pay somebody more it becomes public knowledge someone comes into your office and says you know ... you don't want\nNothing is as a device if his pay that's for sure and I'm not even gonna ask any of the eyes of you or anyone else for that pay 'em 'cause they're just miserable anyway that said from business matters my ... my thanks to Simon ... listening you get paid for it I'm afraid about I [noise]\n\nYou're listening to the b._b._c.

of them puffing through have they have [noise]\nWelcome to the frame I'm John horn thanks for joining us there is a long tradition of musicians lending their voices to politicians in political causes\nBruce Springsteen and Jay Z for example were among those who performed on behalf of President Obama and when Donald Trump was inaugurated the musical guests included Toby Keith and Lee Greenwood\nBut what happens when a candidate or elected officials play list includes artist who don't want their names associated with a person\nEarlier this week Trump played for el Williams hit song happy at a future farmers of America convention in Indianapolis lawyers for the ... or send Trump a letter saying in part for el has not and will not grant you permission to publicly perform or otherwise broadcast or disseminate any of his music\nMany other musicians have objected to Trump's musical selections but can they really block is using their music that's with so many questions about copyright law it depends to sort out some of the legal issues we talked with students eager she's a veteran intellectual property lawyer who teach\nUC Irvine and I asked her how ... can play an artist song without asking them and whether it depends on where it's used\nIt totally depends where the song is used and if it's used in a place that has a lot of public events like a\nA sports stadium or convention center and even restaurants they buy blanket licenses that their renewed every year and the money is sort of divvied up among other musicians who are members of the musicians organization and the money is set out to the musicians afterwards so it's a blanket license for many many songs\nSo let's talk about some of the legal issues that are involved here there is something called the right of publicity I Believe that protects the image of the artist but not necessarily his or her song what is the right of publicity and how does that factor into these conversations\nWell the right of publicity is a very crazy law that it's different in every state there is no federal law for copyright laws federal and so it does apply equally in every state and it basically protects the right of people to stop others from using their name likeness her voice for commercial gangs\nAnd then what is the ... 'cause it seems to be somewhat similar which is the on authorized the use of a trademark but is that for the band or the artist and not the song\nWell artist can have trademark writes in their individual names if it's associated with their work and they have a body of work\nSo yes they could sue under the trademark act that Lana mapped\nArtist can sue for someone using their name or their songs and claim that it's an implied endorsement that by by Trump playing an artist song maybe is a theme song that that implies that that artists supports Trump and they could see one claim that violates their\nTheir trademark writes in their name\nSo before we talked about Trump I'm going to talk about Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker I Want to play a performance of the song I'm shipping up to Boston by the band drop kick Murphy's that Walker used at a rally\nAfter he use the song the band tweeted at Scott Walker please stop using our music in any way we literally hate you love drop kick Murphy [noise]\nNot sure that's going to motivate me to go out and vote but this is the idea of falls in door Smith which implies that an artist has supported or endorsed a product for a candidate do they have any claim if governor\nWalker is using this at a public setting as opposed to a commercial\nWell I think they're it hasn't\nReally been decided by court I think some artists have made that argument and the cases have settled so it's unclear but it's it's a better argument than a copyright infringement argument because of the blanket license that are usually issued two public venues\nSo now I Want to listen to a song that Donald Trump used at a rally just a couple of days ago oddly the very same day that eleven people were killed in a Pittsburgh synagogues\nSo for our Williams who song that is sent from a cease and desist letter for using that song at a political rally and he cited copyright infringement in violation of the ... act does he have much of a claim against Trump if Trump had a public performance license\nWell looks like according to the Hollywood Reporter that they did not obtain a license that a frail Williams he's part of an different artists organization and did not have any blanket license with that venue and supposedly the Trump campaign did not get a individual license either so he may have a claim\nI'm going to ask you about commercials now in two thousand and ten Charlie Crist was running for Senate in Florida against Marco Rubio and it used to talking heads song by David Byrne called the road to nowhere\nIn and attack commercial burn sued and Chris had to issue an apology which he recorded on video and in it you're just going to hear it but Charlie Crist looks like a hostage in a prison camp reading a letter here's what he said\nI Do not support new I ... or do I couldn't do any actions taken by anyone involved in the Senate campaign that were inconsistent with David Byrnes writes\nI suspect that was part of a settlement of a lawsuit why is it important to in order to get that kind of apology and is that kind of settlement language essential sometimes to people who feel their songs have been misused\nWell I think for artists to don't want to be associated with a certain democratic or Republican Party or Canada eight day it's important for the public record to reflect that they were not a part of this they were not consulted so I think it's trying to uh set the record straight that they are not in any way endorsing that candidate\nWhy do you think so many politicians are using music right now what does it give a candidate or an elected official I think of like\nMajor league baseball players who have a song Pete up before they bat you know each one has their own song and that sort of their signature and who they are and it says something about them so I think it's another way than parting message about who they are and what they stand for and that music is just super stimulating in gets everyone excited\nSusan Seager
