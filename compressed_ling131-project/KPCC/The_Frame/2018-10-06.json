the way you see that justice can be nearly impossible\nWhen we talk about fixing our criminal justice system and things like sentencing reform or police brutality that get the most visibility but there is a powerful player in the system that gets very little attention\n... officers themselves are basically impenetrable black boxes the district attorney is somewhat of the conductor of the\n... this is politics with Amy Walter on the take away on today's show look at the grassroots movement to elect reform minded district attorneys our\nGoal really is to\nStart breaking up\nThe way the system acts at least from the district attorney's office the take away we'll be right back after these headlines [noise]\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Janine hurts Republican Senator Susan Collins and Senator Joe Manchin a Democrat running for reelection in Republican leaning West Virginia\nBut the state is much harder conversation about how do we change that will be punished violent\nAnd that harder conversation about how we punish violence it's inherently political [noise]\nWe're the only country in the world that Alexis prosecutors and so these officials living constant fear of what we call the Willie Horton effect right that if you do something the harsh and just once it goes wrong you're going to take huge political hit for it\nDukakis not only opposes the death penalty he allowed first degree murderers to have weekend passes from prison one was Willie Horton who murdered a boy in a robbery stabbing him Nineteen times\nAnd so it's just the for to be tougher because the risks are lower\nIf you were recommendation that if we're going to change the way we look at punishing people who commit violence we have to change the way we put prosecutors into office I II and they can't have the political pressure that they have to go in front of voters every two or four years\nThat's certainly one possibility is is to relieve prosecutors that kind of constant political pressure another possibility is to elect prosecutors too because the whole ... of them are more sensitive to the costs of being harsh you know you see this in Philadelphia for example like sugar crowding her\nAs a result crossing your one he's probably the most progressive prosecuting country right now\nBecause he was able to mobilize the communities that these are the most intense of policing\nAnd for them to publish a little bit different because yes they're concerned about the crime and the mistakes\nBut they also know the people who are in prison right it's their friends their father their brother uncle right so so they're much more sensitive to the the cost overruns horsemen and therefore I think\nTo get smarter view on sort of how to balance the cost of harm from prime ... from over punishment you know in general prosecutor's elected by the county and counties have you shoot served suburban belts them they don't really express much crime\nAnd so for them sort of abstract issue but they have tremendous political power it's where the wealth you're white or conservative suburbs have tremendous political voting power\nAnd so people who are unaffected by force being the ticket prosecutor could enforce the law and people that they just don't know it and don't care about and he can mobilize voters who actually experience both the benefits and the cost of aggressive force that you'll get prosecutors who take both into account okay\nThat sounds nice but what's the reality\nThere's almost nothing that regulates their their discretion other than politics I just if they want to drop a charge completely even the first is unambiguously guilty they're free to do that\nPlease operator all sorts of rules the the course operator rules but the prosecutors oftentimes don't approaches are the most amount of discretion has sort of the least amount of oversight\nAnd do we know anything about how prosecutors have used that discretion\nWe don't of all the branches of the criminal justice system the prosecutors provide the least amount of data basically not the officers themselves are basically impenetrable black boxes we have no idea\nWhat they're doing why they're doing it how they're doing what's motivating them to do it it it it's almost completely unknown to curb it we have almost I think I Know\n[noise]\nSo what happens if you get caught up in that black box\nName is Richard miles and I'm One of the Dallas exonerees I was wrongfully incarcerated at the age of Nineteen centuries to sixty years for murder and attempted murder I spent a total of Fifteen Years in prison for a crime to either not too long\nOr two people in Dallas was shot while sitting in their car one\nDied one survived\nRichard miles was nearby using a pay phone when he was picked up by police and brought to the crime scene as a suspect in the murder\nEvery day that I had aspired to do I'm going to school getting ready to go to plastic surgeon or in College of all of those type of things\nIt ceased to exist because I was no longer my own individual how I became a commodity let's just say ooh\nRichard the fault in that lives in the da's office kids go but tore evidence was never given to the defense and the prosecutor instructed a witness to point to miles when he was asked to identify the killer\nA lot of people don't really think about the road because\nIt seems to sit so far away from the actual everyday processes of the court systems you only hear about prosecutors ... lawyers now hindsight tells me that the district attorney is somewhat of the conductor of the orchestra\nYou have all these different sections and together they make music in my particular case\nI Believe that the prosecutor was just hell bent on getting the prosecution prosecutors are promoted based up on the amount of cases that they ... not on the amount of cases that they lose as it is a priority\nFor the prosecutor to win\nAnd then when they understand that the laws are set up in their favor to win that's how they do\nAnd while they were winning Richards life was put on hold\nThe prison system itself is a whole different culture it's a whole different experience it totally disconnects and individual from society from technology from interactions with family and so going in at the age of Nineteen\nAnd getting out at the age of thirty for those are some like the very developmental and and form a new stages of an individual and when you grow up in a oh pressed environment that doesn't do anything but stagnate a person's growth moving forward\nIt wasn't only Richard who suffered his family did too\nAs far as my family was concerned my mom and dad my immediate family knew I was innocent they stayed with me for Fifteen Years my dad passed six months before I got out he had a fight with cancer um and so I'll never be able to establish a a relationship with my dad\nBecause of the physical separation that the prison system places within the family Nicholas within the family\nStructure when he was released Richard Move back in with his mother eventually he found a job and enrolled in school it took two and a half years before he was finally exonerated Richard also had the vision of justice for the future particularly in the upcoming ... in Dallas County\nJustice is not just a conviction is also the opportunity to vindicate and I believe that the da's office needs to embrace the four definition of what justice ears\nWere trying to be a community relations grass roots with police officers and citizens and nobody's really interacting with the da's office to create community relationships top down um and so that's what I Would really like\nFor this da to do whether it's a newly elected the or whether the da ... this term\nIs to really take the role seriously and know that we are dealing with humans on both sides of the equation and how can we move forward keeping that humanity aspect upfront\nRichard miles is one
