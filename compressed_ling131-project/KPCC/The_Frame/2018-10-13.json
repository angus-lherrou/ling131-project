I mean within the deal\nThere is a new deadline that will expose I think the fault lines between America's closest allies in Europe and the United states on this issue coming up right before the election on November fourth that's when the automatic\nVery serious sanctions against anyone doing business with Iran are supposed to kick back in a and so basically there is a big lobbying campaign right now pressure campaign to get European countries to pull out of doing business with Iran as a consequence of this\nEuropean talking tough but it doesn't really have the infrastructure set up a to protect them from the effects of us sanctions so they are largely expected\nTo comply with this move on Trump's part however the absence of a ... that was the you know you're chronic acronym for the Iran deal the absence of that does not mean the existence of a proactive new strategy and so you know it's really hard to say\nOne part of the world that he did say he was going to help fix was the middle east are going to fix that whole problem that nobody else could fix Israel Palestinian\nChallenge look or you know if it's fair to say that you can paint a lot of things on Donald Trump but dysfunction in the middle east [laughter] ah the bottom line is of course that you know the the\n... of the region and the terrible situation uh predates him and in fact he was welcomed by leaders there\nReally with open arms among traditional us allies in the Gulf and in Israel\nWho really didn't like bronco Obama's policies if you didn't get along very well with the men\nAre and who saw in Trump either opportunistic early or genuinely someone who they could get along better with who would have a more similar world view to there so this was in one region in particular where American allies and the leaders of those countries saw a real opportunity to reset\nI Would say the action has been much less dramatic ah in terms of concrete changes in the region than you might expect as a result of that uh and you start to see some of the consequences of that no kicking in for example in Saudi Arabia\nA Trump and his son in law Jared Kushner really not only renewed the traditional American partnership with the Saudis but doubled down on it in a dramatic way\nA Jared Kushner seem to believe that it would help a deliver Middle East peace so far that has not been forthcoming between Israel and the Palestinians quite the opposite uh by over investing in young Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman he seems to have been overruled on the issue of\nIsrael and the Palestinians number one number two there is now the question of whether he is turn the country into a much more virulent form of dictatorship and of course everyone is concerned now about the fate of the American\nLiving journalist Jamal crush hoagie and wondering whether Trump's embrace of the current Saudi crown prince has in fact enabled are created a situation where that was impossible by this coast American ally\nIn Europe candidate Trump bemoan what he saw as an unfair NATO alliance\nWhat I'm saying is actually is obsolete extremely stretch of the United states there's surely show and\nWe should we are just\nIt's not fair to say that as Trump has claimed that he's gotten European eyes to pay billions more for defense in that you know no one cared about this before he\nIt or you know that we they were ripping us off or not living up to their obligations 'cause he he's missed characterized almost every aspect of this however if you wanted to really great on a curb your you definitely can say that the threats or the bullying or the blustering or however you want to characterize it have produced\nA new awareness in Europe that they ought to ante up more for their common defense in NATO then they felt pressure to do in the past\nAnd when it came to dealing with Kim Jong on Trump said it'd be nice to get along\nAnd they said would you speak to the leader of North Korea I said absolutely what us why are they come up\nTo her\nOffspring anybody [noise]\nThere's a ... or ... percent yes [noise] that I can\nOf those them know what I\nWatch them you know those are\nCertainly you could argue that he is engaged and has opened up a process of meaningful talks negotiations and dialogues with with the north Koreans again not to overstate it but I think it's it you can definitely say that something that existed now that didn't exist in the past and on Russia\nI don't know who he said nice things about me if we got along well that would be good if Russia and the United states got along well and went after ISIS that would be good\nI Would say that the Trump Administration policy toward Russia is actually\nA more hawkish or muscular\nContinuation of the second term post twenty fourteen Obama administration policy toward Russia I eat after Russia invaded uh its neighbor you crave\nA illegally annexed Crimea and uh has generally had a much more aggressive\nForeign policy outside its borders we've responded with sanctions by increasing the military presence of NATO troops including American troops in Eastern Europe and in those countries that border\nRussia and a increasing pressure in every way on Russia isolating it this is essentially the policy view and it is largely uncontroversial right more or less supported by Republicans and\nDemocrats at least among elected officials\nThen there's Trump's\nPersonal predilection an admiration for like ... there's also\nHe's repeated efforts to challenge his own security bureaucracy to do things like experiment with lifting sanctions often you hear people inside his administration take credit for well we've had even more tougher sanctions I've heard this from many of them\nWhich carefully ally the fact that in twenty Seventeen because they were concerned about Trump's stated preference for even considering lifting those sanctions were trading them away to root for something\nCongress actually took a very unique vote\nTo review can constrain the president and the Senate voted Ninety eight to ... to to legislate those sanctions into he couldn't just wave at hand and withdraw them and then to impose more sanctions and Trump even then wanted not to sign them but of course and I need to do is a pretty veto proof\nMajority so he was persuaded to sinus infections\nSo how much of his rhetoric weather as candidate or as president has been translated into policy and how different is the policy that's been implemented by the Trump Administration differ from the rhetoric\nWell this is I think that the biggest challenge are you still hear from many inside the Trump administration's foreign policy world essentially versions of do pay attention to the treats pay attention to the policy\nA term McMaster used to tell people that well what happened to him he got fired\nRex Tillerson used to say well I don't even pay attention to the treats the guy got fired by read so that got the world's attention and in my view you know that's not a realistic thing anytime your analysis of foreign policy is essentially don't pay attention to the unvarnished thoughts of the most powerful men in the world\nYou're probably going to make some huge analytical mistakes and I think that you know Trump again has been fairly consistent in certain areas of expressing preferences that are then translated policy if you didn't think he was going to withdraw from the Iran deal as some serious foreign policy people thought or\nConvince themselves you were
