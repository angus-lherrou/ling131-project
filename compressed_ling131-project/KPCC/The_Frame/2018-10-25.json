Elizabeth Peabody house from reading preschoolers to making sure a troublesome roof is holding up on a rainy day that's why [noise]\nWater damage all they're\nEven more important keeping certified early childhood caregivers on staff in Massachusetts about thirty percent of employees in this industry leave their jobs every year mostly because of pay which\nIs only about fourteen dollars an hour on average in the state but Melania sorrow who works with preschoolers at the Elizabeth ... says hey isn't the only thing that matters I feel like I'm In this for the long haul\nSorrow has been caring for children at this day care for four years so I mean it's hard but again it's very rewarding to see them take what you you teach them this daycare runs on tight margins and roll down says it's hard to stay competitive with pay\nWe you know barely make it so anything that could help us in the expenses side of things it's really helpful\nOfficials in Massachusetts are hoping a new pilot program could help roll down squeeze a little more room into our budget by making the supplies and services she needs like a recent roof repair a little more affordable than India Bala as with the United way of Massachusetts Bay the organization coordinating the effort\nWe created a model where they could share practices information and even things like back office operations\nParticipating daycare centers get access to a website where they can find discounted rate for everything from office supplies to accounting services basically the program treats the Elizabeth Peabody house and eleven other daycare providers like one big purchasing group that means more business for participating vendors\nFor almost a year in and we will continue to grow and expand that\nWe shared services model is still in the pilots stage in Massachusetts but in neighboring New Hampshire these purchasing groups are now common with more than two hundred participating providers it costs the state about a half a million dollars a year to run the program it saves daycare providers five to ten thousand dollars a year\nAnd ... says most have been using that money to invest in their workers\nThey are using them um to stabilize salary is to be able to provide raise is offering them discounts in savings\nPaying workers so they stay on longer saves money on hiring and training Marcy white book because with the center for the study of childcare employment at the University of California Berkeley she says daycares nationwide or trying everything from housing stipends to tuition reimbursement to retain staff\nThe strategy have been fella button was a hole in the bottom of it but we haven't really restructured have these programs work\nSince the childcare sector is mostly private keeping fees competitive doesn't leave much room for increasing worker pay which is problematic because someone with similar credentials can make about twice as much working in a public school\nYou really do need to figure out how to transform the way we finance this\nFor now these shared services programs offer daycare centers one way to make every dollar go a little farther in Somerville, Massachusetts I'm

I wanted to play that because it's sort of sets it it sort of frames nicely what what we've all been talking about here if you want it to jump in before I did that I\nDid I mean I just wanted to add since we're we're you know we're all a little bit behind here we are talking to each other and trying not to look at TV or anything else but I did get the tweet a and apparently the the president added to his warm you know calm words\nThe media also has a responsibility to set a civil tone and stop endless hostility and to me\nMean the media did not bring this on CNN did not bring this on itself so that\nAgain and he kind of walk it back when I had a gay and he's putting a target back on a on a ... he is very ... very conscious very\nConsciously it's another both on the side or ism but it is completely\nImmoral and you know we shouldn't expect any better but we've also got a call it out of that is just outrageous\nSee I Am I'm I'm One of those people who has or I I've watched the president\nAnd I've ... I've grown accustomed to the rhythm that is President Trump and that is something happens he says the right words and then I click a stopwatch to wait for the longest and paid for him to defy the scripted words\nAnd believe in Charlotte you don't have the right thing for a while\nAnd so and so here we are and that sort of leads to the question that I was the next question I was going to ask which is what is the ... what is the rest of his responsibility I was going to ask that Joan before you read that way before you read that sweet I'm\nThe president saying it's our responsibility but is it the president's responsibility\nHere or our responsibility to tell the truth and by and large we do\nAnd what he could you know considers and demeaned as fake news\nTends to be accurate news he\nHas gone on a spray of lies in the last week or so I mean we really we I Can't believe it but the old the old Trump or with a little more mellow\nAnd valleys that we have a neutron who is you know Ninety percent more racist and men dishes Charlie struggling so I like that uh you know he's ready for the midterms and he's bringing in white nationalism\nAnd so he keeps escalating and to suggest that perhaps we brought this on ourselves because\nOf our endless hostility is just complete BS\nAnd we've got to look at if I Want your Charlie um you get in and then April I'll give you the last words\nJust wanted to follow up on this you know I I obviously we we need to focus on Donald Trump but it but I also think we need to focus on what he has done to the political culture and the influence that he's had on his supporters who he has convince a to demonize end to end to single out the political opponents in regard them as enemies\nI'm looking at pictures out of Florida where people are showing up at the wrong to Sanders rally talking about you know fake news fake bombs if you want to get an indication of how we bizarre our politics has become\nYou mentioned this before but the number of right wing websites including people like Rush Limbaugh we're basically saying this is not real we shouldn't take it seriously and what that means for our ability to confront the threat\nThat we uh ... that we're facing right now it's a it's an extraordinary time and Donald Trump is a symptom of this but but keep an eye on on the we influence he is having on people out there and April\n[noise] I just I it was unbelievable and kind of going back with Joan said I'm this president has turned up\nOver the last couple of weeks because the elections that are happening in a in a in a few\nDays a week ago um it it doesn't you know he's he's momentum now for his Republicans as democratic tidal wave or whatever's nominees folks happen or some kind of way but the bottom line is we're actually not that he is out of desperation for women\nAnd their collateral damage\nThan we're seeing it and when do we say when when does it stop and this president has got to know you know he may not like that because we report things we don't shake\nThe fact we get all sides of the story and and how what's going on he said it blue and orange we're going to call it on to get it there but he doesn't like that\nSo but we're faking it now where it's hard to ... ... it's not okay it's not okay at all\nThat my prayer he uses it will change the parts that we continue that are in the white hope for better day I'm home I Believe in this country I Believe it I found it ...

with a segment on Megan Kelly today about Halloween costumes\nAnd you'll get in trouble if you are a white person or black or white like that that was okay as long as you address character\nKelly's remarks drew widespread condemnation and yesterday she apologized on air but today there was no new episode of her show and they repeat was run instead the former Fox News star came to NBC with a three year sixty nine million dollar make a deal\nBetter ratings were never very good and now it seems that all maybe coming to an end\nBrian Steinberg has been following this story for a variety when we spoke I asked him about the big bad that NBC made on Megan Kelly a little over a year ago\nI think at the time they saw a viewership that had been energized with Republicans in the White House and Congress\nAnd felt that indicates that Fox News attitude into his ... and it can be a valuable thing you they have the same time they also make us Australian anger over at MSNBC so there was goes which fraction of what this type of heart is in line up programming\nOne of the things that I think is interesting is that from the very beginning making Kelly had a tough time and there was a confrontational interview with Jane Fonda how has she done up to this week how had the ratings then and how would she perceived both within NBC and by viewers generally\nWell generally speaking the show is not pulling the viewership that it did when Cameron hall and our broker we're doing and I caught our of today is about four hundred thousand years that is cause for concern especially when you're up against us syndicated program at ABC with ... and Brian seek rest um I think within the network my understanding\nIs that both sides are going to ask credit for the call died the word that I got for someone with each other I think the show is trying to scramble on and find new format has new ideas clearly Megan Kelly wanted to break news and explore hot hot button issues and the today show well does that\nAnd also the news the broad based program that that you know aims for everybody and I think sometimes you know she got a little too close to bone examining meat you issue to NBC and things like that perhaps\nDid not um a make the is there overjoyed\nI guess you could make the argument you can take the personality out of Fox News but maybe you can't take the Fox news out of the personality\nDid NBC know what it was getting into because making Kelly certainly has a history of making inflammatory comments not only about race but also about gender about sexual assault about contraception about black lives matter\nThere is a whole history there did they know what they were doing when they hired her so should this have been much of a surprise to the network\nI was surprised that they they put her into two shows very quickly I was surprised they didn't you know spend more time having her from the audience is like falling you know long reports filling us Lester Holt filling in for dateline I'm appearing on the today show with with with me for reporting\nAnd I was surprised they spend more time developing her story telling muscle rather than her her partisan muscles\nI think there are a lot of people who found her comments about black face completely indefensible but among those people were people who works at NBC and we're very prominent on air including people like al ... or\nHow important was it that people on the air at NBC said that making Kelly's apology didn't go far enough\nThat tells me to decide as fast as a root for some time\nUh that that that her fellow colleagues would go on nightly news and on the today show and spend a five minute segment discussing this issue and how wasn't sufficient that's just to me that that she had not integrated herself that well with NBC News and I think she's long you know taken pride and kind of\nHaving her own persona cultivating her own\nUh you know swath of of of of popularity and people bought her for a certain reason she she knew stood up Donald Trump she spoke her mind Fox News on both sides of the issues take I public is an Democrats you know she doesn't mince words just taken a you know what from from interviewees that was kind of her her boyfriend\nAnd I don't buy the same time I'm not sure it blended well with the rest of the people and the news is a place of working reporter is not of a you know on air con time personality is needed MSNBC\nI Would argue that Rachel Maddow while reporting on her own so I I don't know that at jail right away it probably never got a chance to do so\nIt feels very much like NBC is scrambling and I think that's evidenced by what happened this morning where rather than get a substitute host they re ran a friday show from the past with Megan Kelly in fact she started the show saying like Happy Friday on a Thursday\nIs it your sense of the network is really trying to figure out as quickly as possible what it can do with the situation\nHere that are trying to take the show so badly that you can't come back because ... during morning news time as is death there's no reason for an original content and then at that time of the day people want fresh content there's news out there there's comedy on the issues of the day so I Wonder if perhaps they're trying to do is just seem to show wiring repeats they have no relevance right now\nOne of the other issues for NBC is it already has had to dismiss Matt Lauer over what he is alleged to have done in terms of sexual assault and sexual misconduct\nIf you take Megan Kelly with that and not just the money but kind of the public embarrassment where does this leave NBC after all of this is said and done\nWell it's a big big bad to begin with morning TV is is not an easy place to succeed look at a Anderson Cooper or members of the air Katie Couric all had daytime morning shows that that lasts about two years or so before going off the air um it is not an easy place this is a big swing with a lot of money spent on it\nUm I'm not sure I think they got they had a big hit it big anger they know the idea of the big anger and when you don't have both those elements that could be a recipe for failure\nWhy was this the breaking point why was she and the network apparently unable to weather this controversy well\nYou know when you make getting that kind of topic on broad base broadcast morning television\nAnd you can kind of control you know how far you go I think it's just a lack of awareness of audience you know this this is a broad base morning program it's not Fox News if people who are home watching looking for you know help the tips are injured human interest I think the topics uh abroad a veteran broadcaster would not go into\nBrian Steinberg of the senior TV editor at variety Brian thanks so much for coming back on the show\nThanks a lot John good talking to you\n[noise] coming up it is an easy telling a story about gentrification making a video

us gentrification on the east side of Los Angeles has been a hot topic of conversation for local residents artists writers and activists for some time now\nEspecially in recent years with neighborhoods like Boyle Heights and highland park experiencing an influx of high end coffee shops yoga studios and price the apartment complex as\nThe conversation suddenly made it onto an unlikely platform in the form of a video game called doughnut county it was recently released by ... interactive\nDon't be fooled by it's obvious cuteness even though it's fun to play donut county offers a deeper social commentary than the visuals might lead you to believe when we spoke with a game designer band as a veto he explained how it all works\nThe play as a hole in the ground and you start small and you get bigger that's the basic concept of it but beyond that I was trying to ask or answer the question of like why is it a whole and so uh that story kind of shaped around this\nVersion of LA called doughnut county where you're playing as a you know new tech gender fire who moved in there a bunch of raccoons who have this app that lets them open up whole to steal people's trash\nIf you're a little bit convoluted but uh the idea is that they're kind of displacing every one and done accounting stealing their trash and then putting new raccoon if I'd ever tech versions of everything down\nSo how did Los Angeles and gentrification become part of the design and the look of donor county\nIt started with just the whole and it took a while to kind of took a couple of iterations to land on what I really want to talk about but I think um well I Love Los Angeles and uh I moved here in ...", "show_name": "The Frame", "year": "2018", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "25"}
