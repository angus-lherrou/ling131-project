terrorists on solar panels and dishwashers from China and other countries to be sure and then it was steel and aluminum also China and other countries\nNow those thanks to the Trump administration's focus on Beijing is taxing fully half of everything that we buy from China all of that has led to retaliate George Harrison China and other countries on our exports agriculture mostly\nBowl thing happens so fast you might reasonably conclude we could get out of it just as fast but as marketplaces song reports game theory suggests otherwise\nGame theory is the way scientists and mathematicians think about human behavior in interaction which should I Do based on what you do should I trust you and what do I do if you break that trust\nBefore this trade war the U.S and China had some trust both were members of a free trade club known as the world Trade Organization and then trust broke down trade professor Jennifer Hillman at Georgetown Law says a decade ago Beijing begin requiring U.S companies there to hand over their secrets\nThey're forced technology transfer violates the commitments China made when it joined the WTO that its level of IP theft is a violation of the intellectual property provisions\nWashington meanwhile broke trust by taxing Chinese imports this year\nUnder the WTO rules the United states is not allowed to unilaterally just ratchet up the tariffs on China\nGame theory suggest a couple of things one is it's hard to establish trust when it's broken into a trade war is actually a rational thing for countries to do it in their self interest here's how\nAnd why you business process I ruined sooner origin says the U.S interest is to tax Chinese imports whether Beijing responds or not either way Washington makes money\nThat China and poses to address the US's best responses to see whether we're going to tax the all important as well as China doesn't them the best response to the U.S is also to say well you know they're not doing anything let me sort of collect from them\nNow if you think game theory is just a theory you're\nTaking on Nobel economist John Nash he helped to develop this now enter the popular imagination in two thousand one when Russell Crowe played him in the movie a Beautiful Mind\nI guess that's the only way I'll never distinguish Marshall so in a way that\nHe came up with something called the national equilibrium which suggests that a trade war of self interest is actually the norm in that cooperation and free trade is the exception\nBoth countries imposing to address is the ... equilibrium of the game\nJust a neurosurgeon this means a trade war could go on a while as in ten years now game theory does allow for things to get shaken up but it takes something dramatic to disrupt things said political change\nCould be the election of a new president and the United states now that unfortunately has to be coupled with a similar willingness to negotiate on China's buck\nOr outside parties say other countries of the WTO could bring the U.S and China together and create space for trust says Jennifer Hillman at Georgetown Law they could say listen here's a new trade agreement that takes away tariffs provides new customers for your exports and outside third parties will be the free trade police\nDo it's giving a little bit of political cover to China to say we need to make these reforms in order to remain a member in good standing up the WTO we need to do these reforms\nAnd to provide political cover for D.C as well someone else made me do this but she agrees with sooner origin that a sudden outbreak of trust is not imminent and that this trade war as game theory suggests could go on\nA while I'm Scott tall for markets [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]

that charge about um a company that draws\nA grandfather or the one the grandfather died long before a candidate was even in the race and even the candidate has talked about his grandfather's past and

kind of the stereotype of being like a while the white suburban area with pretty name be based voters I'm highly rid of it\nIsn't you know like a progressive hero he needs to be registered Republican he left the party has started to feel more riots and things like immigration um and he's running a pretty centrist campaign but I think he I think he appeals to a lot of people in orange county um it's it's shaping up to be a lot closer than expected\nAnd and the issues animating that race or health care health care and business\nI'm Brian I Want to come back to the land of ten thousand lakes where the big story really is the attorney general's race and that's the race featuring\nI'm outgoing Congressman Keith Ellison you favor while he was favorites to win right Brian until the domestic abuse allegations against him by an ex girlfriend surface\nIt how much of an impact has that had on on the race and will it cost him the race\nIt's at a huge impact W just take for instance and we pulled this race in September\nAnd Wilson was up by five points we pulled it last week and he was down by seven ... so you have it a lot of trouble getting past this this racist largely about him his opponent is not very well known he is recognition is very low and so people are making their decision based on Keith Ellison\nA ... well what I Want to make one data point here\nThe last time a Republican won this office was Nineteen sixty six that was ... I was born with it's been\nA very long time and Republicans have feel like they've got a great shot fought mhm our poll showed one thing that that might give Keith also some hope\nThat there was plenty of undecided and one in five Democrats listed themselves is undecided in that race so for for them this might have been a wake up call that this is not a drill and they're really going to have to make a choice in two thousand has been this week trying to make that case bringing up\nThings about his opponent Doug war though and and how conservative e is telling people you might not like me but look at him you know I was going to ask\nYou about the the undecided but in relation to the the the run for governor but real quickly how much of the the Kavanaugh hearings on how much did that play into um\nThe ... the poll plummet for Keith Ellison well\nA lot of people use that to make the case that if you're going to hold him\n... a justice now justice Kevin are too high standard Democrat you better hope Keith Ellison too high standard and if you turn on the TV there's a lot of ads for other races for Congress for a you know these these competitive races where Keith Ellison his picture right next to the Democratic opponent so he he's a fixture in more than his own race\nI'm a real quickly in the in the governor's race will those that large percentage of of independence now the governors' races in is an open race because the incumbent governor Mark Dayton is not running for reelection and so you've got congressman Tim Walz and a Republican Hennepin County commissioner Jeff Johnson\nUm in in the in the past you get it from the past election results do you get a sense of where this big chunk of undecided voters might go I think it stands at twelve percent at least in one of the polls\n[noise] you know it's a great question and I wish I knew but but he you know this is a case where there is a Democrat running to succeed a two term Democrat that's never happened in Minnesota where the Democrat has won a the Democrats usually a C a quite a bit of a drop off in Minnesota in these midterm elections\nThis time they nominated Tim Walz who's a congressman from southern Minnesota and his had somewhat of a moderate record so\nThere is a really hoping that he can kind of carry some of those centrist voters who might lean a little bit right\nA Jeff Johnson has run a pretty standard Republican campaign he's echoing the president on some of these immigration topics and and uh cut government cut taxes and Tim Walz is has not really had to go negative on his opponent yet so he feels like he's in a good spot okay and\nAnd and and how long were you and I were talking about Montana a moment ago but you've done a lot of reporting in from Idaho where Medicaid expansion is on the ballot it's a ballot initiative Idaho is they ruby red state but what are the chances of the ballot initiative passing\nReally high and it's kind of unbelievable you know I grew up in Idaho and I watched it turned from a purple state into a great ride state\nAnd part of that and frightened redness has come from people moving in from California and other states with more fire right tendencies are more our ideologies\nWho and through election to the the state legislature I've really ensured that there was no way that Medicaid expansion was going to happen same for and the governor but you know in this campaign it's a grassroots campaign it's headed by and childhood friends from standpoint how a tiny town up north\nAnd they decided okay work to get it on the ballot we're just gonna you know go door to door it gets support not through a huge massively paid campaign but trying to talk to people about what they call the gaps so people can make\nToo much money on but not enough money to get the sort of health care that makes living in a sustainable life in Idaho possible\nAnd the polling on it similar to the polling on Medicaid expansion in Utah is pretty strong and and it seems very likely that'll pass\nAnd both and candidates for governor but a Republican who will almost certainly when and the Democrat has said that they would not fight that if that measure passed so it looks like it will become a reality after this election\nSo are the Republican so are Republicans running ads I'm a ... in Idaho saying we support this in the way that we're seeing in races around the country where Republicans are actively campaigning on say on health care and in particular I'm thinking of you know we will protect a pre existing conditions\nWhat you have some of the more moderate Republicans who have come out in support but very few I think that most people don't want to be and\nPacked into in future elections as someone who had gone on the record of supporting what is generally referred to still has a ... right and a lot of that than ... anti proposition to messaging has been this is Obamacare you are bringing socialism

P. C. C. [noise]\nWelcome to the frame I'm John horn thanks for joining us who decides the value of a work of art is the most expensive aren't necessarily the best are those are the core questions at the heart of the new documentary the price of everything directed by Nathaniel ... on\nA few weeks ago Congress showing his film in London and in another part of the city on that very same day this happened at an art auction [noise]\n\nThat's the sound of the painting girl with balloons by the street artist Banksy selling that option for one point four million dollars and then immediately beginning to self destruct thanks to remote controlled shredder that the artist installed in the paintings frame\nI began by asking the price of everything director Nathaniel Khan about that banks the episode\nOf course the moment immediately as well what happens you know what's happened as the art been destroyed is it you know what's going on here will the person who just bought it\nA fruit in fact she did she said yes I Want it\nBut it's also incredible commentary that banks he's making on the idea of value you know what what happens the work of art has just been sort of semi destroyed but it's actually worth more because of its threading its notoriety directly\nAnd um well for lots of reasons I mean it is actually let's be honest it is now a new work of art correct but he is making a commentary on the things that we deal with in our film which is the question of\nHow do we value works of art who's in charge who's making these decisions who says it's worth one point three million who says it's worth twice that now where does that come from\nThat actually turns out to be a very complex not\nAnd that sort of the knocked in many ways that we are attempting to at least if not untangle explore from many different sort of points of view angles in the film the price of everything\nLet's talk about a couple of the artist that you spend time with one of them is pretty familiar to a lot of people's Jeff Coons several of his words are on display in LA here at the British Museum\nIncluding the first one sculpture of Michael Jackson and a big blue stainless steel balloon dog why was Coons somebody that you thought was important to spend time with and get his perspectives on\nFor a lot of reasons I mean actually Jennifer it took me to meet Jeff one of the producers Jennifer Stockman took me to meet Jeff and she's known Jeff she was the Germans Guggenheim board for Fifteen Years so she knew many of the artist and many of the people who who are in the film she has intersected with them so that that's one thing I Want to say about a film like this the access is is crucial\nAnd I went up to him and I started I just said you know we're making this film and we would love for you to be in it\nBut also we started talking about Philadelphia which is where I'm from and he told a wonderful story which really captivated my imagination he said as a kid I said what you know what was it as a kid that really kind of move due to want to be an artist and he said it was actually in coming to Philadelphia he looked around the city and he saw that there was on the top of city hall\nA big statue a big sculpture of William Penn and it's a very large sculpture we all know it\nAnd it it ... it almost seems uh we used to make fun of it sometimes but also wherever you are in the city you see that sculpture it is it's it's sort of the symbol of Philadelphia\nI think he realized that through art and through sculpture sort of specifically one can have an enormous impact on you know on lots of people in the entire populace so I think that that that sort of sense that Jeff has\nOf of impact\nOf of really kind of a punch\nIs very it's very exciting and I mean obviously I I wanted to film and now there's also of course the fact that ... is so enormously financially successful\nSo he sort of represents you know as as an artist of today he's at the end you know in a certain for for a certain kind of way of looking at art\nHe is enormously successful wildly successful\nUm but he also his art is also I think reflecting the obsessions of our age with shiny things with a with surfaces with you know with reflections of ourselves\nIt's inevitable I think that some people will look at Jeff Coons and think that the tail is wagging the dog so to speak that he knows what sells and he knows how to sell it\nAnd then there's other artists like Larry ... who is not at all interested at least our late in the market that he is motivated by something I think is hard to define but it's certainly different\nMy top pictures were in that group of the sixties\nThat were recognized\nBut then all this success all the all this like saying this at the time finally began to look like saying as\nI said to a guy in the gallery man had a show like in the works I asked him what do you think I should do you know give me some advice and what he said to me he didn't mean but what it meant to me I'll tell you he said to me oh you don't have to worry about that you're ...\nAnd that repels me you see what I mean that that that to me man oh you mean I should just paint the same way I've been paying\nFinding Larry was really finding the film in making this film you know we began to edit it and I realized something fundamental is missing\nAnd that's a very scary moment for a filmmaker because you realize okay this is all interesting but what is going to hold it together what you know what's the threat so I began to ask you know people in the art world I said I'd like to find somebody who was once really hot in the art world\nAnd then maybe they fall falling off for for whatever reason they phone off and now they're kind of you know off the grid somewhere maybe upstate somewhere maybe kind of in a in an old farmhouse maybe with peeling paint you know I mean something like this and and but they've kept doing work\nAnd um and maybe they have a lot to say and they need to be sort of philosophical up and the person I was talking to stop stops that wait a minute I Know exactly who you're describing you're describing Larry bones\nSo he is indeed somebody who was picked up by the art world ... you know it was for his dot paintings in the sixties and then as he change as his style began to evolve\nThe markets said keep doing that thing it's working well it's certainly keep making does and he said no man I'm I'm a voting might my work is changing and ultimately he faced a choice you know do what you're told\nOr do what your soul tells you write and he chose his soul and he's continue to evolve and he's gone through many many different phases and always respected I Want to be clear this is not somebody who just dropped out he's an artist's artist facts I knew the moment I met him that we had a film\n[noise] coming up on the frame more with Nathaniel ... the director of the price of everything [noise]\n[noise] in most states the midterms are

frame I'm John horn thanks for joining us let's get back to my conversation with documentary filmmaker Nathaniel Khan about his new film the price of everything among the questions the film raises are these who really owns art and why has the market for art gone through the roof\nThe answers often can be found at art auctions here's art critic Jerry ... the film talking about them\nMake me sick [noise] only because\nWhat I'm doing in those ... rooms is saying goodbye to the rest of my life to every work of art I'm saying because all of it is now too expensive for any\nInstitution to buy some maybe the Getty and they can only buy one thing you hear I kind of wish that collectors would give back but I don't know that I Would give back so I'm gonna hang some apartments\nLondon or Shanghai Ernie or [noise]\nAnd I won't see it again for my natural life\nI think the idea the idea that there are private collectors my I I Can't judge that other uh because because you know great museums ultimately most of them are filled with works that were once part of private collect correct\nCorrect and that's a huge part of the equation that a Russian oligarch has probably able to pay a lot more for a pain in the LA County Museum of art well that even though the County Museum of art may at some point get a gift\nThat on the high end yeah that's a societal problem though which is way too much money is in the hands of way too few\nAnd they are now able to manipulate art the prices of art and use art as an investment instrument and that's what's happened so now that artist become an investment instruments yes they have price museums out of the market that's a problem with that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Frame", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "26"}
