mainstream media both are being criticized by politicians some politicians anyway and by the public to some degree as well\nBut journalism and Facebook have a weird symbiotic relationship to publishers need Facebook to get their content out Facebook needed that content to users and accord following this we should some new light on a key part of that relationship the part of that has come to be called the pivot to video Microsoft wrote about it for Vanity Fair walk through the program\nThanks for having me to go back a couple of years ago April to thousands sixty ... says we are pivoting the video at Facebook and journalism to does what\n[laughter] journalism with it basically and\nThey say listen we have to be in this space we're going to hire a bunch of video producers and and yet now we learned through this law suits ... maybe it didn't work out so well\nRight so I mean I think for publishers this was kind of a fucking costs fallacy they've already invested a lot of resources and Facebook are these debates but kind of eating into traffic so in Facebook's I've represented video\nIt's kind of like a thing where Facebook says jumping publishers okay how high man so they invest all these resources into doing video and then in twenty six year twenty Seventeen you kind of saw these layoffs where entire editorial teams were being restructured to eliminate writer even higher video producer is so this happened to places like ah\nMTV News and having to block it as Mike dot com mashable you name it probably happened there\nOr so we'll get to the to the layoffs thing in a minute but uh and the reason is germane is that very quickly after this started Facebook said wait where were these video figures art as impressive as we thought and now we've learned from his lawsuit this week not only were they less impressive and thought they were just flat wrong by a lot\nYeah you you have a small group of advertisers what this lawsuit basically saying that he's looking slate of a number is by in some cases allegedly up to nine hundred percent so entirely different story than what we thought we were seeing with these videos you count\nPart of the problem here it seems to me is that nobody's chicken Facebook's a mess as it were they keep their own numbers they tell us what was going on and and media and journalism react as opposed to having some objective measure of whether or not these things are working these videos\nSure I mean I think that everybody there's a lot of blame to go round here right obviously Facebook is to blame but also um advertisers and publishers maybe arguing their own homework and art keeping tabs on the number is as close as they should have been a seems like publishers were a little bit Katulis they were definitely desperate for new revenue stream\nAnd uh yeah they're they're definitely wasn't any checking going on here in terms of numbers\nShow even besides the numbers though one has to point out that that publishers as you sort of mentioned they jumped right in here and they made those transitions in the newsroom people were laid off organizations were changed and or or I'm Sorry to use this word pivoted um because of what Facebook's you had to do\nYeah I mean again it was kind of a case where obviously media in dire straits and publishers are looking for new revenue sources and they see this video thing in his book is doing and they think this this could be at\nAnd and they kind of just jumped in both eat what does Facebook have to say first of all I Know a lot it is obviously refuting the fried claims and the lawsuit right now\nIt did um I mean obviously it took some accountability and twenty sixteen when these discrepancies kind of first uh emerge publicly but I mean Facebook is kind of maintaining that and it didn't do anything wrong\nAnd we should say this matters opening and Gordon and everybody's going to have absolutely Microsoft jak writer at the very first of all thank you [noise]\n\nJust

protesters have taken to the streets like never before this cannot be the America that we all have set up the question that we're going to see in the next election is whether or not it's a painting

since the Nineteen sixties and seventies [noise] that sounds like a lot of you have been participating\nI'm not going to be on the sidelines and hunger here ... too much I've written and called and contacted congressmen you know I personally attendant about half a dozen or rallies and I thought it was important that we go and be with like minded people\nWhat's the impact of all this with the energy they produce is transferred to the polls in November\nFourteen percent showed up at a protest [noise] well that's more than twice what happens in a typical year you know it's like six percent of Americans say they've done something in the last five years fourteen percent strikes me as incredibly activist and incredibly mobilize\nPolitics with me Amy Walter on the take away right after these headlines\n[noise]\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm jak sphere\nSaudi Arabia is acknowledging the death of journalists ... showed gee it the Saudi ... this month according to report in the Saudi state news agency NPR's Peter Kenyon reports Eighteen people are now under arrest including to advisors to the Saudi crown prince\nSustaining that energy to get them registered an out to vote and then continuing to make an impact even with out an election looming that's the challenge\nYeah and it's a different story when we tell the history of movements of the past we like to focus on the dramatic demonstration\nAnd it distorts the more complicated and more time consuming and maybe more boring reality\nThat movements are built of people sitting in church basements and in around kitchen tables and having arguments about what to do and what issues are next and all that stuff has to happen first sustained influence\nBut when you tell the story of the civil rights movement you say oh one day Rosa Parks got tired of sitting in the back of the bus so she protested and boom a movement takes place\nSeems to me now that the whole goal of the protest seems to be not to change the mind of the party in power but to change the party in power\nI think the fact that each party the Democrats and Republicans have has become much less politically diverse changes the landscape from Nineteen sixty three there were plenty of Republicans who supported civil rights in Nineteen sixty three\nThere were plenty of Democrats who didn't so the polarization does matter but it's a mistake to um put a glossy vision in which\nA non violent action is just aimed at convincing people on protesters and controversial that's not the way the past was\nI was going out all public opinion polls the other day and I discovered that the march on Washington was extremely unpopular\nAbout three quarters of Americans thought it was dangerous destructive and probably counterproductive or at least that's what they told the pollsters and when we look back in history we've read defined that event as something consensual\nWe've made Martin Luther king and the people who were at that march into you know you're you're just an uncle who's very friendly and safe\nAnd that's not the way social change takes place by making Martin Luther king and the civil rights movement into this consensual easy process historically then we lose the sense of perspective on what's going on now\nI Want to raise the issue of social media it's not simply that social media is used as a tool to organized people outside of their homes\nBut more and more people now see using social media as a form of activism Internet itself and I I was looking at a recent Pew poll that found\nOnly about fourteen percent of voters over all said they attended a political rally or event\nBut a third said they use social media to publish expressed support for opposition to a campaign do you count going on to social media your Twitter account your Facebook posting things about an issue or cause\nIn the same way that you would if somebody showing up to the actual event\nOf course it's not the same thing but let's go back to the poll because my reaction to it is exactly the opposite of yours you say only fourteen percent showed up at a protest\nWell that's more than twice what happens in a typical year\nYou know it's like six percent of Americans say they've done something in the last five years fourteen percent strikes me as incredibly activist an incredibly mobilized whether your activism starts ends with a clicking on um a wink is real\nAn open question but here's something to remember in American political life protesting isn't enough it has to be followed up with action and a plan to take the Parkland kids for example some aren't even old enough to vote but that hasn't stopped them from organizing in a remarkable way\nWas thinking about the Parkland kids organizing that you know dramatic and interesting demonstration in Washington DC and that demonstration was really cool but then they want on a bus tour across the United states and there are high school groups across the United states that are registering people to vote\nAnd one or another those Parkland kids is it a lot of those organizing meetings\nSo was the demonstration that mattered was a demonstration as part of the fabric of a larger social movement\nWhat happens to these movements over time how did they developed into something that is a more lasting and that we do look back Twenty years from now and they are the moments that get put into the history book\nShe's not always the question and you know there was a million mom march for gun control in two thousand\nWhich is a long time ago now and in most states since that time it's been easier to access guns\nYou can't always see that as a failure it feels like for gun control activists because they're not in the debate alone the challenge for activists like the park when kids is to take tiny victories and they've gotten some tiny victories already in ... in legislation and Florida\nAnd don't stop don't be satisfied with him and push for more\nAnd to take the seeds and put them in the context of a larger story where we can use defeats to build and generate more activism right now there's an extraordinary amount of attention\nTo the mid term elections but the mid term elections really aren't going to fix anything or provide an easy answer for the activists who are turning out\nThe coalition of people who are engaged in protesting against various aspects of the Trump presidency\nIncludes very diverse interests there people who would normally vote for Republicans who want a restoration of institutional politics and civility in law and order there are people who would otherwise be Democrats working on congressional\nStaff and working on incremental legislation and there are people who think that\nThe United states is so distorted and screwed up that you have to really start from scratch all of those people are out of these demonstrations in I'm twenty eight teams if the Democrats gain a house of Congress\nThat really changes things for some of those people and not for others what's been a little bit different in this iteration of activism is lots of the organizers have been candid about that what those park when kids\nSay you know we know we're not going to win this white tomorrow we know that this was a long haul struggled but were young and we've got phones and we can go on\nBut again we go back to the Nineteen sixties thinking about groups that we don't hear about right I'm sure there were plenty of\nMarches that seemed to really impressive at the time but now we look back fifty years later and they don't get mentioned in the same breath as the march on Washington\nAnd the key challenge is building organizations that can sustain themselves in times when lots of people aren't paying attention and then ... that can opportunistic we respond\nTo new chances to mobilize people so that when times are good for your cause you can raise money build organizations and politicized people and when times are bad\nYou can sustain the organization and look for chances to engage in the future another challenge of activism in America is walking inside and outside of institutions at the same time having candidates for office who actually tried to execute policy reforms without giving up\nThe grassroots civic engagement part of the story\nAnd it's very very difficult balance to achieve but it's a the challenge of America\nDavid Meyer thanks so much for joining us thank you was a pleasure David Meyer is author of politics of protest social movements in America and the resistance the dawn of the
