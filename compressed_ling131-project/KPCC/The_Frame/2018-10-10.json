he's seen it before it's a new version of an old problem no one is a professor at the University of Virginia and he wrote a book about what happened when another new innovation the automobile arrived

show from NPR ... eighty nine point three gay BCC\nWelcome to the frame I'm John horn thanks for joining us Taylor Swift as one of the biggest pop stars in the world she has been a political her entire career but a few days ago that all changed\nIn opposed to her one hundred and twelve million Instagram followers she endorsed tendencies Democratic Senate candidate Phil Bredesen and Democratic House candidates Jim Cooper while bashing Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn in the process\nShe explained ending her political silenced by writing quote due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years I feel very differently about that now Michael where did the LA Times music critic when we spoke I Begin by asking him what events swift might have been talking about\nWith Taylor were always left to read the tea leaves a little bit you know here's artist to interview a long time so she doesn't\nMake you think super clear I think that the wisdom and I think it's right is that the personal stuff she's talking about is most likely or court case where she issued a Denver radio DJ she said group during a meet and greet\nThing that's important to note is that she only sued him after he sued her for saying that she had caused him to lose his job and then she wasn't the case so I think that's probably what she's referring to she's had this you know the humanizing experience that naturally made her look at things differently\nAnd then as far as the sort of the world events I don't know I mean I think you you can't discount the fact that she put the statement out right after the Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd Marsha Blackburn we should say in the house has not had a great record in terms of voting for pay equity and sexual and gender discrimination\nI think one of the most amazing things at the St Louis how hard she went in on black bird I mean it's one thing to say though for this person does this person it's another thing to say do not vote for this person for these reasons Taylor was really forthright quite detailed\nUm you know I'm sure Blackburn would take issue with the way the Taylor represented her record but as far as upstart wading into this kind of stuff this was like wow\nBroadly speaking what do musicians have to gain and lose by taking these kinds of positions Donald Trump's Taylor Swift let's just say I like dealers music about twenty five percent less now okay what are the risks what are the rewards\nI think it depends on the artist I mean the thing that struck me about Taylor is that this is someone who has a very large\nRed state following this is not someone who's playing only to a coastal progressive audience so for her it is a risk for her she's risking alienating people who don't share her politics and look I mean we saw this there was a huge backlash\nOn social media after she did this people talking about how tall they are that she would come out and um the trade is sort of heartland values so I don't think that every artist has a lot to lose but I think Taylor did\nThere was a long feud between Kanye West and Taylor Smith that dates back to the MTV movie awards is there any way to read what she's doing in contrast during reaction to Kanye West endorsement of Donald Trump on Saturday Night live\nYeah it's an interesting question I'm Taylor is one of the savvy is operators out there in terms of sort of how to conduct a career and pop so [noise] you can safely assume that she knew\nComing out when she came out would be interpreted as this sort of proxy war [noise] was it a motivating impulse\nI don't know I mean the thing about the instrument those it struck me was how Ernest it was like there's been a lot of calculations in Taylor's career and look this is not\nNot calculated a came right before she was on the American Music Awards which is like a big media look it came right before a Grammy voting starts a you know she's obviously going for nomination for her reputation album so it's not like she wasn't taking all this to account\nBut I don't know the idea like did she want to get into it again with con game in this way I'm I'm not sure I haven't decided yet\nLast night's were performed at what we know to be your favorite word ceremony of the year the American Music Awards she took on the prize for artist year tour of Europe pop rock album of the year\nAnd I'm Talking about what records you sad because that would give the and make more credit than they deserve that when she took the stage in front of a big TV audience she spoke in here\nThat this war and and every single word given out and I were voted on by to people and you know how\n\n\nSo she didn't make any endorsement what would you say about what she said and the fact that you went back to her voter registration push\nI mean look you know a little bit is a lot a at something Eric and Music Awards would I have like to see something a little bit more pronounced yeah of course it's better TV it's more interesting at advances the story a little bit more but\nYou know she said something which is more than the vast majority of others did on the show\nYou think this is it for now or do you think she's going to continue to flex or political voice\nYeah super interested to see how this goes not just what she sort of says on social media I Want to know how this impacts are music I mean I think ... Taylor has been known for someone who is writing sort of directly from the particulars of her personal life her romantic life for social life\nAnd this whole little chapter this whole shift for her it starts to make me think well maybe maybe killers thinking about her art in a different way that she's going to start using her records\nA as an opportunity a platform to talk about other stuff now do I wanted to become bon oh God no I certainly do not want that but I'm intrigued by the idea that Taylor might start writing from a different\nPoint of view or might just sort of be ex ending what she wants to write songs about\nMichael would is the LA Times music critic Michael always a pleasure thanks for coming back on the show\nI Know that you know\n[noise]\n... my ...\nI mean I don't make her more green grass uses the power of storytelling remember and word through tragic events [noise]\nMm [noise]\nIn Florida thousands of people are under mandatory evacuation orders that officials worried not enough for leaving\nYou're going to be stuck in your home is that's the only place you can try to ride this out you're going to call nine one one\nYou're not going to get anyone that can respond\nI'm Mary Louise Kelly will have the latest on hurricane Michael this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News\nWe came to pour money nine point three [noise]\nHe'd BCC supporters include universal pictures presenting the new film first from Academy Award winner Damien ... director of la la land and whiplash darn Ryan Gosling in playboy in theaters in IMAX friday or\nPasadena that step into space in twenty eight team better readers have Pasadena Weekly located in Pasadena Miller provides banquet rooms and hearing for weddings meeting gay living special occasions in our events dot com\nWelcome back to the frame I'm John horn filmmaker Paul green grass maybe best known for their Jason Bourne movies but there's another genre films that occupies his attention and those are movies focused unreal and violent attacks around the world\nHe made Bloody Sunday about British soldiers opening fire on on aren't Irish protesters in Nineteen Seventy do which killed fourteen\nGreen grass also directed United Ninety three about the hijacked plane that went down over Pennsylvania on nine eleven and Captain Phillips about a naval hijacking by Somali pirates and now they're just released twenty two July\nThis new film tells the horrific story of a right wing white supremacist exploded a truck bomb in Oslo and took a ferry to a nearby island where teenagers were at a political youth camp\nAnd opened fire Seventy seven people were killed that day and many more were injured and affected the perpetrator is currently in jail when I sat down with Paul green grass he started with why he wanted to tell this story\nI made the film because the story of what happened afterwards how Norway responded to this attack him new wife fought for democracy in a moment of Supreme crisis\nI thought was a story relevant to all of the democracy in the west might come to your country across Europe [noise]\nToday and tomorrow because I think we are in a a dangerously on mood moment to moment in the evolution of\nOf western democracy without a once again ... ... protections fool sees a home right wing fool sees a\nRaging like a ton of food in through the west and I'll support to the coast by many many millions of people for entirely", "show_name": "The Frame", "year": "2018", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "10"}
