Democrats over its original limited scope there were more angry accusations and the Senate today over how the cabinet nominations to the Supreme Court was handled\nAnd one last question for you just the first case and the justices heard today was actually about a critter called the ... go for fraud and this sounds refreshingly um this sounds like a refreshing departure\nFrom everything we've talked about the last week as really for the last Eighteen twenty months what was this case [noise] actually I have to say that\nUm there was a exactly what we've been talking about because this is an environmental regulation case\nA and it has to do with the definition of critical habitat for this frog which is about three inches long and apparently a red or it's crook sounds like snoring loudly uh there were only a hundred of them are still alive when the\nUh they were declared a endangered species are and the issue here had to do with a parts of the property run by the warehouse or a lion company in Louisiana where the frogs have not been seen since Nineteen sixty five and the fish and Wildlife Service said that well with some reasonable\nUh modifications this a property again good how's this frog that requires a very specific type of pond and\nA tree canopy and so forth in which to propagate itself ah and ah the company said no ah it it's not happening because we'd have to do all this work to make it a habitable again for this frog the government said a doesn't really require very much and they used to live there are any sought accord\nPretty much seemed to divide along that conservative liberal split with liberal members viewing the purpose of the endangered species act quite broadly for that and given the government a broader powers to protect the species that were on the verge of extinction uh with uh the conservative saying\nWell maybe that's a worthwhile gold but why would these extra costs to be imposed on the landowner because\nWhy or how they can continue cutting logs if they want us to develop this property for residential use which they certainly had in mind or they might require more permits and it would be more burns for them to to to do that and to try to preserve a\nHabitat for this this frog so uh we this is the kind of case that Brett Kavanaugh I probably would line up with other conservatives based on his record on the DC circuit is the kind of case that that he would be a tie breaker on so ah without without him there if they do divide for for the frog\nA wins [laughter] or if a if a if a if a he comes on to the ... votes for the the private company you could say the looks my the frog micro or to make little amphibian joke there but uh that's the\nAh that's that's precisely the kind of case but I Will say that is the second case was a age discrimination case and there was seemed to be broad consensus on the court in favor of the employees against the smaller fire department that had fired some a to a fire fighters or the older\nThe two oldest firefighters on whether or not they were covered by this federal law so yeah that's a reminder that you know a fair number of cases forty percent maybe more are near unanimous or unanimous on the court and there is only a relative minority that that divide along this ah for four or five for ideological split\nJasper even Supreme Court correspondent for the wall Street Journal thank you for being on America on the line thanks for having me\nSo when the show started I I I threw out a question what can we regular everyday ... day folks do to calm things down and I wanted to hear how how you're dealing with the situation in your own family the number's eight four four seven four or five eight to five five\nAnd Dennis in union county New Jersey\nIn dentist thank you for calling into America on the line\nClose Jonathan Hi so how are you dealing with it\nWell I I actually don't know if I Am I don't I Hope the screener that uh I'm a union to destruction worker or younger guy living at home and my dad was actually a union while there for thirty\nYears and as he's gotten older and headed towards retirement I've just seen him sort of fall pretty a propaganda movies this information\nOf the conservative media and it's really confused me I mean I told your screener my dad was what stock he didn't go to Vietnam but during the twenty sixteen election cycle we had a veterans for Trump signed hanging her garage wow so it's been\nReally difficult especially as I've become more active in my union politically are going to labor marches going zero canvassing events where were\nYou know putting out democratic candidates who have been pro labor\nRight I think it's really difficult right now there's a tendency to do so what does your dad said how when you ask how do you go from Woodstock to from\nA a lot of it seems like he's falling for the dean of Soviet fear mongering that's the biggest one ... um\nHe it seems like the dog whistles and racial divide there are there's a fear that spin implants it hit in him but I don't see on a person to person basis when you know he's interacting with someone with a different race I can tell you\nMy best friend in the world is half white half black and he's done things for my best friend's family I'm On both sides you know fixing cars driving his eighty five year old African American grandfather to go get his medicine at the pharmacy\nBut at the same time he'll talk about north New Jersey is ... ... and it it really confuses me when I see his personal ... system\nBut yet this still exist in fear of the other and we just had a lot of big conversations that sometimes tournaments the screaming matches and sometimes you know resolved with a hug but it's it's a really difficult because our views are\nGrowing further apart than is I Want to thank you very much for for calling in the most important thing you said in in your response was that your you and your dad are still talking so keep that conversation go and thank you very much Dennis\n... I wouldn't go to Ian if we've got a little time in in Honolulu thank you for calling into America on the line\nYeah Hi thanks for taking my call so aren't um one thing I learned from the last several years is that trying you know ... people who already are sort of think differently\nThan you is a sort of ignore fake news or ignore\nThat potentially you know bogus information or the airlines or hate mongering information is not very useful because they already suspected or\nPart of the group that they disliked but what I have found is that at the regrets of that there's a lot of people in my own you know sort of ideological circles why we're becoming sort of more of a mirror image of\nWhat we don't like what we say we don't like on the right and so I found it's more useful actually call out people within my own grew up when they have badly I think that is maybe one of the most important thing we can\nDo is to not\nLet our our own fat as our own circle of of of folks you know get a show tribal and so a focused on a destroying the other side that we we start perpetuating our own fake\nNews our own information and how does how does that go over [noise] when you call out yeah\nWhen you call out your progressive friends for some of the things that they said that go over the line ...\n... ... it it it usually goes pretty well and and the reason I I think it does is because um when you when you first of all when you speak with someone with whom you share a goal you know whether on the election or policy or something like that\nThen they're much less likely to view you ... and they know you they're much less likely to view you as as a as a you know a an enemy or a threat\nThough I think they take the criticism or so for instance in the cabinet nomination you know there was a lot of discussion of um basically pointing out that all the Republican you know a rich old white guys they're all ...\nCountry caught background people just like Kavanaugh they all just want to give them a path and I just think from the top of my head that you know Ben south I think as a son of a public school teacher and generally like he went on a mission trip to Africa and it's been working with Chris Coons in fact it's like and crews are the ones we ... we all have\nThe right and the idea that the animals actually and in out in ... I got a I\nHave to cut you off because we're gonna have to go to a break but yes Chris ... senators Coons inflate had been doing the buddy tour and they were on sixty minutes over the weekend\nA when we come back though are the panel that's been patiently waiting supposed to bring them in in a block but we took the calls are going to bring them back in the ... going to continue this conversation about the Supreme Court\nAnd how the question we're going to be talking about it has the Supreme Court ever seen this kind of political divide or are we in uncharted waters\n\nSometimes it seems like the news cycle is one big runaway train headed way too fast destination unknown\nI'm Mary Louise Kelly and all things considered we plan to our daily voyage carefully and take the time to see the important states along the way don't worry we'll still get you where you need to go all things considered from NPR News enjoy the journey\nWeekdays it for money be nine point three key PCC\nKatie cc supporters include fortunate the Internet of things and cloud can increase business capabilities but they also increase risk of exposure to security breaches fortune that security fabric works to mitigate that risk lord fortunate dot com slash fabric\nWelcome to the frame of John horn thanks for joining us in a recent column in the New York times writer Amy chose it examined the parallels between the Trump presidency and reality television\nIn her view of things Trump may have left The Apprentice but he behaved as if he's still in some sort of TV contest complete with cliff hangers in a changing cast of characters\nAnd that's why she speculates that Trump like a popular networks series we'll be renewed for another season when he's up for reelection in twenty twenty\nWhen we spoke this morning by phone chose it laid out how Trump continues to borrow from reality T. V. down to his governing style\nIs something they cannot underestimate that twenty million Americans watched this show they saw him as\nThe successful boss in the boardroom um and he very much created a character that resonated with people you know we in the media would had written for years about his bankruptcies and business has failed real estate deals um all of these things\nAnd thinking oh people know that he's not I think that we\nUnderestimated the power of television and having that I mean not just believing that he was that person but that familiarity of having him and I'm so many living rooms for so many years on The Apprentice I think ah you know absolutely paved the way for his candidate seats\nIf Trump is a student of and certainly an alumnus of reality television what have you taken from reality television into the White House what are some of the troops from the genre that he keeps leaning on\nYeah this is something you know the reality t._v. producers I talked to said they're just watching and disbelief as he uses some of these gimmicks of the genre that keep people hooked I mean the biggest one I think is the cliffhanger you know we we discussed whether red roses he was going to get fired for a week and it turns out at the end of the day\nIt was a stay tuned for next week you know one of Trump's favorite expressions is we'll see what happens a Politico story counting that he had said we'll see what happens eleven times one afternoon on a recent Wednesday so he is a master\nOf that sort of cliffhanger but he's also I think that's something that uh my place the creator of the bachelor told me recognizes from reality T. V. when one slice was creating the bachelor he said let's do something let's like have a joke with the audience where every week will say that it's going to be the most dramatic\nRose ceremony ever and it'll be like a wink to the audience because how could every week to be the most dramatic\nAnd I think you see Trump often speak\nIn that kind of hyperbole when he told the United nations eat at the most successful administration ever um you know the likes of which the world has never seen he uses these uh you know linguistic cheese is that initially overtly for Mike flies are sort of a joke with the audience\nAnd it was kind of a joke with some of the people at the un who laughed at a NATO attack not with him but at him you said in your piece that the most popular series don't get canceled until they're six seasons but quite a few unpopular ones don't watch nearly that long they may be toast after just a couple of episodes\nTrump's approval ratings are not really good according to the Pew Research center's latest for fifty five percent disapprove of him as president and only thirty eight percent approve\nSo how does Trump fit the model for a popular TV series\nWell this is something that you know it's hard to get your head around because yes his approval ratings are historically bad um but\nThere is no sign that people are not watching I mean that ... the ratings for all the cable news channels including Fox and MSNBC CNN are all up a\nLate night television that has entirely focus their monologues around politics are all saying record ratings um my ... my own newspaper is seen as faking subscription so there is no signs that people are not tuning in just because they disapprove\nIsn't there a fundamental difference though between the way people might watch the bachelor or who wants to marry a multi millionaire or a pawn war that they are looking at these things as entertainment as opposed to watching the person who is the leader of the free world\nOh a hundred percent and let me be clear you know it's a luxury that only privilege viewers can't afford to really tune out of what's happening but\nBut at the same time I think well of course the stakes in this are real you know climate change global warfare reuniting families on the border and to compare it to television is not to belittle the stakes but I Do think there is something beyond being a concerned citizen when you are watching your six hour\nOf a CNN panel discussing you know Paul Manafort's jacket or Stormy Daniels recent tell all or George Papadopoulos his girlfriend I mean this is that sort of cast of characters and there is intriguing some of these storylines that I think go way beyond the argument that you know watching just means you're being and informed citizen\nThis column was clearly meant to provoke a conversation would have been replies that have been most remarkable to you about ways that people are reading this he's\nWell the headline gave a lot of new\nYork Times readers a heart attack I think that the Trump will win a second term um do you know I've heard from a lot of people who want to kind of quibble with how many seasons the show has been on they say well it's technically been on since twenty Fifteen so that would be you know X many seasons and then of course I've heard from people who have said you know this is not\nTelevision is this real life and I completely understand that argument but at the same time getting back to what we discussed at the beginning of the segment is that I think it's a underestimating the power television if we completely disconnected\nFrom real life I and I say this is someone who watched eight seasons of The Apprentice and when I saw Donald Trump us in the elevator at Trump Tower and declare his candidacy I I thought you know the country thinks that he's this character\nYou end the story by quoting my wife's a veteran reality producer who says I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows back in the day and people said this is the beginning of the end of western civilization I thought it was sort of a joke but it turns out they were right what do you think he means by that\nWell I mean he means that pioneering all of those crazy wacky shows back in the day paved the way for The Apprentice which he believes he and many others believe pave the way for a President Trump\nChose it gives a writer at large for the New York times covering business politics and media she's the author of the recent column why Trump will win a second term Amy thanks so much for taking time had come out on
