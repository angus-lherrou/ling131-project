Monday through Thursday we're here with the latest political news analysis\nAnd your calls tonight we have the first the new series that will be bringing you on the ... in the closing days of this campaign field reports from the battleground\nWill be in three key states for updates on the races that will shape our next two years Missouri Nevada\nAnd New Jersey but first a quick update on the news of the day this afternoon President Trump knowledge that Saudi journalist in Washington Post columnist Jim ... is likely dead he says the evidence seemed to indicate that the show he was murdered but stopped short of blaming the Saudi crown prince and he made the comments to the New York times\nAnd they quoted him as saying of Saudi Arabia\nThey've been a good ally and they bought massive amounts of various things and investments in this country which I appreciate and meanwhile let them or poop is weighing in on this should the u._s. beers a certain responsibility and he wonders why the Saudis\nHaving been punished as the Russians were for alleged use of chemical weapons so what kind of being fooled by Vladimir potent and tonight ABC News reports a crucible secretary of state Mike Pompeo was played the table ... being murdered\nOK Nancy yeah\nThis was a [noise] you know this is all none of this has been substantiated some of it's been proven false there were\nA women who were paid to say that they were prostitutes and had had sex with men end as a by and paid by a conservative news site a so a lot of this is fake news a Washington Post gave it four Pinocchios yeah yeah yeah and it's um\nYou know but these are I mean this is where we're at today I mean these are very effective ads attacking adds whether they're they're truthful or false are effective um\nAnd so you know and then does is a\nGood this is a big problem for him and its trickling down I mean so we have five races in New Jersey house races that are all contested and the Republicans in those races are ... you know saying the same kinds of things and trying to get\nA the Democratic candidate to say oh you know I I wouldn't associate with Bob Menendez I wouldn't vote for him and then they're not saying that but um this is part of the uh the Republican attack that's coming from the national party into New Jersey\nRight you know and into horses and he he first baggage responds by calling you in a ... in a wire which is I guess that's New Jersey where you're at um but it does it British voters and look terribly excited for either one of these these candidates I mean this is this is a this is the race was decided by you know negative partisanship and holding their nose\nYes uh I think that it's safe to say and yet there have been some really interesting\nPress releases put out by progressive organizations or in the state about asking voters to support Menendez and the language is kind of couched in a you know you you can always have the perfect candidate you want but right now we need to vote democratic\nUm so right now the effort is trying to make sure that Democrats forget about the independence and you know but to get Democrats to vote for him and then does\nOkay so let's go back to what Allison in Missouri because I was just kind of a bizarre story Missouri as well uh this story about a sort of a notorious conservative journalist from the group called project Vera toss\nWhen undercover posing as a volunteer to Claire McCaskill campaign and then secretly videotaped her staffers and and here's a clip from project bird\nYeah I think it's like a topic that's like not too far left to try to get some more voters\nOr were still runs for more than\nOne [laughter]\nOr more like now I Do not like [noise]\nThey go through other means of support and get the distance roughly give the money from their life\nOkay so Allison will give us some context of that video and and how it's\nOut in the campaign [noise] yeah so I'm like you said project their tests went in and um recorded\nSenator McCaskill's campaign staffers\nUm so you know in Missouri where you've got a state that that voted for Trump um but you know you've got a vulnerable Democrat running for reelection um you know the the abortion issue is obviously a touchy subject and so the\nThe video kind of um portrays McCaskill is not being up front about her views on abortion and her views on various gun issue so um you know it's something that I think I'm is going to be a a big deal in this race Senator McCaskill\nUm her office has filed a complaint with Holly's office ...\nSo the attorney general here in the state so she her campaign of filed a complaint with his office under state law I'm against fraud and deception and nonprofit fundraising so I think they you know they see this as a big deal and and something to\nUm to fight off I mean something to know is that I'm mixed school supports um banning bump stocks and she support universal background checks and she has a high rating with\nUm emily's list and Planned Parenthood\nShe's a Democrat and All right so he faces in an undercover person to get a tape joined she's a Democrat [laughter] okay well let's go back to back to the Nevada um you know I mean a lot of Democrats that a lot of high hopes that this was going to be the pick up see we talked about 'em but I've seen a lot of stories and no one wanted you to address addresses are making\nThat that the span of voters do not seem as highly motivated as one would expect in the era of of Trump\nOr so let's let's talk about the role of the the Hispanic voters ... voters do not turn out in big numbers that is pretty bad news for the Democrats pick up chances isn't it\nIt is that it's definitely bad and and that you know one of the things that we saw happen you know just in general Democrat turning out in twenty fourteen which was sort of a red wave here in Nevada Republican slept all of the constitutional law that says um you know with a ... through and through Republicans had control both houses of the legislature\nAnd a lot of that with attributed of the of the failure of folks that Democrats and the Democratic machine to turn out which like you mentioned\nIncluding Latino and a lot of that has to do\nPeople might hear about you know Harry Reid said that the political godfather of the state and his fabled ... machine and that's what gets people to turn out and about as ray machine or a combination of\nThe state Democratic Party you know a different you know activist groups that that work with the Democratic party and then also the colon airing union which is how\nI wanted to talk about that because that that's kind of the wild card in Nevada politics isn't at the corner union\nExactly yeah the coronary and it's just that NAFTA mobilizing for us I mean when they show up and get their members to turn out and it can have incredible results for for a Democrat\nYou know as you can imagine they you know work to bring their at\nTheir their members you pulling faith you know they'll they'll buy them over on break 'em they they'd even rallies actually and Joe Biden will be here over the weekend I was saying a rally for jacking rather than in other Democrats optical an air union so you know a big part of\nHow many people turn out and that's actually how many Latino voter turnout\nDoes have a lot to do with ... the corner union and the rest of the ... machine that they can really get that excitement there to get folks out to the pole and ...\nAnd ... and they and they did turn out that was there was one of the states that Hillary Clinton a one or two two years ago let's go to the phones because we we did ask the question are you going to be voting when you could turn on boats are you going to be voting for or against Donald Trump penny let's go to a good a penny from Ewing New Jersey penny thanks for calling into America on the line\nYeah hello hello Fannie\nYes yes uh your opening question about a slap in ended I made a special trip a walk like falling place find very gay\nVote against Bob Menendez on the Democratic party on the Democratic side and since he won the primary I Am going to hold my nose and I'm voting for 'em and then end as in ... in the mid\nTerm election okay so the question was what are you voting for Trump's or you're voting for him and then there's because of of from\nA ... to to maintain that said that majority I Am voting against Trump in the midterms I Am voting for for the earth for environment for peace and justice and I can see Trump's click on TALK\nOr see and the um the whole thing and that and how old's on legislation and the and the judges and you can ditch Sherry and that's why I Want to keep\nFighting it end is in there at least ... you know one more Democrats on the Democratic side and not let the conservative majority that has such a chokehold on the federal government\nAnd the bureaucracy and stronger so I'm I'm a very pragmatic Danny I'm voting\nFor a penny thank you for the call and then that's what you were describing a little bit before Nancy that that does the go to the real politic that you're seeing from a lot a lot of voters or\nWas it a you know thanks to all three of you for being here in America on long we have to go to a break and when we come back how much money to the Saudis released spend them United States anyway

Saturday to one eighty nine point three K PCC\nWelcome to the frame I'm Steven quibble sitting in for John horn disappearance and presumed assassinations Saudi dissident journalist ... allegedly under the direction of Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman continues to fuel outrage across the globe\nAnd also poses an ethical dilemma for arts institutions with ties to the Saudi Government a year long cross cultural program called the New York Arab art in education initiative\nWas launched earlier this month partly with the aid money from a nonprofit founded by the Saudi crown prince now some of the New York institutions involved in the initiative are either declining Saudi dollars are postponing related events Robin Pogrebin is covering the story for the New York times after the first explain what's behind the Arab art in education initiative\nWas an effort to had to get to know the Arab world through culture whether it was exhibits panel discussions kind of impose yeah and so\nThere were several major American museums that agreed to participate and everyone was very excited about the prospect and you know while they had different manifestations of this project kale\nKind of bought into the idea of it and we're making plans right around now to move forward when obviously this became a serious ranch in the works\nAnd what are some examples of the programming and exhibits there are a part of a year long initiative\nWell for example um October twelve the Brooklyn Museum opened an exhibition of art and artifacts from Syria um the Guggenheim hosted a conversation with a Palestinian artist and the Metropolitan Museum of planning to hold a seminar on how museum's curator art from the middle east ...\nSo how's the international outrage over ... ... disappearance and apparent murder likely to alter the tone and the tenor of this art in education effort\nI think that cultural institutions around the country as frankly it our political organizations are doing are are grappling with this issue of of how to balance this interest in what seemed very kind of positive effort to um\nEstablished connections with the Saudi Government the Arab world more generally has now been very much complicated and potentially compromised by\nWhat seems to be increasingly clear evidence that the Saudi Government\nPlayed a role in cars show gates death and so now I think museums were\nA Lowe's to immediately I'm kinda disavow al ... potentially cancel these events and activities that now they are having to think much more seriously and deeply about whether an ongoing um collaboration makes sense\nCould it be that that the entire initiative is at risk or or just X amount of dollars of fun you know funding coming from the Saudis\nI think definitely the entire enterprise is at risk as it is this\nWas kind of a nascent relationship that was developing between these cultural institutions and the Saudi world and so it was definitely new territory and frankly the you know potential upside of having an infusion of dollars it's no small part of it these are cultural institutions that are struggling\nAround the country um there's always this question of\nA finite number of philanthropic dollars to compete for as well as diminishing government support and this was a really\nKind of a potentially great new pot to draw from and potentially benefit from that they now have to swear off and you know and it's very realistic that this is not going to be an option anymore and I think that's frustrating and they've been a little slow to\nUs how to reconcile themselves to that what\nExactly is behind the Saudi government's interest in us art and culture\nI mean I think it you know certainly there is the the image aspect of it I mean you know there are a lot of people who try to burnish um they're sort of a public relations\nA profile with culture it's it seems to usually be a pretty benign um avenue\nOf of collaboration I mean certainly for example um in cutter you know we've actually had the New York times art conference there a couple of times and the shake a has been a huge supporter of the arts and she put a lot of effort behind museums\nAnd then you actually saw that kind of shift I'm when I'm the government changed there\nAnd um we certainly as as a country have had to somewhat change our\nPosture towards cutter and\nYou just realize that you know these are\nCountries that are um it's just a very loaded in terms of what can happen like there's a whole sorts of human rights issues\nYou know you have like the ... now has raised a lot of questions about labor and the construction of museums so these are things that you really have to take into account and and and it's definitely new ground\nUm for cultural institutions but um we're in a world now where people are much more sensitive to these issues and museums and other arts institutions are going to be held accountable um\nAnd so um it's it's definitely something they're going to have to answer for it and that's what they're finding 'em in the case if this Saturday government\nRighted as you write in your piece even prior to this crisis that we're experiencing now the Saudi government's poor human rights record is certainly been no secret and and yet the U.S government's cultural educational institutions have not shied away from forging relationships and taking money from the Saudi so\nIs the ... really likely to permanently sever these ties and the art world\nI think it really depends on how it plays out and I wouldn't say that they have kind of taken Saudi money and an uncomplicated away in the past they actually I think have sort of tiptoe around it they\nPlayed it down they sometimes you know keep it at arm's distance I mean there is this ... foundation through which they Saudi money comes and so in a way this kind of ... art Institute it's sort of under the rubric of that that you see these collaborations happening\nSo you don't necessarily see how\nDirects the relationship is um and there is kind of some effort to even obscure it but I think what happens when an event like this comes just for is you know suddenly it's all really laid bare and the connections become clear you have journalists like us kind of digging and making sure that the public is aware of them\nAnd so then institution suddenly become much more accountable ...\nRobin Pogrebin reports on arts and culture for the New York times Robin thanks so much bank you ...\n\nComing up the composers have deer Evan Hansen dig deeper into
