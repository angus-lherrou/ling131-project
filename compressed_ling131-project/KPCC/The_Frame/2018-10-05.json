impulse cool I'm Steven bed for marketplace\n[noise]\n\n\nThis one out of the way out does your must still have a job the fifty H remember back in August when the CEO of Tesla tweeted that he was going to take the company private at four hundred and twenty dollars a share and the funding was secured\nAnd remember this past weekend when must contest reached an agreement with the SEC that's the securities and Exchange Commission that said most would step aside is German and paid twenty million dollar fine a settlement that also said not for nothing that the company would monitor mosques communications\nWell somebody didn't quite get the memo I think from mosques account this afternoon this tweet just want and there's a type of who he left out to say but the quote goes just want to say that the short seller enrichment commission is doing incredible work and the name changes so on point\nEnd quote short seller in Richmond commission as you see the people supervising his publicly traded company got it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUm but you know it's still should have never been that close I mean we should still should have never been in a position where the Russians could potentially influence an election in favor of somebody as reckless or as ridiculous as Donald Trump boys as a candidate\nSo let's just go out and make sure that doesn't happen again let's use the next thirty days to elect a whole bunch of people who are going to take victims seriously who are going to honor the impartiality of the Supreme Court I'm a I guess the silver lining to this debacle is that\nThere's an election right around the corner like we don't have to wait for a year and a half and you can if you're angry you can do something about it in the next thirty days\nAnd real quickly what message should Republicans take from the protests that are swarming or their offices\n[noise] well I mean let's step back and and and talk about this in a bigger sense I mean none of this is fun right to to\nThe fact that this nomination and his presidency are tearing our country apart um you know I I I I Hope as a message to both parties Republicans and Democrats that we've got to do\nThis differently you know in my remarks hum you know I also said that Republicans don't write to me angry about the way in which these allegations\nBecame public ... it's not ridiculous to believe that the person who leaked them whoever it was had a political agenda and that's not right um these allegations should have been Dr Ford's I should've been hurt us ... when they came out if they ever came out and so I just think we've all got to sort of step back after this\nAnd try to see if there are ways after this election that we can put this thing back to gather and I argued on the floor today that the withdrawal Brett Kavanaugh's nomination\nPutting up somebody who is equally conservative but just not as to visit would have been one of the means\nBy which to repair our broken political infrastructure but we've got to spend some time Republicans and Democrats on that after this election is over\nSenator Chris Murphy of Connecticut thank you for being on America on the line faction within\nThis afternoon senator Heidi Heitkamp a Democrat from North Dakota in a very tough reelection campaign announced her vote she'll vote against judge Kavanaugh we're still waiting to hear from senators Collins of Maine flake of Arizona Murkowski of Alaska and Joe mentioned another Democrat up for reelection in the red state of West Virginia\nRepublicans are feeling confident that at least two of them will be yes votes and this comes as an op ed in the wall Street Journal published just thirty minutes ago is a closing argument from judge Kavanaugh himself\nPromising independence and impartiality is confirmed\nWhen the show started I asked the question are you angry satisfy relieved that this is all going to be over soon how do you feel about the entire process that's played out in judge Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court asked you to call eight four four seven four or five eight to five five\nAnd Martin in St Louis heeded the call Martin thank you for calling into America on the line\nThanks for taking my call uh how do you feel about all this uh extremely frustrated mad\nAs a senator and said this is really a joke on par with so called investigate them park is created by the White House than Republicans are it's not not really a true investigation they what they've done and they\nPut the uh the eye on a on a ... and then let him down a blind alley they go down one blind nothing they're not the blind date and there's nothing there now they're going to end all there's nothing there okay\nWell we did it now let's just ram rabbits they're the role of this\nThrough and you know what's true and what's not true and what this fable of uh\nJudge Kaplan are being ... by an altar boy and never mind in a moment I'm more likely a drunk and tobacco is over then then then that's probably a gang on under oh among an ad or an ... it's it's\nReally irritating American or [noise] you know\nI hear your Martin I I hear your Martin and and you're expressing a lot of feelings that we have heard on this show since we've since we've come on the air or early last month Martin in St Louis thank you very much for calling bill enriched in New Jersey thank you for calling into America on the line\nThey were doing good how are you are you angry\nSatisfied I'm actually I'm I'm I find it kind of odd that guy was\nSuch a squeaky clean that specifically background they're going through so much effort for nobody would be able to see it\nLiterally screams unrealistic to every one copy\nTo look at people but our to look at\nLike ... like how is that you're pushing so hard for somebody that's so sweet and then it's kind of ... is that good for your review pushing ...\nNobody's going to be questioning the back of their part that this guy got screened core honest judgment on the decision not even sure what I'm Talking about what's the future check your\n... your ... you raise a good questions when I thank you very much for ... for calling into America on the line let's go to Suzanne in Maplewood New Jersey Suzanne thank you for calling in are you angry satisfied baffled like Bill\nI think more frustrated than anything I'm frustrated with the process I'm frustrated\nWith the inability for the Republican two kids on any way they have pushed back all the Democrats I think that and I see how on Merrick Garland was treated\nRent now we are pushing their fears hypocrisy but I'm troubled by the references\nConspiracy I Try to go in with a very open mind to the doctor for testimony and I really take a look at how\nHe would resign Kavanaugh right when he went to the conspiracy when he was so parties and and mostly it was his temperament and when I thought his response to a club or car\nI think that his actions and his words actually prove that he is not fit for the office\nOn the fact that he showed toward her was actually the ... and a perfect living example\nOf his inability to respect to one and he didn't think that lead to any men but the way that he went after her was quite disrespectful she out meeting with misplaced anger because he's angry at Dr ... or\n... why would they be placed on to that one and\nThen the wind and Susanna I'm gonna have to know his true colors and Susanna I Want to thank you very much for ... for calling in a way to squeeze in this one more call Josh in New Orleans thank you for calling into America on the line\nI um [noise] yeah I'm a Democrat but I'm working in the Midwest right now and we're dealing with a lot of people that are not strong Republicans are strong Democrats [noise] and um a lot of people are tired of the\nPolarization so it's kind of frustration for straightening for me as I'm trying to talk to people about like the actual issues like health care and other uh and education ... or so out of like get becoming very disillusioned by all of\nThis I mean it's hard because I'm a Democrat and I understand by\n... you're you're trying to break through and no one no one seems to want to hear because they're so they're so\nAnd every heart rate is yeah it's hard because like people are like well everybody's throwing shame about each other and I also like I'm\nJohn I'm Josh I'm really sorry to have to cut you off like that we've got to go to a break a we'll take more of your calls remember a we're asking you as a cyber Brett Kavanaugh's nomination nears its and are you angry relieved Gladys almost over was still taking your calls aid for four something four five\nEight to five five and when we come back from the break we're going to bring in our political panel to actually respond to what they've heard you're listening to America on the line [noise]\n\n[noise] sometimes it seems like the news cycle is one big runaway train headed way too fast destination unknown\nI'm Mary Louise Kelly at all things considered we plan to our daily voyage carefully and take the time to see the important states along the way don't worry we'll still get you where you need to go all things considered from NPR News during the during\nWeekdays it for ... point three key piece easy\nEasy easy easy solution National Geographic

... politics was shown at another time when the economy was strong and the government got shut down back in the Nineteen nineties I'll tell you all about it on one a tonight at eight and nine it's the frame with John horn and stay with us at ten fresh air looks at digital ... information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks and things have happened that I but I always thought it was something that was a momentary thing that happened in my life because it wasn't something that I was necessarily sharing with other people when it came out a year ago when it really did for me at that time was make me realize oh my God this is so\nVast and I actually looked at that moment once it happened I thought\nThese courageous people are members who are speaking out right now have created an incredible opportunity so in that moment of being totally I'm concerned about what was taking place in recognizing this\nThis terrible impact has been had not just in our industry but really recognizing oh my God this is something that's you know global actually um I realized we were in a moment of opportunity\nWell let's talk about opportunity because you write that there are a couple of things that are happening it's not just about bringing abusers from the chance to change workplace culture so that women and men are valued equally yeah what are the steps that side after I had taken in that regard\nWas ... from the very beginning we recognize we needed to look at what was taking place because so many people were not and\nHave not reporting on it so knowing that there's trauma and\nUm you know fear behind that what we worked on really was creating first of all policies that help to support our members we you know as many people many organization did they did the code of conduct\nWe wanted to make that apart is something that's even bigger\nSo we created something that's called the four pillars and it deals with us um\nCreating guidelines one of the guidelines which was really important and we're actually buildings more guidelines that are coming out soon but one of the most important guidelines was the guideline about no auditions or meetings to be held in\nHotel rooms are private residence without somebody being able to choose to support peer to be with that they should never be alone in that environment that was a major thing for us\nThat guideline now is something that actually was put into one of our largest contracts so it's something that the studios actually supported we wanted to work on um creating reporting systems that were stronger for members we actually have a one of the things that the union put together was a therapeutic support program\nWe found that a lot of our members who were feeling um had been victimized felt\nThat they didn't know how to get the help they needed to move on\nSo um we wanted to make sure to create something that can help them and it's going to be something I think that's going to be meaningful down the road we worked a lot and legislative policy kudos to Governor Brown because he actually went and supported some legislation recently just sign on to some pieces that are really important to all\nWorkers who are ... you know subjected to\nPossibly being um sexually assaulted but particularly for our members there was language they needed to be done and legislation and he signed onto that\nAnother symptom of the patriarchy or in balance of power in Hollywood is pay and we heard for instance the doormen talk about inclusion writers at the Oscars and we certainly I've heard stories about what Claire Ford was paid on the crown yet given what other people who were male were paid\nAnd the huge disparity between how much Michelle Williams and Mark Wahlberg were paid for re shooting scenes in all the money in the world\nSo how do you keep things moving in that direction that people are paid equally for equal work\nWell pay equity is really important if we're looking to really create a better structure to really create the systemic change that we need pay equity is very important because it creates a level field for when you're talking about power\nI also think it's not just the pay equity which look at kudos to all the people who actually in the organizations that recognize an HBO Netflix we can go on and on the people that are you know organizations that are starting to really you know walk the walk but um it's also the leadership roles\nThe people in power can not only the man they're really also really good women who should be in those roles as well and we have to find that balance\nThere are a couple of issues that face survivors of sexual assault one is and I think the cases of Harvey Weinstein and bus Moonves\nSuggested that people who speak out are punished and are denied work and the second is more complicated and that's I think what we've seen in the Brett Kavanaugh hearings and that is that people who speak out about sexual harassment and assault are believed so how do you change the culture\nWhere generally women more listened to and believed\nWay now that's clearly a process when you think about me too movement that really started in the nineties that was Anita Hill and I think you know I think it's about moments and I spoke to Anita Hill about a month ago asking her if she felt that there was a change that had occurred and she said I Do think things are different and I said what do you think there are different and she said\nBecause I think people know more now they understand more\nSubtle way for us to\nThe only way for us to really change it is to continue speaking out and for those who have the courage to stand by those who speak out\nAnd the courage to go and do the investigation and not to shunted away I mean it's not again not only in our industry we've seen it unfortunately through\nDifferent parts of labor we've seen it even in you know religious menus there's all these different places where we've seen people who have spoken out and had not been believed or had not it had not been followed up with but as we start to listen and support and stand together will start to see those chefs\nGabrielle ... is the president of sag after a
