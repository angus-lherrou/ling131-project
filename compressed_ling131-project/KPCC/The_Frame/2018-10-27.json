get a head start on the road I Want and I ...\nI decided to come early in case there is a discrepancy I Would add time to resolve\nBut does this early voting surge mean we're going to have a huge turnout overall for all this energy and the lead up to the election going to allow and what can you tell us about who is likely to win\nFor people who are participating in this and the bulk of those overwhelmingly or people who are shifting their voting from election day early\nOr an average turnout rate there will be the highest we've seen in the last century there's no\nHistorical precedent for that politics has me Amy Walter on the take away\nCounty down to the twenty Eighteen mid term elections we'll be right back after these headlines [noise]\n...\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm ... authorities have arrested a suspect charge with sending more than a dozen explosive devices to prominent Democrats and CNN this week\nAcross the country but we get a lot of really solid data out of those three states as\nWe can see from this data right\nNow that John early voters running at ... in some cases that record for maternal election you know there's one other thing that's related to your posters make certain assumptions about who they think is going to be a likely voter on somebody's poachers are are thinking that perhaps\nThe electric got to look like a typical midterm election where we get maybe forty percent of those eligible to vote on I don't think that's going to happen here I think we're going to have a a turnout Richard prior to that we could be at least admit forty percent range so\nIf we beat the forty eight percent um turned out that we had Nineteen sixty six uh we're in an average turnout rate that will be the hardest that we've seen in the last century and so I'm pollsters aren't taking better to account aren't they going to miss our end up probably underestimate or in some ways I'm the contours of the electorate\nEspecially what about you what do you know ... and what is your all your research shown you about the early vote and what it does or doesn't tell us about the upcoming election and the kinds of people who are showing up\nSo I think what's important to realize is that a while we get a lot of data from states and counties\nCampaigns have a lot more data about voters and off and on a daily basis or getting lists back from election authorities about which individuals have voted and so you know if you're a campaign and you've identified two hundred thousand voters in your district or state theory or get out the vote targets\nEvery day you're getting a list of who actually voted did Amy vote yesterday or not and so it opens up all these tactical questions and\nAnd one of the things that I think um should give us a fair bit of uncertainty about\nTrying to decode uh from early vote tally use some idea of the contours the races that different campaigns and parties have\nDifferent strategies and tactics about how to approach early vote and so ... some campaigns are making concerted efforts to\nMobilize certain types of voters over over this period and because this is still sort of in its infancy it's difficult to I think come up with a a clear idea that certain types of voters are voting early instead of just voting on election day as opposed to being mobilized for early vote who wouldn't otherwise be voting and they're like yeah\nThat's my question and to both of you but such I can start with you about this idea that\nReally you don't want to read too much into the early vote because the theory is these are voters who would have shown up any way you can have huge turnout in the early vote but it doesn't mean that you're going to see equally large turnout on election day\nRight I mean so everything we're talking about I think is happening at the margins and you know a lot of elections are cited at the margins the margins are important I think two things to keep in mind as you talk about early vote or or what some people call convenience voting which refers to any situation where voters are not required to cast a ballot in person at their neighborhood\nVoting location to take all that stuff together I think there are two big rules to to keep in mind what we what we've learned from from about a generation of of this expanding\nI'm One that been lots of studies and a lot of the promises when states turned early vote as more people will vote\nI think an aggregate as hard to see the giving people opportunity to vote in different ways and at different times in different places has not dramatically increase the pool of of people who who are participating and then the second thing is that we see an increase in\nIn early vote year to year in states to the extent that they keep their rules\nConsistent and so um there's you know often if you're comparing two thousand Eighteen to two thousand fourteen or two thousand ten\nStates have changed their rules during that time so there is not always clear sort of linear comparison but more importantly more people are participating in this and the bulk of those overwhelmingly or people who are shifting their\nTheir voting from from election day to earlier and so yeah we should see gains in in early vote as a sort of net increase in participation a lot of that is is shifting\nMichael what about you what do you think about that\nWell I think I disagree with just about everything that was such as that because of what this is a analysis is missing is\nThat we're seeing historic numbers or early vote so far in some places that are surpassing a presidential election and so we can see lots of energy out there to sell it and we should get a very good sense of whether or not we're going to have high turnout knows elections that won't just be cannibalizing people moving around if\nWe see turnout numbers that are exceeding twenty fourteen and just the early ...\nThe number of early voters have already passed a total of twenty fourteen I think that would be really clear signal that um you're going to have a higher turnout election but Tennessee today will surpass it's two thousand and fourteen early vote and we still have a a week and a half early voting to go\nOver six hundred thousand people have voted in Tennessee so far so I'm you know what to look at one point two million people who were voted early in Tennessee [noise] probably\nNot just a shuffling around it when you were loading it's also has something to do with greater enthusiasm and there's a lot of good signals to suggest that we're gonna have to turn out\nRight now twenty fourteen did have very low turnout to me when I'm looking for personally is not just that it exceeds twenty fourteen but we're getting somewhere to a level no one's expecting it to hit the level of the presidential turnout beginning in flirting close with that level is that what you're saying\nYou know Britain now again in some states were actually ... Minnesota\nIs one of these days and they'd been recording their numbers for weeks now and they continue to be about twenty sixteen so again we'll just have to wait and see how this all plays out I read that at least some cautions warranted and whether or not this little out but I think the best way to think about this as we can probably\nA turnout rate it's gonna be\nAbove Nineteen sixty six on and it could go much higher to go about fifty percent and if it goes about fifty percent really looking at it as a ... you'd have to go back\nTo Nineteen fourteen or to see a turnout rate that was about fifty percent of those eligible so this electorate is looking more like a presidential gonna maternal although I don't think we'll be at a presidential level but it's still looks more like a presidential than a typical midterm election that we've had over the last three decades\nSasha I remember I'm old enough to remember maybe you do to reading a lot in twenty sixteen especially via Twitter a campaign folks in Florida especially\nThose affiliated with the Clinton campaign who said\nOh my gosh are early vote is so good we have bad more votes more early votes than ever in the history of all time\nAnd it's a pretty good sign that Hillary Clinton's going to win Florida and of course it didn't exactly work out that way so again as we're going into these next couple of weeks here trying to analyze the numbers that are coming out\nWhat do we have to be careful to look for so that we don't end up in the same place\nSo you know a lot of the public facing data will see the party registration of people who have already cast ballots the race or ethnicity in some states um we should not assume that those are mine with the groups not everybody who just registered as a Democrat in Florida or has a history of voting in the Democratic primary in state\nIs going to cast a ballot for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump prefer given Democratic Senate candidate over given Republican candidate so just looking at you know who's winning in terms of a more registered Democrats are registered Republicans cast ballots has all the problems are that you could infer the author worth keeping in mind especially with twenty sixteen is\nHow late movement in an election intersects with with early vote so you know the second call me letter came out right around this time or in a two years ago\nAnd so you know as we look at news events you know I don't know the caravan I guess and and the Republican messaging on that or or the president claiming he's going to issue a new tax cut things that we think might have some persuasive power over\nOver voters we should remember that a significant number of votes had been cast before those events take place and I think that that's something that twenty sixteen should be instructive on and give us a bit of caution of assuming that the that the entirety of the electorate is thinking the same about both candidates on on October twentieth as as they are November sex\nWe have to take a short break more with Michael McDonald and Sasha Eisenberg coming up this is the takeaway\nWe're live where local where LA's NPR leader eighty nine point three K PCC at eight o'clock it's one a with Joshua Johnson than at nine we bring you the frame our daily program an arts entertainment and culture\nAfter that the daily from the New York times had nine thirty and stay with it said ten for fresh air with Terry Gross got a program note Saturday and Sunday Morning weekend edition keeps you up to date starting at five AM\nThan all things considered has all the news at two and five on Saturday and Sunday afternoons and you can bet both shows\nWill have ... updates on the arrest of a Florida Man in connection with the Thirteen bombs sent this week to prominent Democrats in media figures\nIf it happens and there's a good chance it will will have it for you he PCC all weekend long we stay warm tomorrow eyes in the eighties and nineties we cool off a little on Sunday little bit more on Monday eyes will peak in the mid seventies let's get back to the takeaway on Cape ... see the", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Frame", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "27"}
