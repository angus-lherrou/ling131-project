scary time for young men in America when you can be a guilty of something that you may not be guilty of this is a very very very difficult time\nHe was speaking in response to the sexual assault accusations against judge Brett Kavanaugh what do you think is he right about the status of young men in America\nWe want to hear from you men and women men are you scared you'll be wrongly accused of

can also send us a tweet using the hash tag eight O. T. L.\nThat is a scary time to I guess a scary time to be an America fear is\nNot just [laughter] [laughter] well Sam of all let me and since it was the president of the United states who said it's a scary time for young men in America because they could be falsely accused of of doing something they didn't do\nIs that he was that his place to do that\nWell he certainly has not stepped up to the plate and major additional ways for those with\nThe national healer as opposed to be asked will divide or but I think that I Would say that two thirds of the people's support him a lot like the laws so I'm not so sure that he is he is a fellow crew building under any circumstances\nWell let me bring in a high and then a Lexus you know with the president saying what he said I Want to read it again\nWell I say that it's a very scary time for young men in America when you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty of and of course my first thought immediately went to the Central Park five\nAnd the fact that that's a ... statement on top of everything else um but yeah I mean listen I think these statements from the president and ... earlier from Donald Trump junior\nNeed to be put in context of a more recent history than even the Central Park five you know um you'll remember that the phrase ultra right on that it's it's something we we no longer talk about it now just the Republican Party but at one point it was the alternative to the Republican Party you know what I mean the rights that what it was gathered\nA that that's what had gathered itself around to be was to be an alternative to uh George Bush style Republican Party and that movement\nReally was a coming together of a few a digital spaces that were dominated by young white men who were very upset one of them was white supremacist white nationalist some of the Richard Spencer ... Andrew Anglin breed um\nBut an in some of them were the far right libertarians but to the groups that were core parts of the right one was something that's made it was fear idea\nI'm a vets um there were all of these guys who are many of whom were made a lot of money in self help books and self help pod cast a four men are and they started off talking about sort of weight lifting and things like this my sort of issue was\nThe mastermind behind the the pizza gate where people right that was my sort of had she now works for him for wars\nBut he is one of the kings of this NATO sphere\nThem they it was All right was coming together of that\nThat online presence with the white nationalist and so this aggrieved male identity thing has always been a core part of that in politics and that is Donald Trump's world that is certainly don't Trump juniors world that it's unapologetic we always been where he's coming from health and this has to be expecting\nA Lexus I just you know it's um something I Want to kind of correcting the question the way you posed seven and I think you're just drawing on the president's on words here is the idea that somebody\nYoung men should be afraid of being falsely accused student adjustment to say for being accused of something I I the false pieces as a biased and the question I think and the president's perspective is that\nCabin eyes an innocent man who's been falsely accused of something which you know really doesn't jive even with the testimony we heard last week in which basically he\nActed like a person who wasn't so much being accused of something false as somebody who's passed with more catching up with him and he was being held responsible for his actions is that there should be consequences\nInstead of drill down even more specifically I think ... absolutely right pointing to the genesis of the Trump\nConstituency but also the fact that we have this reckoning with what it means to be particularly white and male and privileges in America and this idea that now maybe there isn't a separate set of rules for those people is coming into focus\nAnd that's very scary for everybody who's been in power this whole time\nAnd I love the cat when I talked about her to get into Yale with any help it grandfather is buried at Yale which again you don't just end up being buried at you you get that they they just ... the idea that that would not occur to him to be a privilege is what was so interesting to me in that moment the unseen\nLet's go to coy in Asheville North Carolina coy thank you for calling into America on the line\nYou for having me I just wanted to say a couple of things number one\nUh I think President Trump's remarks were totally off color and a tone deaf of the situation that being said I Would fall you accused of sexual assault in college\nI started dating a girl who my friend told me was that news at the mental issues um but you know I thought you stretch show uh we were dating and one night we you know and it got drunk and\nUm [noise] the next day she called me and said that I had sexually assaulted her and my personal idiot reaction was oh my\nChoir you still there and\nYou're you're you're breaking your ... can you hear me\n\nOkay looks like we we have lost we have lost coy um who is\nA said that he thought that the president's comments were tone deaf I'm an off color but was relating his uh his experience of being falsely accused of of sexual assault\nAnd we didn't get to the the the finish that story let's go to Christine also in North Carolina in Greensboro North Carolina Christine welcome to America on the line\nWell thank you good evening so\nGo ahead\nNo you're the caller is what's on your migrants did\nA couple of things that I Want to talk about what could that caused it I think in in terms of the president's ... statement at an early ... and ludicrous that he may think that we don't have the justice system that can weed out false at a ...\nA sexual assault so I don't they are\nAn educator and the United states and as a victim of sexual assault if I had my ass off and I would hope that our justice system is confident enough to find those things just like if you were falsely accused of murder ...\nOr ... of grand theft auto anything of that nature those things where did that in the judicial system and as the president of the free world should know that\nIncreasing your second ... and the second point\nThe second point is that he I'm going on with Alex's set on Alexa I'm Alexis Grinnell that mhm\nYeah on which ... which is that his statements should be that it is a scary time for a white man in America because that point of privilege not being accused never be questioned that good old boy and then tally it's finally a crank going at it seems and\nThis has been seen by all other um\nGroups that have been marginalized\nThat this is a a\nProblem for that this has nothing to address and finally the curtain on being put out from underneath them and yeah it is a scary time cut down but it because the current has finally can hold on\nChristine great and powerful odd\nChristine I Want to thank you very much for calling into America on the line we've got a ... minute ... seconds left before we have to go to our break let me go to ... go go to Sam and just get your reaction your reactions to the two calls we just got\nWell I I just think it goes back to just though he held him to interact with other people just\nA little bit of common courtesy is involved in it but let me go to the President Trump promoted his remarks is managed to take a country that was moving toward being divided and make its just create chasm between us\nAnd I don't know you know how that gets better I mean I think we're resilient enough in the short term to to deal with it but some of the long term ramifications of what he's done word truth is truth is real alternative facts of the sort of thing I like it was truly damages for\nWe're going

Ford\nTalking about how he was being assaulted it was hard not to be thinking about the fact that these words came from Christine Blasey Ford and imagining her saying them so I Wonder if this experiment might work better in the future when the real proceedings aren't as fresh perhaps in our minds\nAnd also this was actually very interesting to think about it was pretty clear that the hundred or so people in the audience last night\nPretty unanimously already believe judge Kavanaugh is hysterical\nSo maybe it might be more interesting to see of his supporters would be swayed by saying his words come from a woman\nA unlikely unlikely um what else does it reveal what else did you\nTake away the ... I think for at least some people outside the unexpected revelation wasn't actually mainly about gender it was that if you take those words of the transcript and divorce it from the drama of the actual hearing\nYou realize how much of what was said and how it was said just seems incredibly over the top and sometimes just bizarre and I have I think a good example this is Brenda Kevin ... speaking quote unquote and it devolved into this unhinged where'd salad basically\n[noise]\nWant to hearing and I said well anything I ...\nIt seems that\nWhen an ordinary way I\nDid the hell of an inch confidently which is what you're poor wages were and I understand it I I\nWouldn't have confidence like my dream my family\n[noise]\n\nYou can hear your little laughter there and I don't know if it's kind of uncomfortable laughter or real laughter and then also what happened with Lindsey Graham did do some of his questioning get read by women as well yeah\nAbsolutely was read by a woman and got similar reaction actually abroad reaction there was a lot of laughter when Kevin or in some of the senators were speaking there's a moment like that at the beginning of the transcript where senators grassland Feinstein try to score political points even off the way Dr Ford is being introduced\nThat got a huge laugh and it just it felt like watching Dr strangelove in a way of these very powerful people in a very intense situation doing the juveniles sparring and I spoke to a few people in the audience after the show and several of them share the sentiment of this woman her name is ...\nI didn't know what to expect going in I was like I'm either going to walk away feeling Crowder angry and I feel like neither of those things right now I think I'm just mostly shocked at how\nSilly so much of that was like listening to it all there was a lot that was just really childish and and sort of out of character for what I Would hope that people running our country fled for that [noise]\nSo you have to take away from me I guess is that it is saying something about our modern moment that the actual transcript of a Senate committee hearing basically comes off as political satire\nAnd this
