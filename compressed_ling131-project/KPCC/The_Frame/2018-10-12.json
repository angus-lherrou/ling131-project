impossible it may be impossible to imagine\nA more bizarre scene than what occurred today at the White House when the press corps was brought into the oval office to listen to a ten minute monologue\nFrom Kanye West joining me now from the ... from Washington to talk about the event and more consequential news is Washington Post reporter Eugene\nScott Eugene thank you very much for being on America on the line thanks for having me\nSo I Want to start with I'm Serious news and that is um the latest on our colleague Jamal ...\n... according to a pie Georgia's population is approximately thirty two percent black\nBut the list of voter registrations on hold 'em by camps office is nearly Seventy percent black but this is disproportionately affecting black motive is that also the case in other states where we're seeing this happened this being voter\nPurges ... what a coincidence right uh so what you've seen all across the country\nWe know that the vote is the heart of democracy we know also that in the past decade there's been a wave of new laws to make it harder for people to vote for the first time since the Jim Crow era in twenty three states\nAnd these new laws absolutely disproportionately hit hardest ah communities of color young people poor people\nThis kind of law that ah the the love it basically is disenfranchisement by typo if there's even a dash missing in your name or any other error in entry suddenly that's deemed maybe it'd be voter fraud and you're you're no longer registered this law\nHas been declared illegal in many places all over the country Georgia is one of the only states that still has a law like this\nAt the same time you see these purges\nNow you want to make sure the voter rolls or clean you don't want dead people on them but there has been a frenzy of purging voters off the rolls especially in the states that were covered by the voting rights and and as you know in twenty Thirteen the Supreme Court gutted the voting rights act\nAnd ever since then Georgia and other states that had been covered by the strongest provisions of that law have been purging at a much higher rate than the rest of the country in a much higher rate than they ever had before it's a there's good reason to think that this is not an accident\nAnd in one of the stories I saw today just before we came on on the air it involves Indiana\nWhere they've been going through voter purges and there was some astounding number I mean the headline I have is Indiana purged twenty thousand voters using a Chris Kovacs cross check system which I Want to ask you about a moment but the number is up to four hundred something thousand people have been purged from the voter rolls in Indiana\nI'm Christina or or or Michael talked about this this interstate cross check system that is the brainchild of Kris Kobach and for listeners who may not know Kris Kobach was um secretary of state of Kansas and who was the one who ...\nThan the now inoperable a voter fraud commission task force that President Trump\nUm impaneled in then disbanded when he came into office\nRight well I think you know what Michael is reminding is is that you know we're still voting without the full protection of the voting rights act and you know we saw this than twenty sixteen and we're going to see it again and twenty teens so that is a great concern I think what's going on Indiana\nAnd places like Georgia which is really troubling is that you know when we said just a dash is out of place and it can your name is completely annexed bunch from the rules that also disproportionately affects Latino voters who may have hyphenated last name\nSo that hype and is not there and so there's a gap between the name then that person is that is expunged many people don't know that they're even expunged and so when they do go to vote this type of a discouragement can also turned into a form of voter intimidation which we often time seeing in the south if we remember at brand kept also has a\nCampaign ad with him you know rounding up by truck for him to round up all the way\nAnd we quote unquote legal um I don't like the term uh but we've also heard stories from twenty sixteen about people don't do the polls armed that will also discourage people so we have some institutional factors and it's an ex turnout ... that will just\nIt affects them and let's also remember when Stacey Abrams worked for the non profit news when we worked with a nonprofit the New Georgia project they registered over two hundred thousand Georgians over say the past decade or so\nFrank is well aware of that and he he knows that he can't win it out right and so he has to make sure he takes people out of the race because ... has been traveling the state of Georgia and not just Atlanta and that just making in the big cities to really make her case not just a black Georgians because they're not enough\nBuilding eligible black Georgian but to poor people middle class people upper class folks all throughout the state and her message is resonating and that is why can't is is really moving forward that this pretty aggressive agenda to explain to people from the girls\nAnd and it's worth noting that Kris Kobach who orchestrated this system called cross check where uh it it's supposedly says oh we think this person might be improperly registered and it's full of errors and ... states have pulled out of it because of that\nKris Kobach like camp is running for governor he is both the referee and the player\nAnd co back is\nA notorious as a hobby almost he he went around the country are trying to pass anti immigrant was he's been pedaling the false idea that there's massive widespread voter fraud in the United states and therefore we need to restrict\nThe right to vote the commission that he orchestrated blew up the ... the White House commission a you the members of the commission began suing each other and it's if it's found no evidence of widespread fraud\nAnd even in his home state of of Kansas there was a lawsuit challenging his purge practices\nAnd the judge ruled against him and ordered him to go back to a lawyer school to get remedial legal education because he had so botched this and uh it was quite an extraordinary rebuke of of his entire a hit his entire operation\nYou know in July I Believe it was I'm Michael your center at the Brennan Center for justice issued a report detailing the national scope of voter purging in the u._s. you talked about some but how widespread are we talking is is a fifty state\nProblem or is this the localized meaning is this just the south\nIt's nationwide and again removing names from the rolls is not necessarily itself a bad thing they're voting rules are full of ... and we want to make sure that\nOnly eligible people are able to vote and that it's accurate\nBut the way this is too frequently done all over the country is without\nAdequate notice to people to make sure that they are aren't accidentally removed and again in the south especially the states that were covered by the voting rights act a very suspicious surge in purges after the law was gutted\nThere are so many answers bipartisan answers that could fix this we have a voter registration system that is still antiquated now Thirteen states have passed something called automatic voter registration\nA and Washington DC and ... under that system you're automatically registered to vote if you ah interact said with the DMV in your state unless you opt out\nAnd that makes it possible to keep the lists and keep them clean and keep them accurate and without so many of the problems and without the potential for manipulation a bipartisan which is what we're seeing now that we're seeing these\nAt this happened in Georgia Ohio Kansas Indiana North Carolina Florida all states controlled by Republicans um any states with a\nDemocratic governor a democratic legislature doing as well I I can speak to you from my home and the great state of Brooklyn [laughter] or ... or ... thousand of people were dropped from the rolls because of incompetence or worse ... local officials we need to upgrade and modernize the way we run elections if we take our democracy seriously\nI think you know we also need to remember that it's it's not just Republicans I mean there are a lot of Democrats who also don't want new people\nOn the Brussels either just because so many districts the primary is the election right so they don't want nobody nobody's that isn't bad and they're they're happy with that too that we need to stay vigilant on across parties as\nWell Michael Waldman thank you very much for joining us tonight Christina you'll be back later in the show time for a break when we return young people

P. C. C.\nTo the frame I'm John horn thanks for joining us in the wake of the two thousand and sixteen election it's fair to say that many people reconsidered their relationship to politics\nThe hosts the podcast keeping at sixteen hundred went a step further\nThey created a new podcast called pods save America and whether they launched the company crooked media now they produce ten pod cast and tonight they air the first four live pod save America shows on HBO the hosts are former members of the Obama administration and their political bent is no doubt progressive\nThere Dan Pfeiffer a strategist and former director of communications Tommy ... who worked in communications and national security\nAnd the speechwriters John ... wrote and Jon Lovett we recently visited the crooked media offices in LA just sit down with the to Johns and fabricate started with what they can do with a pod cast they couldn't do working in politics we might be reaching\nA different audience um or at least more expansive audience than if we were on a Senate campaign on a congressional campaign I'm just ... and and look that's sort of the nature of\nA bunch of people started listening since we started positive America now we have this this big audience and\nWe talk about giving people an on ramp to politics and so there's a lot of people who've never been involved in politics before\nWho if they hear a bunch of people I'm joking around about politics making it entertaining making it fun they might start listening to a pod cast\nAnd they might not listen closely if say like the DNC puts out a press release or some candidate puts out a press release you know and so I think there is a media function I'm to what we're doing obviously that because we have this larger audience now than we might be able to bring more people into the process\nYou have shared on the pod how crooked media was started with you're going to the bank with I think a hundred bucks on a play a little bit of that recollection that you shared with your audience\nA year ago John ... and I were sitting around the kitchen table\nJohn's house thinking you're talking about kitchen table issues I'm located table of wages they're helping you know we went to a bank of America with a hundred dollar bills and he said what was her name give us Olga Olga\nHelga I'll go he's the one where it was all this story and we gave when we ... we gave we said oh the here's a hundred dollars we like to start a bank account for a little company called ... the media were just three guys with a pod cast idea through both of those uh we gotta we gotta pun ... dream [laughter]\nAnd then a hundred and something episodes\nLater here we are now you've got a big office you've got what a almost a dozen pod cast now yeah ten pac has got HBO shows you've got merge you've got live shows international tours obviously that probably wasn't the plan or to the outcome you're expected so soon so what do you think's driving it\nWell we didn't go into this plan I mean we really didn't and I think it here for ... yeah I mean that was our plan I think we I think we felt to things really deeply one that the conversation around politics was broken into the Trump becoming president was a national crisis and we want it to be involved\nAnd we bet that there were a lot of people out there that felt the same way we did that they felt as though the conversation around politics was often very self serious without levy feeling like you not only understand what's going on but know what to do about it the way we talk about it sometimes as\nThere's incredible reporters and anchors and journalism on television is is not a too broad a brush but at times when you're watching puppetry no matter what medium and\nYou feel like you're being talked to last like a frustrated participant and more like a cynical observer and we want it to make sure that we're always talking to people as frustrated participants that you're not some disconnected person out there were all part of this fight\nYou're three thousand miles or so from Washington do you think there's a perspective that the geographic location of crooked media gives you as thinkers as pod casters in the way you approached stories\nI think anywhere outside of Washington gives you the prospect of any anywhere outside of Washington and New York and we you know we've been there I Lived there for ten years you not only watch all the same media watch all the same cable news programs read all the same stuff you also see all those people socially or when you're out and about or through work\nAnd so it is all the same reporters talking to all the same political staffers talking to all the same pundits and there's a group think\nThat still exists and media for anyone who uses Twitter for sure no matter where you live but it is way more intense in Washington DC that it is outside\nA pod cast is I think by definition intimate I mean here we are talking around this round table and when you're doing something public like a live show it's a very different kind of set of rules so I Would play something ... you said in a pod a little more than a year ago it was right after the Las Vegas shooting\nWhich so frustrating about this is this will happen again oh this is the worst whenever it won't be for a long it won't be wrong more people will die and and and then you'll see the politicians have there's just no words ... why don't you have words why why you are you surprised you shouldn't be\nShouldn't be surprised at all it's going to happen again it's going to happen in a month this is giving somebody else an idea somebody is going to watch this and they're going to have the idea and nothing's going to stand in their way\nJon Lovett I remember listening to that in my car and I drove to exit past where I was supposed to get off because I was with you in that moment how did you were Cain what is so important to a lot of listeners of the pod when you're doing a live show is it even possible to have that kind of personal connection\nThe truth is you asking this question is the first time I've ever thought about that distinction between the intimacy of the studio and what happens on stage in terms of connecting with people because I think\nOne of the reasons that the live shows have been successful the reason I think people come to them is because\nThey feel like listeners and they want to be part of this community of people that are all listening I mean yeah when we do it in front of a a an audience there's applause and there's laughter and you can hear that um but I think one of the goals of the live shows kind of have the same honest conversation\nIn front of people as we do when there's nobody there and in terms of what that clip was I mean one of the things about this ... whether it's a live show or not as it's a chance to really talk about how you're feeling right then and that's what that was\nComing up on the frame more with Jon Lovett and John ... their pod cast pod save America airs a live show on HBO tonight\n[noise] this then he'll laugh [noise] then then [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] what is the president's promise were we going to end terminate repeal Obamacare and replace it I Will build a great great wall\nOn the cusp of the midterms we take a look at what's worked and what's falling flat
