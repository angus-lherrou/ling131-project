[noise]\nWelcome to the frame I'm John horn thanks for joining us when someone dies and there are assets to be divvied up among airs there's always a possibility that things will get messy and the case of the dispute over James Brown is at stake the godfather of sold died in two thousand and six messy doesn't even begin to describe it\nRound was married four times disputes between his children grandchildren his fourth wife and their one son have led to more than a dozen law suits\nTheir questions about how much brown intended to give to charity and about the legitimacy of his last marriage add to that the intricacies of copyright law and it gets very very complicated Hollywood Reporter senior editor Eric Gardner explained the questions surrounding Brown's fourth marriage\nJames Brown married a woman named ... who was secretly married to another fellow who in turn which secretly married with three other women what happened was that in Nineteen Ninety seven\nTony re married a Pakistani man who asked at the wedding ceremony had told her that he uh he was already married three women\nPakistan evidently he well he wanted was citizenship in the United states and that's why the marriage occurred and then\nAnd then he departed so a few years go by and James Brown Mary's is where men and then she tells him that big secret and that causes a big fight in in the marriage and questions about whether or not they are truly married and that question has been going on for for more than a decade now\nAnd unlike prince James Brown did in fact have a will but are there issues with his will or what's the problem there\nJames rounded habit will but uh it was never a updated during a the marriage with told me right so after he died she petition the court to alter it she claimed that she was the surviving spouse and as\nSuch she would be entitled to pretty much half of the states or the other children and grandchildren from James browns marriages\nDon't like this they you know question whether the marriage was legit or the administrators for the estate she had had questions so there's been a ... big battles for the last decade about about the nature of this marriage\nAnd it seems clear to from a cursory reading of the coverage of us will that James Brown wanted to give the money away and yet it doesn't seem as if any money has been distributed yet is that correct\nYeah in his will he earmarked a big portion of his uh his estate to go to\nA scholarship for needy children um because of this fight which has taken place for twelve years now and it's still ongoing all the money has gone to legal expenses there has been one penny Kate out to charity\nThere are more than a dozen lawsuits over his estate is there a common theme at least to some of them\nThe common theme that we're seeing is that you know it's a it's just a big masters all these sorts or interpretations of of you know what constitutes a a marriage and you know how to divide assets and\nThere's so many mouse to see it in so many people objecting um you know it it it it's just a big\nBig mess um you know because there's charity involved we even have the involvement of of the attorney general in South Carolina\nI'm and everyone has just been trying to figure this out that try to get this elements at certain points but you know within the state that is valued up to a hundred million dollars is a lot at stake so there's a lot of fighting\nIt safe to say that his music is now and will continue to generate royalties on top of the valuation\nOf the state now but it also sounds as if there is some copyright issues involving the state you wrote a little bit about termination writes what's the issue there and how does that affect the estate\nShore well as everyone knows the term of copyright is pretty long there are songs\nAnd books and other creative work from the late twenties on that are still under copyright when Congress decided that they were going to extend the copyright term they said\nTo themselves well you know perhaps we should give benefits to the authors who actually created these works what usually happens is you're a young law there\nI Want to make it in the industry so you you sign up for the rights she works for for you know very little um and now those rights to publishers are studios under determination provisions of the copyright law and author or is Eric is allowed to reclaim those rights\nDuring the later years of of the a copyright term in what Congress wanted was not very easy way\nFor you know studios are publishers to manipulate it so that these termination writes whip\nThe signs away [noise] so what we have here in the James Brown\nA case our air is who you know theoretically have these termination interests and\nAnd you know the question is about you know who gets to exploit them and\nIf they're not exploited can there be deal making that in that happens that you know bolsters one party to the detriment of another um it's very it's a very tough issue very unsettled and we haven't really seen anything like this in a court of law yet\nThis is now twelve years into a legal fight is there any sign that any progress is being made on any of the cases can we see this wrapped up in the next year or two or is it going to go on well beyond that\nQuite the opposite you know a ... a few years ago one might say that that the parties were nearing a settlement with the latest developments including a new style last year we are certainly years and years away from any sort of resolution um you know the thing seems to\nBe getting more complicated not less it's going up on appeal or new lawsuits and being brought 'em there's absolutely no end in sight as of\nRight now they're a gardener is a
