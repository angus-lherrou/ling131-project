Jackson's bills for\nAddressing the term employer for sexual harassment because an employer for me if you look at it technically would be my\nPayroll company and I never meet anyone from a payroll company but people that can affect my career I directors and producers and casting directors agents all of these people have the ability to jumpstart\nOr kill a career and so you make people in in terms of that\nVulnerable to sexual harassment into an imbalance of power and so that one was very important to me um because something of that nature happened to me early on in my career and shifted the direction of my career\nI moved away from film and television and concentrated on doing television commercials and doing other things and so that was close to my heart\nAnd then there were as the Thirteen hundred and other bills that target\nThe culture of abuse that happens to silencing their retaliation and the excusing of say that we were calling it the one free grow you know you come forward you say it's been sexually\nMolested or harassed in the workplace and they say okay well this is not going to be acceptable moving forward and so he just\nEssentially employers had this leeway and ability to\nInvite this ongoing harassment in the workplace\nOne of the reasons I think that a lot of survivors of sexual assault in Hollywood are silent and there's a number of factors of one of them is because they feel compelled to sign in and da\nDa and exchange for a financial settlement they agreed not to comment and as we age twenty well specifically bans secrets settlements are MDAs in cases of sexual assault sexual harassment and sex discrimination why do you think that's important well\nI think that whenever they're secrecy it creates vulnerability so the the nondisclosure as they were were always protecting the abuser\nBut moving forward I think\nWhen we ship the perspective from protecting the abusers to protecting survivors were going to give people\nThe opportunity to get their voices back to get their their stories told and to to create an opportunity for educating and advocating for for this to stop happening\nOne of the things that I think is very important to talk about and I'm not sure if this is something that can be addressed through legislation\nIs that when the charges raised against Harvey Weinstein Les Moonves there was a similar story and that was that if you said anything about them or fought off attacks your blacklisted is that still a concern that people who speak out are jeopardizing their careers\nWell there's absolutely the risk of that happening but this legislation is\nA glass ceiling break I think for vulnerable people in California and I think it's going to allow for people to find their voice stand up and say enough this happened to me you know and of course there is a concern about that and I\nI had to weigh that when coming full year ago um and I just thought this isn't just about one story and one person and what happened to me it's really about changing\nThe whole Plainfield leveling it out and saying this is not how we're going to go to work anymore\nSean tall cruising though is an actress and an advocate
