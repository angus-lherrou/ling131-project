[noise]\nAnd this slightly less violent film\nWe're joined\n\nBy\nThose are seen from two relatively recent movies the first was taken from two thousand and eight the second was Billy Elliot which came out in two thousand\nThe first movie of violence filled hostage drama was rated PG Thirteen by the motion picture association of America gave the rating for quote intense sequences of violence\nDisturbing dramatic material sexual content some drug references and language unquote\nBilly Elliot a movie about a young boy who wants to become a ballet dancer was given an R rating by the NBA the rating the MBA I said was for language nothing else simply a few too many F bombs\nThe modern movie rating system is turning fifty this week the NBA is marking the anniversary\nWith a new report about the history of ratings\nReport includes a survey of parents and kids about the ratings spoiler alert they liked them and video interviews with key figures in movie ratings one such interview is with Joan Graves she heads the MPA ratings division which is called the classification and ratings administration so how do you go about writing I\nFelt today well to board a parents or their chosen when their kids are between the ages of five and ... and they're on the board from our last seven years\nAnd they um they live in Los Angeles why they're on the board we screen the film together and immediately after the found a traitor a give us a rating on it I pat and then\nWithout talking to the others and then the thing you read or collects the vote announces it and then a discussion as had about how people feel about the rating how they were very strong felt very strongly about their position or was\nKind of equivocal and then out of that discussion comes the reading and the descriptor which has given to this matter\nWhat John graves does not discuss is who actually rates the movies the documentary filmmaker Kirby Dick in his movie the film is not yet rated investigated the makeup of the movie raiders\nHe also concluded that the MPA penalize is independent films with more restrictive ratings than studio productions that have very similar content\nThe modern movie rating system was put together by former MPA had jak for Lenny on November first Nineteen sixty eight it replaces what was known as the motion picture production code which banned in a ray of themes scenes in dialogue\nThe code forbid blasphemy profanity and nudity and even said quote last full embraces suggestive posture and gestures or not to be shown\n[noise] that's why do some of the ... it was a movie ratings symbols which will be used by this theaters we present the following guy for parents and young people\nThe first NBA classifications had for ratings\nOnly just admitted general audience of genes ... all ages admitted parental guidance suggested are restricted under Seventy and requires a company to do this no wonder under Eighteen admitted\nIn later years the MPA replace the X ray with the NC Seventeen mark and edit the PG Thirteen rating in Nineteen eighty four it came on the heels of Indiana Jones and the temple of doom but [noise]\n[noise]\nAnd this film gremlin both of which were rated PG but had a lot of scary [noise]\n\n\nOf the rating system say the MBA I get several things wrong first it penalize is important movies that should be seen by teens by assigning them an R rating\nAlmost always because they have more than one F bomb which is often an automatic are those movies include Billy Elliot the king's speech boyhood and the documentary bully second movies with tons of violence and disturbing images\nBut in a miserable number of swear words are rated PG Thirteen and that list would include World War Z the dark Knight and taken\nFinally there's something called the ratings creep and that's when movies I Would have been rated one way a few years ago are now rated differently\nObviously case and morals evolve the motion picture production code from the fifties\nAnd forbidding of lustful embraces looks absurd today but what's not as funny as when movies that would have been rated R a few years ago for violence are now rated PG Thirteen in fact there's more gun violence today in PG Thirteen movies\nThan in R. Rated releases here's Dan Romer the research director of the Annenberg public policy center who visited the frame last year to talk about the issue\nWas is something we've noted than in some of our other research that uh the PG Thirteen category has gotten increasingly violent and what used to be called our as today called PG Thirteen these films are open to anybody with no supervision required\nAnd so we worry that they can really send the wrong impression and we read all the time about kids being exposed to guns and using them\nIf you show parents uh segments of these movies are\nOne of the time after they've watched three or four of these they begin to think it's not so bad that one of their own kids could watch such a thing even if they're under Seventeen and so the PG Thirteen category becomes even more plausible to a parent under those conditions\nSo happy anniversary MBA but maybe it's time to give yourself a rating rather than just reading movies and the ... we give you is N.
