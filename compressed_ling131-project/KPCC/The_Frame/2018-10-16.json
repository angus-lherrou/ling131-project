public radio stations across the country [noise]\nGood evening everyone good afternoon in Hawaii I'm Brian Lehrer infer Jonathan Capehart tonight and tomorrow night every Monday through Thursday through the mid term elections this program is bringing you the latest political news and analysis\nAnd we are listening to your thoughts and feelings and questions about the issues that matter most to you and tonight we have lots of issues on the agenda and I'm In love\nWith as many as a hundred fifty initiatives on the ballot in thirty eight states issues ranging from hunting rights\nTo voting rights we will get to this year's bumper crop dealt with questions later in the hour but we begin as we do every evening with the news that's affecting our politics today for example\nWe have President Trump sowing confusion on the disappearance of Jamal could show gee in a very similar way to how he shows confusion about Russia\nWe have Elizabeth one revealing that she accepted Trump's challenge to take a DNA test to prove that she has some Native American blood and if she does he said he would donate a million dollars to the charity of her choice spoiler alert\nAnd later it says it makes a mockery out of DNA tests and it's legitimate uses well also dishonor in legitimate tribal governments in their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and who's her to is proven Senator Warren is undermining tribal interests\nHe writes with her continued claims of tribal\nHeritage I'm amber did she not\nThat this whole thing well enough or is this gonna backfire on her politically\nYou know I was actually wondering that same question they Brian I think Emily made such a good point she said look more into the to push back\nAgainst insults Trump to leveling at her\nInsult that she clearly think could be politically damaging a but in the process she's kind of ...\n... ... lay by Trump's game in a way by saying okay you know what you want to you want to call me a derogatory term for Native Americans Pocahontas a well fine let's play that game how Native American and by and then\nThroughout the day she said we you know reminding\nThe president had promised a million dollars to Native American charity if if she took a DNA test and\nUh you know there are ways for Republicans to slice and dice the numbers and they have and say oh you're no more Native American than the rest of us in there and it's totally understandable that\nCherokee Nation and representatives of the name American community would feel like she's taking this using this moment is a political pawns for her benefit I'm sure that's right see the risk it it just feels like Elizabeth Warren is kind of playing Trump's game right now\nBrian Lehrer infer Jonathan Capehart on America on the line tonight with amber Phillips from the Washington Post and Emily Bazelon from the New York times magazine\nAnd with a new Washington Post ABC news poll shows lots of Americans excited to vote next month most of all women under forty from my reading of the poll saying they are certain to vote\nA that's up by a whopping thirty two points from the same poll just before the twenty fourteen mid term elections for women under forty\nPart of that poll is findings about how the Brett Kavanaugh Christine Blasey Ford spectacles affecting everyone's eagerness to vote could you break up those results\nYeah absolutely you jumped on the key point women I Want to vote and they lean democratic we already knew that from several other calls that women want about are more likely vote Democrat or Republican I many fourteen percentage point where men\nTend to lean Republican or Democrat but it by like a five to six percentage points on and so after the Kavanaugh hearings what this call's really captured is enthusiast than going out\nA among independents\nAs well as women toward the Democratic party um and not because you have a majority of Americans not recruiting of cabinet are\nSitting on the court and small majority of Americans it's about fifty percent which when you break it out a way from registered voters I think that they want camping out to be investigated by a Democratic Congress which than\nThey're willing to vote Democrat in the first place and so I was talking to some operative today are trying to help Democrats keep the Senate or take back the Senate which is going to be a struggle a and they were saying they feel like enthusiasm factors leading their way despite conventional political wisdom\nThat the Senate pretty much in Republican hands they pointed to the point that no I I think we're going to get a lot of our people asked about it like North Dakota Indiana and Missouri in West Virginia\nEmily you as a Supreme Court\nThe obviously followed the Kavanaugh hearings closely what do you think it means if these numbers are accurate we're seeing Kevin are still more unpopular than popular but an indication that Republican turnout might be higher next month as a result of the whole thing plus everything that amber just said\nWhen I'm curious about from you is do you think this says anything larger about the American people's feelings about the me too movement generally or just about this highly partisan standoff\nOh it's it's just more evidence of division rights and the reason it's matters politically is that\nThe Senate is not doesn't reflect majority opinion and a lot of it it all over on America and so we're looking at results in particular states mostly red states where Democrats had an uphill battle and so if Kavanaugh helped Republicans\nBecome more enthusiastic and increases turnout then it could have a disproportionate effect on the composition of the Senate and who wins the house races on the other hand if on you know the vote goes up among Democrats and independents it will matter more there because those are\nRaces where um it's closer and they're they're I'm more of a possibility for democratic gains I feel like\nThe political implications are kind of confounding when you're trying to understand the effective Kavanaugh on the whole country and yet always in the United states given our electrolysis done it's not the national referendum on any particular question that matters that's how it plays out in specific election so I find the whole thing\nNot very satisfying as like a referendum on the me too movement because if you were just looking at that you would look at Kavanaugh's approval ratings and say they're down and that's what matters but that's not that how it's going to play out in the election\nAmber briefly any idea if the Senate Democrats are second guessing themselves about\nHow they play the Kavanaugh bloody forward situation like with this so bent on trying to push a confirmation vote pass the midterm elections that they turned off more people to those very Senate candidates trying to win their races to stop Trump from putting more conservatives on the court at the Senate level\nYeah my sense are starting to operatives in watching senators since those hearings were done is that they felt like they were between a rock and a hard place I mean since Trump nominated cat on July\nSenate Democrats pressured by their base to do everything they could to rent that are getting him on the court was Merrick Garland in Republican do largely sixteen are\nRaking in their ears and and they tried that and then you would ... claims from Christine Blasey Ford came back\nAt the last minute but were introduced to the public sphere in a way that a lot of Republicans to claim\nOr to argue that the Democrats were paying playing politics with it even though there was no evidence of that I've done what I mean by that them directly using this accusation to try to cap and are bringing it out at a particular time um\nAnd at the same time all that was happening you have these red state Democrats like Joe mansion in West Virginia Joe Donnelly of Indiana Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota staying as far away from that that they couldn't because as you point out that not something they want it to ... weeks before the election\nLet me throw in one thing in addition real quick that's kind of related before first break I'm Hillary Clinton in an interview stuck to her position the President Bill Clinton's relationship with intern Monica Lewinsky back in the nineties was not abuse of power listen\nDo you think bill should've resigned President Clinton should've resigned in the nineties in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scan absolutely not so it wasn't an abuse of power now no\nIn thirty seconds and but does it matter this year what Hillary Clinton says and is there a generational split do you think among women or at least democratic women on this\nI think it doesn't matter because the potential twenty twenty presidential candidate like yours and junk ran\nSaying that their party should have been tough on Bill Clinton and essentially disagreeing with Hillary Clinton and so I then we're re litigating this all over again even with the Clintons out of the political culture um but in a way that's dividing the Democratic party so I think that does matter it's not something they're going to let go\nNumber Phillips politics goes funding for the Washington Post thank you so much for joining us tonight\nThank you Emily Bazelon stays with us as

the state we're in this time looking at how states are taking new approaches to health care from lowering prescription drug prices to expanding Medicaid\nWelcome to the frame I'm John horn thanks for joining the counter family of land for Illinois is back on TV Tonight with one glaring absence the former title character of the ABC sitcom Roseanne Connor\nYou probably remember what happened to Roseanne Barr the actress and comedian who co created and starred in the original series and they're very popular re boot earlier this year\nAfter ... posted a racist tweet about former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett ABC fired her in may tonight the show is back or maybe born again re titled the Connors and scrubbed of any connection Jabbar\nThe rain all either TV critic of the LA Times got a preview of the first two episodes of the show I suspected she couldn't but I still asked if she could tell us anything about how the writers of the corners explain Roseanne sudden disappearance\nAre correct I cannot answer you at all on that because there was such a head embargo on information about Britain than going into that the network didn't want a those who are able to see the show ahead of time talking about what happens\nStance we're gonna have to talk in like really vague terms which I'm sure is\nGreat for people to show how I'll ask a specific but vague question and that is was it well handled was the delusion that came up with creative and satisfying even if you can't tell us exactly what it was\nYeah I think they did a really a pretty amazing job with the Connors given what they're up against you know they're coming back with the show\nThat was launched in spun out of Roseanne without Roseanne so the way they dealt with it and the pilot is it's pretty artful and it's also funny and it's also moving\nAnd it's just really interesting without her in the next the kind of new dynamic that arises in the family is entertaining but it's also I'm also a little more interesting than it was before just because we've seen the corners would present for ...\nWell I think you raised a couple of interesting points and that is when Roseanne was fired for her races tweet about Valerie Jarrett the show was the number one series on TV\nSo how much of that appeal was tied to her specifically and without her on the show does it feel as if it's an extension or a completely new thing\nWell initially I think the appeal was Roseanne I think you know ... coming back\nBut you know also there was you know Laurie Metcalf replace her sister Jackie in the shadow she has an amazing career that you know she's done a lot of great things in between the time that Roseanne was on the air before and\nThe ... says she was also big draws while but\nI think it was you know seen whereas than in the Trump era you know what does this look like 'em and so many of the things that you know she talked about back in the eighties and nineties or topical now so I think the draw initially was seeing her again I think now with the Congress come back with out her that's also a draw\nYou know how do they handle this with out this really cantankerous cigarette the front of the family\nAnd the dynamic is different it's not the Connors you know kind of copying what they did with Roseanne without Rosanna the max I'm because Roseanne Barr is no longer there with the cast the cast is able to sort of bounce off each other more freely\nCc these really great moments between Laurie Metcalf replace her sister Jackie and Sarah Gilbert who plays Darlene residents daughter they really kind of step up into the strong female Raul and some of their exchanges are hysterical and overall the writing is really funny as well so\nYou kind of see it more natural dynamic between the other characters whereas bar was always the one we kind of relied on to deliver the punchline now that's next around the whole cast in it and it creates really kind of different slow around that kitchen table\nThere was criticism in some circles that ABC's firing of Roseanne was Hollywood punishing a Trump supporter does the show without her still retain some political diversity well people who voted for Trump to find something to like or a character to root for\nYou know it's so funny that we can find anything it's divisive right now I mean even in Roseanne even you know a sitcom has developed um I don't necessarily agree with the idea that you know ABC was punishing her for being a Trump supporter there's many reasons why\nThat doesn't quite work with you know the way that resent arrive when it came back in the food and the way that she went down I don't think really has a whole lot to do\nWith her supporting Trump\nBut at this point the Connors\nAre more about universal issues I'm so far I've seen two episodes but the two episodes what I've seen the Connors are more about you know personal issues rather than political issues\nI'm sure they talk about the lack of health care they talk about you know low wages and unstable jobs and things like that but there's not as much you know about Trump specifically or about Islam or ... yards and the things they talked about before an rather than I'm In the corner so far\nI think it's probably pretty obvious that without rosy on the show is not likely to be as big a ratings hit as it was before but could have become a better show in some ways\nHave the show creators been forced to ask themselves what the ... really is about and could it be that they are now going to make something that is even better than it was when it came back the first time\nThat's a really good question I actually think it is better I think what I've seen so far is better than what I saw the Roseanne ... which which I liked the Rosanna though\nI think you're right and that uh that I think the idea that they do that I think the idea that the writers do have to figure out what the show is really about the kind of happening before eyes now that Roseanne isn't there taking up all around I think out of the gate\nThere may be curiosity in terms of what's going to look like the ratings might be high I don't know but I think it is a better show already just because the writing sharper and the cast has room to breathe\nMarine Ali is the TV critic for the LA Times rain thanks so much for coming back on the show\nThank you John\nThe
