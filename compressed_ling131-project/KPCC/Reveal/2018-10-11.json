such a great second coming as a character actor Linda Holmes I I don't want us to end this conversation without giving him his his high five I really liked Andrew dice clay in this movie and as soon as I realize that with him\nI got happy I was like this is great and he's got a great character and he just he's he's in it he was terrific to me uh okay\nI mean we know hold on to do what you there's more to get injured eyes but you didn't like him\n[laughter] it's not that I mean I perhaps and as hearing me a little bit on [laughter] and I and gave that reading I I wasn't necessarily looking for an Andrew dice clay career revival I could have done with someone else I think he's finding it that's fine yeah I I didn't need to see him again\nI mean I'm I'm not a fan from his comedy but like I thought he did a good job with that character like he he was that guy can cast anybody not knowing who he wasn't as prior life I thought he worked\nI suppose yes if we cast aside your entire prior life he sometimes are very smart charming screen hasn't very true very true speaking of that I\nCould have been in the film John I knew were low on time but there had been reports that ... had apparently been in the running to play the character that lady Gaga ultimately got is that true what happened there\nAre very much true and that was in at a ration of the film that at one point Clint Eastwood was going to direct\nA Beyonce was even briefly you're going to be back with the Bradley Cooper version I think actually Lady Gaga is a much better casting choice because I don't know that you could really watch that film but beyond say and I keep saying to yourself\nThat's the that's beyond say and I think lady\nGaga has a better ability to do in fact Andrew dice clay got that part of our people like Robert De Niro and John ... and John Travolta\nThe one thing I Will say about Andrew dice clay yes he's a horrible massage units that comic\nThat does kind of ... one of the premises of the movie which is that Jack's character said you can't reinvent yourself you can't become this different artists and yet Bradley Cooper changes his voice an octave so he doesn't sound like Bradley Cooper\nAnd Andrew dice clay who has in his comedy been a horrible human being becomes a nice loving father so some of the choices in the movie itself\nBut why jacks complaint that you can't become a different artists as your career progressed\nChurch church but\nWe don't go ahead and go ahead and do an I\nThis is Andrew dice clay plays a loving father who is also however at at patriarch who um himself wished he had been at a famous singer and um you know where he plays as Frank Sinatra lines for last you know people said he was like Frank Sinatra but\nIn a strange way that character replaces the daddy elements of previous a male protect it so like for example the James Mason Norman main character planning on writing Garland um he felt like a daddy he felt much older\nAnd and you know really patriarchal guiding her career I feel like Andrew dice clay character is not entirely sympathetic and this is you know maybe a radical reading but\nI feel like Hey Ryan right this is why

I think the youngest I've been ... probably when I was like ten yeah through not twelve Thirteen and it's just so common and not one of us who his cat called makes quote unquote a big deal about it because we know that it will continue to happen no matter how much we sneak up about it\nHow many of you have\nOr their spirit ... something along the lines of what Christine Blasey Ford testify to or have a friend who told you something\nHappened that made them very uncomfortable\nOne two three four five six seven eight I\nFriends who who happens actually often for half and race and\nThey don't like it was it on the whole scenario there's always like one specific things that they remember that you can see the day like it makes their skin color get affects them mentally so much like what she said that was the one thing that like always affected her ... laugh\nLynn Sam wack [noise]\nNo I have friends that have had something like this happens to them or worse and they've only gone to me and a select group of people about it because of the fear that nobody's going to believe them that their parents are going to be angry at them for whatever reason", "show_name": "Reveal", "year": "2018", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "11"}
