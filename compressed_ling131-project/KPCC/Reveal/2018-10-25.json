that gets us to a man does point around not having those opportunities so early because of ...\nAnd it's kind of fascinating professor Lewis we we hear a lot about the workforce or the future and how much more it's going to deal with being able to work collaboratively and be creative and work across disciplines and and ... and ... and that's exactly that's exactly what we're working to eight to score will\nNot well not really safe before I'd love to get your reaction to another clip from the documentary series America to me that I think kind of speaks to the inherent difficulty of dealing with anything related with race this is a clip of a white parent that's heard in episode seven of America to me was\nYou know I don't really like being called\nI don't identify as white\nIdentify as a human being\nAnd I heard a conversation recently on the radio you know someone who's African American saying I really really resent when I hear white people saying that they don't like being called white\nI was struck by how something that could make so much sense from my perspective could be so offensive from someone else's perspective right how lucky for you\nWith your white privilege you know the ... you can you deny your skin color or eliminate that from your identity because I don't have delivery to do that\nI can completely understand that but I'm not changing my philosophy based on the other person to\nAnother clip from the series America to me now on one hand\nI think that this guy is kind of if he could use a little more talking too because\nI think you know I mean that's one of the keys of white privilege as you have the privilege of not thinking about being white that the privilege however I also understand where he's coming from I mean I think there are very well meaning white people who want to do something about racial equity\nBut it's so viscerally hard to talk about it from a perspective of you are white and I am black and you're over there and I'm over here\nThere's this desire most people to say hey look let's just like let's get a little bit closer together so we can work together it feels like you can't even deal with issues of racial like what are you in school until we teach the country how to talk about race in the first\nPlace yeah and I think that that seems like a much bigger problem yes I agree with one and that it's one of the really painful parts of watching the documentary right is here's a school that is much more diverse in school I mean our schools are highly segregated cross country and it seems like an ideal place to really develop a real blast racial literacy among our young people\nAnd what you see over and over again is white kids getting to not engage getting tend not getting not pressed to think about these things\nAnd you have black students developing robust racial literacy because they're forced to because they have to navigate these hostile racial places so in some ways that documentary again illustrates the kind of lost opportunity so what you had instead of all these people who managed to get to adulthood\nAnd anytime you have the white folks about race who are adults ... immediately very articulate people become very inarticulate rapidly as soon as you ask them to think about you know race is a subject position we don't get to opt out you know and that and the idea that I can benefit you know the kind of\nHistorical amnesia that we have about our own racial history and our own place in it in this country is remarkable Charles can you\nGive me a million but yeah I was just a comment or we don't do you say ... um yeah definitely I think\nBlack is I think not even just bike is I think students now not even talking about school and I think kids of color in this country\nHave to grow up with like the reason why so prevalent us why race is so prevalent is because I Can't speak for everyone's experience but at least I grew up we precautionary tales of like real life things like I didn't grow up we folk tales ... a lot at our no I was like\nI was like eight years old and my mom was like let me tell you about it I mean to you and I was like okay you know mother innocence of my ... who's ... she's like so new stories like ...\nWait [laughter] and then I just think it was like because no one really gives white kids those types of like you know stories and I think is because like there aren't really those types of stories to actually felt like it was like I don't I don't know about like Ted Bundy if you want to like really realize privileges or not I don't\nKnow you have to go to for those who don't know Emmett Till was a young man who was murdered by a mob and the town of money Mississippi allegedly for whistling on a white woman we did an interview last year with a man named Tim Tyson who wrote a new book\nAbout the Emmett Till case he interviewed that woman Carolyn Bryant who eventually confessed that she lied about accusing Emmett Till of having whistled at her you'll find that\nInterview with Tyson on our website the one eight dot org I Know we got to go but the will to give you one more last word before\nI I just wanted to say one of the things that was interesting about this process of being in the film for subjects and including Brandon's dad who we heard that clip from is the being in this series gave him more opportunity to reflect on and think about and talk about because we've pressed people on these things\nThen he would have in his everyday life and I think the experience of being in this documentary has deepened his understanding to a vet experiences so it's a kind of thing you know we can do a film on people and do it but we we need to do it more in the community\nSteve James the director of the

vanished along with all of the footage the last film didn't reservists until two thousand and eleven when it was returned to tan who by that time had become a novelist\nRather than finish the original movie tanned made a documentary also called sugars and includes original footage from the Nineteen Ninety two film but it also follows hand on her quest to find out who car Dona really was I'm really good\nAt keeping things in my life I kept all major and I was in my letters and and videos and and I became a quarter actually have my own teenage went in my twenties and everything else because when something that huge just stolen from your life you tend to want to keep everything else and and that's that my friends 'cause I was I you know jazz\nMan who accused me of all kinds of things including being harder um and then um one day she like a few years ago she just throws me that's too big ... of\nMy letters to her because she had kept every single one of them and in fact then I could you know I had I had some of that material to using the film and I rewrite somebody letters and I realized what you know became ... with my teenage south the south I had repressed all these years and remember who that person wise that\nThat decided to make sure Chris and obsessed with telling stories and I realized I Am still that very much that same person I just had to peel off as the skin there's this other layer I had you know developed over the than suing decades\nOne of the things that is so fascinating about the movie is that the world that you are living in and growing up and was so repressive artistically that Singapore was a country that was so restrictive you couldn't even chew gum\nAt ... you still can't I guess we can chew gum if you bought it from somewhere like you just got by it there\nBut that as an artist what you weren't able to see and listen to in terms of film and music was so heavily censored that in some ways your artistic life was almost born in response to that that you are rebelling against those things that you couldn't do by doing them yourself\nUm yeah I just think of as a rebellion I was thinking of it as surviving and keeping scene and keeping myself interested in life and that not um you know getting stuff that was going to keep me interested in and ... percent movies or music um\nSo I'm Jenny and I actually live in Venice, California and I'm ... and I live in Minneapolis, Minnesota so\nWe took a picture together and then basically described um what are you are basically who are you what your identity in the blink space than eat\nBut what are you are you a question is the question that makes people get often so I think it's kind of playing off of the common question\nWe took a really long time to figure it out and and decided to go really corny I'm so we like our general ethnic backgrounds next to the picture and then we send mixed babies that met in Minnesota a hundred percent best friends and then he read one hundred percent grass underneath that so [noise]\n\nI'd had people tell me why did you include some schools that are Asian Asian that that's not help I'm like you don't get to tell them who they are I think showing that diversity of like the seven plus million dollars in the U.S\nShowing that there were so it was really important to me I always feel like identity is a completely personal process your right to call yourself what you want to call yourself but no one gets to tell you who you are so basic I said if you want to fall under the rubric of what you think ... is to be part of the project

there's another group of sort of trying to join the caravan as it makes its way north and\nUm we can talk a little bit more about\nThe political stuff when I'm not on the highway with the caravan itself Mm\n\nA large group of people they caught a caravan\nSeven thousand strong is a so called caravan growing to a mile long as it's heading straight to our border\nWhat do you think of this caravan wasting what should the president and the Congress or\nIn the military to the borders to order now the president is trying to bring home a house from victory on November the shakes or at least narrow the losses by leading heavily into this caravan is a threat to national security\nWill be the [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\nAny what exactly is this caravan [noise]\nWe're here and it's difficult to verify but it was\nVery much a grassroots effort that was started through social media ... there were people in three places in Honduras or let's say by\nI think we've got bought and San Pedro Sula through their own social network started telling people that they were going to create this caravan in the north and they converged in San Pedro Sula about ten days ago\nThey say they told the media in hunter is because they wanted people to join for the most part caravans offer people safety in numbers and they told the media and suddenly more and more people started coming together\nTo be ideal is that a large group of people is a protected group of people because this does very much sound like the opposite of how we think of people attempting to sneak into the U.S in small in conspicuous group so it's it's about scale\nYes it's about safety both from drug gangs along the route which have been known to kidnap migrants from Central America\nAnd it's a sense of safety from the Mexican authorities themselves the Mexican government was deported somewhere around Seventy thousand people this year so people have a reason to be afraid that they could be deported if they're caught and there's a sense that was something this big it would look really bad\nIf the government tried to crack down so most people in the caravan has\nDecided not to apply for papers or try to do this in a legal way and they're just moving forward with the sense in in the hope that they'll be allowed to make it all the way to the United states\nNow this happened earlier this year in the spring another caravan made its way north it was only Fifteen hundred people some two hundred actually manage to get in the U.S and that here at the end the trap that attention because of the president's reaction because of President Trump's reaction\nLike I remember those yeah he he called them invaders sent the national guard\nSo many people are making a comparison to that first ... down in the spring but uh oddly a lot of the people who are migrating right now say that they haven't even heard of that earlier caravan", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Reveal", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "25"}
