Pueblo of Laguna citizen\nDeb stay safe on the campaign trail thanks for making time for us you bet thanks so much ... let me come to you as we're winding down I Wonder what your take away from this year's candidate pool both ms Holland and and other candidates particularly\nYou know the the the point that she brought up about the Standing Rock protests and the Dakota access pipeline protest the Keystone excel protests you know the nation was kind of grits by that\nFor a very long time and you know it's that that saga is not quite over\n... ... it's interesting how the conversation has shifted from Native Americans kind of on the protests lines to now Native Americans kind of working the big campaign trails in trying to get into more conventional speech a power\nRight I think that definitely it was true um when a ... for example in ... she was running she cited Standing Rock is one of the reasons and she is not the only candidate who did that you know this is kind of interesting it's ties back to the beginning of our conversation about identity\nAnd one of the extraordinary thing I think about this campaign season with so many candidates\nIs it's introducing people to Native Americans in a very different context suddenly people in communities like Kansas City or looking on TV as seeing a commercial\nWith the native woman in a very professional powerful role and it's very different than the a narrative of a protest or or somebody doing something else or one of my favorite commercials early on was a a Lakota Woman running for attorney general in South Dakota who ran the entire commercial and look up to um\nI think that has a long term effect in terms of what people see and how they perceive I mean the biggest problem with any country in terms of identity as often and visibility and this changes that in a really pronounced way\nKerry living I Wonder what your take ways are from what we heard from Holland or from you know anything in this year's Kennedy\nPool I think this year's candidate pool has been a fascinating land and I would say that Kansas lake\n... are coming out and really establishing themselves as a force in all the way candidates do that they're fundraising has been incredibly strong in this cycle you've got well funded challengers who are I'm running really just smart competitive races all throughout the country\nAnd so I I think you're really seeing the results of that\nAnd it's going to be fascinating to see what happens next month during the elections\nIt's been great hearing some of your stories about understanding your own heritage or you're very tribal heritage is Brad from Marilyn sent us this note using our app won a vox pop I'm\nOne sixteenth Native American morning to the southern Cherokee Nation of Kentucky I only know this because my grandmother's for sure quarter Native American and she did some work to get the records and get us registered with the tribe and I even got a sense a travel ruled card in the mail\nI've heard that I could take advantage of this to get benefits like free health care or use it to clean being Native American instead of white to get around affirmative action type things\nBut I feel that I don't really deserve it since I'm really just white and taking advantage of this would be unfair to actual Native Americans have to deal with real Native American issues so I don't really make a part of my enemy to mention if people\nAre so I'm Sorry grandma but the real card is just a novelty\nWe appreciate you sharing your story with us thanks very much mark I wonder what you make of that particularly this idea of taking advantage there was a story regarding um house majority leader Kevin McCarthy and identity and some programs that are related to Native Americans what what's your thought on that\nWell in that one was an interesting one because of the tribe that they enrolled and really doesn't exist it wasn't a federally recognized tribe I'm certainly there are those that will try to gain the system was things like that um but for the vast majority of folks even things like health care\nOr the Indian Health system is very complex and it's not free health care some of it is prepaid healthcare but it is not I'm kind of the fantasy approach that you think of\nI spend a lot of time working on that right now one of the interesting things is much more of the Indian Health system is funded by Medicaid dollars from the Indian Health service\nBut medicate exactly so you have to qualify goes through the process and show income levels and all of that\nAt least wrote on our Facebook page thank you for this informative show today encouraging to hear there are more Native Americans running especially women\nJoan tweeted you're going to need a bigger show there's way more than an hour's worth of native issue that needs to be discussed eight men to that job and we will not leave this issue behind before we go though more can you just clarify for us exactly what happened with Kevin McCarthy and and this program ah that's set aside for Native Americans we if we can you explain that before we go\nSure there's a ... has set aside program for a ... for native own businesses and you have to be identified as a tribal a citizen for that\nUh and his wife's family and a brother in law I as I understand it were um basically running a company that was taking advantage of those set asides\nReally has has has there been an investigation to that or any kind of\nA trial yet now that it's in the news I think there will be an investigation into that\nI Would imagine so and one more thing before I let you go to our listeners who said that he didn't feel she deserved to take advantage of those benefits that he identified as primarily just whites would you say to him\nWell again that puts it in a racial context instead of a tribal citizen contacts\nAnd if you're a member of a community it's a self governing community that you want to be part of and have this long arc of history\nAnd be supportive of people I mean one of the reasons why there's someone people getting excited by the number of Native Americans running for office right is because they have the shared history there the first time we'll get a discourse\nMark ... editor of Indian country today carry levine senior reporter with the

S. C. N. and bird Norman Lear center and the immigration advocacy organization define American examined the portrayals of immigrant characters on scripted TV series\nThey looked at one hundred and forty three episodes from forty seven different shows in the past couple of years what they found was that a third of the immigrants portrayed on those shows were associated with a crime even though native born Americans actually commit more crimes than immigrants\nFurthermore while Seventeen percent of immigrants in the U.S have a bachelor's degree and another Thirteen percent have some post graduate education on TV only seven percent of immigrant characters are college graduates\nRaphael Augustine as a writer on the cw showed Jane the virgin and a guest column published in the Hollywood Reporter today he said the way to get more accurate portrayals of immigrants on TV as for Hollywood to hire more immigrant writers\nI reach him today on the set of Jane divergent and I asked him about his first reaction to this study\nSadly it wasn't too surprising a I have seen the representation of immigrant communities on our television and I haven't been too happy about it but it wasn't until the Norman Lear center and defining American\nDid the study and found out just how agree just the the numbers are it's incredible that more crime is committed by immigrants\nOn television than in ... immigrants or trade is less educated on television than they are in real life and unfortunately until I Believe show runners have the courage to start hiring more immigrants people of color\nMore women and to our writers and are we going to make a difference\nThere is also the issue of immigration status and according to study on TV immigrants are often undocumented and not naturalized citizens when in fact the exact opposite is actually true that nearly half\nOf American immigrants or naturalized citizens that fewer than a quarter of immigrant characters are on television so what does that say about the status of immigrants in the nation\nThat there's two things under the so wrong narrative that there's a good type of immigrant or a proper type of immigrant to be allowed to be in America versus a hard working day to day regret that American\nWith every aspect of the word except for one the other is I don't believe that we've properly told stories of immigrants who are just simply hard working Americans and don't have documentation that take someone like my my parents my parents while undocumented paid taxes\nEvery year that they were in the United states and da da da da da da da and shit and it was founded on you know what I mean these are the stories I don't believe are being told\nI Want to ask you about a character on Jane the virgin ... grandmother and I want to play a clip from the episode where she becomes a citizen and talks about it afterward at a family party\nAs I studied for my citizenship exam\nI learned about the motto of the United states if you ... on them out of many one and he said that it originated by the famous Roman writer Santo about family and friends\nWhen each person that's the other as much as her ... [noise]\nIt makes one out of Maine\nWhen I ask you how your own experience shaped her story\nI pitched that line I pitch that concept I Know that that that episode was going to be magnificent without me the writers' room that we have the gene divergent is incredible and our show runner Jenny Letterman is an unbelievable story tell her that line has stuck\nWith me so I swore allegiance to this country and says I became a citizen and when it was time for all the do the same I said she should probably say that because the truth is all of us out of many to become one in this country\nI Want to ask you about your path into writing for television and for Jane divergent specifically how did it come about and how did you end up where you are professionally\nPlenty enough I come from a long line of doctors\nAnd lawyers which is what I thought I was going to do a my immigration problem let me to my community college mount sack or I discovered theater and film which eventually led me to UCLA where I did exactly that and\nWhen it was time for me to start writing more original stories for TV I decided to tell my\nPersonal story of discovering that I was on documented when I first apply to go to college when I realized I wanted to tell that story that script itself caught me and to start dance which right near Dallas fellow got me in age and got me a\nSell my first original pilot with CBS Studios and that is what got me on Jane the virgin\nEven though the study points out a lot of shortcomings in problems with the depiction of immigrants on television are you at least excited about some shows including Jane diverge in that are trying to counter that narrative and where do you think progress has been accomplished\nI Do have great hope because I Am seeing more and more of our stories being told like in superstar where they have an undocumented Filipino character and I think that when he came from that particular show bringing in an organization like the American\nThat worked at them to tell a very ... chicken shoe store yet narrative great anatomy at the same thing with one of their own document of doctors that is a fantastic and bass for stuff\nBut the second step is to actually hire immigrant writers to join the writers are we on the grill and get better by the first year of our voice\nAnd I think all movies like Black Panther movies like crazy Rich Asians show that\nImmigrants themselves and immigrant stories are good for business\nRaphael Augustine is a staff writer for Jane the virgin he joined us from the set of the theories Raphael thank you for
