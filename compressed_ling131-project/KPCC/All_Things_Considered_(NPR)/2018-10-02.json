says the FBI should do a comprehensive investigation into the allegations surrounding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh but as NPR's Mara Liasson reports he also says Senate Republicans should determine the scope of that investigation\nBut it doesn't come down to a he said she said it comes down to a he said she said they said\nAnd that's the challenge for mayor the individuals that Dr Ford had said they were also there and they can also testified of this all of them instead came out and said we don't remember anything like that so well I don't have any reason to doubt the doctor for it had something happen to her I I Can't piece together that it was actually Brett Kavanaugh the one that was actually there what\nWould the FBI have to find to change your mind about Kevin fitness to serve on the Supreme Court\nOr the FBI was going to go back and do interviews and this is the hard part about this the FBI processes interviewing all the same people that the committee staff has already interviewed a river comes there's they're gonna have to find some something different than what we've already seen which I think is very unlikely because the FBI is not doing a full on criminal investigation going through DNA and going through sides well\nThen if you think it's unlikely that the investigation will turn up anything worthwhile but the point of the investigation is is just a gesture and now a hollow gesture\nSo the point of investigation seems to be two things one is somebody democratic colleagues who told me their goal at the end of the day is to slow down the nomination all the way through the election do they're making an election issue or to be able to hopefully slow it down long enough that each week they would say we need one more week one more wait one more week do fully win the election\nI think that you wouldn't want to do the investigation because it is slowing things down\nNo I I don't mind and investigation as long as the investigation is it fair that it's timely that it's not just designed to be able to drag on a week and at the end of it say well now we need another week and now in another week the Anita Hill investigation or with the FBI that time was three days\nIf the investigation is indeed confined to one week uh your colleague inside the Republican Senator Jeff flake of Arizona has said that if the FBI investigation finds that Kavanaugh lied under oath during his hearings than his nomination is dead you agree with flight\nWould absolutely agree and then then the issues to fall is not only sexual assault as an issue but it's lying to Congress in lying under oath or clearly that would be disqualified\nEven if it's found that Kavanaugh lied about his drinking habits you think that would be to qualify as\nWell so that has been a whole new issue that I've been fascinated with that people have said OK if we can now now that we have him on record for new things I Try to find new things that maybe we we can say not necessarily lying about what we have different interpretations\nAre one people that one person says yes objectively I think you drink too much and he says objectively\nNo I don't think I was drinking too much then that's enough for lying and enough to exclude him that's no longer a dialogue about sexual assault that's trying to find some way to trip up a nominee to be able to catch them on something based on some kind of history from thirty six years ago\nThat ... that's no longer really drawn to be able to get to a judge that's trying to destroy someone personally I Am offended by that and I think most people should be quite frankly many of my democratic colleagues have said to me quietly I really hope that they don't reopen my time when I was in high school the way that we're opening up the time on Brett Kavanaugh and he's in high school and try to challenge everything\nYou don't think it's fair to say that it would be disqualifying Brett Kavanaugh with ms characterizing his drinking habits as a teenager\nSo drinking habits as a teenager and someone saying he drank too much and the other one's saying he didn't drink too much becomes subjective issue a sexual assault is very clear\nRepublican senator James Lankford of Oklahoma thank you very much for joining us today but glad to be able to do with you\nGeneral Electric stunned much of Wall Street today by firing

starting a series that explores China's reach into other countries NPR's chief international editor will Dotson joins us now to give us a preview hey well I also\nSo I understand the series is looking at China but from the vantage point of other countries why look at China from the outside\n[noise] right well for nearly Thirty years we've been reporting on a rising China we've been following as it reaches one atomic benchmark after another\nAt some point you have to recognize that the world is changed and\nChina's not rising anymore it's risen right what we're looking at now is not a developing country it's a major player throws its weight around that is confident and assertive in sort of pushing its its interests and if you want to see that engagement you have to be looking outside of China and how did\nYou decide where to go to assess China's massive influence around the world well\nWe went to more than a dozen countries around the globe we went to South America Africa Europe south east Asia and what we were looking to do is not just to sort of a cheetah\nA geographic diversity we're looking at a diversity of places in terms of the countries that China is meeting so that means how China engages democracies versus how it's engaging developing economies struggling societies places\nThat are very far afield generally far out of their orbits and places that are in their strategic backyard\nAnd without telling us too much about the stories we're going to hear in the next coming days give us a fan of what you found\nWell it'd be great to start with a story that our Shanghai correspondent Rob Schmitz found a he was looking at China as meddling in Australia meddling yeah look of course China in Australia have were really broad relationship or they are huge trading partners\nBut the relationship is deeper than just goods and services he looks at a writer who was trying to write a book critical of China's influence in Australia and for the longest time he couldn't get it published in Australia\nAnd and this is sort of thing that's really remarkable here is that China's no longer content to stifle free speech just within its own borders it's now extending its influence into public fears of other countries exercising censorship in foreign country exactly\nWhere else did you guys go well in Africa are Nairobi correspondent found a massive new infrastructure project that links to of Kenya's largest cities now this is something you can find many places like this it's something that can you deeply needs it's a it's been very well done and very well executed\nBut it's now leading to greater local resentment at the Chinese operation using Chinese\nThere and there's fear understandable fear in Kenya that they won't be able to pay the Chinese back\nThat these Chinese projects that we're seeing spring up around the world are creating get traps that can cause future dependency\nIt's also important that China doesn't always get its way in some places they are making masses investments are in these projects are hitting the skids and we have a story that look some of the problems that can be devil even China or in Morocco\nAnd then in Europe there are concerns about China's stifling free speech fear over investment in certain high tech sectors and also there's growing concern about China investing huge amounts and ports around the continent here's one analyst explaining what's worrying some in Europe\nThey've invested all along the proof is if you're up it's like almost in anaconda strategy like he's surrounded and squeeze it in that way you you have some control in every\nWhat an ominous analogy in anaconda you had exactly the anaconda strategy and how China chooses to use that leverage Howard deploys that

necessary to complete the investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nDr fours allegation is not merely uncorroborated it is refuted by the very people she says we're there including by a longtime friend of hers refuted\nRefuted cabin I think those people Henry few data for its recollection of what happened is that accurate\nNot quite accurate because the bulk of their statements are that they don't remember now the letters vary in terms of how in fat ugly they don't remember how fat ugly they deny what they think was happening in that summer\nBut there is a big difference between not remembering ad refuting and that's why having FBI investigators get involved might help the senators drill down on this okay let's\nTry to another statement this one where Kavanaugh has been asked about drinking while he was under age\nThe drinking age was Eighteen and Marilyn's for most of my time and high school was Eighteen in DC for all my time in high school\nAll right John did Kevin I'll get the law right was Eighteen the drinking age at the time in both places\nBrett Kavanaugh got it wrong from Maryland in Maryland the drinking age in the summer of Nineteen eighty two went from Eighteen to Twenty one\nSo at the time it would be very likely that Brett Kavanaugh being someone who was a less than Twenty one was not drinking legally at least for half of the summer\nThere are some moments where Kavanaugh talks about how much he drank back then he repeatedly mentioned that he liked to be here but he says as much as he liked here he's drinking was not out of control here's how he put it\nI liked beer I still like beer but I did not drink beer to the point of walking out and I never sexually assaulted anyone\nHow firmly contaminants this team never drink to the point of blacking out has there been any evidence to challenge that\nFar we've heard from people who went to high school with him college with him who said that yeah he drank a lot and that he would be a very sloppy drunk\nBut how is anyone to sort this out\nI think that it's extremely difficult because the whole nature of this is very subjective it's not the sort of thing that lends itself to fact check per se I think it's it's right there on the margins of unless the guy was taken to the ...\nER and there's an official record of that this is going to be extremely difficult to pin down Jon Greenberg is a staff writer at politifact thank you very much my pleasure\nNow let's look at what the FBI is trying to find out during a week long

justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here in the studio Hi Ryan let's start with the big sticking point so far which has been the question of the scope of the investigation do we know what the FBI is looking into exactly\nWe don't exactly know what they're looking into no a Democrats as we've heard have complained that the scope of this as a kind of being curtailed reined in by the White House they said that the administration has put strict limits on what the FBI can investigate Democrat set the FBI and the White House today a list of twenty four people that they say that the bureau should or should talk to\nThe administration has pushed back against this uh they said that uh they do want a full investigation they've made clear that um they also don't want a fishing expedition\nToday the president said that he wants what he called a comprehensive ... investigation he reiterated again that he wanted done quickly uh and it is the White House that has the final say on what the FBI gets to look into in this background investigation\nThat said Trump said today that well he has final say he's listening to what the Senate Republican leadership or wants to have checked out what they want looked into and then he's directing the FBI based off of what the Senate says\nAnd what has the Senate Republican leadership said they want the FBI to look into\nWell they initially said that they wanted the FBI to look into what they called credible allegations of sexual misconduct\nThat was always a big enough kind of ill defined enough that the questions about scope where it's almost inevitable a on this question of senior U.S Senate GPA pointed to comments at Seventy Senator Lindsey Graham made over the weekend\nA Graham said that the FBI would talk to witnesses that Christine Blasey Ford mentioned in her testimony last week that includes Kavanaugh's friend mark judge a gram also mentioned Deborah Ramirez she's the second woman who came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Kevin all\nThose allegations date back to their time at Yale in the early mid Nineteen eighties and those are the only people that Graham mentioned\nSo it's had mentioned this is day three of the FBI's week long investigation do you know much about what the FBI has been doing about three days so far\nWith the bureau itself has not provided any ah any clarity on this but NPR has learned that the FBI has interviewed Ramirez ah she's given the FBI list of people that she says either witnessed the elected incident uh or heard about it uh contemporaneously you on that though it's it's pretty much crickets a the bureau has not reached out to forward at this point\nIt also had an reach out to a third woman who came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh that's Julie sweat Nick\nAnd then there are number of possible witnesses who could have information about the various a legend events in question one of course it's having us read mark judge we talked a lot about him judge has said he'll cooperate with the FBI of his his lawyer today declined to say anything beyond that\nAnd at the same time more of Kavanaugh's high school and college acquaintances are speaking out tell us about what they've said most recently\nWell in the last twenty four hours a former friend of Kavanaugh's at Yale came out and publicly ... disputed Kevin O's representation of his of his drinking as a young man uh this is Chad letting too and he's a history professor at North Carolina state now\nAnd his comments don't relate to allegations of sexual misconduct but really about how much Kevin drank and what led you didn't says is that he frequently drank with Kavanaugh when they were at Yale us as Kevin I was a belligerent and aggressive drunk\nUm but at the same point in time the White House has put out statements from two college friends who say Kevin did not behave that way they don't match a those allegations don't match the cabinet that they knew a it's important for Democrats um to talk about Kevin most truthfulness about his drinking his truthfulness in his testimony that it's a something that should be looked into and the president says you know what I Believe what Kevin has had to say\nNPR's Ryan Lucas thanks Ryan thank you\n[noise] you're listening to all things considered from NPR\nNews everybody it's now Eighteen

rapper name ribs and see\nUs we've been discussing this Pakistani bread is an advocate for expanding the stories that are told that in our culture be they on screen or in song and naturally that got us talking about how audiences can identify with characters that don't always look like them\nYou know it's something I've thought about law is this idea of like relate to Billy particularly if it's someone who's kind of you know there's this uh\nThey just received wisdom that sent people's stories I'm all inherently more ... than others you know at least that's that's something that you kind of absorbed as an actor performers in August of ... you know whose stories\nI'm often on as visible you know [noise] um\n... heard or seen as widely so I think a lot about this and I really believe that it's the it's the specificity of someone's experience to really kind of the minute shy and the micro detailed account of granular specificity of someone's experience that makes it relate to ...\n... in that might sound contradict treats some because of course ... micro specifically if your experience is completely different to mind\nBut within that busy busy you are recognized is is is honesty and true so even if the texture of our experience is really different it's the kind of underlying emotional truth that we really really connect with\nRight and it all comes down to the stories that they're telling as well and we should say it's not limited to film and television because you are also a musician and a lot of the stories that you're telling through your music are about what it's like to be somebody who was seen as an other ought to play a clip from your song or gumbo\nYet they did for the Jews run by a random do whatever they want to sell the damn it anyway because it's easy in a way of living people don't get married have let's say you know [noise]\n\nIf you didn't hear the lyric they say the airport searches random but if it's always me it ain't Random House about

couple of years and the gamble is the first kind of saw those single I've been putting out of put out for a while now\nAnd um it's kind of carrying one in that vein of really embracing the specificity of my own experience which is something that as I said I kind of for a long time to be something as big Tunisia and unrelated to ... for example the English don't mix tapes I pull out a few years ago\nI recorded that several years before I ever got released because it's just all he's going to care about this like a couple of bucks on the kids and Brad fish and Newton maybe and like\nI don't know I mean who's going to you know he's going to be able to relate to these ... tragic because as soon as I put it out you know it kind of got so much more traction and\nMany of the other releases I'd I'd I'd uh I'd put out because it was kind of saying out a an experience that may be a lot of people I've heard about before\n[noise] um so\nI kind of just continuing in that vein of trying to embrace mine experienced trying to believe that it's enough trying to believe is university relate to people\nAnd I'm ... and the you know I guess that\nHas something to say you know the I I Want people to hear it so he's coming from a very personal place um and and all the time it can be said for it is like you know big pie political I'm bothered argue that you know certain people's experiences an escape from the politicized and it's often not by\nTheir own choosing you know if you're born into a sudden Bodie and it's a place in time and your day to day experience that you might

on the east\nAnd um yeah they'll be\n... that is that people receive as political and that's cool that's fine if you want to describe it that way just don't forget the all the other stuff you're listening to Israel so political absolutely idea that there's any days not political to me is is a fallacy because\nYou know all the piece of all is a point of view on the world\nYou know every time you choose wanted to tell one story over another we'll prioritize one character's perspective over another that's a point of view that or an expression of your priorities and that's all the politics

the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh NPR's Windsor Johnston reports the agencies looking into allegations of sexual misconduct that stemmed from Kavanaugh's high school and college days\nAsked about that I'm asked about a Yale classmate named Liz Swisher\nShe said I'm Brett Kavanaugh um drank more than a lot of people he'd end up slurring his words stumbling is not credible for him to say he had no memory lapses and the nights you drink to excess I Know because I drank with him\nHow should we assessed that\nGoes on if you if you kept reading and says she actually can't point to any specific instance like that\nUm the quote that jumped out at me was bread was a sloppy drunk and I know because I drank with him um there's\nAlso I don't find it uh I don't I I Do not think that's a fair characterization\nAnd this back and forth for people who are looking for\nBrett Kavanaugh not being fully truthful about his drinking this this back and forth would be where you would find that uh there have been a lot of people who've come forward and said\nThey think that actually was a pretty fair characterization I should add though that the White House has delivered to me statements from a couple of people who Kavanaugh went to college with including a sweet mate\nWho says that he saw a cabin on not just at the end of the night but also in the morning and said that he did not see behavior that involved blackouts or anything at the level that has been described\nBy others so what do you make of these dueling narratives that we heard represented by President Trump and Senator Schumer having listened to the testimony about whether he was truthful or not\nPresident Trump said today that lying to Congress would not be acceptable\nBut President Trump does not believe that Kavanaugh lied to Congress he believes in and talking to people at the White House who are working on Kavanaugh's nomination they believe that in Kavanaugh's opening statement that clip that we played earlier where he says\nI drank to access I drank a lot of beer I liked beer and I did things that I look back on and cringe that that although we didn't broad and not specific\nCovers just about everything they say you know he admits to everything except blacking out and when it comes to blacking out that is much more difficult to answer definitively\nDissolve is likely to have an impact on the three or so senators who appear to be on the fence\nIt's hard to know a those three Republican senators say that they are waiting for the FBI investigation to come through they keep getting asked in hallways by reporters whether lying matters to them but\nYou know the definition of lying may be different from Chuck Schumer and Democrats who are predisposed to have concerns about this nomination than it is from Republicans and\nPresident Trump and Kavanaugh's backers who say this started with sexual assault and now you're talking about whether he had through a drink at somebody at a bar in at Yale\nNPR's Tamara Keith thanks a lot of time You're welcome the political firestorm\nOver Brett Kavanaugh has raised lots of questions about how judicial nominees are evaluated like could lead to changes in the process NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson has been posing those sorts of questions to lawyers who've been responsible for vetting judges carry joins us now he carried I also\nSo but the judge has already have to complete a pretty thorough and very long questionnaire is it surprising at the White House didn't touch any of these allegations of sexual misconduct and Brett Kavanaugh's case\nIt's true that judge candidates gas a bunch of questions known in shorthand as the sex drugs and rock and roll Russians things like did you abuse alcohol or drugs did you have a wrap sheet what about financial improprieties but those questions usually started age Eighteen and go forward\nIn this allegation by Christine Blasey Ford against Brett Kavanaugh\nHappened when he was Seventeen years old to be clear Kavanaugh has denied any sexual misconduct but there were plenty of hints about his use of alcohol from that high school yearbook injury to his fraternity at Yale which was known for rock is parties to his own speeches once he got on the federal appeals court here in Washington DC\nWords like what happened at Georgetown Prep stayed at Georgetown Prep\nIn a time in a speech when he reminisced about baseball outing at Yale where people stumble drunk off the bus in the pre dawn hours\nI mean what could what is happening with Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation lead to changes in the way the FBI conduct background investigations in the future you think\nThe lawyers I've talked to have pointed out the system has adapted in the past for instance in the Nineteen nineties\nQuestions about paying taxes for landscapers and babysitters came up after some nominee right for cabinet positions ran into trouble\nBoyd and gray who handle judge nominations for President George H W. Bush told me that I might go back deeper into nominees background into high school for instance but he says when it comes to allegations of sexual assault the situation is complicated\nShove scary thought that one allegation was low back up you know a ... home there's nothing for\nDo you choose to look at it will have an alibi for those who can you just do nothing\nNow it's important to say that supporters of Christine Blasey Ford say she does remember several key details about that night in Nineteen eighty two and then another accuser Deborah Ramirez has come forward with concerns about Kavanaugh at Yale\nBrett Kavanaugh he has made it clear that he has already been through six separate background checks for government jobs over the years you know with any of those background checks revealed allegations for anything that's been mentioned so far what were they caught in any of those reports\nThose background check reports are secrets on the White House and the Senate Judiciary committee led by Republicans have said they did not capture a whiff of sexual impropriety when it came to Brett Kavanaugh and we do know that there are some clues that Kavanaugh was asked about his finances\nMaybe some other allegations in a private hearing with the Senate Judiciary committee this year but that hearing has\nRemained mostly private I reached out to Ron Klain who helped President Bill Clinton that judges planes that there could be another issue the White House counsel's office under Donald Trump is understaffed and they've been pushing through judges had a record pace\nI Wonder if the bakery is just too many cakes and maybe they're not getting the attention they deserve\nBy contrast run cleans has President Clinton stopped all the other judges while he pushed through Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court but judges are central to Donald Trump legacy and his mainly pleasing his political base so I don't expect to see a let up there in this case All right That's NPR's Carrie Johnson thanks carrying\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nGood afternoon everybody it's Eighteen minutes past four o'clock you're listening to all things considered here on eighty nine point three K PCC I'm John rabies sitting in for Nick Roman who should be back tomorrow if I don't break the show so I thanks for being with us a lot more stories still to come\nAnd then at seven o'clock tonight I Love for you to check out America on the line of national calling on politics and it's part of the key PCC voter game plan our initiative to keep you engaged and informed on the election\nSo this is a show that is all about the midterms getting ready for them and tonight Washington Post national security correspondent Greg Miller is going to tell us about Russian meddling in the twenties sixteen election and whether the midterms are at risk that's America on the line\nComing up tonight it's seven here on eighty nine point three K.
