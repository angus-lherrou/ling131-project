stepping down NPR's Scott Horsley reports UN ambassador Nikki Haley's announced she'll be leaving her post by year's end\nNPR's Greg Allen is in Tallahassee and joins us now Hey Greg ... so do people where you are seen to be taking the hurricane seriously enough at this point or the adequately preparing well\nIt's hard to say you know here in Tallahassee is very calm um you know we didn't get a lot of advance warning on this this is a hurricane or just kind of popped up over the weekend in the holiday weekend for some people and those governments city\nSo I think a lot of people were slow to pick up on it plenty of water and other supplies still available to stores not big crowds here\nDown in Panama City as we heard of that big county area there is a much more concerned because that's near where the hurricane made make landfall category three and a pie wins a massive storm surge and so there's a lot of concern about getting people out there especially because a major bridge will be closed when the winds get too hot\nWhat about the Tallahassee area specifically what are the concerns there well\nYou know you have a couple of hundred thousand people who live in Tallahassee is the capital of course in here the concern really is about ... of the high wins will get from a category three storm you know I'm Will get at least hurricane strength maybe a ... strong tropical storms winds\nBut that there are a lot of trees and this in this town here\nAnd the trees come down to the power lines come down and of course we lose power a it's a town that there's all these big ... live oak trees Spanish moss very picturesque city but these big trees have relatively shallow roots around and do a a guy named Harold barber or who's up picking up less than the hurricane supplies\nAnd he was born and raised Tallahassee here's what he says about the trees\nI'm a retired firefighter and stone I'd see that come up by the roof ... come out of the ground the lease get heavy get top heavy and you got that wind pushing it yeah they will come all\nYou know two years ago her main was a category one hurricane but that one knocked out power here for some people for a week so there's a lot of concern what\nWe're hearing though is that officials are most worried about hurricane Michael's storm surge how high of a surge are we talking here at this point\nRight this could one of those we haven't had a hurricane like this in quite some time or maybe ever in this part of Florida and putting on the track you may see an eight to twelve foot storm surge meteorologist say in the Big Bend area you know and that's the corner where the witness looks next to the panhandle in Florida\nAnd there'll be significant search all along the panhandle going uh west that would be that's the reason for that all these coastal counties have had these evacuations it's the water that actually is the risk to life and limb\nAnd it has to do with the geography here the continental shelf extends real far out into Gulf relatively shallow water just piles up and that we may see here ah tomorrow\nOK That's NPR's Greg Allen in Tallahassee thanks very much Greg\nYou're welcome now to the Supreme Court where this morning protesters had a message for the newest justice\n[laughter]\nOnly days after the Senate voted narrowly to confirm him Brett Kavanaugh made his first appearance on the high court bench\nAnd hair national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson was watching the oral arguments and she's here now to tell us about them Harry Hi Mary Louise so we heard the protesters outside the court what was it like in say today well after all the rancor of Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings in the Senate things were quiet inside the court know disruptions no arrest\nKavanaugh's wife actually lived there his two daughters skipped school to attend retired Justice Anthony Kennedy was there to of course Kevin replaced him on the bench and at the start of the day chief justice John Roberts said it gives me great pleasure to welcome justice cabin out of the court and Roberts wished him along and happy career ... [noise]\nHe has been busy already has hired for clerks all of them women I Will note uh we're told he spent the weekend reading up on cases did he actually speak much from the bench today he was really active for his first day on the job that counted more than ten questions from him to both sides mostly technical questions about the state of the law\nThe court today heard two cases about what kinds of crimes should trigger the arm career criminal act\nCongress passed that law to take dangerous people off the street it sends them away for mandatory prison terms if they have prior violent crimes in their past the question for the court today was whether certain kinds of robberies or burglaries counted or not\nIt sounds like neither of those cases today or ones with big political or ideological divide winner cases going to come before him that would test this new five for makeup of the court yeah\nThe docket is not super polarized so far but there is a good chance the high court will consider whether to accept some cases that could wind up being blockbusters\nCases that they have to do with President Obama's docket immigration plan\nCases that might hit religious liberty against the rights of algae P. T. people or cases about the power and reach of the executive branch at least one of the justices today appear to be playing a long game that Elena Kagan she was appointed by President Obama but she and Brett Kavanaugh go back away she hired him to teach at Harvard law school when she was a dean there\nThey behaved very warmly together today laughed a lot and he shook her hand as he left the bench\nThe issue is whether she's trying a charm offensive on this new justice to get him to be a more moderate figure on this bench overtime huh\nBut what about the fear that Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation battle was so partisan was so rancor is I think is the word you used that there would be this cloud of partisanship hanging over him and a hangover the court did you see any sign of that\nNot in the courtroom today Brett Kavanaugh of course introduced some of this himself in the Senate when he mentioned in organized campaign to go after him even citing the Clintons he spoke Monday Night at a ceremony at the White House saying he wanted to be impartial unfair and\nPart of a team of nine justices on the court but Kavanaugh off went out of his way at that event at the White House to thanks senators who made the difference in his confirmation people like Susan Collins of Maine and Joe Manchin of West Virginia and president\nIn a surprise announcement from the White House today one of President Trump's most loyal foot soldiers announced plans to resign at the end of the UN ambassador Nikki Haley broke the news during an Oval Office meeting with President Trump NPR's Scott Horsley says Trump praised her as an effective advocate for his America First agenda\nI think it surprised a lot of people both here in the U.S and in the international community she didn't really offer an explanation for the timing except to say she needs a break after six years of South Carolina governor in the last nearly two as UN ambassador\nOr she is going to stay on 'til the end of the year she said given that the timing on this Tuesday Morning is interesting\nNPR's Scott Horsley Trump says Haley told him ... a month ago she might want to take some time off elite told reporters she has no plans of running for president in twenty twenty instead she plans to campaign for President Trump\nStocks rose mixed on Wall street slaves energy and textures recovered some of the earlier losses you're listening to NPR News\nAnd from Cape you see the News I'm Nick Roman with destroys recovering at five thirty three\nCalifornia Department of motor vehicles is under fire again earlier this year the DMV took heed from state lawmakers over long wait times\nThan king twenty three thousand botched voter records from the motor voter program that registers Californians to vote when they get a driver's license and yesterday the DMV says Fifteen hundred people who were in eligible to vote may have been registered by mistake\nCalifornia secretary of state Alex ... says splitting a pause on motor voter is certainly on the table story from Capital Public Radio's ... by\nMotor voter was launched in the spring and it automatically registers people to vote when they obtain renew their driver's license at a press conference secretary ... blames the DMZ for undermining the public's confidence in the electoral process\nThe legislation calling for California motor voter was passed in ... years ago the technology was yours and to me and for the DMV to still be suffer from these types of mistakes is absolutely unacceptable\nThe secretary is running for reelection this year and his opponent election law attorney mark measure says these mistakes are happening because ...

Hi Elsa so why now why is Haley stepping down now\nWell that is a really good question we don't know exactly why now but we do know that she wrote a resignation letter six days ago which would have been just as President Trump was attacking Christine Blasey Ford that my down to look good if she'd resigned then\nShe says she's terminally main yourself she's going to go into the private sector we know that she and her husband are not wealthy people they have a lot of debt based on her financial disclosure form\nSo for someone who does want to run for president maybe some time in the future time to make a lot of money she is staying on 'til the end of the year but it made sense for her to announce this now because in case the Republicans lose big in the mid term she doesn't want to be seen as\nKind of a rat deserting the sinking ship right might even held it yeah\nSo the thing that's different about this departure compared to other exits we've seen from the Trump Administration is that he seems to be leading on good terms with President Trump is that actually the case\nYes it sounds like it's the case she is the most adept political operator in the cabinet you know she has been just a seller right away but somehow being out of Washington has allowed her to carve out\nThis independent political persona as a loyal Trump cabinet member but not a sick event she's tougher on Russia than he is although that is true of many relatives of his foreign policy team but she has been able to separate yourself from Trump when it suits her purposes\nRemember when she said there would be um sanctions on Russia than Larry Kudlow said no Nikki Haley is confused and she retarded very friendly and said I don't get can use a decade she also wrote an op ed piece saying on the one hand she wasn't anonymous the internal\nAnonymous resistor but also pointing out that she does from time to time different with the president but she brings\nThose differences are privately now some Republicans grumbled that was pretty self aggrandizing but once again she was able to burnish her own brand as someone independent\nForeign policy hawk but not a total Trump is she actually could kind of had it both ways okay so yes she's actually managed to have it both ways which shows you that she is a really good politician\nSo as we heard Haley just say she won't be running for president in twenty twenty but are we to assume that this is really the end of\nHer political career we are certainly nuts and nobody does um she is not going to challenge the president in a primary in twenty twenty um she hasn't ruled out not running for president a lot of people think she'll run and twenty twenty four or possibly she'll take a Senate seat in South Carolina one comes open but her ...\nCentral ambitions are well established and it was really interesting people who are following her career and speculating about its future paid careful attention to what she said about Ivanka and Jared today she said that Jared was such a hidden genius that no one understands\nVon ... of course the president's talked about as a possible replacement for Nikki Haley so she is staying on good terms with all the members of the Trump family That's NPR's Mara Liasson thanks Martin thank you\n[noise] the national Security Agency is the country's largest intelligence agency\nAnd among its most

that theater experience that part ... part joy vote tent revival Marcos now had up has our story\n[noise] let me tell you might be great I Love the secret city a few years ago I got invited\nTo come see in the choir now I had no idea what it was all I was told was imagined a diverse underground artistic community getting together on a Sunday Morning to celebrate creativity and each other through the craft or fear\nYou know I was down for that but it wasn't long before I learned the mastermind behind this project was LA feeder veteran Kris well really\nI very much believes in theater I mean I Will always think of myself as an actor and a person who makes theater and performs [noise]\nUm I guess I felt that the theater I was making wasn't really addressing the community and the community wasn't really engaging with the theater and that\nFrustration got wills thinking about how to stretch himself as an artist so he started talking to friends like Leslie ... a Cal arts faculty member and current secrets of the board member\nStyle I remember a couple of just ... that we had in that mid late nineties where and when we went to keep it just brainstorm about like well what if

with LA he had fallen in love with his boyfriend the painter Robert Lucy and a couple of moved to New York\nI didn't really find the community there that I was looking for and I also was doing a lot of regional theater and I was I was not feeling that engaged by the theater I was making [noise] and I realized that I wasn't satisfied living on the road and living out of the suitcase and that was a\n... what did satisfy him with the memories of those LA brainstorming sessions and intimate salons with friends where people would bring a poem a story or a song to share so Christian Robert rented a small studio space in lower Manhattan and picked up where they left off in LA\nThe word quickly spread and soon the secret city was holding feeder church once a month in New York [noise]\nSince two

even dedicated time for silent prayer but at this service prayer takes the form of whole group meditation [noise]\nIn twenty ten Chris Wells scored an ... it's a special honor given for off Broadway

company facing a lot of storm damage claims you know like from a hurricane the guy who buys the bond gets a huge return it the storm isn't that bad but what if it is\nWell if there is a serious

earlier today as a strong category for stormed with winds of up words of a hundred and fifty five miles per hour\nActually dried up for a while so this new way of controlling for risk was developed and it was called the catastrophe bond essentially an insurance company sells a bond and the investor gets paid interest for it\nOK so tell me how that works like what would happen if there is a catastrophe like a hurricane or some out of control wildfire or an earthquake\nWell if there is a serious natural disaster than the buyer of the bond has to foot the bill for some part of the damage so if you buy one of these bonds\nYou're sort of gambling that there won't be a bad hurricane season this year because you know there is you could take a loss for example right now about Fifteen billion dollars worth of catastrophe bonds have some exposure in Florida where hurricane Michael has had\nWhat kinds of investors are buying kept on well mostly big institutional investors hedge funds a mutual funds may be your own pension fund they like to include them because they're a good way to diversify risk and what I mean is\nIf the economy slows you typically see a lot of different assets like stocks and real estate and so on\nLosing value at the same time but the value of catastrophe bonds isn't tied to the economy it's tied to\nYou know Mother Nature so when everything else is losing ground you can still make it so I see uh-huh their way of hedging risk which investors like really popular these these catastrophe bonds or bonds pretty popular there's about thirty billion dollars invested in them right now overall\nAnd the reason has to do with their ... they typically earn an investor\nAt least five percent and sometimes a lot more than that and that's because they're potentially so much riskier than other kinds of bonds\nSo anyone investing in them is going to want to be paid more\nThere are some pretty major storms in recent memory last summer there were three in a row we at Harvey which flooded Houston for days and we had Irma and Maria than just last month Hurricane Florence land into the Carolinas I mean one after another have investors lost a ton of money on their cat bonds because of these storms\nYeah last year was was particularly challenging for for the bonds and there was a lot of speculation that would kill off the market there was this fear you know investors would see these big losses and nobody would ever want to buy a catastrophe bombed again but the market has has come back pretty well\nSo as we're seeing more catastrophic storms are our tap on just going to become a riskier investment\nYeah I mean that's always going to be a potential problem the more big storms you have sort of less attractive the sponsor yeah name but there is another issue I think that is even more of an immediate problem over the past decade interest rates and things like treasury bonds have been very low so investors have turned to these catastrophe bonds because\nYou know they could are much higher interest rates on them well now interest rates in general are rising so relatively speaking catastrophe bonds aren't as attractive as an investment as they were in that's\nThat's bound to weaken demand for them\nInteresting lesson consequences of all these storms that NPR's Jim Zarroli in New York Thank you Jim You're welcome and we'll be

Democrats over a plan to expand Medicare to cover all Americans in an op ed published today in USA Today Trump says the Democrats' plan would hurt seniors he made a similar claim last night at a campaign rally in Iowa\nA majority of Democrats have already signed up\nFor his socialist healthcare plan that would of blood or Medicare and limit Medicare Advantage for twenty million seniors\nAlright fact checkers have challenged the president's planes and one of those ... is our very own Scott Horsley who joins us now to set the record straight have got good to be with us so we are just weeks away from the new terms now Democrats are talking about health care to both sides are clearly focusing on this issue now they\nAre else that you know health care is an emotional issue it taps into people's fears and vulnerabilities\nIt also taps into our pocketbooks in a big way so he has long been a potent issue for mobilizing voters\nEspecially older voters who are more likely to show up at the polling place in the past Republicans have campaigned against Obamacare this year Democrats think it's their turn their campaigning against GOP efforts to repeal Obamacare\nFully half of the Democrats' campaign ads had been devoted to this issue Here's Senate democratic leader Chuck Schumer\nThere is one issue above any other that is going to define the results in the November sixth election and that is health care\nAnd President Trump is apparently also sensing the political power of that argument so he's mowing a counter offensive with this critique of Medicare for all\nSo what is Trump saying about that program in particular this this idea basically letting everyone get Medicare instead of having to pay for private insurance\nThe first thing the president says in his USA Today column is that it would carry an astonishing price tag\nThirty two point six trillion dollars over a decade now that sounds like a lot of money as it is but what the president leaves out is important context which is that our current healthcare system\nIs on track to pay even more than we already have the cost of health care system in the world and if you count tax breaks for the insurance that workers get on the job\nThe federal government already thoughts about two thirds of the total bill\nBut we're not getting any of the efficiencies or the buying power that would come from replacing private insurance with a single payer system\nAnd how does the president explain why shifting to a single payer regime would hurt senior citizens\nHe argues that Medicare for all would lead to rationing that doctors and hospitals we put out of business that seniors would lose control of their health care\nBut he offers no evidence for those claims he he really seems to just be a playing on generational fears that any effort to boost hell security for younger Americans has to come at the expense of their ... seniors\nOkay but realistically what are the prospects ultimately for Medicare for all\nEven if Democrats win in November they're not going to have the power to pass Medicare for all over the president's certain veto mental like Obamacare and GOP plans to replace Obamacare Medicare for all might not look so shiny and break when you actually have to debate the the details of the plant\nBut if we're going to have that debate Elsa it's probably useful to do so with facts not fear and unfortunately the president's op ed column today doesn't really contribute to that\nFinally the president has repeatedly said that he had kept his promise to protect people with pre existing conditions is that true\nHe has made that promise repeatedly but in fact he and his fellow Republicans have tried to unwind the protections in Obamacare\nAnd they've proposed replacing them with unspecified state level guarantees the insurance industry has warned that could destabilize the market create a patchwork of state regulations and raise prices for older sicker
