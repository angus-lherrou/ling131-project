{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "A bunch of people related to the case was our money's name on there among his name was on their ... and bill jeez I'm really so\nSo he leaves and ... who goes where\nNo one knows but he's not in the immediate area as far as I can tell they pull out all the troops again they're searching this area that's like\nBrambles in dense brush around the prison\nAnd in the meantime this is our money's version I'm Henry McCabe same investigator from before during the manhunt shows up on his door\nTells him that go has escaped again and says listen we had such a hard time catching him last time around is there anything you can tell us this time it might help us in our money says like oh jeeze yeah I mean\nI think what he's going to do is hunker down right next to the prison is going to wait until he is going to be able to monitor you guys when he knows you moved on and cleared the area and he'll make a break for it and go so probably he still right nearby you should go back and catch him how does she knows that\nWell so that's the thing he Daryl basically I think talked about that on the stem to explain how he ... during the manhunt so it's possible that this wasn't news but our money claims that he told that to McCabe who thought it was helpful [noise]\nSo um they went back search theory again and sure enough he was there have popped up and he had managed to have a gun that had been smuggling him by his son a few days earlier and he shot the first officer that came near him and then all the officers opened fire on him and he was killed\n[noise]\nSo-so look at where we land here like like this this this small town lawyer who took on a case now does he want to do because he thought he should\nWho defended this fellow for all this time who suffered so for doings or any of the more or less give up his practice in small town it utterly changed his life and you're stuck to his guns\nAnd he and he and he stayed with this guy and yet once she's escaped and he's at\nLarge and the police come and say tell us what you know about your client all of a sudden he does to you know go to the bushes and those will seize nearby like that's interesting because because it basically after all this he more or less sets up the situation that that kills is like\nYeah it's like why is it okay in the second scenario and not\nIn the first scenario with the buried bodies right yeah well interestingly Lisa learning the or the ... the law professor though we spoke with for this episode she says that when she teaches this case to her law classes um you know like even if you\nPresume that this was privileged information which Mr Armani says it wasn't as Garrett talked about on the stand\nBelief is that even if it were privileged information and only\nArmani knew\nHe could still reveal it in this case ethically really why\nBecause you go back and look at rule one point six which is the current ethics code\nIt says a lawyer may reveal information relating to the representation of a client to the extent that we're reasonably believe is necessary to prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm\nSo\nSo you could quibble about this you know is this does this meet that standard but once ... is on the lose you know knowing what Frank knows about his having committed multiple previous murders\nMy reaction is that it was very reasonable\nBut in our case had the highway if he had not had a hit list in which she looked like he was going to murder more people if he had not threaten their lives if instead he was going to sneak out and simply go to Rio on a plane and if he could get to it then\nOur lawyers would not have been able to tell about the highway place because no one was going to die\nYou know if I had been representing this man and he was on the loose than if I knew that he had killed several people and that he is\nA sociopath or something like that I Would uh I Would estimate the odds of his injuring or killing other people as very high because serial killers that's what they do\nYou know if it were another case and he was just going to run off some place and there was no danger to anyone\nUh then maybe it would be different\nWhat is the argument that would be against that was when we think are gonna think of it the argument against that is even if someone tells you a secret as his attorney or her attorney are supposed to keep the secret when there is a\nConclusion of the case and the person is either innocent or guilty how long must you keep the secret but\nForever set the forever forever why ah well the the idea is that um if you want clients to be able to speak freely to their lawyers\nUm the the lawyer is simply the clients agent the lawyer has that information at the behest of the client it's not the lawyers decision to reveal it\n[noise]\nThanks to our producers Brenna feral and Matt kill T um to a gym Tracey who's currently writing a book

city's darkest day\nThere's an underlying tone around the world of an office in off the level of hatred ... and\nWe'll learn more about the shooting ... residents where they go from here\nIs shining and I felt like that was telling me that you know it's going to be dark and gloomy for a little bit but I'm a park there's clouds and show you that I'm Still here\nBut first the snooze\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Janine hurts and interfaith vigil was held in Pittsburgh tonight for the eleven people killed in a shooting at the tree of life synagogue yesterday morning and the six others who were wounded\nTo do I do have to ask you this is something I think there's two takeaways than the\nNumber one is there are levels of evil or evil manifests itself in a multiple homicide\nAnd certainly seeing a loving people's lives being taken from them is definitely something that has\nFelt strongly by a lot of people but it also is when those people are being murdered simply because of the way that they pray and then it takes on a different level when you pray on the elderly\nOr you prey upon children and then it takes another level when you go into a place that is sacred to those people end up place that is considered a safe haven\nBecomes a mass grave yard and when all those different levels of evil or\nOpen there is a natural reaction for people to want to reach out and just try to help other people but there's a secondary level as well because all of the rhetoric and the talk about our different all of the\nNotions of how we should not welcoming people or people are different and Americans are different there's an underlying tone around this world of enough is enough\n... at this level of hatred has to and that's Mayor Bill de Vito of Pittsburgh Mr Mayor thank you so much for talking to us thanks have a great day\nAnd now we're going to speak with a member of the congregation door ... which warships in the building that was attacked\nAnd wife is with us now in our studios in Pittsburgh and why thank you so much for speaking with us at such a difficult time thinking and we know that you just came from a service that must have taken a lot of strength just to get here and so I Want to thank you for that I Know you've worshipped as a part of his congregation for\nFor many many years as I understand that yeah we have news what drew you to it it's a congregation that is called a reconstructionist\nSandwich sect Judaism that is very open to new ideas and sell us maintaining tradition\nYou also has a lot of people from the edit professionals that or academics and also in helping profession and that's who did us very well and also is very welcoming of people who are very knowledgeable and not very knowledgeable and my husband and I not being very knowledgeable and very welcoming of this and\nYou happen not to be at surfaces I'm yesterday as I understand it\nRight it was actually not a service it was a meeting in the ground I study that was led by Dan like here is a tourist steady group many people would be there but he arrived he is now in critical condition in the hospital and Jerry ... then you with us all arrived early\nHe has died and shooting everybody else came later it was actually one of their man mighty gainer came and he had a moment where he could get ... to the basement\nBut otherwise other people are on their way so you there man who died had come earlier and they always do because they are they part of the strange thing for the congregation\nWhat are you drawing upon to help you process this to live with this\nPeople read poetry at a gathering today I thought that was a useful\nLast night there was a vigil that we attended my husband and I attended and my son with his friend to being around people who are going through the same thing and then just having come from a gathering that included to service all our congregation and getting everybody was saying hubs really matter at this time\nAnd then people you know are constantly sending us text and email us and that also helps to know that it's sort of keeping the ball in the air or otherwise in the dead time then you don't know what to do with yourself\nMhm I just appreciate that you were able to find the strength to come over here and speak with us and I'm just happy to have a chance to look at you and tell you in person how sorry I Am and how much the\nPeople all over the country all over the world all of my colleagues are grieving with you and I'm well thank you that's all I can say I they really are no words and I just wanted to say thank you and just ask if there's anything else you would like to say\nThis is a kind of place we have that everybody does that they can some people they were little some people do a lot but I mean anything and everything and the men can ledger in hospital and ... they knew it was killed\nWere to core members of our community\nShould not say we're about Dan because he's still alive and I hope he will make it Jerry was so so essential tied to imagine continue without him and Dan is very essential great there actually are great man\nSo we'll see how things come and go in the next few days do you think you can go back to worship there for sure what we're not allowed to go back now of course and I think we can't come back for a week but yes I'm sure it will be a very emotional first meeting there but\nThere's no doubt we will go\nThat's Pam wife she is a member of congregation door dash which warships in the building was attacked yesterday and she was kind of to join us\nHere at the studios of WAMC Pittsburgh and why's my condolences and my admiration for you thank you so much for speaking with you for me and foreign competition to\nJoin in\nThe uh the life and the character of the prophet Mohammad\n'em and many of his teaching as hum\nTell us that we should try to respond to evil or was it good you know when someone there's a verse in the ... on that says repel evil would that which is better and we thought that you know what better way to embody the prophet Mohammed teachings than to try to start a campaign\nThat will help 'em reach out first and foremost as fellow human beings but also to you know our Abraham Mick cousins or from the Jewish community\nUm and try to help out in in in some way I'm through this horrific ordeal\nHe original goal was twenty five thousand dollars now that you've so you've exceeded its so quickly now you bumped it up to Seventy five thousand does that say something to you\nI think it says a lot I think it says that there's a lot more good inhumanity than there is a bad and evil and hatred um we've had to increase the goal now twice\nAnd a lot of the donors are not even Muslim I mean we we said clearly on the crowd funding page that although this is a Muslim led campaign we welcome people of all faiths or even no faith\nBut the fact that this is a Muslim led campaign is there some message that you would hope to impart with that\nYeah one particular story from the profits life inspired it and it is like there was a time when the prophet Mohammed was a sitting down with some of his disciples and he noticed a Jewish funeral procession\nPassing by at a distance and he immediately stood up when he saw that Jewish funeral and paid his respects\nHis disciples asked him why are you standing up\nUm this is not a Muslim funerals it's only a Jewish funeral why are you standing\nHis response was so beautiful he said\nIs it not a human soul is it not a human soul and that that that story you know when I when I first saw the desecration at Jewish cemeteries last year and now it's what happened at the synagogue\nUm it reminded me of that story from the prophet Mohammed life and ... and ... and it really inspired me to want to start\nSomething to want to help out and really to put aside I mean if you look historically Jewish and Muslim communities in America\nHave not worked that closely together I mean often politics gets in the way things that are happening overseas often gets underway but what's most important is our our shared humanity and we want it to reach out as human beings to help out\nAnd do you have a plan for the funds now that you've exceeded even your own expectations what do you hope to do with the funds that you were raising\nWell we want to do is go to any of the affected families to say you know any costs that you have whether they are deductibles for medical treatment whether you know you've had to have relatives come in from out of town or you know book hotels to to be near you whether it's funeral expenses we as Muslim Americans\nWant to list that financial burden off of these families we we want to be there\nThat is part el ... of the Muslim or non profit celebrate mercy

today\nAnd we just getting that that was talked a lot about his anti Semitic views before the attack on a social media platform called gab and we understand has become popular with some far right conservatives at All right activist what did he say they're\nYeah his writings reflect really hardcore anti Semitism vicious hatred and a lot of been echoing conspiracy theories Michelle about Jewish leaders including the idea that they're secretly funding undocumented immigrants who are\nComing to the U.S federal investigators say they're looking down with our social media activity as part of

was found in those searches we continue to conduct interviews scribes social media review possible surveillance camera video and exploit digital media to determine how wide Bowers committed this terrible act\nBut I should say that job this All right social media platform that Bowers used they've been struggling to stay afloat\nCensus attacked the Internet service provider kicked him off their servers today so they've been scrambling to find a way just to remain active\nWhat what kind of thought he's been saying about how this attack which is not the first mass shooting we've been seeing but sadly the latest ... how was it so deadly\nOnce again this was a gunman who a master really incredibly powerful arsenal he was armed with an A R Fifteen semi automatic rifle is as a weapon with a very high rate of fire as well as three ... three fifty seven handguns\nHas already said today he used all of those weapons during the attack uh ended up here so far that he acquired the mall legally
