seven this is all things considered from NPR News [noise]\nHi Michelle Martin will get the latest on the shooting and an update on the male bombings that targeted critics of President Trump\nNow anybody ever told me it was him I like having a million years never in a millionaire\nPlus we'll tell you what we're hearing in Pennsylvania where voters we met had been calling for unity and these divisive political time where\nWe have had the most progressive in civilization is when we learn\nTo work together to everyone's benefit for this news\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Janine hurts in Pittsburgh with already say accused gunman Robert powers was in the tree of life synagogue for about twenty minutes this morning killing at least eleven people and injuring ... others\nAnd this is a little bit of what he had to say\nThis as a medic attack is an assault on all of us it's an assault on humanity\nEarlier today he seemed to express some surprise that anti Semitism isn't in the dustbin of history\nWhich was an anti Semitic act you wouldn't think this would be possible in this day and age but we just don't seem to learn from the past\nI don't know how far in the past he's looking because just last year in Charlottesville, Virginia white supremacists march through the streets chanting Jews will not replace is one of them drove into a crowd of counterprotesters killing a woman and in the aftermath\nPresident Trump at the at this point speaking off the cuff not from prepared remarks said that there were very fine people on both sides so he decides to go forward with a campaign rally today in Illinois what reason did he give for not canceling it in light of the tragedy\nAnd he said he didn't want to let evil when a and he he referenced and nine eleven and the opening of the stock exchange\nUm it was about a week after nine eleven and his retelling of it it was the very next day um but he he simply said ... you you just can't let the bad guys when here's what he said\nWe have our lives we have our schedules and nobody's gonna change just okay\n\nI've heard a tone it down just a little bit is that okay [noise]\nSo the crowd didn't want him to tone it down and it turns out he didn't entirely tone it down he then proceeded to deliver a pretty Trent standard Trump rallies speech there was talk of the caravan chance of build the wall at one point he mentioned Hillary Clinton\nAnd he said it really fast and quietly like he was trying to make a point of toning it down and then the crowd of course chanted lock her up lock her up\nUm Clinton is one of the people who this week had received an explosive device hadn't sent to a center her as as part of that um attack 'em\nAnd so I'm One other no President Trump says he is planning to go to Pittsburgh soon OK\nNPR's White House correspondent Tamara Keith thank you very much for being with us him You're welcome now we're back to Michelle in Philadelphia\nFederal authorities are also investigating the spate of pipe bombs male two prominent Democrats and CNN this past week they have charged a Florida Man named Cesar say oc is to appear on Monday\nThe individuals who received the improvised explosive devices were regular target of verbal attacks from President Trump last night though the president bristled at the suggestion that his rhetoric is to blame for what he called the sinister actions of one individual\nBut we wondered if it is fair to ask if his tone has created a climate conducive to violence like the mail bombs or the carnage at a synagogue today\nI talked about this with professor Kathleen Hall Jamieson she is an expert on political discourse at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School of communication and we spoke so that we could raise the complaints of critics that President Trump has normalized a quote unquote of the ring of people are by which we need a tax on political opponents as enemies\nThe president the United states has a unique capacity to determine what are accepted political norms of discourse\nIt to the extent that he expands those outside the normal boundaries he says to everyone else those expanded boundaries are no boundaries in which you can not only speak but speaking public and not be afraid of sanctions and for that we have the whole Donald Trump accountable\nI mentioned you that we've been traveling around a state bro this week meeting with\nAll kinds of people I spoke with a group of Trump supporters were going to hear from them later this weekend they prefer not to have heard any of the president's attacks on individuals the media I you know I was asking them about the tone that the president sets but they prefer not to hurt any of this\nWe all live to some extent within our own like minded communities and when we live inside our own media bubble were far more likely to see the world through the filter that it offers so to the extent that the president is saying things that have been normalized inside that constituency they're not going to remember it specifically is going to be a background assumption\nThere have been any device of moments in American history of any violent moments I mean assassinations politically motivated bombings the civil war for that matter how old are you you can ... this year as a person who studied communication throughout our history\nThe difference between then and now is that now exist in an environment in which these horrific acts that is bombs were sent to people yielded two and a half or so days of people asking whether or not these were fake or not\nWhether or not Donald Trump was or was not to blame for them what it suggests as we've lost our capacity be horrified by the sort of action we've lost our ability to say whether\nThey were Democrats or Republicans we disapprove of this action profoundly and we're going to ask if the climate that is conducive to it something that we are in any way contributing to for example when someone's driving around with a van with pictures that suggests ... member him at the pictures that show people in the crosshairs of a gun\nThat that was normalized enough in a community that that person thought it was acceptable to drive around with that van and then I tend to rally in park that than go to a rally were some of those sentiments within the audience were expressed on T shirts\nHow we manage to normalize that so much that in this moment we couldn't come together and say whoever did this this is highly problematic we disapprove of it and we're going to look at the broader culture and can we minimize the liquid there will ever happen again\nThat is Kathleen Hall Jamieson professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for communication her latest book is cyber war how Russian hackers on trolls\nWe ... we believe that checks are what the system is designed to have but a check has to go in both directions if you have a situation where you have President Trump in the White House in ... close to your speaker you can't just have a check going in one direction that ... got to go in both directions\nIf you go back to Congress and you were in the minority how let's sit with you\nThe only thing I care about is that we have a block of good people and that's what our caucus is about that are going to drive the solutions that's the primary importance when we're in a position where we're supporting democratic members of our caucus that should tell you our view right I mean it's not so much who holds the majority it's for the ... going to be setting the agenda in Congress and\nIs it true that you have committed to only voting for speaker who will sign on to our family into ... we break the ... of August has agreed to that and if there is no Republican who signs on to that would you vote for a Democrat for speaker\nSo here's what we agreed as a group to do that we are only going to support a candidate that supports these proposals\nIs it difficult for you that being a Republican part of the Republican caucus given the way the president conducts\nI think both parties need to have strong interest in them and I think if either party is hijacked by the fringe on one side of the other that's a bad thing\nYou see a way out of it out of the the current atmosphere\nIt's up to each and every one of us start to the kitchen table and it goes to the White House and everyone in between uh how we talk to each other the tone use whether review differences of opinion as strengths to harness rather than we consider to be criticized I was very very blessed to grow up in a very diverse community and\nI carry that with me to the FBI and one problem solving model that we had in the FBI was anytime we had a time sensitive crime problem we what's around the table with people from completely different backgrounds different\nEducational backgrounds different professional backgrounds\nComing from different parts of the country different regions of the world invariably everybody based on the family they grew up in the city they grow up in where they went to school what they studied pain they may have felt that you and I couldn't fathom that offsets how they approach problems and we\nPut all that together and it always allowed us to get one step ahead of that criminal ... everybody's unique perspective together and that's essentially what the problem solvers ... says it's a legislative version of that and I tell everybody\nI meet if you ever had a chance to sit on a one of those meetings you'll be so proud of your country because you autistic I cannot tell who the Democrats or Republicans are that room you know when I leave Congress whenever that is are under whatever circumstances that is I just want to be able to say that I\nI did my part when I was there to advance that\nBelief that we got to get rid of this judging people based on what box they checked on their voter registration form where they're Eighteen we got to get past that\nCongressman ... thanks so much for for talking to us today\nThey kill an WHYY stave Davies is still with us for a couple more seconds ... congressman fitzpatrick almost went to ... took pains to identify more as a member of the No Labels group or the problem solvers conscious than he did but the Republican Party what do you make of that\nHe has a case to make that he's an independent who voted against the repeal of Obamacare he's gotten support support from gun control groups Democrats like Indian he will help the Republicans keep control of committee assignments and the flow of legislation and nothing Democrats care about will ever get to vote and that's what matters\nThat ah WHYY state David statement seems

sharp about the barbecue that I you know I didn't like it or you know cost a little bit or whatever and Jonathan just shut me down in the most magnificent way explaining to me that\nThat was my aesthetic take on their barbeque but what I needed to do was appreciate the style they were cooking and how they were making it and judged against that you know it's okay to\nNot like something

have released the names of eleven people killed at a synagogue in Pittsburgh yesterday morning they range in age from fifty four to Ninety seven the alleged shooter faces multiple federal criminal counts as well as the charges as NPR's Eric Westervelt reports\nThis this is another attempt by the state legislature will legislature put this one on the ballot to try to deal with or of housing affordability crisis so we have in California it's it's a bit different than than the general ... kinds of bonds it's a revenue bond in that there's already a dedicated stream of funding here\nAnd so the funds to pay the bond back will come from the the revenue that already exists\nAnd is there any controversy about taking money that was designed for mental health services and transferring that into a pool of money for housing\nYeah absolutely that's a the even the road to get here this is essentially a bill that was a senator Kevin daily owns in two thousand sixteen and was challenged by a lawsuit saying you know that's not the intention of props sixty three which is the money\nThat is going to be used for this specific God bond measure and said there are people who are saying that you're taking money that is meant for mental health services and now creating a housing program out of it\nAnd for for mental health for national health right yeah I just remember this was a millionaire attacks that we passed proposition sixty three back in two thousand for\nThis is not new money this is just saying that money we can now use a hundred and forty million dollars of that money to build housing for it for a mental health patience right and the other point I Want to make is reiterate what Michael said\nIs that all these initiatives there either placed on the ballot by the state legislature or by signatures and this is one that's placed by the state legislature to change the law that was already voted upon the voters that they cannot change but they need your permission to be able to spend the money differently\nNot new money put to spend it differently\nNow you want to weigh in on this because it is a little different than prop one\n... one there's the same issues that that play that the that this will ultimately costs close to four billion dollars a\n... half of that will go towards the these housing programs the other half will go to interest now one thing to think about is that that's that's over a billion dollars I could have gone to a mental health services that voters intended to go to mental health services that once that go to pay off interest\nUh on on a program that they did not originally support and that that money that was taxed for people that's now money that's not going to go to my ... that's going to go to a brand new program with results that we don't yet know what that what that is um so I think that's something that has to be kept in mind that\nThis is something that's going to be it's going to end up costing double what what is it what it is up front it's a brand new program is taking money away from services and this is or mentioned the mental health services act has already been under fire for ... for ever since it was passed by the the state auditor by legislative and his office this money that's\nBeing under used as it is and so now do we want to take that money and waste half of it on a interesting they're talking about proposition to the bond measure melody\nRabbit just jump in there and say absolutely there have been a lot of controversy over the spending on a ... sixty three but I Would add that the author of that measure uh Darrell Steinberg who's now the mayor of Sacramento he said that it was always intended to create a program that stabilizes homeless mentally ill um\nHomeless people All right so that's proposition to next up of the third bond measure on the ballot propositions three which issues nearly nine billion dollars in bonds for water related infrastructure and environmental projects would like to start is on on that Katie Orr\nYeah I can say um if you think you voted on a water bond before you have [laughter] I'm about the third one we had one and twenty four team that was for seven billion dollars and the governor came out very strong for that one there was one in the spring that we voted on for four billion dollars and that was actually an effort by lawmakers\nTo keep this proposition off of the ballot they were trying to I'm sort of doing an end run around that up but\nThey were not successful this one would be for watershed treatment habitat groundwater management a whole slew of\nA different water projects but um it's not we don't see the governor jumping in and supporting this one as we have in the past there is a feeling that the government the legislature and the government is not the ones backing this\nMatter and do we know how much of this money would go to providing a more reliable sources agriculture water in California versus urban residential use has that been delineated anyone's knowledge\nIt seems like most of the water is for um uh people people are saying that one of the criticisms is that this is a give away to agriculture businesses\nAnd that they they are the ones that would benefit most from that Senate specific a water projects water districts what want money for their projects than they should find a way to find them we shouldn't be making everyone in the state pay for projects that will only benefit specific places\nAll right ah Michael Evers anything quickly\nWell I think the other thing about this one is and again I I I spent the last couple of weeks rooting through this um and and trying to figure out the details of how this money is going to be spent\nAnd it's it's really unclear exactly what kind of trends parents oversight we as taxpayers will help with the expenditures under this under this measure as I understand it the money basically goes to agencies and state agencies are going to allocate the funds and it's really not clear to me exactly how you tracked the money was one of one of one of the concerns I it was\nAll right that's propositions read nearly nine billion dollars water related infrastructure and environmental projects the final bond measure is proposition for one and a half billion dollars in bonds for children's hospitals a melody yet again say on that now\nI mean this one is one of the ones that doesn't have a lot of opposition its funding a\nCutting edge technology for children's hospitals that's probably a hard thing to run your opposition campaign on on but you know their argument is that they treat children from low income families they're not being subsidized for some of that care and that this money is needed for seismic upgrade equipment\nUm you know the one thing I Would add is that if like Katie said if you feel like you've voted on this before you have\nUm there were two different bonds on for a similar improvements ah seven hundred and fifty million bond or in two thousand four and a nine hundred and eighty million dollar bond in two thousand eight so these are things that are going before voters a you know several times\nIn the last retrofitting issue was a big thing for a lot of hospitals I Know because uh just the cost of doing it to these large facilities is is a major sell your thoughts on this bond measure um\nSo to take a stand against children's hospitals [laughter]\nYou know they you know this this is one of those measures that sounds sounds good uh who who's anti giving children's hospitals money ah well I Am a [noise]\nUh so now again so there's one point there's one point five million dollars is gonna end up costing double that\nUh how about how about this is just an idea how about the state if if children's hospital retrofitting is so important to have at the state just take some money out of its massive budget that ... and and the massive increase in revenue has every year and put some money to children's hospitals retrofitting\nWith existing revenues they could do that if they wanted the state legislature could do that if they want it to instead we have this measure right here which is one point five billion dollars that's going to be\nCosting double that it's going to be at the expense of taxpayers and when I asked the the the president of the California children's hospital association if money was necessary she said uh yes it would be nice to have we do a great job of fundraising but\nThis would be nice to help her out of this is the two thousand

D politics reporter Katie or\nSouthern California newsgroup interim opinion editor Salvador Rodriguez\nSan Francisco chronicle political reporter melody Gutierrez Cal Tech professor of political science Michael Alvarez at Loyola Marymount professor of political science Fernando Guerra\nA it's a nice idea fanciful idea um that that's going to cost a over a hundred billion dollars probably if it's ever if it ever gets anywhere um why why is it that\nSpending ... why is it that we we have this significant increase in revenue why is it that we have a pipe dreams like the high speed rail project\nOn the agenda and and yet we need to have a brand new source of funding for transportation infrastructure that doesn't seem right to me that seems like a a money grab to helps us to help sustain an unsustainable a physical turmoil and ...\nYear I've I've heard some people argued that it is a regressive tax because people who often you know can't afford housing closer to work Dr Laura instances have yes less fuel efficient cars they pay more\nYeah absolutely um one of the major issues I have with this initiative is not actually the repeal\nBut then it hangs cos the legislature and California government\nFor any future a use of fuel taxes and just the same thing that has happened with proposition Thirteen which as Hank cup California to be proactive enough variety of different issues\nThis well heck office for generations to come in dealing with our road repairs so it's not just the repeal if further says that you can't do anything without two thirds vote\nIt is ... ... again horrendous public policy uh problems um I agree with Michael ... and with Katie that it is a Republican ploy and just in Democrats have done this historical years well using the initiative process\nUh fortunately in the last couple of elections it's kinda died down this ... this is ... basically the only initiative that really being done by a political party like that where we used to have like four or five every every year um but you know\nCalifornians we vote and and love our taxes ... just in the last election we voted archive except don't tax our homes and don't tax our cars that that's the issue no\nRight or let's continue that was proposition six the repeal of the vehicle fee increases and the gas tax proposition seven authorizes the California legislature to provide for permanent daylight saving time\nBut it would only happen if the federal government were to allow that so this is a dependence proposition so to speak a Katie want to start us on this one\nWell as the relatively new mom I feel like [laughter] and it's you an expert on that fewer time changes the better\n[laughter] but I think you really laid it out this is something that I feel like California has sort of\nHad a fascination with we thought there were a bill in the legislature this year and that allows for this vote 'em and but you really laid it out what does this proposition do not much I mean it lets the legislature vote on it if the legislature approved at the governor could than it let Congress work on it and I believe the president has to weigh in as well\nSo I mean it's just it is the start of a step\nOr other process but um it really\nIsn't anything that you'll you'll see happen anytime soon anybody else with anything quickly at Mike I just wanted to say I think that this is a we're already a couple of steps in as I recall the history of those so I I Believe that there have been a sort of the legislature's been interested in the past and\nAnd we're now at a point where they were waiting to see if other states we're going to be interested in moving away from daylight savings time and so I think the legislature's kind of hopeful that by getting the California voters to weigh in on this one and then they will act that maybe that will lead to a a larger group states can suffer ... part of the challenges are California Constitution which is hundreds of\nPages long we continue to put a lot of things in there and this was decades ago that we did this and so now we actually have to have you vote on it to allow the legislature in Congress to take action\nIf it happens so we're just asking you not to just give them permission in case there is a national trend to change that by the way the European Union and throughout the world there's major discussion and in Europe they will change it next year that we're getting rid of this and it's good consistent throughout the world and we just want to continue with it\nThere are concerns historically I should say there have been concerns or in the agricultural community about this I'm a ... because of you know the darkness when kids would be going to school things like that um but ... are you aware of any sort of organized opposition to fulltime daylight saving time\nWell I mean I think that's one of the things that would be interesting to see if it gets out of California and goes to the federal government\nWhere would everyone come down on and I honestly don't know I I Do I Do know I Will say I used to live in Indiana which had three times and was incredibly confusing so we're not we wouldn't be as bad as some places but um I I really I don't know how the federal government\nWould would take to that yeah of course our neighbor Arizona or doesn't go on daylight saving time so they have a permanent\nFerment in time but it's not daylight savings time it's it's a standard time that they keep year round so once again that is propositions seven which is passed by voters then would allow the legislature and the governor to take this up is\nThe federal government were to make a move towards a standardizing a fulltime daylight saving time\nProposition age ah would require dialysis clinic kidney dialysis clinics to issue refunds to private insurance companies a for a revenue that they take in that's more than Fifteen Percent a profit\nFrom the service that they provide this is a very complicated a measure I just led recently a full on debate on this and I'm Still trying to get my head around the complexities of this but part of the history is the effort of service Employees International union\nTo organize the employees at the two biggest dialysis companies the chains that are here in California I'm Michael you want to start\nUs off on on on this or give me the that's going to say uh actually you know this this one known you the longest I think that's why\nYou know in my mind valuation of this this is exactly what a what you just said which is one is incredibly complicated I've I've gone waded through this a number of times in it you'd you'd reads as if it's if it's an attempt to to begin lower the cost or make make a dialysis treatment more affordable\nUm but I Do understand that there's a little bit of politics by which are I Wonder if some of my colleagues might want to talk about 'cause I'm not quite as as aware of the politics\nNow where did you you estimate for when this to share yeah I mean this is one of the lesser known initiatives no doubt you've heard the radio ads because a hundred and twenty million dollars is being spent on the lot of ads on mostly by the dialysis clinic um who have poured a lot of money and you know you do have the backdrop of union\nUm unionizing and uh you have the backdrop of you know whether or not a health care costs should be able to sort of like they have been and so there's a lot of in the background going on to this one on top of the fact that it's just a very complicated measure so the proponents\nTheir argument is that there would be a greater investment by these dialysis centers\nIn patient care because they're not going to want to pay these rebates the private insurers for going about fifty percent and sense what they would pay their employees in providing services would count as expenses that therefore they would more likely to invest in\nProponents say this might well lead to dialysis clinic closures will continue on this proposition on our ...\nMay shouldn't say it as a stand up comic with cerebral palsy and that's part of a stick\nIn their hands\nOlympics I Would win the gold medal Palestinian Muslim\nI'm female I'm the same old and I live in New Jersey [noise] laughing through the pain that next time on the\nTed radio hour NPR joining us this afternoon at three
