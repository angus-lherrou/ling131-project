of the Supreme Court nominee in August and now says he has changed his mind\nMark off color within the law school class of Nineteen Ninety along with Kavanaugh and he joins us now welcome to the program for having me well you think back to the late eighties when you have an hour in law school together what stands out to you\nWell it was intense experience it's a small class of about a hundred and sixty people at that time at Yale Law we knew each other pretty well and uh the classroom experience and the social experience were both among the most intense of my life\nWhat was Kevin all like back in law school when you were students together\nWhen we're in law school a Brett was like most people he was young energetic smart somebody that was interesting to talk to and hang around with a I never in this important to say I never saw any of the behavior or anything like what's been alleged and I never heard stories about that\nYou're a Democrat what factored into your decision to sign a letter to the Senate Judiciary committee along with twenty two other classmates endorsing Kevin ... over the summer\nI Am a Democrat however my side lost an election in ... certainly aware that\nBrett Kavanaugh does not agree with me on a number of legal and political issues but having lost an election the other side was not going to nominate somebody that I Would have chosen in that way and so you have to look at qualifications you have to look at experience and so I knew from my own experience with Brett\nThat he was somebody that I liked but I called some people practice in front of the court that a court of appeals for the district of Columbia and they explained that he was a fair judge somebody who hire good clerks and wrote could opinions\nAnd so in part based on that I signed the letter\nAnd then what was it about last Thursday's hearing that prompted you to send a second letter just yesterday to the Senate Judiciary committee withdrawing or support\nI think it really has to do not so much with the allegations of Dr for given that we're still waiting for the FBI to report on that it has to do with the exchange he had with the senators which is a co equal branch of government and having civil discourse with the quote unquote branches of government is something that\nWe have to expect from the Supreme Court in particular it was the exchange with my own senator Amy ... red Kevin uh started by recognizing his that he liked her that he had murder work but then when she has to hard question he responded by throwing the question back at her\nThis was a question about his drinking\nThat's correct and he done that before with Senator Whitehouse or perhaps one other senator in ... there was something about that that was like a gut punch you know it was it was it was really disappointing now he did come back and apologize for that at least to center ...\nBut that's something that is very hard to get over why do you consider that just qualifying\nLike I said because there are a expectations of the Supreme Court that they have to treat with respect to co equal branch of government they can't as we often hear Eric ... power to themselves and if he's going in with that kind of contempt protocol equal branch it's deeply troubling\nAnd now that you've been in touch with other classmates do you feel that your representative or more of an outlier\nOh I'm an outlier in two ways I mean there was an outlier for signed a letter in the first place it was only twenty three out of the hundred and six\nSome members of the class scientists and the first place so that made me an outlier in certainly an outlier or with my Proctor and withdrawing from the letter [noise] um so it's it's really only the two of us are among said oh group who did those things do you still consider him a friend [noise]\nYes I I I Hope that we can have a friendship I'm I suspect you might be screened and my calls right now but uh I Hope not\nMark officers Yale Law school classmate

unprepared to carry out the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant families earlier this year that it wasn't even ready to house the children nor did even had a plan to reunite them with their parents\nThat's is from a scathing report from the homeland security department internal watchdog this week\nThe administration has abandoned its policy of separating families to deter illegal immigration but only after widespread outrage and after more than twenty six hundred children were already separated from their parents\nTo talk more about the d._a. chess inspector general's findings were joined by NPR's Joel Rose angel\nHey also so you know we've been hearing all year about the problems with this policy of separating families but why isn't new in this report that contradicts what we've been hearing from the administration\nWell it contradicts some early assurances that we got from federal officials as this policy was being rolled out here's da chest secretary cures to Nielsen\nIt is important to note that these miners are very well taken care of don't believe the press they are very well taken care of it\nBut this report paints and much less rosy picture the inspector general found that the H. S. held hundreds of migrant children in border patrol facilities well beyond the legal limit of Seventy two hours in fact federal officials held more than eight hundred migrant children for longer than that including one child who was held for twenty five days\nAnd many of these children were held in metal cages in border patrol facilities near the border until the government was able to find space in shelters that are equipped to have children\nWe had full significant sponsorship deals that reached late stages of negotiations um there was inquiries made as to whether we would consider removing Tibet from the competition\nThe reason was China Tibet as a part of China but many Tibetans hate Chinese rule and the Chinese government tries to stamp out anything that suggests a separate Tibetan identity potential sponsors were so worried about offending Beijing they pressed to China's agenda themselves\nI did have a threat to someone he said look at it with my boss it's Tibet can you get them out there [laughter] and he apologized today so I'm really sorry it's a terrible thing to ask we love what you do but would you removed to that and I said to the mall you clearly don't love what we do because what we do is to that\nThe sponsors and seeing how China had punished firms that straight from its official line in January authority suspended Mary outs Chinese website after the hotel group mistakenly referred to Tibet Hong Kong Macau is countries the next month Mercedes was forced to apologize for quoting the Dalai Lama Tibet spiritual leader on Instagram\nWatching understands why sponsors were scared of backing his soccer tournament I imagine it's\nOutfits graph that terrified of the you know a six months down the line there a business meeting in China and that fights with images and is that companies logo and the Tibetan ... lives in Tibet shut the facts and yeah that could be a deal breaker [noise]\nWatching refused to dump the debate costs more than a hundred thousand dollars in sponsorship fans were grateful surprise\nYoga used to work with students for free Tibet\nIt's very rare these days that you see people sticking to such principles and being

fully for the two biggest last year the Durham University students you organized to debate whether China was a threat\nTo the west often we published the debates we started getting a lot of emails from the Chinese students and scholars association\nTom Harwood was president of the union then he said Chinese students complained about the topic and pressed him to drop one of the speakers Anastasia when a former miss world Canada ... also a human rights activist and a member of a spiritual meditation group banned by the Chinese government again Tom Harwood actually it goes\nTo the point where the embassy signed off our office and started questioning of all about the debate often if we could look to invite a phase deal in\nAn even go to the point where one of the officials at the embassy suggested that if this debate ones ahead the u._k. might get\nLess favorable traits comes off to brag says Harwood was still it is just quite shocking that within an institution that was a hundred and Seventy five years old that prides itself on hosting free speech free exchange debate\nThat an outside influences trying to change that will try and stop us hosting a speaker\nIn a statement the Chinese embassy denied pressuring the union to Malcolm risk into former British foreign secretary was one of the speakers of the Durham debate he didn't think much of China's alleged tactics\nI thought it was pathetic it's something that the Chinese raised foolishly do again in a good\nBeijing has spent years trying to influence how the world talks about China and risking says when the country was much weaker\nIt was easy to ignore when I was a foreign secretary I was involved in the final stages of the negotiations or the transfer Hong Kong back to China and it wants to the Dalai Lama was going to be in the United kingdom and I told my office that I Would be very happy to see him or the ... to the plate and they said it was inappropriate\nBut nothing more than that happened because at that time they didn't have the diplomatic way to they have today\nRon emitters as they were important reasons why China wants to frame it's global image measures that China scholar at Oxford University\nOne of the context for the obsessive way in which Chinese officials can sometimes think about the way that China is portrayed overseas is the fact that for the best part of a hundred and fifty years China was of course not in control of its own destiny\nIt was a period when foreign powers carved up China which the government calls the century of humiliation the government's reason economic boom changed all that\nThese days ... much better position to actually spread that narrative talk about itself in those terms with we might say much allowed to\nMake a ... and that is creating some cognitive dissonance I thing for some parts of the American establishment which maybe for a long time so that democracy was not the only way that China could guys but the only way that any country could possibly go\nNow Chinese President Xi Jinping has gone further than past leaders arguing the China's authoritarian system is a model for others and alternative to
