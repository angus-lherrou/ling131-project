President Trump's national security adviser John Bolton is in Moscow today he reiterated the administration's announcement from this weekend that the U.S does intend to withdraw\nFrom the thirty year old nuclear nonproliferation treaty signed by Ronald Reagan and the cow Gorbachev today in Moscow Bolden said the treaty has outlived its purpose\nSo there's a new strategic reality out there this was a Cold War bilateral for sickness or related three and a multi polar\nJoining us now to talk about what all of this will mean is Melissa ... at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies she's a nuclear weapons expert and joins us now thank you thank for having me so is what John Bolton saying accurate is this treaty passed\nIts prime [noise] no not in any way I I'm surprised that he's even using that language this treaty is about protecting Europe\nSo the U.S and Soviet Union of first agreed to this and Nineteen eighty seven and one of the really darkest points in their history um because these missiles carrying nuclear warheads we're really a threat to Western Europe\nAnd so the U.S wanted to protect allies by limiting the Soviet union's ability to deliver nuclear weapons to them\nHow we pulling out of history to be a bad idea right now for security in Europe\nWhen they originally created this agreement the idea was that the Soviet Union wouldn't be able\nTo prevent NATO members from coming to each other's aids because of the threat of their nuclear intermediate range missiles\nAnd that's still true today and so the fallout from these ah statements from the Trump Administration has really\nMulti ... no one uh there was no advance notice that we know of to any European allies or NATO So there's going to be a lot of infighting and handwringing over what NATO should do\nAnd to uh Europe and I would say at this point Russia and China and the whole world are really worried about what this means largely for for treaties an arms control agreements around the world\nI Want to take on Bolton statement about how this is now a mole type polar world let's talk about China how China's missile capabilities factor into the Trump administration's decision to pull out of this treaty\nSo it's true that the u._s. is concerned\nThat China might use what's called a ... twenty six to hit Guam where the U.S has military installation or to hit an aircraft carrier and not whether us ... considered about um with China\nThe problem is that China was never a party of this agreement so really they don't have any restrictions on building these kinds of missiles\nAnd you know if if the U.S wants to negotiate with China a similar kind of deal than they can do so\nCould point out of this treaty complicate U.S Russia relations at this point\nCertainly they both holds today just as they did back in Nineteen eighty seven the largest amount of nuclear weapons in the world and it's in their self interest to prevent other states or non state actors from getting as many nuclear weapons as they do\nAnd how worried should the average citizen be who's watching all of this play out right now just leaving this treaty in your opinion make the world less safe\nFor a long time people really believe that international agreements where the best way to create peace and stability in the world you didn't have to like your partner in a treaty but you could still\nA deal with them and you could believe that they would obey the terms of the agreement and you could verify that and you could retaliate if they didn't\nBut a lot of those rules are going out the window and increasingly under the Trump Administration and under potent and Xi Jinping we're seeing more strong arm moves and so\nWelcome back to the framed by John horn identity is at the center of KIPP full backs long term photography endeavor known as the hop a project\nIt's included a book exhibits in portrait that he's taken of hundreds of people from all over the country now what began Seventeen

artist kip ... started taking photos of people who like him identified as ... or mixed race the term hubbub has its roots in the Hawaiian language to mean mixed or part\nIncluding in the context of referring to those with mixed native Hawaiian heritage he take their portraits and asked him simply what are you the question was meant to elicit a sort of statement of identity or at least of how they see themselves in the world\nI did a about twelve hundred people early to thousands and I made a book with a chronicle books called ... and ... and the Japanese American museum I held the first show two thousand and six and that was like the beginning of everything\nIn its current exhibition up about me full because returned to the original participants with updated portraits and

later and says hey I'm Christy nice to meet you too\nAnd it's just a different kind of maturing as she's not defensive she's learned how to pick our battles at I think it's\nIt's it's Twenty one to

grew up in Nineteen Seventy LA county uh my cousin told me you're off she went to\nModerate high and you know this and why are there and they told her and so I'm like okay and so I grew up thinking it's oh that must mean your Chinese English Irish and later every other people are going up I'm like oh and I lived in Hawaii and like\nAnd it's like a ... different definition there [noise]\n\nI wanted to find other people around to see like who is really involved in infested identifying that way and the other one is I Want to show that we are nothing alike that there is I mean people always

why can't they\n[noise]\nSo I'm Jenny and I actually live in California and I'm ... and I live in Minneapolis, Minnesota so we have a picture together and then basically describes on what are you are basically in who are you what your identity and the blank space beneath\nBut what are you or your question is the question that it makes people get often so I think it's kind of playing off of the common question\nWe have a really long time to figure it out and and decided to go really corny and that we like our general ethnic backgrounds next year the picture and then we sat next babies that ... and then if that at a hundred percent that's fans and then he ran one hundred percent grass to eat that that [noise]\nOh\nI'd had people tell me like why did you include some people that are Asian Asian that that's not help I'm like you don't get to tell them who they are I think showing that diversity of like the seven plus million dollars in the U.S\nShowing that there were so it was really important to me I always feel like identity is a completely personal process your right to call yourself what you want to call yourself but no one gets to tell you who you are and so basic I said if you want to fall under the rubric of what you think ... is and be part of the project [noise]\nEspecially since I'm mixed ethnicity tie in Chinese myself\nAnd I submitted my own statement\nThat we are

I feel confident that they'll be able to link these devices but then the real work will be can you link it back to a person or persons unknown\nAnd I know they're really looking at how were these delivered\nAnd the fact that none of these devices actually exploded that that fact does help investigators right when the devices are still intact and might still retain fingerprints for example\nAbsolutely and that's why the um the first responders are are taking so much time to render these devices safe\nWithout destroying the evidence it's not like they're going to put another an explosive device next to it and blow it to smithereens they have techniques used to preserve evidence this will be important as the investigation unfolds but right now\nThere are devices that could be

than Seventy thousand Americans died from a drug overdose\nOpioids were responsible for about two thirds of those stats and the White House today President Trump signed legislation that will allow lawmakers from both parties to say they are taking steps to address the problem NPR's Scott Horsley reports\nThe opioid bill was passed by both the house and Senate with near unanimous approval level of bipartisan support that Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio says is unusual in today's highly polarized political climate\nI guess maybe because the severity of the crisis and particularly in states like mine of people are willing to work together and joined hands and figure out how to solve it and forget the politics\nDemocratic senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire agrees the opioid crisis cuts a wide and deadly swab from rural areas to big cities and polls show it's the rare issue that voters in both parties are alarmed by\nWe are losing over a hundred people a day in the United states of America to this epidemic you couldn't go anywhere in the country and talked all about the impact it had on them this is impacting people in all walks of life in different ways\nThe opioid

to do\n... wants to see more effort to address over prescribing opioids knowing that many addicts start out with a legitimate need for pain pills but yes despair also plays a role\nOr the answer to this is to get people who are in places like small town Ohio of rural Appalachian more opportunities that is I think one of the antidote to the drug issue more broadly\nHealth secretary Alex Azar said this week there are some encouraging signs that the epidemic may be leveling off or at least not growing as rapidly as it once was\nBut drug addiction remains an elusive and evolving problem overdose deaths from heroin and prescription drugs may be near their peak but ... says methamphetamine is regaining a foot hold and cocaine is making a comeback as well\nYou know it's a societal issue we of

head on a he did not take any responsibility personally for it\nWhich was interesting but he called it a heinous act and he did promise to bring Robert did it to justice so I think that was his attempt to try and concerns a among people from all around the world who thinks that this is sort of part of the Saudi culture to violate human rights in this way\nAnd how was the audience reacting as the crown prince was speaking today\nIt was a very positive you know I'm sort of a bully in the audience in favor of the crown prince he got standing ovations um after he uh discuss the situation as well as when he was talking about the Saudi economy and how you know he wanted to lead the charge to make it an economic powerhouse in the middle east\nYou mentioned that it was a very supportive audience I I Want to talk about what American companies did show up they who did you see there\nThere was a broad range of executives from all different kinds of companies the big names from my jeep marking and Goldman Sachs we're not there are some of the banks did some lower level executives but I think some people were definitely shy about being there they were in many cases concealing the names of their name tags by their ties are keeping their jackets\nButtoned up which you might not you in Saudi Arabia were pretty hot these days they\nWere people willing to talk about why they did show up what they hope to get out of the conference\nYeah somewhere I mean there was definitely a sense a people that I spoke to\nThat you know this is an important business opportunity important investing opportunity and I didn't want us our relations with the Saudis I think some people felt that you know their attendance if they didn't show up wouldn't necessarily be noticed or make a statement so they felt like they were going to go\nAnd see what happened anyway and there were others who felt that you know it's unclear at this point exactly what did happen and you know until investigation as conclusive they were going to get the Saudis the benefit of the doubt\nHave you heard anything yet at this conference that makes you think ... that will determine new American investment in Saudi Arabia or hurt existing ties with the kingdom I think\nSo I mean I think it will depend somewhat what additional evidence comes out going forward but you know people said that the big banks of the biggest brands and business are going to be reluctant to jump back in right away because of the potential damage those brands\nAs well as companies in Silicon valley which are very focused on you know ethical investing the defense companies were less reluctant than the big banks to step away from the conference I think they just seem less concerned about the backlash against their friends and\nThis is such a important market for them to be involved in I think it would be after them as being just for them to step away\nThat's Allan Ropper port of the New York times thank you so much for joining us today\nThank you for having me and here in Washington the Senate Judiciary committee considered for more of President Trump's judicial nominees today but two senators attended the hearing that's because the Senate is in recess NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson reports\nThe entire hearing was over in less time than an episode of law and order around forty minutes and all the committee's top Republican Chuck Grassley didn't show up neither did any Democrats instead senator might crepe our Republican from Idaho was in charge\nBrigitte ... could ms

followed the usual script nominees bank their spouses and children that Miller gave another family member or a shout out\nThe money let's tease that out to all these defendants work or worked for Adidas accompany the third person you've describing your columns as an aspiring sports agent has sort of middle man what argument to these defendants try to me to explain why these payments they made to the players were legal\nWell they never believe that they were they admitted they violated NCA rules right that bond that they didn't violate the law\nDoes not violate the law and their belief was look we we worked for Adidas and we have players who play for Adidas sponsored summer and a new basketball teams\nAnd we steer them to schools that have signed contracts endorsement contracts with Adidas and we're not trying to hurt those schools like Kansas or Louis Vail mhm we're trying to help them by giving them a great player so that was their case the fed said now by giving you by paying players you have rendered them ineligible\nAnd loss when those players get to the school ... those schools the schools are at risk for NC double a sanctions and not those schools have been defrauded and because those schools receive federal funds it's a federal case and the government won that\nSo lot of evidence was presented in court over the past few weeks what of course some of the new details that came to light about about how this kind of player recruitment works give us some details\n[noise] well I think almost anybody who's seen the movies or or follow college sports at all
