Washington I'm jak spear\nPresident Trump is celebrating what he calls the biggest trade deal in us history prime minister Justin Trudeau was also talking up the benefits of the new continental trade agreement agreed to in principle late last night as Dan carpet truck report you do also brief provincial leaders this morning\nDr Ford's allegation is not merely uncorroborated it is refuted by the very people she says we're there including by a longtime friend of hers refuted\nRefuted Kevin I think those people Henry few data for its recollection of what happened is that accurate\nNot quite accurate because the bulk of their statements are that they don't remember now the letters vary in terms of how one fat ugly they don't remember how fat ugly they deny what they think what's happening in that summer\nBut there is a big difference between not remembering refuting and that's why having FBI investigators get involved might help the senators drill down on this\nOkay let's turn to another statement that's mine where Kavanaugh has been asked about drinking while he was under age\nThe drinking age was Eighteen and Marilyn's for most of my time in high school was Eighteen in DC for all my time in high school\nAll right John did Kevin don't get the right was Eighteen the drinking age at the time in both places\nBrett Kavanaugh got it wrong from Maryland in Maryland the drinking age in the summer of Nineteen eighty two went from Eighteen to Twenty one\nSo at the time it would be very likely that Brett Kavanaugh being someone who was a less than Twenty one was not drinking legally at least for half of the summer\nThere are some moments where Kavanaugh talks about how much he drank back then he repeatedly mentioned that he liked to be here but he says as much as he liked to hear his drinking was not out of control here's how he put it\nI liked fear I still like beer but I did not drink beer to the point of walking out and I never sexually assaulted anyone\nHow firmly in ... he never drink to the point of blacking out has there been any evidence to challenge that so far\nWe've heard from people who went to high school with him college with him who said that yeah he drank a lot and that he would be a very sloppy drunk\nBut how is anyone to sort this out I think that it's extremely difficult because the whole nature of this is very subjective\nIt's not the sort of thing that lends itself to fact check per se I think it's it's right there on the margins of unless the guy was taken to the wrong ER and there's an official record of that\nThis is going to be extremely difficult to pin down\nJon Greenberg is a staff writer at politifact thank you very much my pleasure\nNow let's look at what the FBI is trying to find out during a week long investigation of Brett Kavanaugh\nThe president formally asked the bureau on friday to reopen next background check of the Supreme Court nominee and that means we're now three days and to the pro\nNPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here in the studio Hi Ryan other let's start with the big sticking point so far which has been the question of the scope of the investigation do we know what the FBI is looking into exactly\nWe don't exactly know what they're looking into no Democrats as we've heard have complained that the scope of this as a kind of being curtailed reined in by the White House they say that the administration has put strict limits on what the FBI can investigate Democrat said the FBI and the White House today a list of twenty four people that they say that the bureau should or should talk to\nThe administration has pushed back against this uh they've said that uh they do want a full investigation they made clear that um they also don't want a fishing expedition\nToday the president said that he wants what he called a comprehensive ... investigation he reiterated again that he wanted done quickly uh and it is the White House that has the final say on what the FBI gets to look into in the background investigation\nThat said Trump said today that well he has final say he's listening to what the Senate Republican leadership or wants to have checked out what they want looked into and then he's directing the FBI based off of what the Senate says\nAnd what has the Senate Republican leadership said they want the FBI to look into\nWell they initially said that they one of the FBI to look into what they called credible allegations of sexual misconduct that was always a big enough kind of ill defined enough that the questions about scope were almost inevitable a on this question of senior U.S Senate GPA pointed comments at Seventy Senator Lindsey Graham made over the weekend\nA Graham said that the FBI would talk to witnesses that Christine Blasey Ford mentioned in her testimony last week that includes Kevin us friend mark judge a gram also mentioned Deborah Ramirez she's the second woman who came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Kevin all\nThose allegations date back to their time at Yale in the early mid Nineteen eighties and those are the only people that Graham mentioned\nSo as I mentioned this is day three of the FBI's weeklong investigation\nAbout what the FBI has been doing and those three days so far well\nThe bureau itself has not provided any uh any clarity on this but NPR has learned that the FBI has interviewed Ramirez ah she's given the FBI list of people that she says either witnessed the elected incident uh or heard about it uh contemporaneously beyond that do it it's pretty much crickets a the bureau has not reached out to forward at this point\nIt also had an reach out to a third woman who came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh that Julie sweat Nick\nUh and then there are number of possible witnesses who could have information about the various a legit events in question when of course is Kevin us read mark judge we talked a lot about him judge has said he'll cooperate with the FBI of his his lawyer today declined to say anything beyond that\nAnd at the same time more of Kavanaugh's high school and college acquaintances are speaking out tell us about what they've said most recently\nWell the last twenty four hours a former friend up Kavanaugh's at Yale came out and publicly ... disputed Kevin O's representation of his of his drinking as a young man uh this is Chad letting too and he's a history professor at North Carolina state now\nAnd his comments don't relate to allegations of sexual misconduct but really about how much cabinet drank and what led you didn't says is that he frequently drank with Kevin all when they were at Yale us as Kevin I was a belligerent and aggressive drunk\nOr but at the same point in time the White House has put out statements from two college friends who say Kevin did not behave that way they don't match or those allegations don't match the cabinet that they knew a it's important for Democrats um to talk about Kevin most truthfulness about his drinking his truthfulness in his testimony that it's a something that should be looked into and the president says you know what I Believe with Kevin has had to say [noise]\nNPR's Ryan Lucas thanks Ryan thank you [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nIt's Eighteen minutes now past four o'clock I'm John rabies
