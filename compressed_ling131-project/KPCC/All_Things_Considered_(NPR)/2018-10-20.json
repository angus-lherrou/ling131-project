{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "When someone suffers a trauma when they're Seventeen years old and doesn't get any help you know Lori strode she left school on the thirty first of October a dreamer and intellectual someone who would have gone on to brown and changed the world\nAnd instead on November first she went back to school a freak and that's what happens with trauma it brands you up people point and call gosh ... she's the one who survived and it took away her innocence\nI think one of the characters in the movie or a doctor characters or something along the lines of there are many ways tragedy and violence can change a victim and it can make people may be sad in in ... in this case it makes her kind of a doomsday proper right I mean she is now not living in fear but lying in wait\nYeah but that's all in response to only one idea that she has per separated about for her entire life\nWhich is that he will come back for her\nAnd she has lost everything she ended up in a couple of relationships that were failed she ended up having a child the state came and took the child from her because she was an unfit mother unfit because her only goal everyday was to prepare her daughter for the fact that Michael Meyers was coming back I think\nI had been my notes why won't her dumb family believe her [laughter] like you know that it does is excellent thing that happens in horror movies where you can be in the audience thinking why aren't you listening but her family is trying to tell her and not a subtle way to get over\nIt all the hiding all this preparation and it was for nothing [noise] it took priority of your family it cost you your family if the way I raised her mother\nAnd she hates me and says she's\nPrepared for the horse in this world than\nSay goodbye to Michael in get over it everybody's\nTrying to tell her to get over it I think that's been the sort of refrain in her ears since she was Seventeen years old\nAnd in a weird way you know that is all of our ways of trying to distance ourselves from that person's trauma nobody wants to really get into it\nAnd it's much easier to give somebody a pain killer and say get over it you talk about Lori like she's a real person she is a real person how long has she felt have you felt close to this character 'cause we should say that this was\nKind of you're coming out party for you personally um can you talk a little bit about that idea\nIt was a role I had been on a TV series prior where I was one of six women with maybe two lines weak and here was a script that was completely a character a full character with a really emotional and dramatic arc\nAnd so for me honestly her name is on every page of the script and I was thrilled I'm a bit of a smart alec I have a trash talk\nNow not an intellectual and a big emotional hug a lot and here was a role of a quiet intellectual repressed virginal dreamer a who\nWalked down the street and sang herself I Wish I had you all of a [noise]\nJust\nYou know there was a romance to her and so for me she was the best role\nReally I've never been able to play\nOne thing that's interesting is I'm thinking of how John Carpenter who along with a co writer Deborah he'll created the franchise you're listed along with him as an executive producer and that must be incredible to think like you started out in Nineteen year old [laughter] and now your executive producer of it\nI never thought I'd have any have Audi\nReally though I mean I Know listening to this people are like Tony Curtis and ... like you don't think acting somewhere [laughter]\nI never thought about it for a second I wasn't very pretty I was cute I had great chief from my mother take in touch with cycling when I was\nYou know in utero I wasn't particularly talented I couldn't sing and I couldn't do musical theater I just sort of showed up my point is here I sit\nTalking about a movie that I've been involved with for years\nAbout something that it's up how something and that all of my life experiences have added up to this moment\nIs not something I had any idea what happened it's kind of incredible\nSo I I don't have it better thoughts than that [laughter] I'm happy for your Jamie we\nCreate our own I'm by the way I'm happy\nDon't get me wrong I didn't interview for um New York magazine with David ... and in a communication with me when we were sort of signing off an email exchange where he was doing some background information he said enjoy your victory lap\nOh and I started of course just started falling my eyes out because that's how it feels I've been going around the world sort of high fiving people with the astonishment of this moment I've worked hard\nBut I Am I don't expect it and that's what a gift is when you don't expect something and then it's given to you\nAnd you open it and go wow\nCue that incredible and that's what I feel David Gordon Green and Danny McBride gave me when they allowed me\nTo go where we had to go to explain and honor the courage and tenacity\nOf Laurie Strode who represents all women who've been addressed all women who've had to fight back all women who've survived and that's a privilege and not something I take lightly\nWell it has been an incredible journey it was a real honor to speak to you\nWell thank you ... it's been a a great privilege and I'm

... jihad to solve the consulate in Istanbul this bond as according to report in the Saudi state news agency NPR's Peter Kenyon reports Eighteen people that have been arrested including to advisors to the Saudi crown prince\nOf ... killing and those same really quite at odds with what the Saudis are announcing today the idea of a fistfight seems really counter to what the Turks have suggested so I think the only way right now to get to the bottom of this\nIs out a credible investigation and that means something that would be authorized by the un or some other international body\nWhat would that investigation look like how big are we talking how long would it take\nI think we're talking about something small you know we're talking about as in past cases like this maybe five individuals could be led by a high profile former prosecutor\nInvestigators who have experience with international crimes and criminal investigation and um you know at the very minimum it can involve\nAnalyzing what the Turkish authorities have been giving to the news media over the last a week or two but I think it's something that could be done fairly quickly four to six weeks while once it's authorized\nWho has to call for this I mean what what would it take to put this in motion\nYeah I mean there's really a bunch of different models that would be available for something like this the Security Council has authorized investigations\nFor for heinous crimes and comprehensive systematic crimes like crimes against humanity and genocide the human rights council could do it the human rights council benefit is that it's not subject to the veto of\nAny of the five permanent members gonna okay so if the U.S decided they didn't think this investigation was necessary that could block the Security Council investigation but not the human rights council\nAbsolutely and and there's there's a third option to which several human rights organizations have been calling for and that's for the secretary general on his own to authorize an investigation and set one up\nWhat would happen once this investigation is complete it would it be binding in any way could the Saudis just decide we have our version of events we don't buy it\nYeah no this is a this would be something where it would be an investigation because of its credibility because it would be international eyes it would be something that from you know from that point states could take a look at it and make a decision as to how to proceed and there\nWould be any number of options available to them whether its diplomatic penalties penalties and international organizations or or other kinds of outcomes but but there's nothing binding I'm not talking about you know but\nWe are talking about a credible international destination that's David Cay thank you thank you\nPresident Trump is campaigning in Arizona tonight the trip is part of a western swing to rally Republican voters head of the midterm elections which are now just over two weeks away last night in Montana he distilled the Republican closing argument heading into the mid term elections to this\n[noise] I Know a lot [noise] of job at all\nThe power of the law and order and common sense that's what it's gonna be\nThe caravan he's talking about is a group of migrants trying to reach the U.S support or it's now a big feature in his stump speech and joining us now to talk about all this is NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith hate him high so why I'm Talking about another caravan at a political rally think well\nThis is not the first time he has talked about caravans I he talked about a different caravan back\nIn April a this is a new one um and it's getting a lot of attention on cable news and so he is talking about it again he suggested at that rally that without offering any evidence um made a claim that at Democrats were somehow behind the caravan\nWhat they wanted a jar of in and there are those the say the caravan didn't just happen it didn't just happen a lot of reasons Jarvis four thousand people but I just want to say the Mexican government because they're so good hopefully be bored every day [noise]\nWe should underscore that there's really no evidence to back up this conspiracy theory that that he's been able to offer but you know the reason that he is talking about this and talking about illegal immigration is that it's something that gets his supporters animated\nYou know they are still at these rallies chanting build the wall almost every ... every time he's out there so basically this is just an effort to rally the Republican base to get out and vote yeah and the evidence is that it's a winning issue a there are two new polls from Hugh that are out\nAt the find that illegal immigration is an incredibly salient issue among those who plan to vote Republican in the upcoming elections they asked about twenty different issues facing the country and those supporting Republicans\nIntimate terms uh Seventy five percent of them say that they consider illegal immigration to be a very big issue Jocelyn Kiley is associate director of research at the Pew Research center you can see that\nUh there's energy among Republican voters around the issue of immigration and that energy is most pronounced within the set of Republican voters who are really focused on border security and law enforcement\nAnd so how do we know this is a base play illegal immigration in the way that President Trump talks about it is simply not a priority issue in the same way for Democrats or independent voters as it is for Republican voter voters and for Republican voters and she says it it can be a powerful motivator\nElections supposed to be about the Republican tax cut which was one of the president's biggest accomplishments why is he talking so much about immigration specifically now yeah and immigration is an area where he hasn't accomplished as much as he would want to border crossings are apparently up a and a\nAnd you know it it's just he hasn't gotten the wall for instance a but it worked for him last time I he feels\nFor dismiss adventure yesterday President Trump promised severe consequences if the Saudis were involved in the murder the Trump Administration wants to deliver more water to farmers and as ordering a fast track review of environmental restrictions here in California and other western states NPR's Kirk Siegler reports\nThe memorandum takes aim at California's complex delivery system of publicly built and federally subsidized water canals farmers in the states Central Valley have long decried environmental restrictions that limit the amount of water pumps south from snow fed reservoirs due to endangered fish in the Sacramento delta\nThat's the largest freshwater estuary on the west coast\nIt's not clear how much teeth this memo has ended and environmental rollback were to happen it would almost certainly be litigated\nTrump signed the memo in Arizona State that gets most of its water from the Colorado which is not part of this review but he was joined by California Republican Jeff Denham who's in a tight reelection race\nKirk Siegler NPR News Los Angeles\nSocks

Kendall\nEllen Helmand is a professor of politics at occidental college she's written a book about sexual abuse on college campuses worked on policies on reporting in investigating sexual abuse ad odyssey\nWe spoke with her today about the U.S the settlement\nI think the size of the settlement means that they're serious about\nRectify the situation which is a good sign that they might actually put in policies and procedures to prevent it going forward at the end of the day though no amount of money can kill this sort of trauma but at least it's a symbolic gesture that the U.S is taking a seriously\nHow do you change a culture on a campus\nIt's not enough to simply swap out individuals you actually have to shift the cultures and you do that not only by hiring new people that also by having new policies and procedures so for example USC needs to how much greater transparency\nAnd they're processed cheese they need to have better training for faculty and staff they need to have more information available about what is happening on their campus so for example the campus climate survey that tells the truth about the sort of sexual violence that that\nStudents and others are experiencing\nI had one more question for you and it said what message to the center whether universities that might have similar cases like this but but I'm sort of sensing that you feel like university don't ever get a message\nI think that colleges and universities has certainly got the message that they can no longer engage in that kind of brazen cover up that they previously could so I'm hoping actually that this descends up pretty strong message to other institutions to get them to think twice about whether or not it is worth the cost of engaging in a cover up\nDr Carolyn held

NPR News I'm also Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly after Seventeen Days of uncertainty there is confirmation tonight from Saudi Arabia\nThat Washington Post journalist ... ... ... is dead\nThe report came from Saudi state TV and the Saudi kingdom is expressing quote deep regret over his death Saturday prosecutors say they believe a fight broke out between ... and people who met him at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul that fight they say led to his death\nEighteen Saudi nationals have been detained and the number two of the Saudi intelligence services has been fired the White House meanwhile has released a statement saying the Trump Administration is saddened and that they will continue to follow international investigations\nAre going to talk to these developments in our regular week in politics segment with EJ do you own of the Washington Post AJ\nHey good to be with you and breathe painting of the federal is welcome to you high [noise]\nLet me ask just for an initial reaction from you both in and how you're thinking about squaring the account put out tonight by the Saudis with the account put out by the Saudis rate after the show disappeared which was that he left the consulate walked away alive and well free\nYeah I mean I think that their explanation here that he got into a fight is paper than at best and\nI think going forward we need to definitely proceed with caution there's a lot of questions that remain unanswered here right what exactly happened inside the conflict and doesn't match up with the account that Saudi Arabia is saying or is it closer to what turkey was telling us\nRight is it closer to the bones are kind of getting hacked to death while he was still alive and decapitated and all these horrible grid harming these how their audio to back up their account they say they have said that there is audio they've said that there is video to back this up\nIs is that true I mean you get all those questions answers\nWe have yet to to see or hear those tapes that Turkish officials say that they have each what's your initial reaction\nI have a similar reaction that sounds so much more like a cover story than an accurate account first because as you said they started out denying all of this uh the number of people involved sure makes the fight inside the uh the consulate sound or where the embassy\nSound like a an odd\nThing to happen and obviously there are so many gaps between this account a and show what the Turks have said I think what's fascinating here is that they're a cone she used to follow some of the comments\nThat President Trump made you just wonder has there been discussion between the\nWhite House between the Trump Administration and the Saudis about what would be unacceptable explanation\nOr something that ah that they could get away with as far as Trump was concerned it was he for example who raised the theory that won't get killers a ... a quiz show this sounds like a world killers ... explanation\nYou're reading one of many questions that we don't have an answer to at this point what was coordinated what were\nFacts all of that said we do have some kind of an official account now from the Saudis and it includes that that ... gene is dead\nDoes that put pressure EJ and your view more pressure on President Trump who has resisted blaming the Saudis pressure on him to take a harder line\nI think there is a lot of pressure on President Trump to take a harder line and he has heart and his wine a bit publicly said there should be a severe punishment then all of that\nBut all the indications from the administration or that they really do not want to break with the Saudis they're not ready to take on a the crown prince Mohammed bin ... uh because they seem to see him as an ally and Trump has suggested that he is a personal\nOw so it is not known only to the president Congress has a role in this as President Trump has pointed out with Senator Lindsey Graham has weighed in Republican Senator Graham has weighed in tonight saying he's very skeptical of the Saudi version of events Brea is you know there's been a drumbeat for sanctions there's been a drumbeat from Congress about taking a tougher line\nAre you watching for that drew me to get louder\n[noise] yeah I mean that honest thing remains to be seen I think ultimately though that this incident doesn't necessarily mean that we should reorient our entire Middle East strategy\nI mean at the end of the day we have to remember that ... is not just a columnist for the Washington Post but he was also a personal friend of us I'm a bin Laden and was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood this is an individual you know we have to take all of that into account and I also think that when you are dealing when he was ...\nAs a journalist for the Washington Post and who was a U.S resident into it now appears was murdered to Saudi consulate\nI and of course we do have an interest in making sure that us permanent residents are protected as well that's something that we are interested in doing um when you are talking about the middle east we're talking about a lot of bad actors here I mean if we don't if we're not willing to work with Saudi Arabia\nThe other options are not so great either right we have turkey which tells the highest number of journalists anywhere in the world we have\nIran we have a number of uh other countries that committed human rights atrocity is just on the regular so I think that we just really need to get all of our jak sit around and we need to you know maybe not necessarily change in one fell swoop our entire Middle East strategy over that's\nWhat I find it really disturbing to go back to his youth this person who has been a as close and the broader sense of the word liberal in terms of demanding greater freedom in the middle east to go back to his youth and tar him as\nThat'd be Colombo was an Italian scientist after whom the European space agency mission is named it's actually

this era of me to of reckoning of televised alive confirmation hearings to air allegations of sexual assault\nHillary Clinton reopened a can of worms this week during an interview on CBS Sunday Morning she was answering this question about her husband in retrospect do you think\nBill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now because she said Lewinsky a twenty two year old intern at the time was an adult\nThat echoed the position that Bill Clinton took earlier this year when he was asked about the affair on the today show\nThis will be good at Twenty years ago to the American people sided with me\nThat is true true thirds of Americans at the time said Clinton should not be removed from office that the charges didn't justify it\nWell what the country feel the same way today and how does Bill Clinton sex scandal of two decades ago continue to shape political culture today Susan Glasser oversaw the Washington Post's coverage of Bill Clinton's impeachment now she writes the letter from Washington column for the New Yorkers Susan Glasser thanks for coming in thank you so much\nYou started at the post one week before the Lewinsky story broke\nOne week before the Lewinsky story invoke exactly I was supposed to be the deputy national editor in charge of investigation so at the time and that was the Clinton fundraising scandal now mostly forgotten in the annals of history\nAnd when the Lewinsky story broke how did you all initially think about framing and what kind of story was\nWell it was a political earthquake and I remember standing slap Todd in the post newsroom along with you know hundreds of other journalists when President Clinton came out and said you know I did not have\nSex with that relation without even and in hindsight it seems more clear cut what the outcome is going to be but there were certainly moments when we felt along the way that the Clinton presidency with hanging in the balance [noise]\nI've been going back for some of the Post's coverage of the times and trying to reconcile what you were writing with what I remember feeling I'm Around the same age as Monica Lewinsky and I'm struck when I look back at how women of my generation didn't rally around her\nThe culture has shifted and you know as a woman in many ways I'm sure you know you and I both welcome many of the changes and the revelations have the last year about sexual exploitation of women harassment of women in the workplace\nAnd this unfortunately was not reflected in either the politics or\nThe culture of that moment it was at\nA sexist environment in Washington in some ways still true today and some ways that thank goodness are\nAre not feel really of a different time I look back at it now\nSetting aside the things the Clintons have shed in this last year it was really Donald Trump who played a big role in re injecting the Clinton sex scandals into the national political debate at the second presidential debate he brought Clinton's accusers\nHere just for the\nActions speak louder than\n[noise] Mr Trump Mayer says that Bill Clinton\nMe Juanita broader speaking right before walking into that presidential debate to sit in the audience with Paula Jones and other Clinton accusers\nThat Susan Glasser to read on that was Trump was wheeling out Clinton's accusers in order to deflect from the Access Hollywood tape in order to deflect attention from his own accusers did it work\nWell I think Trump has learned a lot from how Bill Clinton survived the impeachment scandal and breathing it out\nAnd denying or telling the truth slowly you know Trump did use the female accusers of Bill Clinton to shield himself I guess that he knew correctly that Democrats would be accused of being hypocrites that has continued to be the ...\nIt's throughout the subsequent me two revolutions which took place after the twenty sixteen campaign and many people myself included believe that part of that sort of national furor\nOver the meat you stories has been a response in some ways to the fact that there is another male president in the oval office who has been credibly accused of misconduct by numerous women in Trump's case I Believe it's Nineteen when\nDo you think Bill Clinton would have survived the Lewinsky\nScandal if it unfolded today you know that is the question I Will say that the Democratic party has shifted publicly at least more than the Republican Party when it comes to what to do about\nMembers in their own ranks who are accused of this kind of wrongdoing look at how quickly they abandoned Al Franken the Democratic senator from Minnesota\nYou know maybe that would have happened with Bill Clinton maybe not\n[noise] do you think it serves a purpose to reckon with Bill Clinton's legacy at this point where does it leave us or is it time to\nLet it go well I Do think Donald Trump's continued mentioning of the Clintons at every turn suggests how useful part is in\nFoil it is at this hyper partisan time you know there's some truth to Bill Clinton's point that we have litigated this issue two decades ago and to me the fact that it does keep requiring is largely a reflection of the fact that we're grappling as a country with the unique\nPresidents have Donald Trump and the many allegations of wrongdoing towards him [noise] Susan Glasser now a

which has been saying we gotta we gotta give the Saudis a few more days to investigate let's see what they come up\nWith you know it it's hard to know because he wasn't he didn't talk very much with us about um his impressions and he even said that he didn't talk to the Saudis about the facts and the case he just wanted a credible investigation and what what's interesting is that the president President Trump\nUm earlier this week was talking about how well the crown prince totally denied any knowledge of this um Bombay also said that that they totally denied this and you have to remember they have a very close relationship with Mohammed bin some on um you know and it's continued despite\nMany other things ... showed gee was just the latest ads are also though he played a he's played a

a horrible event that hasn't gone unnoticed um but uh that what Saudi Arabia has come out with is is quote a good first step\nUm he also praised Saudi Arabia for moving faster than he expected and for detaining suspects\nThey've integrated allies and aged we need them as a ... a ... situation to be that I think we're doing is if you have a long way to short period of time and it gives you all\nYet so ah earlier he was asked earlier in the day whether sanctions could be on the table and he said that they could but he was sort of noncommittal about that what\nYou're describing is is the the line that the president has been going for a while but but we need to he says uh consider this incident withdrawal ... in the wider context of the U.S Saudi relationship exactly\nUh and and have sitting at a roundtable with a bunch of defense contractors presented him with quite a backdrop\nIt ends up the Saudi arms deals are really really important to the U.S you know right\nAt it so it was exactly and I don't think it was planned that way but it was sort of perfectly aligned with the talking points that he's been using for will basically ever since ... disappeared which is a that\nAlthough this is very serious and and very problematic uh he's saying hey hold on there are arms deals and and we can't mess with that\nI'm In his remarks today he sort of really inflated the size of those deals are the number of jobs that would be potentially created\nA many of those deals are are not as you would say done deals a but but he uh treated them as though they were still he\nHas also said that if a Saudi Arabia was ultimately proven to be responsible that there should be severe punishment his words what options might be on the table\nWell he said that he wants to work with Congress on that um and the options could include sanctions 'em and sanctions could take many forms a they could be severe sanctions or or they could be a more symbolic\nUm but ... as as deferential is President Trump is being or not coming out hard yet on on a Saudi Arabia\nAt some of his allies are are going in another direction I'm a Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina tweeted to say that I Am skeptical of the new Saudi narrative about Mr ... is\nA is an understatement ... um he says he's it's hard to find this latest explanation credible\nOh at least one senator so first thing I might well be a time to

hurts as international calls for an investigation into the death of Washington Post journalist ... ... is the end will grow\nPresident Trump today is repeating his position that he's not sure the Saudi grow government was involved Trump speaking to reporters after a campaign rally in Nevada says it's possible to Saudi crown prince was unaware of the killing but Trump says the multibillion dollar sale of US military equipment to Riyadh still needs to happen\nHe was a key no vote or threaten vote I should say when when it came to trying to repeal Obamacare he famously held up that process had a big press conference in Nevada where he said I Can't vote for this bill\nThen he changed course ended up supporting the repeal effort\nAnd then became a pretty close ally of President Trump who's made repeated visits here uh he'll be here again this weekend\nAnd Trump was joking during his last rally that Hillary and he didn't get along before now they get along fine so the questions I have is how to Republican voters respond to that we've seen time and time again that Republicans\nHad been punished by their base for opposing President Trump is everything good with Heller up Republican voters\nAnd does that back and forth or hurt him with Democrats and independents\nThe big thing in this this is really one of three democratic targets and the best one that Democrats have a shot at that Hillary Clinton won here that just shows you how narrow the landscape is for Democrats to try to\nEven never mind pick up seats but to hold what they're what they've got and my other big question is what Latino do because Latinos in the southwest not just in Nevada but in Texas and Arizona and in the mid term is more broadly you know really could put Democrats over the edge or hold them back\n... giving you were just talking about Latino voters in turn out and that makes me think of another really interesting Senate race that Arizona\nI Would say Democrats so Arizona and continue to see Arizona as a possible shakeup opportunity for them in part because if you look at twenty sixteen democratic did pretty well I mean Hillary Clinton I think last estate by less than four percent I mean that was way closer than a traditional swing state like Ohio\nAnd and one of the things that's been interesting to me though about Arizona is\nIt's really sort of demographically a state that people\nThink should in theory benefit Democrats\nBut it speaks to the exact same problem you've been talking about which is where the voters in the Democratic party are Arizona's one of these states where you know a demographers will describe it as having kind of the widest cultural age gap they say which means that basically like the divide between your older population\nAnd your younger population is huge one of the stark is in the entire\nCountry you have a lot of retirees light of new people coming into\nLargely drought or other folks have color and and one of the big question does okay find that might be changing the population but at the people are young and they're often ...\nOr and they don't necessarily always show up in the mid term and disconnected from the system and this from party politics\nAll right if you're just joining us this is the politics you from NPR and lost my call in and I'm here with NPR's Scott Detrow Mara Liasson intimate ... even though we've been talking about key races in the Senate this cycle that talk about what race you are watching\nYou know I've been looking at been surprised\nBy the fact that in Montana and Indiana\nThe Democrats there have seem pretty resilient you know we're talking about John tester who has the buzz cut hair cut who by the way he's running against the guy who's got the same buzz cut hairdo you can go look that up if you don't mind talking about in Montana that look I don't know what it is but apparently that's how you show your real Montana and um [laughter]\nBut to show your real Hoosier as I Know that you're yeah she ate either go play in that area because your who's your yourself um you know the the candidate who's running there who the Democratic incumbent Joe Donnelly and he's in this red state that President Trump won by a lot he's running against a businessman this guy named Mike Braun\nAnd you know Donald he's been holding up Republicans have been surprised\nI mean I don't know arise honestly diminish ... it's like I look around and some of the chatter I heard from base democratic voters with a lot of skepticism about ... I think they that they that he certainly got some street cred within the local Democratic Party when he decided to vote against Kevin\nWell and I think that you know this is a guy who showed some independence in a lot of ways in that way in one but let's listen to one of his TV ads and I think you'll see why it sounds a whole lot different than some of the other Democrats across the country radical\n... during my support on Monday President Trump's border wall extremes on the left and right I Want to cut defense spending I don't want our troops and verify\nListen to that he says he supports the ice he said that he supports President Trump's border wall how many Democrats across the country would say that that raise my eyebrows any quotes Ronald Reagan said he believes in peace through strength he also said no socialized medicine and know cutting the Affordable CARE Act now that's a line to walk\nThat's right there's not a lot of time left before election day and I knew that we've all been talking about the ups and downs in this race but Scott what's the civically are you looking for between now and November six that you think maybe could give us somewhat of a clue about what'll happen election day\nOne of the one of the biggest things that we saw this week was just the insane amount of money that democratic candidates have had brought in house candidates all over the country bringing in\n... the the type of money that sometimes you see Senate can candidates bringing Senate candidates in beta Iraq's case bringing in presidential campaign level numbers there is just a ton of donor enthusiasm on the Democratic side the candidates have a ton of money\nIt's my question is what are they going to do with it at a certain point you can't buy more TV ads on TV Time is taken up\nThe how do they use this money do they use it on on door knocking on get out the vote efforts do they use it on digital advertising I'm just really curious to see where that money goes and how they can leverage that advantage that they have because again the the divide between the party and fundraising was was really striking\nAnd also can they spend it in a way that lays down some permanent infrastructure for Democrats in states where they haven't had much of one yeah\nGiven it gives you something that you really watching these last couple of weeks\nOkay look the fact is you're now starting to hear that\nTurned out in this election could be a record could be as high as it's been since the mid Nineteen sixties another time of social and cultural upheaval I talked to Michael McDonald who's the turnout expert at the University of Florida keeps the big turnout database that everybody looks at her and he said that he's looking at essentially\nFor markers for indicators for why he thinks that turnout is going to be that high for mid term okay she said that there was record special election turnout high primary turnout a high degree of self reported interest in the election\nAnd high levels of early voting and we're seeing intensity and all of those metrics absolutely and he said when all four of those are pointing in one direction he said you know look it just seems to point to the fact that this is this could be an election that is higher turnout than most people have seen in their lifetimes perimeter\nAnd we should explain that even higher turnout in and meet your needs somewhere between forty five fifty percent of the electorate voting and Marlin you watch\nI'm watching the immigration debate I think that now that the Brett Kavanaugh moment has come and gone I'm not saying it didn't\nHelp Republicans get more energized but I Do think that Donald Trump is looking for another culture war issue that he can use to energize his base that's fascinating the caravan of\nPeople coming through Mexico from Central America on ... potentially on their way to the U.S border is something that he's been tweeting about\nI think that what we've seen is when the immigration debate focuses on border security um or abolishing ice than Republicans when when the immigration debate focuses on taking kids away from their parents\nDemocrats win so I'm watching that a caravan of potential immigrants to the U.S and seeing if it's going to blow up into a big issue before election\nDay that's really interesting and it's also an issue that I think makes Donald Trump feel very comfortable right like this is what he ran on\nWell he's a culture warrior and immigration was his number one issue he wrote down the gold has later and said Mexico was ending rapists do the United states\nImmigration is the one thing over the past decade that has fired up Republicans almost more than anything else including the Supreme Court right that was NPR's Scott Detrow ... and Mara Liasson thank you all thank you You're welcome\n[noise]\nThis is the politics show from NPR I must my salad it feels like every week there is one major news story that dominates the headlines and because of that other important stories often get overlooked ...\nWe dive into Wednesday Disney they did not get a lot of attention and could do that we have NPR's Ron Elving here I'm going to be with us from around the story I Want you to help us understand is the departure of Don McGahn he left his job this week as white\nHouse counsel why don't you start by just explaining what his job wise in white matter is that he left\nThe bare Bones Are these he is already out of his office in the west wing where he oversaw dozens of other attorneys handling all the legal business for the White House down again is going back to the private practice of law he was previously a partner in the powerhouse national from of Jones Day might be going back there might be going somewhere else\nHe will be replaced by another Washington DC attorney ... below me\nWho is well known in Republican legal circles but while Siblani is going through his background check for another couple of weeks\nThe acting white house counsel will be Emmett flood okay an Emmett flood has been in the White House working as a special counsel a particularly are working on outside investigations and he's well known in Washington for his work for vice president Dick Cheney President George W. Bush and President Bill Clinton so he is a\nVeteran of impeachment proceedings\nI feel like as I'm listening to describe all of the some of this feels very inside already to me right in terms of who's who and who they all worked for and and it sounds sort of like\nWe're hearing about one well connected guy taking over for the last well connected guy in a pretty high powered job that that maybe doesn't resonate for most folks um is that a fair assessment\nFacebook accounts that are trying to sow discord in that sort of stuff that they're keeping an eye out for what they don't talk about is any hacking at this point that we know of directed at twenty eight in terms of like we saw on twenty sixteen with the hacking of the Clinton campaign and then the weaponization of those are those emails the\nMessage of the government tried to send on friday was that voting machines they believe are safe so if you punch card on a ballot or if you use the voting machine the vote will be recorded faithfully to heaven recorded any cyberattacks against those types of systems\nBut the campaigns that Ryan just talked about the ones that involve the public information space on line in the way we relate to other Americans on social media\nThat's the biggest concern that the spy agency's talked about this sort of\nInformation warfare right that you're describing and it sounds like that is the this sort of intervention that we're seeing at this point ahead of the twenty Eighteen elections but how does this compare it gets to what we saw leading up to twenty sixteen\nWell earlier this summer and actually just a couple of weeks ago we heard from some of the leaders of the national security establishment director of national intelligence Dan Coats FBI Director Christopher Wray\nUm even the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein have talked about the level of activity that we've seen from foreign actors trying to influence to do and what they said in in the case of Russia in particular is that yes the Russians are active it's not the same level as we saw in the run up to twenty sixteen but that\nDoesn't mean that they can flip the switch and suddenly we're gonna see a whole different level and this could just life church\nOne of the more interesting things to me is that once again in in these criminal charges we saw against this Russian woman on friday there is no allegation that any Americans\nWere conspiring or we're waiting a collaborators in this information warfare campaign but the Russians once again are successfully exploiting divisions within American society and doing it very very effectively in a way that troubles not just the intelligence community but all sorts of political leaders around the country\nIt's worth adding on that very important point that they are not ... eating divisions they are exacerbating divisions are already exist\nYet I mean you mentioned some of this is like ... around gun control immigration these are cultural fishers they'll say is a political reporter we got in the country we hear consistently from voters about these things but it sounds like you're saying they are just taking this and intensifying it in a in a social media space\nIs absolutely and some other documents reference and that these court charges from friday talk about witch hunts and making fun of Iraq Obama making fun of the late ... Arizona Senator John McCain targeting politicians on both sides of the aisle for some of these kinds of rhetoric we've been hearing in political ads here in the U.S over time\nAnd even things like the NFL protests anthem\nProtests interesting if you're just joining us You're listening to the politics show from NPR I must have a holiday and I'm here in the studio with NPR's Carrie Johnson Ryan Lucas and\nPhil Ewing can you can sense as and now that we know that this is happening at least in the the information face and what the U.S officials are doing and is this something that we've been you think as a country successfully able to combat that's fine when we're talking about the administration's response\nThe government says that it wants to make the public aware about this as much as possible the FBI has launched a special website That's focused on public information campaigns\nThe director of national intelligence Dan Coats other people at his level talk about this publicly much more than they used to but the fact that are made clear in these court documents shows how much this continues to take place on social media on Facebook and Twitter especially and frankly what a bad job those two platforms have done\nIn scrapping these sorts of things these court papers are filled with examples of Russian influence mongers creating fake accounts pretending to be Americans\nAnd posting means about president a bronco bottom of the former president his ties to the Muslim Brotherhood are ostensibly or the coverage of the Austin bombings that took place last year and how much\nThe media was ignoring them because the victims weren't white because they were black and Latino at the time and these as Ryan indicated are American controversies taking place naturally in our own context but the Russians are very skilled on social media and getting in there and trying to turn up the volume as much as they can so skilled\nThere's actually some instructions quoted in these court papers in this part of this Russian Campaign they're telling Russians listen if you want to target American liberals don't mention the site Breitbart and if you want to target American conservatives steer clear of mentioning buzzfeed [laughter] I don't know what they're doing\n\nA little bit about what the social media platforms themselves they're doing with these tech giants are doing I knew our colleague Tim Mak\nDid spend some time at with Facebook just this past week and Facebook is sort of touting this election security war room that they've developed\nBut I'm curious if any of you have a sense of how successful because to some degree also you know the Russians and whoever it is is trying to interfere could ... just invent new tricks what\nThe platform so focused on his transparency so they're responding in the way that uh the American political system has historically a to campaign influence issues where if you buy an ad that says Obama is a part of the Muslim Brotherhood\nFacebook once you'd have to disclose who you are and thereby disclose the origins of that type of messaging so that will be in place for political campaigns going forward but in real time when you're scrolling through your Facebook feed\nWho's actually going to look at that and do the research and say oh this appears to be a foreign influence campaign if it's going to have an effect it's not going to stop the problem and it's not going to keep our information environment in the United states pristine in any way\nOn a slightly depressing at one of the questions that I always like to ask a cybersecurity people when I when I meet with them and talk to them is are these sorts of operations is this just the sort of world that we live in now and\nReally there's no way to to and there's no way to combat this to the point where it's not going to be an issue and the depression answer that I generally get is this is pretty much the world we live in\nIt's like you're constantly playing defense you can never really entirely fix the problem right you're just sort of trying to to blockade is that sort of a lack of yeah that's a good example is\nIt's a dilemma that counterterrorism professionals have talked about for many years because we have an open society we have freedom of movement we have freedom of speech you can go wherever you want within reason and in the old days we worried about terrorists exploiting that these days we're worried about foreign governments exporting that because they can move much more quickly than Facebook and Twitter can to clamp down on them\nAnd I'm the U.S government really has no way to stop that from taking place\nI got to tell you that as somebody who sometimes goes out in the world to speak at places other than Washington DC I Know that we have listeners who teach high school and college history or American studies or social studies and at the high school and the college level\nThey are trying to educate people young people about how to recognize some of these phony mediums and information warfare attacks\nTo try to get out the problem that way before people start logging into Facebook and believing what everything that they read there's actually a real kind of effort it civics education out they're aimed at young folks to try to get them to recognize these things that are targeting them everywhere they go\nAnd that's a wonderful but it's also if it's like a generational struggle that's it's going to take years and years to to get an educated voting populace that's conscious of such things\nJust to kind of wrap up the conversation here it sounds like the interference that we are seeing is is really just essentially on the information level the information and public space but it it's not really a matter of voting like if if I Am a vote are we going to vote is not a real threat to election security in that way it is that right\nAccording to what these national security agency set on friday they haven't identified any cyber attack that is going to result in a vote being changed so if you go to the polls and you try to vote for your member of Congress what the government is saying if they don't have any evidence that that vote will not be counted as you intended\nThese interference campaigns focus on the public information space and United States on social media especially and they're attempting to change Americans behavior by the information they take in and the way they think as opposed to the actual way the votes are collected accounting\nThat's NPR's Ryan Lucas Carrie Johnson and Phil Ewing thank you all so much thank you thank you thank you All right well we're going to switch gears because now it's time for race\nOf who was running for United States Senate this against these people and these are held we will never know why and if we by the way\nEvery week we focus on one race in the country that they could have a larger theme playing out in elections around the country this week we're going to look at the third congressional district of New Jersey I'm here with NPR diminish ... and let's bring in Joe Hernandez he's a reporter at W. H. Y. Y.\nJoe thanks for joining us great to be here\nDo you mean you could start with you can you just lay of the land start with the basics of who is running\nWell the Republican incumbent in this race is Tom MacArthur some might remember him because of this contentious town hall in May of last year where his constituents really grilled him about\nHis authoring a key amendment to the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare and won support from House Republicans of course didn't become law and we'll talk a little bit more about that\nHe's running against Andy Kim he had a string of national security roles in the Obama administration including serving as an Iraq expert at the state department and the Iraq director on national security council\nAnd you've been there on the ground in the district so talk to us a little bit about what it's like\nWell both of the candidates have been really busy campaigning all across the district which is quite large we've also seen a lot of political star power in this district so MacArthur had a fundraiser with vice president Pence and former vice president Joe Biden has been stumping with Andy Kim\nThere's also been a lot of money flowing into the district Andy Kim took into point three million from donors in his bid to unseat MacArthur which is one million more than MacArthur has but because there is a wealthy former insurance executive so he can dump some of his own money into the race\nLeaped out of bed hit the light [noise]\n\nCos it's the middle and I I I didn't know what to do\nAnd [noise]\nDidn't sleep in that room for weeks I Would sleep on the couch all the lights on for about three weeks I did that me and the cat\nAfter he sounded figure at the end of its bad side would send him standing sister's house for a couple of nights you felt like he just couldn't hack and staying in the apartment and so he decides to buy his own home by property\nNearby and started construction on a brand new house\nFinally and house was dealt he and the
