service called ... which covers Michigan politics why did you choose this place to to me\nWell on the west side of the city of Troy which is in Oakland County if we turn left right now will be ...\nAnd on the east side if we turn right would be in the city of sterling\nHeights which was in my hometown and these two communities and leaves two counties are really emblematic of the divide that's happening nationally where\nCollege educated voters are tending to move away from the Republican Party toward the Democrats\nAnd those white working class voters who don't necessarily have bachelor's degrees\nAre moving away from the Democrats toward the republic\nTo communities right next to each other moving in opposite political directions wealthier Troy ... grew up is shifting away from strict Republican rule\nThe idea that they could be represented by a Democrat\nIn the state legislature to me a shocking you know these are areas that used to elect their members to the legislature by Seventy Seventy five percent for the Republicans\nAnd across the street working class Sterling Heights is becoming less solidly democratic\nI mean that is a chasm of a difference and it's on either side of the road here\nThese shift could determine whether Republicans hold on to the Michigan governor's mansion and it could even influence which party controls the U.S house of representatives All right well let's explore these areas we've walked ... now let's see what lies on either side of it\nFirst we turn left into what community with lots of people like Kathleen van ... she's got a master's degree in a nursing job with a good salary I Love Michigan\nAnd I love living here no hurricanes no ah mudslides no type foods just good old mid west they all you have you considered just self Republican all your life since I was in high school\nVery conservative have you ever voted for Democrats no and yet here you are wearing a PIN on your coat for a Democrat for Congress\nCorrect I had a teacher to\nWhere it outward\nEducated suburban women are becoming disillusioned with the Republican Party across the U.S and prevent ... personally this political shift is an earthquake for her it has a lot to do with President Trump\nIt's like we're all in a reality show but we didn't sign up to be participating in it\nThe only reality show I Want to be on survivor the water pick me but no sign up for [laughter]\nI'm Serious I tried to six times to be on I\nWas there one moment that made you change your mind and say\nForget it for the first time in my life I'm going to vote for a Democrat\nYes it was the shooting in Florida that high school shooting the Marjory Stoneman Douglas yes that went on and I was having lunch with a lot of my nursing school friends we've all known each other since Nineteen Seventy six we all started nursing school together than\nAnd we were lamenting I said we can't let him anymore we have to do something about that we can't just sit back and bring her hands aim or what are we are going to do\nHer sister invited her to see the Democratic congressional candidate at a house party and ... fell in love now she's knocking on doors with her daughter a lifelong Democrat it's the first time they've ever supported the same candidate\nMy on my mind here for\nA Republican incumbent represents the district right now if it flips that could determine which party controls the house we sign a pledge card that you're going to vote for him so that's the west side of the ... the road separating these two communities now with the east side of it [noise]\nThis sterling fried Halloween festival is a sea of children and their parents out\nThere are a bunch of superheroes when I'm about to my waist unicorns there's a little flamingo being rolled around in a wagon Sterling Heights where this is located is historically a blue collar union democratic voting area and it's been shifting more football [noise]\nI'm Ryan ...\nAnd we do feel like a ten days who am I\nThink he's a pipe fitter wearing a union putting the baby girl in his arms is his third child\nYou know we've got tons of words businesses are\nI mean I get to see the inside of it all these places that we [noise] two jobs or they're all expanding and\nThings are looking for ... years give\nI guess Obama got things rolling decent and uh [noise] you know since from coming on board [noise] obviously the stock market exploded\nAt least it did at first and last month stocks have lost most of their gains from the previous year\nRetired supported Obama in two thousand eight and Trump in two thousand sixteen what do you think led to you making the shift from blue to red [noise] ah\nAnd now the Trump is in office how do you feel about the job he's doing\nI mean I don't I don't have any complaints\nOther people we met in Sterling Heights switched parties in two thousand sixteen and are ready to switch back\nLike Matthew fair he just recently returned to work in the auto industry he got laid off during the economic crash and worked as a truck driver for several years he supported Trump in the last election\nMy very good yeah the business background figured he was you know we'll do a lot better for the country not that Obama didn't\nObviously that was a mistake [noise] so you weren't Obama Obama Trump voter yeah and you're regretting the decision now that I look back out\nI think a lot of people around here you know want to love one a little bit of change\nYou know obviously you've maybe he wasn't the right candidate\nYou only white say that uh because the drums will actually portraying the country you know I actually a national to social media way\nIn the last two years President Trump has transformed the Republican Party with a focus on trade barriers and immigration enforcement\nHe's also reshaped the coalitions that Republicans and Democrats need to win elections here in Michigan people cast ballots just over a week from now in a competitive governor's race and several tight congressional races that could determine control of the house\nThe results here could tell us a lot about whether the transformation President Trump began

associate degree for transferring seven we\nPasadena dot edu [noise]\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm jak spear Cesar ... who is suspected of sending explosives to prominent critics of President Trump through the mail may face up to forty eight years in prison NPR's Quil Lawrence reports the investigation remains ongoing\nAnd well he he could've been worse in the last couple of days but it follows I'm three years where he's basically destroyed every norm of common civility and the rules by which we used to do our politics\nAnd so we've entered a world where a lot of people apparently treat politics as a cult as like the most important form of identity which is asking more of politics for the conveyor and then who think politics is a war to the death between two opposing sides which is also not true politics is a competition between two sides with partial truths\nAnd so we've got this catastrophe ... view of politics which filters down to disturb people\nI'm EJ when I talk to you about this as well obviously we do not know right now the motivations of the suspect um but because people are talking about who received these packages I'm ed how are you thinking about how this episode has had people talking about divisions in the country well\nFirst of all good for law enforcement for finding Mr Sachs so quickly [noise] ah it shows what's happening on the right side of politics that there were already people saying oh this is a false flag operation my liberals\nAnd whatever else we know about Mr ... van is plastered with pro Trump and anti liberal messages as Ryan said his Twitter feed suggests he's on the Trump side if he's on any side at all\nBut where I disagree with David I think he's tried to generalize too much and saying oh this is all politics there's a fundamental problem here which is the President Trump's hold on power\nDepends on dividing the nation it's not just that he's capable of being a United or it's a unity is a dire threat to his political standing and you know at three fourteen this morning he tweeted an attack\nOn CNN and then later he sent out a tweet that complaining that this bomb the stuff\nThat's his were his phrase a was hurting the Republicans in the election there's something very specific here about our president and his party because it knows that most of its supporters support President Trump is incapable of talking out against\nHim David you want to answer that I Know parsing through the Twitter feed can take up some time but\nOkay I I Want to move on to something else then defense secretary Jim Mattis has authorized the deployment of troops to the U.S Mexico border and this is as this caravan of\n... some thousand migrants is traveling north through Mexico um the response to this is clearly political right now but has no legislation is being passed right there is no other kind of movement David what do you see and how we are talking about immigrants migrants and asylum seekers right now is this a permanent shift\nI Do think of as a permanent shift if us working class Americans or why their incomes have stagnated the two answers they gave our immigration and trade\nAnd so a lot more people have come to see immigration and not only is a cultural shift but as an economic threat as well I think what strikes me about this particular episode is that again the catastrophic tones for using about it we've had waves of refugees come to our shores throughout our history as late as April\nOr some come ashore some get granted asylum about twenty two percent in this last wave\nAnd we're a big country and we can handle a lot of people\nAre and the idea that this is some central threat seems to be completely overblown it's an issue that we can deal with a but the way it's being portrayed as some some out of control situation is just out of proportion to what's actually\nGoing into mid terms what is the Democratic reply to a a Republican platform that talks about these issues such tried to Italy\nI think one of the difficulties here uh besides the fact that President Trump clearly are focused on this caravan because he knows that talking about the threat of immigration\nOr helps to mobilize his base of the problem here is that there is a total mischaracterization of what Democrats stand for they're constantly accused of being for open borders\nAnd when you look at all of the immigration bill saver voted for it they call for ... and and with support I should say back in the day from some Republicans\nThey all spoke of obvious limits on immigration and thus far in order to him in ten days right I mean right but the I think what they are doing what they have to do is say we're not far open borders and this is an attempt to push us away from issues related to economics to health care\nAnd to the issues that a lot of voters voting on to the point where Republicans have had to essentially mislead a that's a terrible word about where they stand on healthcare\nA and I think they are doing that quite effectively and a lot of a local races governors races and I think an integrate many house races to\nDavid the Democrats are putting a lot of stock in conversation about health care how are you thinking\nAbout that yeah to get some credibly stupid idea a Donald Trump represent he's represents a big change in American foreign policy it'd be changed with American identity or he plays on cultural in any of the issues it's really a comprehensive critique of where the American establishment has been\nAnd what strikes me as the Democrats and not even trying to answer that critique they go to health care they said we you know we Obamacare gives you protection for for insurance for preexisting conditions and we want to preserve that so well Trump makes a very comprehensive mostly cultural and the density critique\nThe Democrats come back with a materialist response which is we're going to protect protect your benefits and that's a decent response in normal times but in the times like this I think the Democrats should be making an argument in defense of pluralism in defense of diversity of big argument against what Trump really stance\nEJ last hard minute to you\nI think that the voters disagree with tape it that\nThe if you look at all of the polling the top of the top three issues health care and economics ranked one to or to one or in where in where the voters come from I think Trump's cultural message appeals to a minority of the electorate which he is trying to mobilize\nAnd I think national unity or just come simply from defending pluralism which by the way Democrats do I wrote recently about a lot of Democrats in a few Republicans defending uh being open for example a to refugees and away the Trump Administration has not but the way we come together is to solve\nOrders gathered at Washington's national cathedral today is Matthew Shepard was laid to rest he was murdered in Laramie, Wyoming in Nineteen Ninety eight it was a hate crime that had a galvanizing effect on the nation and the ... community like Anderson from member station WAMC reports his ashes were insured in the cathedral today Matthew Shepard\nDie Twenty years ago but lately ... remembers\nIt well they do very clearly she says that holds a lot of power\nIt's like a chow as and hold injustice and broken but also such inspiration and life\nA federal hate crime law was named after shepherd in two thousand nine but Aaron you read it says recent Trump Administration proposals including possibly defining gender as set at birth make shepherds legacy as urgent as ever\nThere's a lot of hate and anger out there and just to know that he's here I think brings us a lot of comfort\nBecause she says at least there's a safe place for him now even as others are still fighting for that for NPR News I'm Maggie Anderson in Washington\nAll street lower by the closing bell you're listening to NPR News from Washington\nAnd from

thinking that this is the night the Dodgers turn it around\nMaybe we just got about thirty seconds here a Dodger fans notorious for arriving late are they still arriving\n[noise] you know when I first got here neck the lines outside because the security is amped up for the world series the lines were about thirty to forty minutes long to get into the stadium and so I think people thought they were getting here\nEarlier than normal realize they were going to miss the first pitch but at this point uh I think the Dodgers fans decided this was the game to get there on time not a lot of folks ah

Florida Man was arrested today even as new packages containing possible pipe bombs continue to surface\nThe suspect fifty six year old Caesar say our faces a variety a federal charges including threatening a former president FBI Director Christopher Wray says ... was found on one of the packages and his DNA into other's race says the packages contained improvised explosive devices\nThat we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices\nWell authorities ... appears to be a political parties and they stress that it's premature to speculate on a possible motive at the White House earlier today President Trump welcome the arrest while giving thanks to law enforcement\nThese people have worked so hard and to have done it so quickly it's looking like a a ... it's a needle in a haystack how do you do this so quickly they've done an incredible incredible job but I Want to congratulate [noise] throughout this week\nAs the investigation proceeded we've heard mixed messages from the president NPR's Scott Horsley is here now to talk more about that hey there Scott ... so the president spoke about the rest of the White House event rites celebrating young black leaders what happens\nHis tone at that event was tough you said there was no place for a political violence in this country condemned would appear to be an effort to show fear among Americans\nAnd as you've done earlier in the week when there was a flurry of these packages the president made an appeal for national unity he said uh people shouldn't demonize their political opponents and settled or different should settle their differences peacefully at the ballot box\nIn other words it was a sort of a conventional message would expect to hear from a president at a time like this\nBut uh still a little bit ... and coming from an unconventional president elect Donald Trump\nRight a lot of his critics have pointed out this week that the president often vilify as Democrats that he's been known 'em to to speak positively about violence I mean was there any feedback from those targeted by the suspect\nA former president rock Obama happened to be campaigning for Democrats in Wisconsin today and she suggested that the president's call for unity rings a little bit hollow\nI'm hoping your finger while\nThey're here people spend years months behind the questioning their hatred for calling\nAnd then I'm not concerned about\n\nPoint and the person himself has been sending mixed messages throughout this episode earlier today he was tweeting or a complaint that nonstop media attention to these suspicious packages was taking attention away from politics and cutting into what he said was a Republican momentum and head of the metro elections\nUm talk a little bit more about them in terms of just eleven days away now which of these mixed messages do you think the president will be leaning harder on\nI think that's what we're all kind of waiting to see a earlier this week in Wisconsin the presidents were self consciously dial back is is more partisan rhetoric you said he was\nI'm going to be nice but tonight at another political rally in North Carolina it was kind of back to the no holds barred Donald Trump or he went after a Democrats as being extreme and radical be named Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters and particularly targeted the news media\nWe have seen an effort by the media and raised in ours to use the citizens are actions of one individual to score political points against me and the Republican Party\nThis was a Donald Trump in full grievance mode already and his partners and supporters ate it up That's NPR's Scott Horsley Scott thank you You're welcome\nMeanwhile President Trump is threatening to close the U.S Mexico border tensions are rising as large numbers of migrant families continue to cross illegally and more are expected as a caravan of migrants from Central America ... north towards the border\nUs border patrol says they're overwhelmed by the influx we're joined now by NPR's John Burnett who covers immigration and is with us on the line from Austin, Texas Hi John hey Ari\nOn T. V. we've seen dramatic images of this caravan moving up through Mexico it's still hundreds of miles away so why are tensions rising now\nWill the fears really suppressing reality the sides of the Honduran Caribbean is reportedly dropped by half from seven thousand thirty five hundred now and expected to fall even more the farther north of gifts but that hasn't stopped all the overheated talk coming out of Washington\nI mean just to give you a flavor or listen to this exchange between Fox News anchor Martha ... and homeland security secretary cures didn't Nielsen that was on TV last night\nIs there any scenario under which if people forced their way across the border that could be shot at\nWe not had any intention right now to people and they will be apprehended however uh that alpha ... officer and an attack at their own personal safety extraordinarily seriously they can't have any ability of course in this house\nJohn how is this intense rhetoric playing out at the U.S Mexico border\nSo today I spoke with the mayor of Columbus New Mexico is ... cities right on the border across from Columbus Mexico he set an armed militia from Florida is already camped out west of towns patrolling private ranch land he got a call from another militia leaders from South Carolina earlier in the week\nHave\nBeen um\nA lot of Ron told me why being from Flint is important to\nBeing from Flint influences my music because it has a really like radicalized history in terms of the working class that kind of citizens are allowed to work that we do when it comes to like a song like symbol symbol is really about\nThe history of people of color and I just don't think I Would have had the same mentality if I'd grown up somewhere else I think a lot of the people I was raised with made me more critical thinkers\n[noise]\nThat song repeats the course of my body or December yeah [noise]\nWhat is your body of several of 'em a lot of things you know [noise]\nUh when you travel internationally in you're in like a black body oftentimes you're seen as like threatening or you're seen as like ... I think like larger bodies mean different things to people as well and so I just was thinking about how my body mean so many things that I don't like intended to\nYeah and as a performer you're putting your body out yeah [noise]\nAnd you're not dressing subtly yeah and you're not\nI mean you're ... your clothing is flashy your choreography is over the top like you're putting it out\nThere I don't it's weird because I don't feel like I don't feel like I'm really trying to be flashy I'm just trying to be myself I'm trying to like express myself in a way that feels real to me [noise]\nI have nothing you perform live but I was talking to friends who did and I said what was the show like and they said he was like a disk of all on stage [laughter] [noise]\nOh so my grandmother's is Nigeria and she's been in London but she sends me late in the fabric from Nigeria she's really she just really proud of me and I'm buying the cruelest fabric for me to wear\nSo it sounds like you're taking fabric from Nigeria having a stone into clothing and Flynn's not to over extended metaphor but [laughter] it's like when I'm On your ... you know um [laughter] yeah again it's\nLike [noise] so this is this is interesting too I think when you're at where artist of color there's always this push to like what's the meaning of\nThe during sorry like it's just like you it's ... sometimes you just like I just like I Want to find them like it's really simple sometimes um but the activity I think on the outside for people it it comes across as like a radical statement because so much of what we are able to do with artists skip boxed in so much\nJust want to be done\nOne of the songs on this album is about making the decision to go on a musical time vulnerable right yep vulnerable um\nIs about like me sitting in the parking lot at work and like not wanting to go in and um one day I just called up my Boston and just told her I had to leave and I think I think with that song it was just like I Want the founder of the song like ... percent to like\n... like a weird like warm released into something else you know I just wanted to feel that way [noise]\nWere you at all worried about writing something that was so honest it's easy to write songs about having a great night out with friends or generic heartbreak dancer super personal yeah and it's it's challenging I think the songs\nAre challenging in some ways because I think our ears and are calibrated to be like dishonest about if I play last like you need to not want to skip it on your like jobs get an artist and our writing to be on Spotify playlist and why are like watering down and really the looting their\nOwn creativity give me an example Jimmy an example of a song that could have gone to different\nYeah stranger is actually one that\nHas a very mellow verse um and then it switches up to be really aggressive and I think it's a prime example of like what not to do you want to give playlist that because people are going to like do you like to hear you're like oh you don't want to be like job and you're like you know writing a report or whatever\n\nI didn't mean to me\nTone is strange names on it today and saying zone is\nAnd it just seems cliche to talk about\nBeing a role model for empowerment and visibility\nAnd yet I I mean I I used to be I mean I'm Still obsessed with like ... and fantasy novels and I feel like I'm like turning myself into a protagonist in one it it feels surreal\nHonestly um I I I feel lucky I also feel like I have worked really hard to like\nCreate something that I'm

Democrats in recent days NPR's Quil Lawrence reports you could face up to forty eight years in prison\nSo thanks for having me so we heard earlier that the FBI Director uh Christopher racing that these um confirmed that these packages were not hoax devices so how can we tell how dangerous they were\nWell I Can't really specifically to comment on this one goes to ... and obviously um and I think the time is going to a really lay out a motivations at all the evidence that's going to be here necessary to to to Richard successful resolution of completion of the investigation\nNow since you are at one point a to a terrorist explosive device or analytical team right are you understand sort of what investigators are looking for so how ... what are the kinds of things they look for especially when packages are found in different states\nWell what would generally happens in a way as a as a post blast investigation\nAnd often a blast investigation um you're left with a a debris or that requires or re constitutional reconstruction of a device that went boom I'm fortunate we in the scenario where I've ever Thirteen or devices that or\nDid not go boom I'm so there's a ton of evidence tree opportunity for for forensic exploitation which a director of the FBI has indicated to the rest of this individual\nMeaning they can take it apart and try and raise the materials\nExactly hold their whole litany of our techniques that are used and it's not just the currents of exploitation obviously we live in a world of social media and everybody has an ongoing fingerprint there's\nIncreased surveillance for the person that I was in the world um and sadly or we're getting more and more experienced in this over time which makes us better it quickly bringing these cases to a successful resolution\n[noise] um that you talked about a social media people are paying attention to 'em what they are proceeding as his political persuasion so how does the detail like that get weighed in this kind of investigation\nWell it's it's difficult to obviously there's a constant wing or of individuals similar civil liberties which we all church um it's it's part of my uh my mandate to ... ... respect and support\nBecause it's constitutional liberties of of of of all I'm domestic terrorism or which we see in in\nIn in the United states um you know political terrorism a generally has an element of either or a criminal work that's used to intimidate civilian populations or influence government leaders are impacts government\nWalk regimes and we often see that in the words that are spoken online um\nYou know people do uh enjoy that that freedom to to voice their opinions um um attorneys are generally are the best insiders when that steps over the line the courts are generally is decided on that sense of what\nWe heard the FBI Director caution that there could be more packages out there how do investigators deal with that possibility\n[noise] well again I I'm not going to speak to the specifics here but uh increase around her would be certainly one technique and are using the ... the the vehicle and we already know that these these devices were sent I'm certainly or\nThe mail system um and uh uh for those of us who might be targets um increased vigilance\nUm have you seen anything like this before in your experience [noise]\nUh no I haven't I'm actually the fact that none of these devices are activated a I have not know\nThat the ATF special agent in charge ... on the line from Miami thank you so much\nThat you already now to

from the mid term election\nWhen\nDo whatever you have to do just win baby or four hundred and thirty five thousand thirty five Senate seats on the line\nEvery weekend leading up to election day we are here with a special broadcast to guide you see all the news that could affect the vote this November I'm Scott Detrow it's been another week of dramatic headlines about a new poll from NPR and its partners shows the midterms have reverted back to the same dynamic that have been robbing the race all year\nDemocrats are talking a lot about health care and Republicans are pushing back took a close look at what exactly Congress and the Trump Administration did to change the Affordable CARE Act [noise]\nAll that and more after the news\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Janine hurts\nIn Pittsburgh at least a loving people are dead several others wounded including for law enforcement officers after a suspected gunman Robert powers opened fire at the tree of life synagogue during a ceremony this morning authorities say the forty six year old is hospitalized and fair condition with multiple gunshot wounds\nA lot of these races are taking place in suburban districts\nSo you know first and foremost you have to start there when you look at the twenty five seats for example that Hillary Clinton or one in twenty sixteen but have Republicans representing them in on the congressional level a lot of those places happened to be in suburban areas like\nOutside Los Angeles Kansas City Philadelphia a Dallas those are places where you're seeing a lot of these races play out\nYou're also seeing women be a big part of the few of fueling the opposition to President Trump suburban women for example when you live in the suburbs\nHave a much lower approval rating of President Trump than others\nBut this is where I Would jump in and get on my high horse about that phrase suburban voters especially suburban women voters because\nIt's kind of a euphemism that we use in political reporting it's not that like living in a medium density area outside of a city and that's not terribly walkable naturally makes you more democratic or Republican or more Sweeney even so who specifically we're really talking about that\nSo I asked a few pollsters earlier this year about this and they said you know listen often when we are when we sort of talk about this we're often talking about white college educated or otherwise affluent because she thinks tend to go hand in hand\nVoters that's that's a lot of it to be honest and there's another cultural associations people tend to put suburbs right you know like\nPerhaps married parents white picket fence all of that stuff and those are people who by the way are relatively likely to vote and we pay a lot of attention because\nRecently those college educated white men and white women have swung more towards the Democratic party and that was even before President Trump a set up that shift yes and that she has been happening among both white college educated men are roughly split evenly at this point white college educated women have swung way hard towards the Democrats\nAnd the district I'm I'm really interested in is California's forty eight which is a in orange county it's a suburb of Los Angeles you've got this a congressman named Dana Rohrabacher he's been in office he was first elected Thirty years ago in the eighties and he's a surfer\nCampaign at him and I think some sort of uh what's the age of ... around and I are on the ... watching him and his suit\nMost people don't know him as a server they know him as as the Republican that is perhaps the most pro Clinton pro Russia congressmen in Washington DC his district was actually one by Hillary Clinton by two points in twenty sixteen he's being challenged by a local businessmen so it's one of those key races in Los Angeles suburb that will show us whether this trend is\nThe local business and used to be a Republican himself\nAnd so like there he may arguably have some bipartisan appeal right and\nPolls show that race is super close if you're just joining us You're listening to the politics show from NPR I'm Scott Detrow we're focusing on the race for the house of representatives with NPR's Dominican months' narrow\nDanielle Kurtzleben and Tim Mak Dominique ... take me to the future of you and I sitting in the studio and election night where the tabs if your browser will be open to\nYou know I'm an old school I don't even have the browsers I use\nPaper and I've got my list here or that and because I'm political editor I Am going to take some liberty zoom out and grab a bunch of races in one big bucket I find the fine the monitoring everybody subtle and here we go this is the Obama Trump\nDistricts okay from Trump right these are districts that President Obama won in twenty twelve but President Trump wound up winning and twenty sixteen I can talk about all these races but I Want to talk about where they are because it's really indicative of how well Trump did and\nUh what Democrats need to do to win the house or on election day or for Republicans to hold it most of these places are either in the mid west and if you look at at all of them globally\nThere in New York and New Jersey the ... the Philadelphia suburbs uh all the way up through upstate New York a lot of these districts there's one that's uh just outside St Louis on the Illinois side\nYou look at all of those places\nAnd I to me you know if Democrats can do well in the half a dozen or so tossup races that are within this Obama Trump bucket then they probably take back the house\nFun fact three out of four Iowa districts therefore I have a district three of them were Obama Trump districts and two of them are pretty close tossup races right now\nNo part of that might have to do with the even this of redistricting but that's a conversation for another\nTo put us out for Iowa out there that's off a I'm going to go with Amy McGrath in Kentucky sixth district she is running against Andy Barr he a as a Republican of course the the Democrat or not this is a district that has been pretty hard core Republican Trump won it by Fifteen points\nIt's any McGrath is a marine veteran and she is one also one of those democratic women candidates that has gained a lot of prominence on the national stage\nOne of many uh one of many women veterans running on the Democratic side this time\nYes absolutely I mean we have quite a few ... at least historically speaking women combat vets running for Congress she raised three times on ... and the third quarter this year and\nPart of what I'm watching is first of all if she can flip this kind of a district that's really stunning but I'm also watching a lot of these combat vets because what we do know from pulling it is that voters tend to give women and democratic women perhaps especially\n... much less of an edge on things like national security and so on as they might give her Republican man and so this is sort of a test case for that\nSo we've been saying all along that the Democrats are feeling confident that they can take control of the house but of course we don't know what's going to happen on election day we've talked before on the show about the legislative stakes what could Congress do\nNext year depending on who's in charge whatever the political stakes what does it mean to the Democratic party if at at the end of the day they don't we take control the house and for the second election cycle in a row\nThey've they've missed their mark and and and they've\nLost it'd be an earthquake within the Democratic party no question about it you know right now there's a lot of younger democratic activists who are quietly talking about the fact that the leadership within the Democratic party is in their seventies and if the party doesn't if the Democrats aren't able to take back the house\nThen they're going they're going to be a lot of questions to ask about who that leadership will be\nAnd Tim take the flip side of that if Republicans somehow keep control of the house of representatives water Republicans talking about the next day\nWell the president has a alluded to more tax relief for middle income Americans um uh and and on the left us there's gonna be a lot of questions on the blame game like who's responsible you know much like what happened with the Republicans\nAfter Mitt Romney lost in twenty twelve whether they'll put together some sort of introspective autopsy of what happened during this election\nWe know one thing is for sure if Republicans hold the house they will not pump the brakes are going to be stepping on the gas or an exclamation point\nNPR's the minute come on to narrow Danielle Kurtzleben and Tim Mak thanks everybody thinking that You're welcome in Dominican stick with us because now it is time for race of the week\nRunning for United States Senate this caller I Need your help we will never backed down from white and if we by the way but [noise] we [noise]\nEvery week we focus on one race that tells us something about the broader election and this week we're looking at the governor's race in Georgia the medical mountain are all you're still with me how's it going there were gonna bring in Johnny Kauffman of\nW. A. B. E. in Atlanta Johnny hello\nSo the medical let's start with you who are the candidates in the Republican is Brian Kemp who the secretary of state and the Democrat is Stacey Abrams she's a former house minority leader in the Georgia general assembly and Abrams would be the state's first black female governor and the race really a statistically tied\nAnd Johnny A voter suppression or who can and can't vote has become a huge issue in this race especially as early voting has begun why is that\n... has sparred over voting for years and it's getting more and more attention as the election comes closer more specifically one issue that's drawn a lot of controversy is these voter registration applications that have been held up because the information on them doesn't exactly match other government databases\nAnd the registrations that have been held up in that list there's a disproportionate number of people of color\nIf this has drawn a federal lawsuit a camp says it's all blown out of proportion is just to move to excite the Democratic base and he actually points the finger at Stacey Abrams end of the group that she founded called the New Georgia project which has done a lot of voter registration he says that\nHer group is responsible for these messed up applications there are on the list definitely some fakes or some errors like people named Jesus Christ that live on having street as complex to point out\nBut the issue has really persisted for a long time it continues to be a source of debate in the race\nLet's talk about the issues for a little bit what are the voters that you're talking to focusing on\nHealth care and education are really big in the race and and jobs although Georgia's economy has been doing pretty well and the current Republican governor Nathan Deal is pretty popular race has been an issue in this race or maybe not\nTotally at the forefront but very close ah there was a report pretty recently that looked back in the archives and found that Abrams participated in a a flag burning of the Georgia flag back in the nineties that at the time that the Georgia fly had the Confederate flag on it as well\nTwenty six years ago as a college freshman I along with many other Georgians including the governor of Georgia were deeply disturbed by the racial ... that was embedded in the state flag without Confederate symbols\nAnd eventually that Confederate symbol was removed and she pointed out that the governor at the time was actually pushing for the Confederate assembled to be removed as well\nPresident last January you you saw this massive women with these cats on down on her and all they were they were around I don't know but that was a sign that Democrats rats and left\nAnd from the very start when we were barely starting to think of mid term back in January twenty Seventeen from the moment Donald Trump was inaugurated\nDemocrats have been angry and and you know there have been activists organizing so when we talk about Republican enthusiasm ramping up before the election absolutely happens all the time what sets this year apart is first of all both parties are super enthusiastic\nBut Democrats have been there the whole time and Republicans have sort of caught up\nTo them and I think what's important about that is that beneath that a top line number of the enthusiasm are the kinds of groups and people that could turn out to vote and what we're seeing is that independents who have been siding with Democrats on a lot of these issues are are\nA higher enthusiasm level than they have been in past years some seven and ten a independent say that they think these elections are very important are seeing higher levels from voters Eighteen to twenty nine now they're not as high as some of these core Republican groups but those core Republican groups are expected to be there\nSo this was a national poll we did not go district by district asking\nAbout specific candidates but we did ask that general question\nOf would you rather vote for a Democrat or Republican House what did we find\nWe did and the Democratic advantage on that question increased from six to ten points just in the past month and that's an important number because that double digit ... will be called generic ballot gap is a significant one when a strategist look at that when pollsters look at that\nThey see that as a fundamental a thing Democrats or fifty percent Republicans are forty percent\nAnd that really tells you the story of a who has the advantage here and you know again we're not talking about the Senate and whether or not Democrats can take the Senate because it's they're being run in such red states\nBut when you look at the suburbs and you look at where these house races are being run that's for Democrats advantages\nI Want to back up and look at the generic ballot issue again because one thing once again this is where the gender gap pops up in the biggest way among independents so when you look at Democrats Ninety seven percent of democratic women say they're going to vote democratic zero percent zero day they are going to vote Republican\nCandidate tell you how often pull polling exactly you do not see the number zero\nZero zero percent of democratic with it so that surprise me but getting to what's important nine and ten Republican men and women say yeah I'm going to vote Republican independence\nIndependent men prefer the Republican by two percentage points which is a say roughly evenly split independent women prefer the Democrats by twenty three percentage points so once again when you're looking at the gender gap that is where it's\nGoing to ... and I look at unmarried women look at white college educated women they are really driving a lot of this election and the opposition to President Trump the last question on this\nAh what were the issues that that voters seem to be most motivated about well\nYou know the one saving grace for President Trump here is that the economy and jobs continue to rate as the top issue for a for people now it's not a huge percentage of people but it's it's the the largest number of what's asked here and when you look at a second is healthcare third is immigration\nBut the divide between the parties are two completely different universes that rise to party slip and Democrats have been blanketing the airwaves with health care and they're running healthcare healthcare healthcare everywhere\nDemocrats believe that the top issue followed by the way by climate change Republicans see jobs and the economy has topped with immigration as not too far behind which explains President Trump's attempts at trying to wrap up the base and talking about immigration and this caravan coming from Central America\nAnd funny you should mention that because later in the show Danielle and I will have a long conversation about health care with NPR's Scott Horsley looking at how it's played out of the campaign but more importantly what the actual votes have done or would have done and what the Trump Administration has done on Obamacare\nAs later on the show right Danielle Kurtzleben ... thank you so much thank you You're welcome [noise]\nBusiness the politics you from NPR I'm Scott Detrow feels like there's always a few major stories that dominate the headlines\nOne person is now in federal custody after nationwide bomb scare the drooling international outrage over the killing of a Washington Post columnist has the Trump Administration on the rise of that of the United states calling a growing caravan of Central American migrants a national emergency\nAnd because of that other really important stories often get overlooked every week we take a few minutes to focus in on one story that didn't get that much attention this week and to do that we always have NPR's Ron Elving all around good to be with you Scott\n... everything else that happened this week President Trump signed a sweeping legislation on Wednesday to address the opioid crisis uh what what was in that bill\nA rare moment of bipartisanship actually a piece of legislation aimed at helping people preventing overcome addictions in what has become forced health crisis in this country and many years\nAnd you know it's hard to think of another domestic issue where President Obama pushed for legislation and provided funding and President Trump has followed up doing more of same a reminder on the figures last year more than Seventy thousand Americans died from a drug overdose\nOpioids were responsible for about two thirds of those deaths\nThat's more than a hundred and Fifteen Americans a day who die from opioids so the house and Senate passed an opioid bill with near unanimous approval several weeks ago but it was not actually signed into law until this week signed at the White House\nTogether and we're going to end this gorge of drug addiction in America we're going to end it we're we're going to at least make an extremely big dent in this terrible terrible problem\nSo what are some specific things that this law does one\nOf the factors sided in recent successes with controlling this scourge\nHas been access to Medicaid coverage which was expanded under the Affordable CARE Act states taking advantage of that have seen some progress in reaching difficult cases among the poor so one of the things this bill does is to lift certain restrictions on the use of Medicaid and Medicare coverage to deal with opioid addictions\nAt backs the creation of comprehensive opioid recovery centers\nTo address the over prescription of opioids and in many doctors appear to be getting the message on this uh the new law also backs government research into non addictive drugs that could be used as alternatives for pain management alternative therapies\nAdditional measures including new enforcement strength for the United States Postal service so that they can try to curtail some of these foreign shipments of illegal drugs into the United states\nYou mentioned some of the overwhelming statistics of of how many people are dying from overdoses I feel like almost every person in the country knows someone in one way or another who struggled with opioids\nThis bill us signed into law at a time where we're seeing some signs that this crisis may at least be leveling off\nYes that came from Alex Azar the secretary of the department of health and Human Services\nA data for the first months of twenty Eighteen indicate that the number of opioid deaths is not increasing nearly as fast as in recent years he used the word plateau\nAnd that certainly hopeful term maybe a few percentage points increase this year rather than say ten percent as we saw in the previous year and twenty Seventeen the number of Americans dying from opioids rose to Seventy two thousand\nFrom sixty four thousand the previous year a new data from the Centers for Disease Control show the numbers are not rising\nAs fast in the last months of Seventeen and the first few months of twenty Eighteen so if anything the government has been doing can further that trend of both parties seem to think that's worth doing and that's at least one hopeful story this week\nWe're talking about how this is the the rare period where we are both parties\nAre on the same page but that doesn't mean there hasn't been any\nCriticism right that's right and there was a lot of disagreement in the process of putting this together people saying look what we need here is to back up and take a much more holistic approach to the entire question but just\nStitching together all these different programs are kind of pastiche of good intentions are that's ultimately not going to be good enough and that that may well be true some people say there needs to be a great deal more money\nPut into all of these programs that it's really just a drop in the bucket against the size of the problem is we've seen but here again the consensus in the end was let's pass what we can let's put as many dollars in as we can if we can only agree on that stitched together patchwork of programs let's at least do that that is
