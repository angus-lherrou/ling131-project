{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "You covered criminal justice for quite\nA covered criminal justice for the New York times for almost Fifteen Years and I had written the previous book about a black family with multiple generations of criminals\nAnd I wanted to find a white family which could illustrate this because some of the studies were were done so long ago that most of the all the people and some of the study is for the one in Boston for example were all white and I wanted to see if I could take race out of the equation to disentangle race from crime\nSo let's talk about the family you focused on in this book they're double goals on their white as you already mentioned they're poor you trace that family all the way back to right after the civil war and\nYou discover sixty members of the family ended up in prison or jail or some juvenile reform ... which is just staggering Internet itself\nYes it sounds like something out of ... believe it or not and the people who did the statistical studies that found that five percent of families account for half of all crime\nThat they never went the next step and looked at individual families to see why crime spreads and families how did you find that vocal specifically well it was really an accident a friend of mine who worked in the Oregon department of corrections\nCalled me one day and we were talking and I asked him if he knew of of a white family with a significant number of prisoners\nIn it and he said I'll have to call you back and he did in a couple of days and he said I've got family there are white and I think they've got six members who who are now are have been in prison but we had no idea at that point that they were as many as sixty who had been in prison or jail\nNow the patriarch that use zero in on in this book is a man named rooster Bogle can you tell us about him how as a father and as a husband rooster Bogle hope to reinforce the terrible choices members of his family were making\nWell rooster took a lot of pride in being tough and having committed a crime which landed him in in prison in Texas when he was only Seventeen and he wanted his sons to grow up to be at least as tough as he wasn't as bad as he was and remind us what was his first arrests for\nHis first arrests was for a burglary of the local a grocery store he was living in Amarillo, Texas\nAnd in fact almost everybody in the family participated in the burglary including a roosters mother and one of roosters sisters as well as all his brothers and they they made off with twenty thousand dollars which doesn't seem like a lot now but\nAnd in Nineteen sixty it was a lot of money yeah\nBut it was like a family day it was like going on a picnic or something\nYes exactly going on a when a picnic a barbeque in Texas\n[laughter] but as Mr grew older he continued his criminal behavior and the family he raised he taught them that it was kind of a badge of honor to get in trouble with the law\nYes and he would he would take his kids out and commit crimes of them they would break into their neighbors' homes or they would break into their mailboxes and take their Social Security checks they would steal people's cows and chickens\nOr they would go into a lumber yard and take lumber with sure they would resell or anything that they could do and I'm One incident to the kids talked about\nWas the one night he had organized his entire family including his wife\nSons and daughters and they go onto the bugs will damaged big dam on the Columbia River outside of Portland and going into the fish hatchery and stolen all the Cohen Chinook salmon if they could find in the fish hatchery there and loaded them in their truck and drove them home and either eight them are sold them\nBut it was more than just adventures and shenanigans I mean you explore a very dark side to the wave rooster raised his family there was rampant physical abuse sexual abuse psychological abuse which leads me to the ultimate question\nWhat's the more powerful force when it comes to shaping criminal behavior did you find it with genetics or family values\nI started out looking at family values\nWhat was obvious in talking to the moguls\nWas that they were very conscious of imitating the behavior of their father end of the aunts and uncles and my grandmother and grandfather\nOh who met criminal records and then they did not have any what criminologist we call social controls so they didn't go to church on Sunday school we didn't belong to any organization like the boy scouts\nThey didn't have other adult role models but beyond that I began to get interested in and if there was any role of genetics and this in criminology has been a no no er taboo subject for a long time\nBecause they can dangerously trend to the question of how race yes and he turned criminality\nIs so there were in recent years certainly since the ... of the human genome some scientist began to look at\nBehavioral genetics and there was a professor at Duke who is a criminologist and her work indentified several genes which could be precursors to impulsivity which is a characteristic of a lot of criminals\nBut she stresses that there's no such thing as a criminal gene which in combination with the environment so if you have a family environment like the moguls and you have this variant of the gene then you have kind of a double whammy\nI Want to end our conversation as un did your book um by talking about Ashley she's rooster vocals granddaughter she was kind of the operation in the family she's a good student she wants to do good she became the first member of the ... and a hundred and fifty years to go to college\nWhen graduated from college and graduate from college what did you learn from Ashley story\nThat she herself says it's a matter of individual choice in the end she chose not to do what she saw around her she didn't like what was happening to everybody else in her family\nSo she decided to try to stick to a good path and that she can break the cycle and she broke a cycle ended in her case she had a little help because\nHer mother was actually the daughter of policemen and ate a prison guard and a grandmother who was a nurse so she had some very good influences in her family that would help to overcome some of the Bogle side of her family\nFox Butterfield

Arabian forces\nHow unusual is it for the royal family to publicly changes explanation for anything\nWell there I Would say that they're not always professionals that communication this is a monarchy this is a place where this is an authoritarian state as well and domestically they're in charge of all the media so when it comes to how they communicate with other people they can pretty much say whatever they want that gets a little bit more complicated when they have to communicate with the rest of the world which I think is what we're seeing now\nWhat about within Saudi Arabia how is fall out from ... playing out there is there any fallout\nHum as far as we know there isn't enough for the simple reason that nobody has much of a say in anything that happens except the crown prince and accept his father who is the king\nSo there have been sort of these two dwelling images\nOf the crown prince there's this image of a man who has worked in quite actively to consolidate his power but then there's also this other image of a man who's tried to bring modernizing progressive changes to society like letting women drive which image using Saudis buy into more\nI think it's one of the things which made him such a fascinating character to watch is really these two sides um and and I do think that the social things he wants to do are genuine I Do believe that he wants women to drive I Do believe that he wants to diversify the economy I Do believe that he wants to change the religious rhetoric away from some of the\nExtremism and um it's safe to say that there were lots of people in Saudi Arabia especially young people who were very excited about the social changes that he wanted to make\nBut I think people are also very wherever the flip side of this I mean I have many many Saudi friends with a lot of people that I keep in touch with a lot of them are very scared you know again the one of the best examples that we've seen that this was the fact that somebody like democracy ... who had worked for\nMembers of the royal family and been sort of part of that elite society decided that it was time to get out of town and go live in Virginia\nYou report it over the weekend about the tremendous turmoil all of this has caused with in the royal family who besides the crown prince his father kings Oman could exert any meaningful pressure on the crown prince to change course at this point\nIt doesn't appear that there's anybody um and we really have to differentiate between the leadership of the kingdom which I Would say is the is the king and the crown prince with the with the crown prince being the one who's doing the day to day management of the kingdom\nAnd the rest of the royal family I mean the royal family is a huge sprawling family we're talking thousands and thousands of princes princes\nOr what you did use to have in Saudi Arabia before this current leadership came into play was a much more of a consensus system of governing the place uh-huh throughout Saudi Arabia's history you've had kind of a group of talk princes who shared the big portfolios whether it was the fence domestic security bombing been something that has very effectively demolished that system\nHe is sort of dismantled all of the other power centers in the kingdom and put everything under himself\nWill do you think the crown prince has been taken aback genuinely by the blowback he's gotten because of what happened to ...\nThe report and that we have suggests that he has that he he has just been completely blown away by how large the story has gotten in by how much it means to people I mean at the end of the day the guy wasn't an American citizen he was a Saturday and so I think he's been quite surprised by it all\nThen Hubbard is the ... bureau

S. spelling out\nThere is it would allow them to more freely deploy weapons that they've apparently already developed while the U.S only last year began doing research and development for intermediate range weapons remember thousands of weapons of this nature had to be destroyed so it's not like the U.S has stockpiled ready to deploy now\nIs it possible that the administration might be for lack of a better term bluffing right to to get a better deal\nThat could be this was a Soviet era treaty and it limits what the US can do not just in Europe but across the entire planet and Trump with like a deal to include China which right now has no restrictions on deploying intermediate range nuclear weapons they might be crushed\nJoin the INS if the U.S started placing such weapons in the south Pacific\nDavid in the meantime the u._s. does have other arms control agreements with Russia or those imperil\nI think this does mark a major shift in us arms control policy since Nineteen seventies the thrust has been to limit nuclear weapons and under Trump the momentum all seems to be toward ending these treaties and letting the stalled nuclear arms race get going again\nAfter all this administration has pushed for developing new nuclear weapons and they've been approved by the new defense budget\nThat's NPR's David Welna David thank you for your reporting your well

pens that's after Arizona second highest court recently upheld the conviction of a man named Rodney Jones a medical marijuana card holder Jones went to prison for having Canada's oil\nShe was certainly acting and his view according to the rules\nThat's attorney Robert ... who's asking the state Supreme Court to overturn Jones his conviction\nIt seems implausible that the intent of the electorate was that the only way that that medication can be administered to them would be by smoking a joint\nBut that's in effect what the ruling means under the court's logic many of the state's one hundred and eighty thousand medical marijuana patients are committing felonies\nClearly there's a lot at stake\nSo how does this happen with the products sold for years even regulated by the state\nThe legal dispute centers on whether Arizona's medical marijuana act first passed by voters as a ballot measure and twenty ten includes candidates extracts Sheila poke a prosecutor and one of the Arizona staunchest photos of marijuana says no in fact it's her office they went after Rodney Jones\nThis case affirmed away candidates has always been treated in this county by my office which is that it's a narcotic drug\nMany dispute her interpretation but it's unclear how many other prosecutors are now following her lead pope believes medical marijuana supporters are taking advantage of the ballot box by pushing initiatives that voters don't fully understand\nThey weren't contemplating manufacturers would be extracting one chemical from that marijuana plant to make this you know mind blowing product\nArizona is a cautionary tale about the possible fallout abusing the ballot instead of state legislators to craft marijuana reform law's says Rob Mike as he's a law professor at Vanderbilt University and says these measures aren't always comprehensive you're opening the door\nTo those opponents to sort of revisit the issue on and exploit those gaps\nMichigan for example only clarified in twenty sixteen what was legal and their state years after voters passed their medical marijuana measure micro says many lawmakers don't want to get ahead of these disputes\nThe way to crack this problem you know these gaps between the the letter and spirit of these marijuana reforms\nI is to have them addressed first and foremost by legislatures and on professional bureaucrats that that know how to write legislation that deals with and and can anticipate with all all those problems that might come up\nThat did not happen in Arizona in fact a bill aimed at fixing the problem

says it's crown prince met today with U.S Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin is NPR's Scott Horsley explains the Trump Administration is still trying to figure out how to respond to the killing of a U.S based journalist under the Saudi government's watch\nI also so can the president on his own cut off aid to Central American countries or does he first knee cooperation from Congress\nThe president does have some latitude to curtail aid payments lawmakers might not like that the top Democrat on the house foreign affairs committee has already lost to protest but presidents in the past have used this power to hold up to countries they don't believe are acting in us interest\nNow aside from his authority some of the experts I spoke with said it would be counterproductive for President Trump to follow through on this trip they say cutting off aid might just make conditions in the Central American countries worse and create an even bigger push for people to try to pack up and scrape for the north\nNow has called on Mexico to stop the caravan and said that if that doesn't happen you will call up the U.S military and close the southern border I mean he is commander in chief so can he unilaterally do that\nTrump and other presidents have mobilized the national guard in the past uh usually in cooperation with state governors you might remember that President Trump mobilized about four thousand guard troops this past spring to lend a hand with more security in general those guard troops have been playing a support role they're not actually patrolling were sealing the border\nBut also that's not really the point you know the migrants the president's been talking about are not as a rule trying to evade the border patrol on the country they have been deliberately turning themselves in when they reached the border and asking for asylum so it's not really clear what bringing in more troops would actually accomplish\nHe's trying to turn away migrants if they don't first apply for asylum in Mexico can enforce fat\nLongstanding federal and international law says immigrants who present themselves at the border\nHave the right to seek protection as refugees at least to apply for it and that's what many of the Central American migrants have been doing many of them are also doing so in family groups and that has posed a challenge for the administration because of limits we've talked a lot about on detaining ... young people for example\nWe have seen a surge in the number of family groups crossing the border illegally\nBut we have to keep this in perspective overall the level of illegal border crossings is still way down from its high point around the year two thousand\nOkay and I've only heard in the interview with reporter genes Frederick just right now migrants advocates are refuting Trump's claim that Democrats are to blame for the caravan of ... what are you know about that are these threats just a ploy head of the ...\nThe

are considered parasites you know like that they're totally dependent on the works of art and the and you know that's like they're just sort of these appendages\nBut I think that he actually saw criticism as a higher calling than that and something that was very exploratory and the same way the painting was exploratory\nAnd in his movie reviews Farber wrote for himself\nThe funny thing about is I mean she writes for the kind of shark has them that you often can't tell whether he likes to move there doesn't like the movie and that's what's interesting about him like I think of all major

President Trump is describing the killing of a Saudi columnist as the worst cover up in the history of cover ups secretary of state says the U.S is taking appropriate steps in response to considering targeted sanctions Here's NPR's Michele Calvin\nTo talk more about Mexico's position in all of this we're joined now by Arturo ... he's a former Mexican ambassador to the U.S welcome thank you thank you for having me\nSo how difficult as a predicament is this for Mexico right now\nWell there's no doubt that Mexico's cook between a rock and a hot place first because the dynamics of the U.S Mexico bilateral relationship\nTries migration and North American security of the fact that Mexican the United states have been working hand in hand to ensure that our borders are secure it's also challenge because of our own relations with Central American the need to ensure that\nThe Central American nations particularly on ... on the side of old can develop in such a way where their economic prosperity can be strengthened\nOkay so you say the number of concerns there or the U.S relationship with Mexico the very real migration concerns of migrants coming from Central America into Mexico is there a concern for Mexico about its international image and all it\nIs absolutely there's no doubt that since two thousand fourteen when Mexico started repatriating very high numbers of Central American migrants that there's a double challenge here one is domestically\nBecause a lot of people in Mexico believe Mexico's during the U.S is quote unquote dirty work by stopping in deporting these individuals' back to their countries have he had a problem for the U.S taking care of a problem for us with very little returned from the U.S for doing that\nAnd then the other challenges with international multinational organizations and NGOs that believe it or not I I agree with them in many ways that Mexico is not observing it since national obligations to provide individuals who have a bona fide reason to fear for their lives with a refugee or asylum hearing in Mexico\nWe see Mexican authorities deploying riot police but the police don't seem to be using force they don't seem to be stopping these migrants in any way does it seem like Mexico is not making a real effort to stop the flow of these migrants into the U.S\nI think Mexico is being doing humans work and supporting us since two thousand and fourteen\nBut in an area like why does that mean what does it mean to support\nThat it it means that does not fleeing because of persecution or fear for their lives most of them are being detained and deported and I think that Mexico using force\nTo shut down its border would play into the hands of those who are in this country or weaponized sing or seeking to weaponize immigration policy and who would use\nOnly deterrence to modify tries migration patents that have structural reasons and that will not be addressed by deterrence alone\nDo you get the sense that it shouldn't even Mexican government's obligation where it should be their burden to process as many asylum seekers as possible within Mexico's borders rather than letting them continue their journey to the U.S\nThose who wish to stay in Mexico I leave the problem is that the majority of the Central America and don't want to stay in ... migrants don't want to stay in Mexico Mexico is a conduit to the U.S Mexico border\nWith challenges when you are Mexican authorities tell them do you want apply for asylum in Mexico they say no we want to go to the United states so unless you have something akin to what the us has to be with Canada\nIn terms of safe third country agreement it's very hard to ensure that by protesting them they can stay in Mexico instead of right doing the truck to the U.S border\nWell how do you think the incoming Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador how do you think he might approach the situation differently if these caravans do continue into the next Mexican Union Station\nHe has said that he will try and give these many of the Central American migrants a work visa to be able to stay and work in Mexico for ... years of labor perhaps as as a source of\nJumper labor the problem here is unless Mexico and also the United states devise a feasible temporary worker program that allows for the legal flow of temporary workers coming back and forth our borders\nThese issues will be stopgap measures\nFormer Mexican ambassador to the U.

that believes are responsible for the killing of journalist Jamal ... secretary of state my palm pale maybe announcement today\nWe've identified at least some of the individuals responsible including those in the intelligence services the royal court the foreign ministry and other Saudi ministries but we suspect to have been involved in Mr to show that we're taking appropriate actions which include revoking basis entering visa lookouts and other measures\nMeanwhile Gina Haspel the head of the CIA is in Turkey today to investigate because she'll just killing at the consulate in Istanbul NPR's Greg Myre is here to tell us more about that visit Greg hey so what is hospitals we're all here\nWell she's got a very significant role in not only with her title is head of the CIA this is a place she knows really well we know she speaks Turkish I'm In a rare speech recently she said is stumble\nWith London or two of her favorite cities in the world\nTo see I never says exactly where somebody spent their undercover days but she clearly knows this place she's a player she knows how the the how things to take place there\nUm and remember the U.S turkey and the Saudis are allies and they are conducting these sort of ... separate investigations but there's also negotiations going on and this is probably not likely to end so much in a court room is or isn't a political agreement and some sort of negotiation so that's the key thing I think to keep watching\nSo what is the White House hoping to accomplish by sending hassle there\nWell the president clearly wants this to end very quickly he's been very close to the Saudis he wants to resume these close ties and have\nBusiness go on a pretty much as usual but he's been very inconsistent in his responses um he's talked about a a credible investigation and then he's talked about things he's not so sure of severe punishment but then he talks about the value of arms deals so he's been all over the place so here's what he said just today\nSomebody really messed up and they had the worst cover ever and were should have stopped is at the deal standpoint whether they thought about it because whoever thought of that idea I think is in big trouble\n[noise] so I think the president is looking for Haspel and and Mike Pompeo to give him a clear picture of actually what happened who was responsible so that there can be some sort of a clear policy uh put in place\nIn the meantime turkey has been revealing more and more information each day about what they say happened inside the Saudi conflict do\nWe have a better sense about what they want to happen next\nYeah I think we saw today president or the one gave this big speech and he talked about this being a premeditated murder so he's clearly still playing hardball with the Saudis and they've got some real issues turkey and Saudi Arabia are rivals turkey wants to be seen as the preeminent Sunni Muslim country\nUm turkey has a very bad economy they would like investment from Saudi Arabia Saudi a contract so the Turks are likely to keep playing this out drawing it out where where's the Americans and the Saudis would would probably like to to finish it up pretty quickly\nUm the ... the the Turks have or we believe the audiotapes um there's still the question where the body is so I talked to to Bruce ride down all of the Brookings Institution um and here's what he had to say about the the Turkish thinking\nI think her to want to enjoy watching every twist and the wind and I think he's probably going to play that game for some time to come\nIn the meantime you mentioned the Saudis wanting to move on quickly how have they responded to all this well\nToday was the beginning of this big business conference or in the capital Riyadh the so called Davos in the desert\nAnd Mohammed bin some on the crown prince NBS of backed out but then he made a surprise cameo appearance in and got a standing ovation so this is clearly the Saudi playbook to a\nTo a business as usual let's find a way out of this and move on the big question of course will be will Mohammed bin some on remain as the crown prince his father is in his eighties and ailing a so far NBS is still in line to succeed him\nThat's NPR's Greg Myre thank you for your reporting\nThank you and leaving hearing the killing of Saudi journalist ... has sparked international outrage that people right here in the U.S are also talking about the incident and how President Trump has been handling it\nNorth Country Public Radio's Brian Mann reports on how it's playing out among voters and
