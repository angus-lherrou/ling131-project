{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "A second of all of course like watching the show I'm literally watching myself learn how to act so I Would say learn how to act before you go ... ah that would be the best advice I could give someone else but if not tried to being something with ... and he can learn everything from\nYeah how did you begin acting anyway\nI had signed two three out to the comedy writer and I was sort of running out of money so thinking about going back in testing which was my original Korea back in England\n... as you were a radio DJ on T. V.\nAnd yeah I did buy for about nine years in England uh for the BBC and so I had about ... from my manager who said they were looking for a very annoying that Rachel Pakistani woman with an English accent\nWas actually banned from the gay or yes very and very tall\nYes by the Saudi women with an English accent it was very specific costing quote it was it if someone had met me\nOn the wrist in it for me and I was vaguely offended actually when my a manager said you'd be perfect for this so they sent me up for it I never thought I get it but I went along anyway 'cause it's a great experience and even humiliating myself in front of my truck could make a really funny call them or something and uh that's\nVery strange not much uh gave me a job despite the fact that I had no idea what I was doing\n[noise] um you know the show seems to have diversity built into its DNA without being about minority experience person saying the cast includes a lot of non white actors and that's not the main feature of their character's it's just something that you've discussed with the cast and creators\nOh haven't discussed it so much with the creators butts when there was one episode in which that was me\nAnd two of the south Asian actresses on the show none of whom were playing South Asian people with South Asian accidents we but just think people we constantly talk about this whenever we're on screen together that it's so nice to have more than one on set a time and also for that not to be the staple possible character\nIs really sad how remarkable it is but I had more people kind of see that we haven't bombed because there are brown people on television and they will follow suit\nYeah off screen you do a lot of activism like you are vocal about body shaming you advocate for disability rights uh-huh as a stereotypically beautiful woman you're an unexpected messenger for that message\n[noise] well I have experienced this ability of my life you know I was death to the child and I was hit by a car and broke my back when I was Seventeen and couldn't walk for every year and a half\nSo I've had experience with disability I was also a very heavy child who got bullied and tease endlessly because of my weight and developed ... because of that fourteen and which I didn't eat a meal for three years and ... writing so then I got hit by the ... gained the weight back\nAnd then some basic again despise go\nAnd then you know it kind of slowly came off after a couple of years and then I developed asthma which maybe go on steroids betrayed me eat trees and cause and people I gained a lot of weight and I just made history as the first woman ever\nTo host the official child on the BBC Radio one\nOf the day it was announced that I had that drop on the radio it was only announced really that I've gained five dress sizes that I was raised to yes in the tabloids and then I talk about the parked outside my house for months so hunting abuse it me about my way I think that I Would react and cry or or ... one of them\nAnd I was you know the first Gulf my bought him on the phone call the magazines and putting extra very skinny photos of myself so I have definitely lived through the various different types of damage that come from\nThis obsession with all white and one thing I Do know from experience is a shame is never the way to get anyone to lead a healthy lifestyle which leads to eating too little too much or exercising too little too much\nAnd that's never an attention towards mental health or self love\nIn advertising and I think that's what needs to change I think we need to be more capital needs to be more police especially around diet culture\nSo how do you get away from the really kind of easy lazy narrative of\nOh well now she can experience of love because she's tall and thin and beautiful and looks great and all these dresses\nWell I'm lucky that I when it happened when I was being like you know nationally fat shamed I held my own and it was actually still state the most successful year of my life I Won the most woods I've ever won not yeah I was in a very happy relationship that I entered into at that weight I on the most money I've ever made so I was living it up\nAt that size so therefore it wasn't like that was a low point in my life and now everything's great and that was an amazing time and I never took a weight loss Dale so I think because of the fact that I thrived in that time my career not reflected by the size of my body by the amount of flash on my bones\nAnd I'm really glad that I made all those decisions back then because now I can back it up now\nThat I'm not a hypocrite I've lived through this I've always stay true to the same message and all I'm campaigning full body confidence I'm encouraging women to stop thinking about that but he's the one minute and think about their achievements think about that lives thinking about the dreams and that goes in the happiness and how to grow that rather than just shrink themselves\n[noise] that must make it all the more challenging for you to on a daily basis inhabit this character whose value resides in beautiful dresses and getting texts from a dollar momma\n[noise] well I think the good thing is that we're constantly only making fun of her yeah so that for all the messaging is actually pretty clear that we are against that vote prices and things she's completely ridiculous\n... ridiculous un stomach to help her she\nFor health because we couldn't make the messaging around that lifestyle and those priorities ... that they all bad and the fact that look at why she ended up with what the plight that she's now in\nIn the season of a good place to honey has a book that as the future free titled get out of the spotlight yeah and I understand you are also writing a book in real life\nI Am writing aerobic in real life you know I Love to concede to this huh [laughter] um it's about shame it's a revolutionary approach to shame on how to kill it\nCanada ever truly be killed\nWell we'll find out but I Believe so I spent the last three is on a ... a shame just coming out bit by bit by bit every part of my life that brings a nanny and it has given me such a sense of self\nAnd such a strength at such a sense of perspective specially such adopt industry it's show business you really need to keep your head screwed on your shoulders people ready to get very carried away with stuff that doesn't mean anything at all\nAnd so it has helped me have a real grounding and knowledge of my own value and protection around myself from toxicity\nDreamy original things on which we're talking with us today thank you very much for having me she plays to honey on NBC's The good place which has just begun season

edu [noise]\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Janine her on the Senate floor this afternoon Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins took away any doubt on where she stood on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh saying she will vote to confirm him\nThe more moderate level headed Republicans and um and there was a lot of past tense use of you know we were friends we used to work together um and I I think this anger doesn't go away for a while\nTo really what do you think is a set of going to be able to move on from this or has a poison some of the relationship for lawmakers really need to get things done\nI mean look I think the partisanship that was happening that's present in the Senate ah existed long before this confirmation battle this certainly exacerbated it or to a greater extent we saw the pressure that was placed on the moderates\nIn the Senate like Senator Collins like Senator mansion um I I Would disagree that ah it's Senator Graham is still considered one of the more level headed members of the Senate right now he seems to be really really ... a spokesperson basically for President Trump at this point and that's the role he served throughout this confirmation process but\nThe Senate is a tough place for moderates to be right now and I think that only a grows more so\nLooking beyond Congress this controversy has prompted some women to share stories of abuse from years or decades ago um for example a newscaster Connie Chung told her story of sexual assault in the Washington Post this week\nOn two was ... he was a little bit about Fifteen Years ago molester was our ...\nWe're now one year after the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke and launched the me too movement and so I Wonder what it is about this Kavanaugh for debate that is making people speak out now who might not have told their stories after wind scene or Bill Cosby or any of the others Kimberly what are you saying\nWell look talking to women who have called me emails me to tell their stories of sexual assault which is happening with a lot of journalists uh\nLately I think the idea that someone who was accused of this could reach a level of such power despite women coming forward and telling their stories about that it's really alarming to them a ... it's not about I mean a lot of these women were talking about how the anger of women these women were angry they were more gutted\nOr that this could happen that these stories of women even if folks say like Senator Collins said that she believes that Dr Ford suffered some thing but that there is no proof that it was him well the idea usually when it's an acquaintance situation that\nA memory works that way I mean Dr Ford's the scientist she explains how memory works in her own contacts and that if she couldn't even be believed enough to stop this that there is a concern that this is really a system that's rigged against women\nBethany I Know you've written with some degree of skepticism about of Ford's account against Kavanaugh what do you think the consequences of this episode will be for society more broadly\nSo I I I think that it's an important ... to have about sexual assault but I think that this is also an and Collins spoke to had a great deal and her and her commentary on the floor there's also\nA presumption of innocence and there's an expectation that you can't bring for these kinds of serious allegations that can dismantle an entire career without any corroboration and unfortunately there wasn't in this case I'm at in the case of ray Moore when he came out and accusers came forward\nTo the Alabama Senate race yeah yeah there there was there's corroborating that a lot of his accusers had that that made their accounts convincing and I I didn't personally see that in in any of these circumstances\nI also want to ask you both about the political consequences of this debate because when Ford first testified in front of the Senate Judiciary committee Democrats and Republicans called are credible and express sympathy and admiration for her willingness to speak publicly this week some took on a different tone starting with President Trump here he was at a rally in Mississippi on Tuesday night\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there don't remember where is the place I don't remember I'm going to\nThe audience laughed and applauded and at that same rally Trump said this is a very scary time for young men in America with the midterms one month away Bethany do you think this will have an impact\nYeah absolutely and we're we're already seeing that as far as fundraising and\nAnd sort of enthusiasm from Republicans this has been a very unifying moment for Republicans I mean we ... we saw Brett Stevens and the New York times applaud President Trump and that's something that I don't think anyone thought that they would have seen three weeks ago let alone I'm right on now but\nThis is this is really I think going to to drum up a lot of enthusiasm on the right in a way that hasn't existed in twenty sixteen\nCan really do think that I'm Susie ... will last for the next month if Kavanaugh is confirmed with the court this weekend is expected\nI think that's a still unclear I mean there definitely was if the Republicans told me they were afraid that the poor part of their base would revolt against them if they didn't get Kavanaugh through now that won't happen it seem more like a defensive play I I\nDon't know if that's enough to counteract the energy that we're seeing right now on the other side that is burned by the sort of gender war it seems that's being a exacerbated by the president or with the comments that you played a I think that really spurs the other side the losing side traditionally is the one with the momentum after a fight like this\nAnd just briefly from each of you know that it looks like having a will be confirmed the Supreme Court apart from the shift to the right ideologically that he was expected to bring to the court to each of you think that the echoes of this fight will linger in the Supreme Court itself Kimberly\nIt could I mean look Clarence Thomas still speaks with a lot of disdain about his own confirmation process so it's very possible this is a consensus building a group uh that's how they have to be at a function so it's tough to see how that doesn't play a role\nAnd briefly Bethany will give you the last word\n[noise] yeah I I think that this has radicalized a lot of people and I think having a ... one of them I I I'm not sure how much in this sort of\nThis experience has impacted his judicial opinions but I I Can't see that it hasn't changed his mind somehow about due process about the presumption of innocence um I I think that there's probably did may be pushing more right were then he would have otherwise been had this been a smooth confirmation process\nThat's Bethany Mandela editor of Rick a sham columnist for the forward and Kimberly ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo my grandparents ah youngest to children their their names are linen Holly and they were in their early teens when I was born in ... and ... and Hollywood would babysit me when I was about two years old and\nThey come home and tears and they'd say mom dad we we've got to get that kid out of that house um and so my mother shortly after I was born started using again and and with with using ... other criminal activity to support the habits\nAnd uh so my my grandfather started lining up uh the legal paperwork to gain custody of me because he didn't want me to just flipping to become a a ward of the state\nYou also write ... about what it's like to be raised by grandparents and at one point there is a scene of them taking out their headstones and you talk about the idea that you're even as a young child and that's never kind of living with death\nThey were planners right so they were like wanting to make sure all their estates for an orchard something tragic happens so and I was an eight year old kid and they would very talked openly about you know there will what would happen if they were to go soon a ... you know my grandmother anytime you took a photo with her\nShe would say if that comes out good put it in the paper which meant use that for her ... to make sure she make sure you choose a very flattering photo\nTo put in the newspaper when she dies a and yes they picked up their headstone a and they we were just very casual lead you driving home from Cornell and hot dogs in Worcester and they said oh let's just stop by\nThe end of the stone is a must stop by the cemetery and and there it was there you know my grandparents who are my parents their their first names and their birth years but no death dates\nThat's a lot\nTo handle a lot and you're laughing now but at the time like ... were you a quiet kid were you like how did you take this and what they were very funny\nPeople to see my grandfather would say you know when they when they barely put me closer to the street so I could sneak out at night and then my grandmother like your best to [laughter] that is an all you know we're on the radio so you can see me but I my main taking a cigarette in and out because that's how they that's how these folks [laughter]\nMy grandmother reminded me often uh that I was very lucky enough to be addicted to heroin when I was born a\nShe was so you know anytime there might be a news report you know in the in the early mid eighties about you know kids who are addicted to drugs when they were born she would just pull out of cigarettes like you know you you're lucky you were born like that right you know that right [laughter] right yeah you know whatever\nSo you begin to draw right but when you're very young and what kind of outlet does that become for you\nI becomes an escape it becomes the one world that I can control right so um it by the time at it it's therapeutic it gets my mind off things my mind as they are on the page a part of my research into this book because I saved every sketchbook\nI had throat my my teen years really and looking through them\nAll I can take off that kid was angry [laughter] you know what I my grandparents never once considered you know putting me into therapy and part of that was their generation you know they they came of age and the great depression you just just didn't talk about things\nUm and so I I you know I had friends that I could speak to I I certainly had some adults in my life I could speak to family members and and teachers at school who\nAlways very patiently offered listening ear to me but the sketch books to be able to work through some of this sort of darkness I had in my head um they gave me an outlet\nYou write in your dedication you write in any dish into your grandparents and mom you say that the book is called for every reader who recognizes this experience ICU\nThere there is a rise in the number of uh grandparents raising their kids right because of the opioid crisis and when you read these stories [laughter]\nDo you think oh God there's a lot of kids who who are going to go through what I'm going through or what I what I went through\nThere are a lot of kids going through that now and of course when I was a kid I thought it was the only one in America being raised by my grandparents you know and I didn't take any other my peers and my elementary school a great school had these sorts of problems\nAnd come to find out later I mean they certainly did so I Know I I Hope that dedication to young readers who are experiencing a similar\nAttracting life might feel less alone by that to know that I'm acknowledging that this might be an experience that they are also having\nIn the book you do kind of reconcile with your birth father you find him and you develop a kind of relationship with your birth mother do you feel like you ended up having a good relationship do you feel like you've kind of for gave her for how you grow up we\nHad a great relationship for a number of years so she sees skipped my high school graduation which is weird this book ends I'm Sorry spoiler alert ... graduated high school and a and a ... and um\nSo I went off to college without having had any contact with her but my\nMy grandparents made sure that we're all together for Thanksgiving and so over the years we did develop a great relationship um we danced at my wedding you know she got to meet\nMy first two kids um but it was it was it was when my second child was born that she started getting into trouble again sir getting arrested again and a loss you wouldn't say say as much it was it was pretty clear that she started using again and she certainly was\nA surrounding herself by some nefarious individuals but I did a lot my last discussion that last time I saw her was about a year before she died and we we left it when she said to me I Love you and I always will\nAnd without missing a beat and I said I Love you and I always will um she she never really took ownership though of of any of the stuff that happens um she would often say when you're just going to get over it\nWhich is a tough thing to say to a kid or you sort of learn to move past\nThings but it's it's certainly nice when it's at least someone owns up to their poor behavior right which she she was never able to do\nWell ... thank you so much for speaking with us and for sharing your family's story\nWell thank you so

I Hope you'll read Susan Collins a statement today she has a lot of faith in him the things she said about him in as being a moderate\nIf he takes us to heart and that really marks his service or on the court it will be a departure from what his critics expect\nDo you think the Democrats miscalculated by shining a spotlight on a victim who originally wanted to remain anonymous opening an FBI investigation that ultimately provided cover for senators on the fence to support the candidate and doing a long term harm to the reputation of someone who is not likely to sit on the Supreme Court for decades\nHow could we walk away from a credible charge of sexual assault against the nominee to the Supreme Court in the United states how could we ignore that we couldn't\nAnd there was an effort made by Senator Feinstein to deal with the coals for confidentiality and protecting her identity eventually it came out and I'm Glad that Susan Collins made it clear that Senator Feinstein should not be accused of leaking this I don't believe for a second that you would have ever considered that\nBut the fact is it became a public fact a public issue on a critically important in a timely issue we couldn't walk away from it had to ask for an investigation to ask for hearing those are just normal request on Capitol Hill\nJust in our last thirty seconds or so do you think that this bitter and divisive fight will have long term consequences for the Senate\nI Hope not I think what we need to do after this is finished next week roll up our sleeves and find a bipartisan measure to work on we've been doing things like the opium bill and the federal as a real authorization bill that are not getting much attention to this issue\nWe need to get back to business roll up our sleeves be bipartisan show that we can work together to restore some confidence in his buddy\nSenator Dick Durbin Democrat of Illinois thanks for joining us here on all things considered thank you\nOh at the heart of the sites of course the Supreme Court one of the most respected institutions in the country\nAnd a lot of people are asking would affect the partisan fight over Cavanaugh I might have on the high court\nA question no one is better poised to answer than NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg Hi Nina high so speaking of partisanship that I'm going to get to the effect on the court in a second but start with the partisanship that a lot of people saw on display when Brett Kavanaugh testified last week he talked about that\nThat he was being targeted as revenge for the Clintons that you've covered a lot of Supreme Court confirmation fights have had you ever seen anything like that\nLook in historical terms nothing like this has ever happened before a Supreme Court\nAny using partisan language to describe not just the senators but all of his opponents and couching the opposition purely in terms of anger over the over the twenty sixteen presidential election Kavanaugh's performance in fact\nCause retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens a lifelong Republican to speak out against the nominee\nAnd he said that he'd like Kavanaugh as a judge even put his picture and one of his books because of a decision that Kevin wrote but Kavanaugh has demeanor and partisanship Stevenson Steven said demonstrated a potential bias involving enough potential litigants before the court\nThat he would not be able to perform his full responsibilities and might have to recuse himself because of that a parent bias here's here's Stevens speaking to a group in Florida yesterday\nFor the record who it is not the ill to get a new justice you know fully do put a part time job\nNow I don't really think that Kavanaugh as likely to recuse himself and indeed you saw him today in the wall Street Journal and an op ed piece trying to somehow walked back some of his comments without specify which ones\nIt appears are based on how things are shaking out in the Senate ... today that um plenty of senators enough senators are prepared to vote to confirm Kavanaugh despite all these questions being raised by Justice Stevens than others so what does that mean for the politics of the court or at least the appearance of the court that it should be above politics\nWell the justices will grit their teeth and and they'll put on a good show in public and private I suspect\nChief justice John Roberts knows and has stressed that the courts best currency is the notion that it's not a partisan institution that there may be ideological differences but not partisan once\nAnd all of this cannot be sitting well with him\nYeah Republican Susan Collins of Maine a made a dramatic speech today weighing in on some of these questions she was announcing her support for Kavanaugh here's a little bit of what she had to say\nMy fervent hall is that Brett Kavanaugh will work less than the divisions in the Supreme Court so that we had far fewer five four decisions\n[noise] how big a challenge is that going to be enough for for Brett Kavanaugh at this stage to lessen divisions\n[laughter] well you don't even have to go there just are you have to do is look at his record Collins framed it as a quite moderate record today but there's a reason that President Trump added cabinet to that list of potential candidates for the court\nAnd that is that on questions ranging from gun regulation to executive power to abortion to overall regulations he is firmly in the conservative some would even say ultraconservative vein of judicial ideology so\nI Would indeed expect eventually anyway lots of five to four votes\nWhere the five justice conservative majority firmly entrenched a court that is far more conservative that ... than any we have seen in this country for\nI Would say probably three quarters of the sense of a century how fast that happens well that remains to be seen\nJust a couple of seconds left but if this vote goes as expected this weekend how quickly would you expect him to be seated I Would expect him to be seated probably Tuesday Morning [noise] wow NPR's Nina Totenberg thanks as always thank you [noise]\n\n\nYou're listening

like to show their support for the reason I made by sending the message that there is a deal possible that they are confident that the EU and the u._k. will find some common ground\nTo agree on the terms of the divorce bill so I think that's the main reason why they are saying this now are basically to support the result mantra showed the Brits as well\nThat the EU is very wedding to strike a deal with the United kingdom\nBut certainly in the remarks made by John ... he seemed to basically just saying that that was movement that the two sides are moving closer together yes absolutely\nUm apparently in the last couple of days there have been some progress it's hard to see what the program would be because the\nMost difficult issue in the negotiations between Europe and the u._k. is of course the Irish border what's going to happen with Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic off the Brexit that is completely unclear um it seems to me really unlikely that there is now some kind of\nAgreement up on what can happen on that border since it is so complicated\nGoing back to your first on said do you feel that there is a view in Brussels that to raise a mate needs more support a given the divisions within a governing conservative party\nYes I think indeed that in Europe people were very surprised by\nThe complicated situation British politics is in that right now Brussels proposed to negotiate with the reason I made because\nI think their argument is that it's better to do with the devil you know than the devil you don't know imagine just that the Tory would have a new data and a couple of weeks from now that that would even be early elections in the United kingdom will\nVery uncertain factors that will make a deal formal harder to agree upon so I think Brussels we'd like to show threes I made that she can get a deal with the European Union and it's also a way of saying that even in British politics some stability is required to to get to a deal\nBut the recovery will show was expressing the view that I'm no deal wasn't the kind of outcome to the European Union were looking for is that believe is that plausible\nYes I think it will be very hard to find anyone in Brussels who played for a no deal it is in the interest of the European Union also in Britain's interests to have\nA comprehensive deal before the end of this year because the relations between the u._k. and you you will be there forever it's not that the u._k. simply disappears from the European continent that's not how it goes of course trade\nIs very intense and will stay very intense there are many corporations between the U. Penn U. and is really nobody interest to\nHave a no deal because it will be very bad for the two buttons and of course a no deal means also a lot of uncertainty\nJealous decorative very serious just

seven typical for him to\nPasadena dot edu\nThis is politics shell from NPR's there are four weeks ago before the midterm\nElection but we're not\nHe can just win baby there are four hundred thirty five house and thirty five Senate seats on the line\nEvery weekend leading up to the mid term we are here to guide you through what could move to vote this November\nI'm Scott Detrow this week the most divisive Supreme Court nomination in a generation heads who the size of ... what does that whole Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation battle have on the mid term\nAnd with President Trump saying men are being falsely accused across the country was having a backlash from conservative men help Republicans draw even with Democrats in key desperate [noise] was a look at how the midterm results could change immigration [noise]\nAll of that and more lived on the NPR News in Washington I'm Janine hurts judge Brett Kavanaugh has been confirmed to the Supreme Court NPR's Brian Naylor reports the Senate voted fifty two forty eight largely along party lines in favor of Kevin uh\nYou listen to the speech forty plus minutes point by point a sales pitch for Brett Kavanaugh in terms of his background his judicial philosophy\nJudge Kavanaugh has receive rave reviews for his twelve year track record as a judge including for his judicial temp for\nA really discounting Christine Blasey Ford another accusation stuff\nFor when and said she name could not corroborate any of the events of that evening gathering where she says the U.S all of her\nEven though calling said that he wasn't trying to do that and she spoke in support of me too hard to listen to the speech and think that Susan Collins really ever was undecided\nHard to disagree with you on that though I'm told she was talking to constituents and uh you know she was really was really mulling this over over the past several weeks and she went out of her way to say how many times she had met with him how many hours she had spent talking to people about this\nI think the first part of her speech was a little bit of selling how hard it was for her to make the decision and then she transitioned to a closing argument for cabinet as\nNot the partisan he was made out to be and I think that that was the vast majority of what her speech was was explaining that he in her mind was not the partisan that Democrats have said he is\nAt the beginning of her speech after she was shouted down by some protesters who had to be removed from the Senate gallery she went on to say that she was disappointed that this wasn't a solemn and consideration of the Supreme Court nominee but it got her level political campaign\nAnd from there it was pretty clear from the start that she was building up her reasoning for voting yes\nIf you're just joining us You're listening to the politics show from NPR's Scott Detrow talking to ice and Roscoe Kelsey Snell and Tim Mak\nTim Ayesha what did you get out of the speech\nA couple of things jumped out to me firstly she she said she was really persuaded to support Kavanaugh actually after some of the allegations that were brought forward by Julie sweat neck and her lawyer Michael ... she said that those claims were outrageous and could not be corroborated\nShe also seemed almost put some salt in the wound of folks would hope that she would oppose Kevin all by saying the Kavanaugh actually you know voted a lot with Merrick Garland you remember America Arlen be\nAn Obama nominee who never got a hearing in the Senate um those two things really jumped out at me and actually the whole speech if you read eighty\nAnd I ... percent of it on its own you could almost imagine Mitch McConnell delivering a speech like that either\nTo me it was how long the speech was how and that's it was it didn't seem like this was like oh well I guess I'll vote yes but it's I'm very reluctant this was a full throated endorsement of him and when you talk about the way that she talked about a Christine Blasey Ford yeah uh\nShe said that she believed that something happened to her but nevertheless she felt like it hadn't been corroborated ... and so it it was a way that I think that she was trying to thread the needle to say that we believe women they should be heard but\nShe's still raise questions on it well let's step back and talk about what we think that could mean from the mid term because you're right Collins says me to Israel it matters is long overdue but then she poked so many holes and what Ford said\nAnd says it's not a criminal trial but there's a there's basic fairness and and if you if you want to take allegations seriously they should at least meet a threshold of more likely than not indicating\nForge testimony was on the or not side well\nI think this kind of lands on something that I've been hearing from Republicans for several days and we haven't heard Jeff Flake kind of articulate this a little bit as he was doing his tour of bipartisanship with Chris Coons of Delaware let ... earlier this week\nThe fact of the matter is these Republicans are saying that they are conservatives that the judicial philosophy and the you know the entire background of cabinet sits with their political beliefs so there's that one bucket of this conversation but\nThen there's something separate happening here that is not specifically political that has to do with me too movement with the allegations\nOf sexual assault and sexual misconduct and they had to find a way to separate the two and make a vote about their political beliefs because at the end of the day they think their political beliefs or what is going to carry them through future elections\nSomething really remarkable here is that Kavanaugh's nomination came almost one near to the day from those initial articles about Harvey Weinstein that really kicked off the me too movement and the the big question that I have is is is what's the lasting impact of this last week\nThis day long gut wrenching testimony now and and Christine\nBlasey Ford said that she was reluctant to come forward because she was worried it wouldn't matter in the end and now Brett Kavanaugh still goes to the Supreme Court anyway so what does that do what does that do for for women all across the country who are go through that who maybe had a similar experience in her life\nAnd and have a seeing this is the combination of a year long national conversation about how we take allegations seriously or not\nI don't think that it ends here at all I don't think that it can and I think some people who support of Kavanaugh kind of\nHave kind of ... colon seem to argue he'll get on the court and everyone will kind of come together and everything will be better and I just I I don't think that we see any evidence of that I think that the divisions in this country seems to be real and seem to be hardening not\nYou know I I don't see him getting confirmed in all of these people who have been so passionate who've been protesting who've been talking about uh the sexual assaults that they've been through I don't see that just fading away it seems like it would make people even more passionate\nIf we're talking about the energy that might come off of this event you can already feel it immediately after Joe Manchin a announced Hughes support for Brett Kavanaugh went outside in was confronted by a number of demonstrators who shouted him down as he tried to explain as\nThough they're not\nIn our cars so Kelsey\nYou and I cover Congress this is just been such a weird process I mean it started off thinking wow this is going to be this ethic clash over the key swing vote then it became over the summer it seems like kind of dug in terms of political interest in a done deal\nAnd then we spent the last month watching this visceral personal fight play out on national television and radio I mean what do you think you're going to take away from all\nThis I Am going to be really watching the way senators recover from this if they recover from this\nBecause it's very likely that they're going to leave town fairly shortly here to go finish campaigning for the midterms which is the only let's gosh just a little bit more than a month away and once they leave they're going to go back into an even more partisan environment where they're running for reelection or supporting other people running for reelection\nAnd then they have to come back here and keep the government open and have a fight about President Trump's demand for a wall on the border with Mexico\nAnd I'm just going to be watching to see if the Senate is just a different place now are they able to recover from fighting so bitterly and are they able to cut deals that are necessary to do the basics of governing or does this continued to be just a toxic political environment\nYeah and and for me it's it's all of that plus what's the effect on the Supreme Court several senators and they're closing speech has pointed out that there's more institutional trust him the Supreme Court than any other institution and all of that's fading fast as well so\nIf we're finally formally viewing Supreme Court of justice partisan and tribal as everything else where does that leave us\nYeah that's a really good question and I think that the only way we're going to find the answer is just to wait\nThat was NPR's Kelsey Snell Ayesha Rascoe and Tim Mak thanks everybody thanks glad to be here Thanks This is the politics shell from NPR I'm Scott Detrow it's time now for race of the week\nThis against these people holler or need your help we will never know why and if we by the way but [noise] we [noise]\nEvery week we focus on one race in the country that speaks to a larger theme laying out and races all across the country and this week we're looking at the Florida Senate ran off my ... with us as well as the ... and diminished go\nWalk us through what race we're talking about so we're looking at the Florida Senate race here where it's Democrat Bill Nelson who's a three term democratic senator and a former representative you've been there a long time and he's trying to hang onto his seat he's running against Rick Scott who's term limited as governor and served two terms in Florida\n... what have you been seeing in terms of both poles and and what you saw reporting there this week\nIt's just a race is really tight I think it's largely because of the opponent that Bill Nelson the singing and Rick Scott\nAnd I had multiple Democrats tell me\nYou know look I don't like Rick Scott I'm not going to vote for him but this is the guy is running a masterful campaign in terms of just being visible and specifically being very attentive early on in the Latino community I met a woman carrying gas wise I actually had met her before\nDuring the twenty sixteen campaign she adamantly doesn't like Trump he told me hell no she's not voting for the Republican candidate for governor\nBut you know she she sort of has had this\nLittle bit of an evolution on Rick Scott here's what she told me about him initially\nLet me be very honest with you at risk up in the beginning that his government for the election\nKind of a shame that that he is an extremely qualified judge and has been not given a fair shot and I think that's also what we're we're seeing and he and he's the only one\nAnd you look at like Erick Erickson who was one of those never Trump or conservative bloggers you look at his Twitter account now he is leading the fight when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh\nSaid we're also seeing this set of coalescing amongst conservative men who may have had questions about President Trump himself but the stewardess appointment has really galvanize them\nThe medical row talk for a moment [laughter]\n[laughter]\nYou and I have been in can be part of all male conversations in a way that oftentimes can't I mean is there something I think there is something to an undercover current feeling whether it's a grievance or not whether it's something that motivates a vote or not that amid this increased focus on\nOn accusations of sexual assault of sexual harassment that a lot of men do feel if not under siege than certainly uncomfortable and certainly reevaluating lots of things they dumped throughout their life that can be a positive thing and it can be a negative thing well\nListen I mean I think Tim hit on the point that this is not just a grievance about immigration or a host of other issues this is also a grievance about how white men have felt that they feel like that they're guilty before proven innocent now\nThat this is part of the backlash to the me too movement where I you know and I think a lot of women who I'd been talking to on the campaign trail strategist as well who felt like there was going to be a backlash that there was going to be something that came\nAfter the me too movement with men somehow being riled up for some of that\nAnd if you're just joining us You're listening to the politics show from NPR I'm Scott Detrow with medical Martin are awesome holiday in camera Keith and let's just look at the Judiciary Committee because for all of the similarities between Nineteen Ninety One and what happened the other week and there were a startling amount I think I'm\nThe Republican side continue to be all white men but on the Democratic side yard ... Mazie Hirono and the ranking the ranking member on the Democratic side Dianne Feinstein so you have seen a lot more diversity on the Democratic side at least but ... when it comes to gender when it comes to race when it comes to so many different things one\nGroup gaining power means another girl losing power and and there is a real backlash I think that's\nHow politics has often been seen the right is this sort of\nZero sum game like if one group gains another group is largely going to be disadvantaged and we've seen this time and again when it comes to issues around affirmative action right or immigration and indifferent sort of minority politics mission issues and we are seeing this now I I Would argue to some degree with conversations around\nGender I'm ... and again I think this is something that President Trump\nA very you could argue acutely very smartly politically smartly tapped into during the twenty sixteen election because it really galvanized people I mean I remember meeting a guy right actually the summer\nWho was a huge Donald Trump supporter hadn't always voted Republican and instantly he started going into this frustration he had about safe spaces and how he feels like safe space and says it's silly idea\nYou know he he ... he's a welder he gets burned all day he has cut why do people need safe spaces and and this kind of talk I think gets that the frustration that some people have which is that like\nWhy do you need to be so politically correct and I know that we've talked a lot about what exactly political correctness means but it's the frustration that they cannot say or behave the way that they had always said things are behaved\nAbout one place where uh you can basically say whatever your feeling is conservative talk radio um and I've been listening to a lot of it recently and there is that very strong feeling of\nVictimization that men that white men are the victims in this um and you know Rush Limbaugh has been talking about so called send the Nazis for you know a generation almost two great commercial success\nBut he is doing it again in light of the cabinet hearing and in some ways this has is reflecting a viewpoint that is very much out there it's not a sub current it's a it's a full on its occurred\nWere so out of balance here women activists seminars the women can demand all kinds of investigations into them men cannot require or demand investigations and the women\nEven though we're talking a lot about the enthusiasm that we're seeing among men head of the midterms\nI I think we have to sort of put that in perspective which is that the enthusiasm we are seeing among women it's somewhat unprecedented I mean I have not sort of heard or seen this level of enthusiasm for women and women are telling me you know they have\nNever done anything beyond vote before an in an election and now they're knocking on doors they're ... they're protesting they're going to march is I mean there's an extreme level of engagement among women and so even though we're talking about what's happening\nI'm On the other side of the spectrum I think that it's it's not happening in a vacuum rate it's also happening in contract and maybe you could argue because of some of the enthusiasm are seeing from within\nAnd when we're talking about women here we're talking about democratic women\nAnd I mean that's an interesting point because there are a lot of Republican women frankly who are leading the charge on saying that they feel like their husbands or their sons are somehow being treated unfairly\nThis time and twenty sixteen we were talking about will you see this big shift of women voters to Hillary Clinton in response to President Trump's various scandals and statements and the answer was a pretty resounding no\nAnd it's true now too when we look at the polling that has not moved Republican women at all ...\nYou may go midterms are base elections typically and\nUntil recently one base was really super energize now both ... seem to be really super energize\nI guess one question is is this going to be a a super ... on steroids base election and and the other question is does this fate is this like a boom of enthusiasm\nThat you know if Republicans are the victors in this fight then maybe they fade out\nYou know look to us from his point about the fact that women are fired up women have been fired up this entire time right I mean since President Trump was elected women have been fired up and their levels were already polling very high so what this issue was able to do is\nEven though democratic enthusiasm ... ticked up slightly since the summer it had a lot more room to grow for Republicans and Republicans have really struggled to find a single issue that would fire up the base and this one seems to have done so and they were kind of surprised by that\nIt does look like at least the bet that Republicans are making is that this will be obese election because when you look at the enthusiasm numbers for Latino for young people for independence groups that right now are leaning towards Democrats energy core constituency democratic groups for this election\nThose are much lower and if that's the case than we are headed for kind of a train crash of a of a culture war in at the ballot box in November of base election\nSo we're about a month to election day right\nIt's a very short amount of time but in the modern\nNew cycle that we live in a month is an eternity like five years with Kevin ... on his way to the Supreme Court do we think that that that may be Republican voters aren't so riled up because they got their guided gotten two Supreme Court justices that's a reason why a lot of Republicans voted for Donald Trump to begin with\nAnd they kind of fade away again or do we think that has staying power\nMaybe if you're talking about psychology um the emotion of anger and fear is much stronger than the emotion of happiness you are less likely to remember the things that you're happy about the things that you are bitter about that said\nWe just don't know whether this is you know the python eats the rabbit and it moves through quickly and it's this big moment [laughter]\nOf energy among Republicans and then it goes well or whether this is you know the python is now a bunch of liquor python and\nAnger as ... as a motivating factor as much stronger in the moment than it is among them\nThat's political editor Domenico Montanaro White House correspondent Tamara Keith and political correspondent Asma Khalid thanks everybody You're welcome Iraq [noise]\n\nIs politics shell from NPR I'm Scott Detrow it feels like every week there's always one major story that dominates the news so each week we take a few minutes to talk\nSome of the stories you might have missed him to do that we always have Ron Elving Iran good to be with you it's got some of the things we're going to talk about what had been big deals and other weeks but this week just no room for anything but Brett Kavanaugh so let's start with this in the middle of all of this partisanship and toxicity in the capital they actually got a lot done\nThat's right the Congress passed an\nAuthorization bill for the Federal Aviation administration for the first time since twenty twelve he's got a lot of money in it to run that agency and all of its functions but we'll concerned consumers most is the focus on passenger complaints for example cramped seats the width of the seats and the leg room\nFAA now has authority to set a minimum amount
