I'm ... beer after making landfall along the Florida Panhandle this afternoon with a hundred and fifty five mile per hour wind gusts National Hurricane center says hurricane Michael's I has now cross into south western Georgia\nWe're seeing a change I think in in sea surface temperature we're seeing\nStronger storms because the sea surface temperature of the ocean water is so much warmer we just don't quite have the knowledge available to us and the equations available to us to predict exactly when and how it's going to intensify and we need a lot more research to understand exactly when that will happen\nAnd so just described to me what was going through your mind last night as you're watching this and it's doing something different than you were expecting given a couple of days ago\nYou know in the back of your mind you're always thinking that this is something that could happen and it's something that the storms can do especially when they have the perfect conditions the warm water of the Gulf of Mexico it's perfect for storms like Michael\nLast night it happened and we all were kind of you know looking at each other like yep there does and and\nWhen they say when it happened you're mean what you're watching wind speeds that are higher than you expected or\nYes as the storm starts to rapidly intensify it takes on this this buzz saw like shape it becomes very well defined you have the sinking feeling that things are about to get much worse than than the forecast had suggested\nTo my central question of why predicting intensity so challenging you're citing factors such as warmer water's warmer ocean waters but we all know that's the case we all know what's happening so is one step here just to start predicting hurricanes are going to be more intense than they were a generation ago\nI mean that is when one step another step is that we need better research and we need more time and effort and and manpower to be able to look at the dynamics of the hurricane to really sit down and peace everything together any\nLast minute for cash you want to give us for how this week will play out with hurricane Michael\n[noise] it's going to have a devastating impact on the coast and well inland hurricane conditions will you know expand well inland into Tallahassee and even parts of Alabama and Georgia\nAnd then rainfall strong winds up into the Carolinas and it will

you with us\nThank you um we have a lot of debris down we picked up about thirty five percent what\nWe're trying to do right now is just stabilize the debris that we have not take that so that in the event of a twenty to forty miles per hour when that this uh debris material will stay put not scattered\nBut let me let me back you up because when we talk to you not quite four weeks ago with Florence you hum had asked people to evacuate\nYou actually were telling us about firefighters out on fire trucks telling people to leave get somewhere safe how about this time are you looking to evacuate or telling people to stay safe stay put\nWorld stand by we have an emergency operations center that we have not activated we have forty one truck taken up debris as quickly as we can we have nine cities and towns across the state that are helping us for that effort we just uh you\nKnow we're all in prayer for our friends down in Florida Georgia South Carolina with that this thing will not be anything like the impact we had four times was a storm surge in this appears to be more of a of a high when\nThere is any live weekend by the time it hits it hits you we hope it when you say you've got people out picking up debris you're talking about to brief still left from Hurricane Florence are you talking about stuff that does come down newly since then with went\nWell what kind of like in phases we uh\nThe initial debris from the shock of of what happened and and now folks are are getting in getting as life out from underneath their home yeah they're finding out that their heat pumps and ate the existence of compromise that duct work and so uh you know sheet rock and\nAnd all the components of the home or you know we just uh after careful inspection by are expected department as many as ... as we found\nThat there's a lot more detailed what has to be done them than what we initially thought\nYou've still got a lot of buildings their houses businesses et cetera with with tarps fervor after Hurricane Florence is that right\nWhat we still have seven hundred homes of twenty two thousand that we cannot re power because the electric components were were compromised during the storm of that and we're works\nAnd as far as we can with the owners to get licensed contractors electrical contractors to come in and correct there's problems that we can re power the home\nAnd then I was reading some schools are had reopened the rest of the craving county schools that had been shot since Hurricane Florence we're set to reopen this week did that\nUh some of them did some of them still are not\nAre not opening um we we had we had five different shelters with twelve hundred citizens and now that sounds about a hundred at our Web newborn rec center a we have two large rec centers and they were one of them a heads feet of water in it so we're we're just everywhere\nYou look from power being down all all twenty two thousand customers that power down uh we're we're continuing to to put our city back together\nThis must just feel like adding insult to injury to have another big storm headed your way\nOh yeah but you know you look at thirty percent of the population the United states lives within fifty miles because they love it we love it\nIs the quality of life that that doesn't get any better and you know we just really like America enough for what they've been doing for us and we in turn are working with our sister towns and cities around New Bern Jones county ... county right to try to help them get back together\nWill mayor Dana outlaw of New Bern in North Carolina we wish you good luck and stay safe thanks for much huh\n[noise]\nStocks plunged on Wall street today us stocks on their biggest sell off in six months the Dow fell eight hundred thirty one points which is a three percent decline here to talk about exactly what happened is NPR's John Ydstie hey John I also so what made the market plummeted eh\nYeah I was a tough day a and a number of things contributed let's start with interest rage rage on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks\nThat's made the market nervous and in fact this is the fifth straight day of losses for the S. and P. five hundred\nA rising interest rates make stocks less valuable and there's concern in the market about just how high rates will go the Federal Reserve has said it will continue to raise rates gradually and it has suggested it was stop praising benchmark rate between three and three and a half percent so it still has a way to go to get there\nSo the way I understand it the fed usually raises rates to stave off inflation right right or their ears and inflation right now well\nSo I asked and like you know what's going on these you know I was gay and he's saying it's by my son's bothering me\nHis wife Karen couldn't convince ready to go to a doctor until the symptoms got out of control\nHe was rushed to the emergency room closest to his son's house half hour from Nashville\nAnd they just started putting in terms of lines are going to work and doing different things and kind of ... what was happening in at that point because imagine the shock when you go in there and they're like oh every Oregon and shutting down and have completely sepsis ... as a\nLeading cause of death in hospitals it's the bodies overwhelming reaction to an infection ... case was so bad the forty nine year old man ended up on a respirator and dialysis drugs sunk him into a state of quiet leery him\nBecause he was supposed to be lightly sedated and he was heavily sedated and that was not a good thing\nKaren says when the hospital told her to start calling next of kin and it was time to get them transferred stat to hospital better equipped to treat him within twenty four hours of arriving at Vanderbilt Randy's condition had turned around completely he was off dialysis the ventilator in off the drugs that put him into a delirious have\nApparently I'm pretty much of a miracle he said that you were on one out of a recovery still lies ahead started me get our faculties about me and my brains starting to work really good again but\nJust the fact that I can you know carry a conversation right now is pretty amazing in itself and you've actually been up and walking around a little bit of a lot done labs around the size of a aids for anyway I mean I'm not going to do I mean that drink too much but yeah walked quite a bit\nDr ... returns to the room and explains to the ... family what he'd done to help bring about this dramatic change it wasn't just good medical attention it was a philosophy\nYou know when you get on an airplane you get safely to the next location because airline industry has a checklist\nWhen he started in the ICU he realized every doctor did things differently and they figured they can't all be doing the right thing so gradually started building a checklist of the best way to handle basic tasks first they figured out when it's safe to take someone off the ventilator he explains then\nWe started standardizing how to remove people off of ... then we came up with a way to measure of your brain was deliberate should not what'd you got that measurement and we were doing this to you when you were there we were measuring whether you were delirious and you were at the beginning\nElite came up with a list of six steps to take in order to reduce delivery him in return patients to health as quickly as possible\nTo put all of this into a bundle which we now call the a B C D E F bundle\nThat bundle includes close management of drugs like sedatives which can cause the leery of\nPatients are tested daily to see if they can wake up and if they're ready to get off the ventilator F is for family engagement us as these all reduce the amount of time patients spend delirious and that in turn markedly reduces the risk of long term brain damage\nGetting out of bed early that part is cuts to him and a half so these things are all intersecting as\nHe sits on a ... bed ... explains that it's a big change from what many are you still do which is to knock out a patient and treat their dysfunctional body rather than focusing on them holistically\nTo me the lynchpin of this whole thing is to respect the humanness of each patient thank you again they hear\nThe bundle when done correctly reduces the risk of ICU triggered to ... by twenty five to thirty percent easily says that makes a big difference to a lot of patients it's gradually been adopted it icy use in recent years but he says it's still not the standard everywhere\nAbout half from our last survey had been doing some elements of the bundle\nPulling it altogether a to F is a challenge Dr Kirk Volcker at the Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Florida discovered that when he took part in nationwide study to expand the use of the bundle in all sorts of hospital it\nWas not as easy as we expected it to be in a couple of aspects patients\nRequire more time and attention if they're alert in bed or walking up and down the hallways with their respirators into\nWe're talking about a a cultural change so we have to buy in from the nursing staff once we were able to get that by an event you have to have buy in from the physicians also\nThat's harder in a community hospital where physicians are more independent and the only two rounds three days a week gradually the ideas took hold he says though they're still resistance to using the a through F checklist to mix\nEvery element is it tended to every day in every patient\nI think in concept it's the rule but actually going through and seeing a B C D E F is the exception it was even a challenge to make it routine\nAt Vanderbilt like a ... and I can't be Joanna starlings or clinical pharmacists to the ICU says when she arrived at Vanderbilt it was clear what needed to get done but nobody was responsible for seeing it through\nThat needs to many cat\nWere nice to be here every single day in San ... helped me had champion this project really empower the interstates Macri there that makes it happening every day\nWith him at least crusade now is to make what this hospital does standard around the world for one thing he argues it can actually save money by reducing the amount of time people spend an expensive ICU words\nBut the most important thing of course is not the money is the human being and so if they're getting better care surviving more often with a more intact brain and not bouncing back to the ice you see some financial benefits to me that's a win

A. B. E. ended land a hurricane Michael had Georgia harder than officials originally anticipated\nGets paid interests for it OK so tell me how that works like what would happen if there is a catastrophe like a hurricane or some out of control wildfire or an earthquake well\nIf there is a serious natural disaster then the buyer of the bond has to foot the bill for some part of the damage so if you buy one of these bonds you're sort of gambling that there won't be a bad hurricane season this year because\nThere is you could take a loss for example right now about Fifteen billion dollars worth of catastrophe bonds have some exposure in Florida where hurricane Michael has had\nWhich investors are buying bonds well mostly big institutional investors hedge funds a mutual funds may be your own pension fund they like to include them because they're a good way to diversify risk and what I mean is\nIf the economy slows you typically see a lot of different assets like stocks and real estate and so on\nLosing value at the same time but the value of catastrophe bonds isn't tied to the economy it's tied to\nYou know Mother Nature so when everything else is losing ground you can still make it was oh I see their way of hedging risk which investors like really popular these these catastrophe bonds or cat bonds pretty popular there's about thirty billion dollars invested in them right now overall\nAnd the reason has to do with their ... they typically earn an investor at least five percent and sometimes a lot more than that and that's because they're potentially so much riskier than other kinds of bonds\nSo anyone investing in them is going to want to be\nPaid more there are some pretty major storms just in recent memory last summer there were three in a row we at Harvey which\nFlooded Houston for days then we had Irma and Maria and just last month Hurricane Florence land into the Carolinas I mean one after another have investors lost a ton of money on their cat bonds because of these storms\nYeah last year was west particularly challenging for for the bonds and there was a lot of speculation that would kill off the market there was this fear you know investors would see these big losses and nobody would ever want to buy a catastrophe bond again but the market has has come back pretty well\nSo as we're seeing more catastrophic storms are are ... just going to become a riskier investment\nAnd that's always going to be a potential problem the more big storms you have sort of less attractive these bonds are yeah\nIm but there is another issue I think that is even more of an immediate problem over the past decade interest rates on things like treasury bonds have been very low so investors have turned to these catastrophe bonds because\nYou know they could are much higher interest rates on them well now interest rates in general are rising so relatively speaking catastrophe bonds aren't as attractive as an investment as they were and that's\nThat's bound to weaken demand for them\nInteresting lesson consequences of all these storms that NPR's Jim Zarroli in New York Thank you Jim You're welcome and we'll be following developments

hurricane Michael would come their way into the government open to the emergency management center stores and government offices are closed today people were encouraged to stay home\nAs it turned out there wasn't much of a storm here today which is good because this city is still far from normal tissues flourishes his delegation of Puerto Rican volunteers knows well how long hurricane recovery can

Hill out the sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh\n\nAfter that confrontation flick insisted on an FBI investigation prompting some to praise the moment as evidence that protest works of protests continued here's this past Saturday [noise]\nPeople\nRushing the doors at the Supreme Court as Kavanaugh was sworn in but what some see as constructive protest others including the president called a mob\nYou don't hand matches doing our citizens and you don't give our do an angry left wing mob and that's what they\nWere the speaking at a rally in Kansas shortly after Kavanaugh was confirmed well he is not the only Republican talking about mobs using that word\nPrompting us to wonder whether a new Republican strategy might be taking shape right before the midterms a Whit Ayres is a pollster who has advised Republicans for years welcome back to the program Mr airs good to be here\nSo we just heard the president they're talking about a left wing mob a Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has called the protesters a mob Senator Marco Rubio has been tweeting he treated over the weekend saying imagine what the cable news coverage would have looked like if an angry mob of conservatives had stormed the steps of the Supreme Court so\nWhat do we think is going on here [noise]\nThe Kavanaugh a confirmation battle United the center right coalition unlike any event during the Trump presidency other than the Gorsuch nomination and part of the reason for that or the loud protests so the tactics or the left ultimately undermine their cause\nJust take a step back with me for a minute we all talk about the lack of civility in Washington these days or a direct question but does calling ones political opponents a mob\nHow\nI figured is symptomatic of the politics of our\nAge [noise] is it the president's responsibility leading the entire country to try to rise above the politics of our age even for weeks out from the mid term is to find some way to try to bring Americans together and not divide\n[noise] Mary Louise there is no way I can answer that question [laughter] why not without getting myself in trouble [noise]\nLet me put it this way there are practical consequences of hardening battle lines and wild no parties blameless in Washington these days it makes it harder and harder to cross party lines and actually get anything done\nYes it does\nAnd in order to actually get something done\nWe're going to have to have people like our clients and the Senator Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham and Lamar Alexander and John Kennedy who will reach across the aisle and form bipartisan coalitions and these are all clients of ours is our clients have done repeatedly and will continue to do\nYou mentioned Lindsey Graham is one of your clients yes he had quite the turning the Kavanaugh hearing where he came out that about as angry as I've ever seen him know me too yeah how do we square that with the politics of getting reelected the politics of doing the right thing in terms of the country\nI don't think it's any more complicated than the Kavanaugh hearings bringing out in tents emotions\nOn whole sucks [noise] and I guess the circles us back to my original question of have the Kavanaugh hearings coalesced into a different strategy as Republicans look at these last four weeks for Americans go to vote\nNo adult tickets coalesced into a different strategy what it is done is unite the various parts of the Republican center right coalition in a way they were not United\nBefore what airs thank you so much it's my

lot these last few days Jamal ... he used the Saudi journalist who walked into the shouting consulate in Istanbul last week\nAnd then disappeared was never seen walking up prompting reports that he was kidnapped\nOr maybe murdered by a hit squad flown in from Riyadh for that express purpose but who is or was Jamal ... and why would he have been seen as posing such a danger to the Saudi regime that's such an extraordinary operation would have been put in motion\nOr going to put those questions now to Shadi Hamid of the Brookings Institution welcome Hi thanks for having me God have you with us All right we know some basic facts ... age fifty nine\nA that he's an editor or that he's a critic of his government and Saudi Arabia [noise] what else should we know about him\nSo the interesting thing about him is that he wasn't always a dissident and he was actually a consummate insider with close connections to the Saudi royal court that's what makes this different this is someone who came from the inside and then decided that he could no longer support\nNew Saudi policies under a new leadership and he left Saudi Arabia in June twenty Seventeen\nHe went into exile he came to the yeah came to the U.S and started writing for the Washington Post what did he write that would have annoyed the Saudi regime so much\nSo one of his pieces that is getting a lot of attention now in retrospect he wrote in September twenty Seventeen where he basically announced his break\nWith Saudi Arabia is the factor leader Mohammed bin Salman also known as NBS the crown prince ... and he supported some of the general reforms that MBBS was trying to put forward including\nMore rights for women but he felt that Saudi Arabia was going to go through a transformation that the people had to be part of the conversation and the Saudi leadership and NBS in particular increasingly moved in a direction where\nThey didn't want any questioning of this new direction\nAnd ... he couldn't bring himself to agree with that and I think that he was pained\nTo have this break with the Saudi regime he didn't want it\nAs you look back over what he wrote what he did what he said over the last year or two was there a moment where it appeared he'd crossed a line on was starting to put himself into danger\nYou know I don't know if we can point to one moment but I think we can say that he had become\nThe most prominent Saudi dissident but more importantly the most prominent Saudi dissident in the west I mean the fact that he wrote regularly for the Washington Post the fact that he knew um many in the policy community in DC so I think he was the one person who could credibly and effectively\nI'm casting doubt on Mohammed bin Salman man's vision for Saudi Arabia at a time\nWhen Mohammed bin Salman manner NBS as he's called was really trying to portray himself as this young reformer and the young reformers in America should Hitchens wagon to this\nIs interesting because because a lot of journalists have written critically about Saudi Arabia and that the direction that Mohammed bin Salman is taking at what you're describing is why he might have been seen as a as a more of a danger than others but he had such a platform that he was so well connected\nIn Washington and and outside of Saudi Arabia\nAnd he's coming from within Saudi society he knows the major players and leaders in the Saudi royal court so it's different you know if I criticized Saudi Arabia for something that's one thing but if Jim Alka shove you did that\nThen it's different because he's speaking from within the family\nDoes it strike you as puzzling though I mean the reports are being source to Turkish officials Turkish investigators saying that this team of Fifteen people flew in on private planes with the express purpose of targeting the show gave that just seems like a massive operation to take out one editor\nIt sounds so crazy that it's hard to get your head around it that Saudi Arabia would go this far to allegedly killed one of their critics\nCan you imagine that this actually happened in the way that Turkish officials said\nYes I think it's the most um persuasive and plausible scenario right now I I think many people have been waiting for the Saudis to offer evidence to the contrary they haven't but not only that they've shown I think it's surprising level of indifference it's almost as if\nYou know their taunting the international community in a sense and if they really didn't do it then there's a way for them to demonstrate that but I think that the evidence is building and also sources from different intelligence agencies are moving in this direction it seems that this is the most plausible scenario\nShadi Hamid thinks so much for having me and my pleasure Shadi Hamid is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution we have been talking about Saudi journalist and dissident Jamal ... now ...\nDisappearance and possible murder is draining relations between
