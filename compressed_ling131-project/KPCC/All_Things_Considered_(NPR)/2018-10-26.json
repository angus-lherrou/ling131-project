a contrast with the Democrats Trump's self consciously turned down the temperature from his usual scorched earth rhetoric\nYou know what I'm trying to say that very nicely have voters [noise] do you normally on screen they was socialists take over that was once a socialistic over [noise] I'm trying to be nice\nBut nice is not a natural fit for this president even as he appealed for calm Trump

very big part of the anger we see in our society Kathleen Hall Jamieson who's an expert on political rhetoric at the Annenberg School for communication says Trump's brush with the conventional didn't last\nHe acted in that moment in a manner that is appropriate for the presidency unfortunately the rhetoric appeared to shift to beginning to play in the mainstream media\nCritics pointed out that Trump himself has a long history of demonizing opponents at at times even condoning violence but speaking to reporters this morning when spokeswoman Sarah Sanders rejected the idea that Trump's no holds barred approach to politics might contribute to a hostile climate and the country\nYou guys continue to focus only on the negative and there is a role to play yesterday the very first thing that

House\n...\n\nThe death of journalism ... has strained ties between the U.S in Saudi Arabia and its stirred up rivalries in the middle east between the Saudis the Iranians and the Turks\nTurkey has been strategic and dominating the narrative and earlier today NPR's Deb Amos told me that Turkey's president isn't just trying to gain an advantage over the Saudis\nHe also was playing his hand to improve relations with the U.S at its they've been terrible over the past year on a variety of issues um but you know ... ... is working with Washington on this particular event\nAnd the pressure comes at a time that the Saudis and the Turks are on different sides of this regional cleavage and it goes to this question about how majority Muslim countries are governed they favor Islamist activists for example the Muslim Brotherhood\nThe Saudis the UAE eat the Egyptians they hate those people are they put them in jail and so for for turkey ... it is good for them to see the Saudi leadership in some ways shaking their reputations question because it is good for turkey as a regional leader\nYou know in the U.S policymakers are so focused on the divide between Saudi Arabia and Iran um how has around played into this story if at all\nOh they've been very quiet hum and in the first two weeks had nothing I'm only in the past couple of days have we'd be done to see Iranian official speak up the first was the head of the judiciary a hardliner who said there's no way this murder could have taken place without protection from the west\nThan on Wednesday the Iranian President Rouhani also repeated that charge that you know it was under us protection that this happened how when the ... century could we have such a terrible murder\nThey see their position strengthened as Saudi Arabia is weak and they are on different sides in a number of conflicts in Yemen in Syria and Lebanon\nAnd they have not been forceful until now but they are moving into a position of criticizing the Saudi leadership and when I think about the Trump Administration\nUh and Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia was the answer to their conflict with Iran and the way right I mean the Saudis backed the president when he pulled out of the Obama era nuclear agreement with Iran on what does it mean for Washington's or on policy\nThat question has reportedly been part of the White House calculation as the whole story unfolds here is why Saudi Arabia is critical to the Trump plan to squeeze Iranian oil imports\nIf you take a rainy an oil imports off the market and that is exactly what the Trump Administration wants to do you could drive up oil prices gas prices in the United states if you don't find a way to fill that gap that's what Saudi will offer they are the only oil producer that has spare capacity\nAnd they have said that they will make up any deficit in a rainy and crude and keep oil prices steady\nNow so far or Saudis energy minister has said this is exactly what they're going to do they're going to open those caps\nAnd it struck him that that looked very much like a package she had seen on Tuesday a male and he was to scream or for Robert Deniro

alliance for lifetime income dot org [noise]\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Audie Cornish ten suspicious packages had been intercepted so far packages contain would appear to be explosive devices and were sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump\nThe FBI is saying it can't rule out that there may be more suspicious packages moving through the mail now and this story is put the U.S postal service in the spotlight joining us to talk about that is NPR's Miles parks he's been looking into postal service policies welcome to the city of miles either\nWe don't know anything yet about who delivered these packages of what's known so far but how that were delivered\nRight so the FBI and the federal investigation are for the postal service both declined to comment when I asked that exact question or earlier today but we can sort of piece it together based on what we know about where the packages were actually intercepted\nAt this point we know that at least seven to ten packages were handled by the postal service or the packages addressed for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama for instance we're flag and mail screening facilities by the secret service and two of the packages addressed a Joe Biden were also found in postal facilities in Delaware\nObviously that's important because us yes has screening procedures specifically in place to try to catch incidents and dangerous items like\nThis when it comes to nail entering the U.S postal system what are those screening procedures\nSo it's really different based on a number of different factors\nYou know the size of the package for instance or maybe most importantly is who that package is going to\nIf you want to send mail to the White House or to Capitol Hill or another major federal building for instance uh it's automatically going to go to a separate offsite screening facility to check for suspicious looking items so these suspicious items that we're talking about\nA period of ... up and sent using excessive stamps which is something experts say is one of the first kind of red flag items to look for during the screening process\nOr at the end of the day though the postal service does admit that they that because of the crazy volume that the that they deal with they can't screen every single item that enters the system so they have a system of best practices that they asked companies and even private citizens to use a when going through their own mail\nOn the reports are that these appear to be homemade pipe bombs it's not clear what kind of damage they could have caused can you give us some contacts like how um I guess random is this like how often are explosives mail\nYet it's maybe not as rare as one would expect they that the U.S postal service says it's about sixteen averages out to about sixteen bombs per year ah which which might seem like a lot\nBut if you consider in the context of more than a hundred and fifty billion pieces of mail get processed by the postal service every year\nI kind of puts it into perspective I specifically when it comes to investigations um\nThey open Nineteen investigations into a hazardous material that could be bombs that could be chemical weapons that were being I'm uh trying to be delivered it could even be hoax a bombs are hoax chemical weapons as well and they were able to gain\nA twenty convictions or in those investigations but mostly when it comes to the investigations were talking about a male staffed and mailing of narcotics or is a much higher percentage of what they're looking at\nOr they're going to be any policy changes as a result\nOr not at this point it it doesn't seem that way I'm obviously everyone involved in the postal service is going to be on much higher alert right now I talk with somebody else\nAmerican postal workers union who made an interesting point basically saying that we've been focused a lot about on the government officials\nThe media members in the case of CNN who seem to have been targeted by these packages but there's also postal workers who were put in danger who were carrying ... point a to point B were also in danger in these situations or if you remember back to two thousand one in the anthrax attacks\nThere were two postal workers who died back then um so there's no indication that any policies are going to be changed but we're definitely seeing how people on higher alert\nThat's NPR's Miles Parks thanks so much thank you [noise]\nTo another story now about methamphetamine which is making a comeback

that opioids took\nChange when you look back at the photos from say your first trip to a country like Afghanistan what differences\nWell first of all I wasn't as adept with the camera so I didn't understand how to read light and to anticipate shots the way I Do now\nYou know the photographing under the Taliban was illegal the only thing that was legal was photographing destruction so buildings any inanimate objects and so for me of course my purpose was to photograph life under the Taliban so exactly what was forbidden\nAnd so I went into women's hospitals a photograph women and labor photographed women at home you know all these things that I Wish that I just I'm\nDo how to work a situation more\nAnd that's just the wisdom of experience figuring out what worked and what didn't know how hard you can push against the boundary of what you're being told\nTo do exactly exactly and those are things that it's not only about photography it's about reading human beings and reading people and and understanding how to express the importance of you know this job\nWe'll talk more about how you think about that because you also capture women and incredibly candid more vulnerable moments women in childbirth\nWomen being treated for for severe self inflict burns um what's your advocate for for photographs like that do you always get their permission before you raise your camera\nAlways before I take any pictures I introduced myself\nI explain that I'm working for whatever publication it's four and not the images will be seen by a lot of people\nAnd they can be on social media that's something that I now have to talk about because it's not only for the publication out and that just spread\nVery quickly over social media so that's something that's very important for the subject to know because\nYou know there's Facebook and most of the countries I work in and I talk about why I'm doing these stories you know I don't just walk in there like I have the right to take their picture I talk about you know I think it's really important to see how women are suffering or how women are dying and childbirth and so that's the first thing I Do and a lot of women say no\nAnd that's totally the right to say now is that where you operate\nStandard among war photographers understanding there is no playbook that everybody gets this year but I'm curious you mail photographers take that much sensitivity in advance\nI've been told that it's rare that people work the way I work that they take the time to be very respectful and to ask people how they feel comfortable being photographed you know I also have to discuss nudity for example I was shooting maternal mortality recently in Somaliland\nAnd that's a very deeply conservative country in place then there are\nThe women you know they said okay if you photograph for example the baby coming out and I don't want my face or you have to cover or you know and they give me the rules and that's what I Do\nYou're making me think of a photograph that you took of a woman named AIPAC a this was she was raped during\nWar and South Sudan Iraq by the time you met her she was very pregnant yeah as a result of that rape you spent several hours photographing her in a dress and then you thought you know from trying to show her belly her pregnancy if that's a point here\nDo we do this without clothes um and you as you were photographing her showing her images on your camera correct to make sure she understood what it looked like\nYeah and I also before I even approached her with sort of what I envisioned I went to Kimberley who was the woman who had sort of rescue her and given her the safe house and said you know does this seem insensitive how do you feel about this is this\nSomething that would be rude to ask and she said no absolutely not let's take this to her and\nSee how she feels and so we went and sort of talk to her through it and before I even finished my son she had taken her dress off and it was like totally she completely understood\nAnd you know as a woman I haven't been raped but I I have been assaulted and Libya I was groped repeatedly and I made a decision to talk about that very openly because I think\nYou know as a survivor it's important to try and strip away the stigma and I think different women feel comfortable revealing different things about themselves and some people do and some people don't and that's one thing I've learned over the years\nAnd I think with Iraq it was something she wanted to do she wanted to show what had happened to her to sort of talk about it it\nWas part of her therapy and I think it's very important for me as a photographer to not make those rules for people and everyone has the right to decide how they want to portray himself you've talked in past\nAbout what a huge advantages if anything to be female and a lot of the places where you're trying to work because as we're hearing you have access to half of the population that are male photographer might not have access to what I loved and that kind of surprised me in this book as you also get great shots of American women there's a there's a photo born here\nOf a navy lieutenant in the nurse corps she's stationed in Helmand Province of an age as me okay she saluted the shots describe or you've caught her in the ladies\nAmy I mean this is after a very intense or I was on a medivac and that and um they would bring wounded soldiers out and Amy was a navy nurse and she was you know they're in the trauma hospital\nAnd so after a an intense night I sort of followed her back to the showers where the women go and I you know I was like I Want to just shoot what your life is like here and she was completely\nLike fun and open and\nGot it she's she's I should explain she's got shaving cream ... up are lagging shaving that made me I look at it and I'm thinking why would you bother to shave and hell no [laughter] after I can\nTell you why because as a woman who's worked in like a very male world and in war zones for Twenty years I Do everything I can still try and feel like a woman you know whether that means like sneaking eye liner on in the middle of Helmand or lipstick or\nPerfume I always carry perfume in my camera bag H its psychological because I have to sort of maintain some semblance of myself\nYou're right they're shaving in the in the next shower stall\nAnd that was the fun of photographing women in the military because it's like it was the first time that I actually had women to hang out west because for so many years and was just me or me

wider picture of this behavior\nThis offender didn't just wake up yesterday and decide that he was going to do this how do you know people that are being targeted because of their religion for example

John horn now let's return to my conversation with the creators of the immersive theatre project delusion their latest installment is called the blue blade unlike a haunted house or an escape room delusion is more like stepping into a movie\nThe sets shrouded in fog and elaborately decorated look real\nThe music and sound design followed the audience through each room at the plot unfolds\nWhen I visited the set last month production designer Kevin Williams and creative supervisor Victor Matthew guided me through the various sights and sounds of the production\nI first spoke with Williams about how he found his crew members\nFunny enough a lot of us work a all across the entertainment industry but a lot of our fabricate her ... year actors\nAs their primary trade and they moonlight by being fabric caters to kind of make ends meet really do yeah like if it's an example what are they building when they're not doing the auditions\nAh well these guys they they work a lot in a theme park construction they work a lot in like you know TV commercials and films and things like that but they build all kinds of things customers crops and just standard sets\nSo we're in a room a tiny room that feels like it's an office is decorated with some posters Japanese posters it looks like maybe some Russian artwork and the corner\nIs this actually found it is it's something that you designed this this\nIs a as we found it and uh as I said before uh my approach to design especially in these environmental circumstances as a\nTo really turn the liabilities into an asset so you take the things that might be difficult to overhaul or expensive to changing you say okay well let's look at this in a different way and a and own it and make it part of the show and a lot of times it works quite well\nOne of the things you have to work around as you're designing the show is the ability to put in whites putting sound and to have a way for whoever's kind of call in and directing the show to be able to watch it so how do you figure out how you incorporate all of those\nThings and hide them\nA that's a team effort really a John and Victor come through the space and that kind of coordinate on where the best location for a surveillance cameras as you know we do our best to hide them from time to time I\nThought yeah I see a whole new I'll read your camera three\nAnd eventually there will be a little camera up in there but um you know it's about safety so it's even if it's not the prettiest thing we make sure that our guests are safe and that's why they're there\nAnd we designed around it so what happens people can come in and either they don't want to play along they want to try to get the actors to break character or or worse they'll actually touch the actors in inappropriate ways ... what are the actors trained to do and those kinds of situations because people will be obnoxious and horrible\nRight and most of them are perhaps and are are empowered with the knowledge that they are in full control and if they need to stop the show at any point in time\nThere's a certain line that they will say and we're always listening are always watching were literally around the corner at any given moment so we can come in as a crew and shut it down and make sure whoever's misbehaving or anybody was hurt can be attended to\nIs it just a coincidence that your radio scientists zombies song is set to watch [noise] totally by did a quick uh last year\nSo we're going upstairs now boy this is a scary [noise] it's just like an old steam room or bathroom what the heck is this saying\nAnything to do I'm going to just go in this room\n[noise] shower with really low ceiling [noise] personal ticket window\nOf affects something that you guys have built [noise] ah this this room looked very address already let's see what's in here [noise]\nTook this looks like we are bad things happened this looks like\nA couple of cops in a room that could have been [noise]\nFeels like almost a hidden room this could be like where and frankly I mean this is in some ways really terrifying said [noise]\nDo you want people to actually trigger memories and they get into rooms like this way out so I mean that's that's the whole point of these experiences is to tap into a motion so if you're not touched either in a dark way or in of a fun way than what's the point right you just spend the money [noise]\nMy name's Victor Matthew and decrease supervisor and ... and director of the show so tell us a little\nBit about sound design and music and how that plays into the experience what are you looking for and what are your basic\nPrinciples for this story shirt so everything in terms of stunt wiser action wise is cute through sounds a design so a lot of cues are for actors to move over to afford to\nPlay or do you have to keep the blame moving as this automated by sound design that we've picked up beforehand but John ...\nThat's how the show because life it's visual rights so everything that's done brushing design team and and or anyone else and then it's also auditory so the music and it sounds like\nWhat is the sound design equivalent of a jump scare where in films like a cat comes flying through the frame and everybody always kind of jumped up to try to do that with your son is on or do you want to be a little more subtle than that\nI think that's a lot of junk scares in life interactive shows are usually done in haunted houses\nAnd delusion tries to um stand out from haunted houses and said it's moving play right which is very different\nNow jumped scares they happened back in delusion sometimes I think but it's I don't think that week um plan does with the score the sound much I think for us it's more about um the wow factor of things that you really didn't expect that are unfolding fried rice\nLike somebody flying through the air those are the thing or a fireplace coming to life or you know things like that so many popping out of a cough and I
