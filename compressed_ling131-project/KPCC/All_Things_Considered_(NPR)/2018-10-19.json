in the Arab world they are so subjective false narratives and these conspiracy theories\nYou know he did talk about that it's really telling he described the effect of the state run narratives and he calls you know people victims of the majority of the population believe it but I think there's something bigger going on here there's this is about the way Saudis especially young Saudis see the crown

both parties are doing to gain an edge in this final stretch before the midterms Hi Mara Hi there Hi so start with the issues there's all kinds of things that could be weighing on voters' minds these last three weeks of the the Kavanaugh hearings the\nPresident's a campaign rallies constant campaign rallies developments at the border a crisis with Saudi Arabia\nCan we say whether any of those seem to be shifting the playing\nField they are not there might have been a kind of cabinet bump but the most important thing to remember about these last two weeks and the election is that the fundamentals haven't changed much at all to house still looks pretty good for Democrats not sure if it's good enough for them to get the net twenty three\nPick up seats that they need which they said they need Senate\nMap looks excellent for Republicans that always has that's because there are a lot of Senate Democratic incumbents in very red states where Donald Trump is very popular\nWe know the Democrats are more energized this year Republicans are becoming more energized as they always do in October we're also seeing signs that they we might have a very high turnout midterm election which is pretty rare\nUh people are self reporting a lot of enthusiasm about voting we've seen record turnouts in primaries in special elections and what's the closing argument that both parties are settling on\nWell the closing argument from Republicans who began thinking that the tax cut bill and the booming economy would boost them but as the tax cuts got less popular they're closing argument is now warning voters that Democrats will take away the tax cuts\nPut regulations back on the economy wrecked the economy there kind of reverting to the Trump culture war issues which do energize their base talking about hordes of criminal illegal aliens coming to kill people\nAnd I'm looking at a fundraising pitch from Mimi Walters Republican congresswoman from California who says we just learned that my socialist pro tax opponent out raised us\nWe can't let the Democrat mob take over Congress Democrats on the other hand have stuck to health care\nWhich is the number one issue for voters this year except for their refining a little bit they're now saying Republicans gave tax cuts to the rich created a huge deficit and to close that whole they are going to come and cut your Medicare and Social Security [noise] let me ask you the flip\nSide of the closing argument question which is what's the biggest challenge for each party at this point what what's keeping Republicans up at night what's keeping Democrats up at night as election day closer than\nRepublicans are worried about the mid west this is the the area of the country where Trump really one Michigan Wisconsin Pennsylvania they thought those states would turn red they thought of Iowa and Ohio would no longer be swing states they'd be solidly red but they are really struggling\nIn the mid west the next two weeks will tell us whether that's true so they're worried about exciting their base in the industrial heartland a Trump and another problem for Republicans is the Trump kept telling his supporters there is a red wave and the borders believed him and got a little complacent and we know that anger is the best motivator\nAnd we don't know who's going to be angry or white working class voters especially men that the Trump base or college educated white women who are very angry but both sides are worried about history Republicans no the party and the White House usually loses big when the president is under fifty percent\nDemocrats know that the groups of voters Republicans depend on tend to turn out more reliably in midterms they're worried about motivating low propensity voters like Hispanics and young people\nOh All right NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson thanks Mara thank you [laughter]\nNow for all the focus on how the Democratic party is shifting to the left nationally\nDemocrats take control of the house it may be because of moderate Democrats winning in Republican districts take Utah's fourth congressional district\nIs deep red and according to a recent poll Republican congresswoman Mia Love and Democrat and McAdams or in a dead heat NPR's Scott Detrow reports\nIn this year deep partisan splits it's almost jarring to hear Democrat Ben McAdams answer this question about President Trump\nHow do you view the Trump Administration is doing right now [noise] you know I think mixed reviews\nThe mayor of Salt Lake county Utah criticizes Trump for sure on immigration policy health care and other friends but he's a lot more measured and cautious about it and most Democrats running for Congress this year near where many in the party are talking about impeachment and single payer health care he likes to talk about burdensome regulations\nI Will work with the Trump Administration when I think it's good for this country and when it's good for you time I'll be there you know I think we do need an infrastructure package to invest in in local roads and bridges and I'm going to be a part of that\nThat's all no accident the county official and

G Turkish authorities or maintain the show was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul they'd reports there is audio or video evidence of what happened there secretary of state Mike Pompeo met with Trump the White House today\nTheir longstanding federal laws that give protection to immigrants who qualify as refugees they have the right to cross at legal ports of entry and ask for asylum\nWhether troops could be sent to the international bridges to block them as an interesting question the puppy come Titus act prevents the military from being used for civilian law enforcement\nIt's interesting that that the most relevant precedent to eh you're saying that you have to go back a hundred years took to Woodrow Wilson right\nLet me let me ask you this the Trump Administration frames all of this in terms of crisis but the situation at the border as a crisis and so appropriate measures are required is the situation at the border right now a crisis\nWell a homeland security spokesperson told me that they're compiling the urine figures right now and she says the numbers of immigrant families arriving in order will likely break records on a monthly basis and now it's important to keep this in context Mary Louise because\nBack in two thousand they were arresting one and a half million undocumented immigrants a year so far this year it's been under four hundred thousand but still the Trump Administration is upset and frustrated they continued to blame everything on Congress for allowing what they called catch and release loopholes in the law\nThe d._a. just spokesman told me that the agency is examining all options to secure the border\nAnd when that spokesperson talks about all options family separation is back on the table this policy that was so controversial that the president had to walk it back in ... reverse it when they tried that earlier this year\nAnd so now homeland security is considering a new sort of watered down form of family separation but also to act as a deterrent to families thinking about crossing of such as those and the caravan uh right now here's the president on the south lawn of the weekend\nIf they fail the separation in many cases they don't set\nOf course as the case that the administration made when they rolled out the family separation policy right earlier this year or so what would a watered down version look like\nWell they're talking about something called a binary choice detained families with their children would have two options one that could give their kids up to a government use shelter where the kids would eventually be sponsored by a relative or a foster family who are already here in the U.S\nAn option to they could keep their kids with them in detention indefinitely until their asylum cases resolved currently a court ruling says the kids can't be locked up with their parents for more than three weeks right this would extend vat and immigrant advocates are appalling\nHere's Michelle brane a of the women's refugee commission on a call with reporters yesterday\nLet's be clear the objective of the binary choice policy that the administration is considering is punish and a church family is from seeking protection this is round two of the administration family separation policy\nJohn Burnett round two or watered down whatever we want to call this revisiting a family separation the same challenges are there right I mean for example if they want to ramp up detention of immigrant families the question of where they would put all these families\nRight and of course the binary chores is still being considered it's not policy yet but if they put it into practice the question is where would they detain all these families currently there are a little over three thousand spots for family members and what are called special family residential centers\nBut you're talking about thousands of these immigrant families that are arrested every week at the southwest border these days um the government doesn't have enough detention beds so for the foreseeable future you'll see the continuation of families\nBeing arrested their process for a few days and then most are released with ankle monitors with their kids to show up for immigration court and that's what's been the devil and the Trump Administration all along\nNPR's John Burnett reporting thank you John\nInterior secretary Ryan Zinke has been one of the most controversial members of President Trump's cabinet there are numerous investigations into his conduct a secretary when the day began there were reports that think he was planning to replace the independent watchdog leading some of those investigations\nThat department now says that's not happening NPR's Brian Naylor reports\nIt all started with an email from housing secretary Ben Carson telling her employees that Suzanne Israel tough HUD assistant secretary for administration was leaving that agency to become acting inspector general at the department of interior\nThis came as a surprise to many in Washington perhaps even to the current acting inspector general Mary Kendall\nFor one thing inspectors general are appointed by the president and the White House hadn't announced anything and lose Hempel which of the project on government oversight just hosts didn't have the experience that would qualify her to be an inspector general\nEach individual that really are they should be non political issues that over say they should have an investigative background that kind of crime them or that kind of watched outlaw\nTops is a former Trump campaign aide who was brought to hug by Carson to replace the staffer who blew the whistle on Carson's plans to use taxpayer dollars to buy a thirty one thousand dollar dining set\n... ethics have also been questioned the inspector general's office has been looking at among other things his redrawing of the boundaries of the grand staircase Escalante national monument in Utah the benefit of Trump ally\nThere are other investigations says crusader director of the western values project a Montana based conservation watchdog group\nThere's another that involved a real estate deal that secretary thank you Family Foundation with potentially involved within his own town that would've been finance in part by the Germans Halliburton which of

which has been saying we got to where we got to give the Saudis a few more days to investigate let's see what they come up\nWith you know it's it's hard to know because he wasn't he didn't talk very much with us about um his impressions and he even\nSaid that he didn't talk to the Saudis about the facts and the case he just wanted a credible investigation and what what's interesting is that the president President Trump\nUm earlier this week was talking about how well the crown prince totally denied any knowledge of this um Bombay also said that that they totally denied this and you have to remember they have a very close relationship with Mohammed bin some on um you know and it's continued despite\nMany other things ... showed gee was just the latest ... are also though he played a he's played a big role in the war in Yemen which has been devastating to that country ah there was this\nBizarre attempt to get involved in politics in Lebanon that still kind of unexplained and he turned

a very close relationship with mom had been on\nA question but I Would love a quick response from from each of you know we now have some narrative from the Saudis of what may have happened we have confirmation of ... stuff is there a single big outstanding question that but you were waiting to to the still unanswered well I think one one is\nJust the the fate of Mohammed bin so I'm On the main does this change him do others in the royal family think that this is a tenable situation that is a good question for Robert de Robin\nWell first of all we're the body the Saudis are the only people who know where your mouth body is and the longer this goes on the greater the repercussions for the ... the house of Saud they're going to pay some kind of price\nFor this misadventures\nAs Robin

forest sense of how the president and the rest of his administration might respond to tonight's near as high town high any reaction yet from the White House\nNo not yet do we could hear from the president's soon he has a rally tonight in Arizona but he has a couple of events before that and he has been a chatty a earlier today he talked to the press a he said uh he was asked about this but it was before the news came out uh and\nUh he said he was still waiting then for an investigation to be completed\n[noise] something that we don't live very serious stuff [noise] and we're going to go to the bottom of it\nAnd more commerce involved is determining what to do\nAnd we haven't heard from a lot of members of Congress yet but one who has\nSpoken out is Senator Lindsey Graham Republican of South Carolina who of late has been a very close ally of the president he\nTweeted quote to say that I'm skeptical of the new Saudi narrative about Mr ... ... is an understatement that President Trump had been asked whether sanctions would be on the table if Saudi Arabia was found to be responsible a he said they could be\nThey could be but he also today's keeps reminding people have the importance of the the relationship with Riyadh how Saudi Arabia is a is a very close ally the United states has been a pain throughout this episode or two to stress look we have to view this in the wider context of a relationship right\nAnd and even today he said that um you know this is a real sad situation he said because Saudi Arabia has been such a great ally um he in particular I ate he President Trump is known to be quite transactional and uh and Saudi Arabia has committed to\nSome deals with the United states President Trump keeps talking about them in our investigation is a huge\nArms deals he keeps talking about ...\nYeah and other private investment in the U.S economy um those deals as we've looked in the end of them are not as big or ensure a thing as the president makes them out to be but certainly Saudi Arabia and investment in the United states it continues to be significant\nThe president has said ah whoever's responsible there should be severe punishment that's that's his words now that Saudi Arabia has confirmed the death and detained Eighteen people do we have a sense what's the range of options that the Trump Administration might take well\nSanctions are the thing that are being discussed a but they could take many forms they could be quite targeted as they could be more symbolic uh and and they're also really depends on Congress Congress in the past\nHas at least on one occasion a forced the administration's hand on sanctions related to Moscow's electoral meddling um they could do it again but it but it's not clear whether the attention span is there in Congress and\nBriefly tell him to Trump's comment that this could be a this could be real killers I mean there's still no direct link here to Mohammed bin ... leadership\nUh not yet and uh I in some
