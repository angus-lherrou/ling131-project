{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Things but the really interesting things happen in your family and your neighborhood in your workplace in your local worshipping community and right now so many of those local tribes of textured meaning er and collapse and people are looking for substitute tribes in politics and I don't think that's gonna work out very well\nYou talk about the idea of red and blue jerseys you also talk about um cable news being a problem social media being a problem um why is it cable news something to pick out in particular [noise]\nWell we don't have enough shared facts right and so the business model of a lot of different media consumption right now is about trying to deepen and intensify the anger against that you can find in your one percent news tribe\nThat maybe it's worth back it up and just looking about what the dissenter mediation of media has done in the Nineteen fifties when there were only three channels\nUh Seventy percent of American households every week tuned in I Love Lucy that wasn't important content but it was shared content\nSo when you think about the MSNBC and the Fox news a sort of tribes in the world they're each getting about one percent of the American public\nBut it's a deep an intense one percent that doesn't think there's really any need to reach across the divide and have any sense of ... that's a really um unhelpful set of economic incentives that cause us to silo ourselves off from our neighbors\nAnd you go on those shows you don't have to\nA fair point you've got to talk to Nebraska is however you can get to um I live in Nebraska but that's on weekends and so in DC Monday to friday I fly off to my day job and Nebraska's a small place but it's still one point nine million people across the Ninety three counties and a couple of times zones\nA four hundred and fifty miles east to west so you want to talk to your people and listen to your people however you can get to them but right now it would be a lot more useful if we had a sense of we which bridged across some of those one percent divides\nSo I'm not taking on you for going on cable I think\nHe got to do what you got to do but it seems like lawmakers have a hand in this right if they're red and blue jerseys you guys are handing them out and the elephant in the room so to speak would be maybe the president Donald Trump rights people talk a lot about his language and his rhetoric how is that not divisive are contributing to the problem\n[noise] sure so I've been critical of the president or on a number of these points but I think it's also important for us to recognize that what we're struggling with right now didn't start two years ago this isn't about Donald Trump Donald Trump or no other politician can fix it either this is not a two year old problem this is a two plus decades problem in the making\nBut can I come back to this point because I think you know lawmakers contribute to divisiveness the way you talk to each other the way you talk about each other the way you talk about us as voters way you talk about activists I'm we hear people being described as evil as mobs right\nYeah I I think I mean you're surely right there is a lot of blame to go around and the kind of people we have serving in politics right now have become a tribe of people who think politics or the center of life and I think ... to ... you know if I could give a message to American voters or don't elect people\nWho think politics or the most important venue and American Life politics are getting a really important\nBut it's a place to do specific things to maintain a framework for to liberty so that communities of love and persuasion and volunteerism can actually thrive and flour\nThe things that make Americans happy or do you have a nuclear family do you have a few deep friendships do you have meaningful calling you have shared work you have shared vocations do you have local worshipping communities all of those things are connected to place\nAnd places being undermined by the digital revolution right now given this great stuff and the revolution but it is undermining our habits of being anchored in a place and we've got more and more politicians who go off to Washington DC and they never really plan to leave Washington DC or the cable news stratosphere they never really plan to go back home\nThose kinda people are rooted in grounded and they're not going to make very good leaders for a republic\n[noise] so you don't sound that excited to be a politician and yet people talk about you are in terms of uh maybe running for president one day they'll laugh about that you don't sound that excited to be fair\nI I think politics has a very useful role to play but it's about a framework for to liberty it's about the frame right the picture for him but the middle of the friend is American families thriving and working with their neighbor and disagreeing over the dinner table for days\nAlliances because you know you you were you tweeted someone who was saying oh I regularly consider leaving the Democratic party you basically said oh yeah I feel the same only about being a Republican\nYeah I don't think either of these parties has a long term view right now I think both of these parties are mostly trying to do anti tribe not what are you for what are the Democrats' big unhealthy long term visions of what are the Republicans big unhealthy ten and twenty year long visions but both parties spend most of their time trying to explain why the other party is even worse than they are\nAnd uh I think the two party system was not what the founders intended and I don't think it's what we're going to have forever but right now we're locked into a two party world we're both of these\nI'm sort of do ... are pretty content to just run against each other and tried to hold down any discussion about new and constructive policy ideas going forward but I think voters want better than that\nDo you want to be one of the choices are we going to see on the ballot\nA I'm a first time politician I think I'm One of eight people in the U.S Senate who's never been a politician before and we have three little kids and the deal we had in our household was if the voters in Nebraska give us a six year calling for the first four and a half of those six years we'd act like we were never going to do it again was a\nA a short term calling and next summer a July August of twenty Nineteen my wife and I are due to go and sit down and figure out what we think we might be called to in the future\nBut when you've got little kids and you lived on a campaign bus\nFor sixteen months I think we did a Ninety three Nebraska counties and I think my baby at that point vomited in

Fifteen or really the most significant single purchase right now because they're using that daily in Yemen and the bombing campaign has now been going on for more than three years\nBut the Saudis don't have a lot of big contract at the moment as as we just heard and it's really the United states that that has the leverage because the in this relationship right now because of the way it supports in supplies the Saudi air force here's ... again\nTonight President Trump told the king he was cutting off spare parts to Saudi air force Saudi air force would be grounded tomorrow morning\nAnd the president has said that if the U.S doesn't sell weapons to the Saudis in Russia or China would step in and do it but it's it's really not that simple of red tailed noted that you\nCan't simply strap a Chinese bomb on an American F. fifteens ... systems have to talk to one another so the Saudis really would be in a tough spot if the United states were to use that leverage and cut them off and look\nAhead with me Greg have the Saudis made any kind of commitments in terms of what arms deals they're looking for in the future\nThe big one that sort of been under some sort of discussion is a missile defense system\nBut again they spent an awful lot of money on the war in Yemen and they're not necessarily seen as being in the market for a big new contract right now the second point the U.S Congress and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has to approve these contracts\nAnd the Democrats in some Republicans are quite upset with the way the Saudis are prosecuting the war in Yemen and for the past year so they've really been reluctant and it doesn't look like it would be an easy go for the Saudis to get a new contract\nThat's NPR national security correspondent

James ... how did he get on to law enforcement's radar and the first place\nGenes one is fifty seven years old and he worked as the security director for the Senate intelligence committee for twenty

surveillance court warrant and I was in that interview lied to the FBI and December twenty Seventeen about his contacts with reporters\nI mentioned you're at the courthouse you were in court this afternoon for this hearing how to play out did this we do come as a surprise\nYou know I Can't really say it's a surprise ever since he was indicted in June it seemed as if things were moving in the direction of a plea deal\nProsecutors had copies of his electronic messages with reporters taxed encrypted messaging apps and that made it a hard case to defend now Wolfe was charged this year with three felony counts of lying\nBut in this plea deal only plead guilty to one which means he likely faces zero to six months in prison and the judge ... brown Jackson let him go home today as long as he promises to return on December twenty for sentencing\nDude wolf himself speak in court today\nHe did the judge asked him point blank did you knowingly and willfully make a false statement to the FBI about your dealings with reporters and we'll send yes he broke down a few times got emotional and choked up\nEspecially when the judge told him there would be no trial in as a felon he couldn't vote or serve on a jury or own a firearm his defense lawyer precedent Burton patted him on the back and handed them some tissues\nOn occasion throughout this hearing and the defense lawyers also pointing out ... was not charged with and did not admit to sharing any classified information\nThat defense team also says they're going to emphasize has long public service when he sentence later\nHere put this into context for us because the Trump Administration has made a point of saying it wants to crack down on leaks and on leakers does this case represent that in fact happening on are they doing more beyond this case\nYou know this effort is a little ironic because this administration the Trump Administration is among the Leakey is in the last thirty or forty years they have their Justice Department has church people in the FBI and other intelligence agencies sharing secrets with reporters and there are lots of ongoing investigations we don't hear about much the FBI of courses\nQuietly working many of these cases and even when they don't charge a compromise or leaks of classified information\nIf they did not in this James was case\nFor people who are interrogated or investigated by the FBI there's always a risk that they could charge you with lying to investigators instead that's exactly what happened to James we'll hear and could be happening town on the line

Ninety six so is it the healthcare providers can't sell the data but from their rules get blurry Daniels says for example the doctor can use it for research or to improve health care operations\nIf he's trying to use your information and arts develop a product that he can then sell and make millions of dollars off of that might not be a health care operation but there isn't a clear interpretation at this place\nAnd there's growing concern about issues of privacy and ownership new income coke or chief officer at the drug companies and ... says it's already difficult to track the

making money okay she making an incredible amount of money up this especially as you get all going to be regulations as we start waking up to this the moment and\nHe says companies like his seeing big changes ahead would be willing to pay something for data if that gave them clear rules about how they could use it there are no company springing up to explore this idea\nWhich came coke or advisors is called humanity dark coat CEO Richard ... says is long term goal was to make medical data a person's legal property to get away from the current system\nThe data's being used without being classified as property and without explicit consent democratization and as a result there's this whole gray area about can you really make billions of dollars from a discovery that came from me\nHe's one of his company has just rolled out an act that would let people specify how their medical data can and cannot use people still won't owned their data but they can agree to do business with companies who are more explicit agreement about how it can be used companies could potentially pay each user ten dollars a month for access to their data ...\nHumidity dot code is framing it's for

News\nWe're going to hear more from lawyer Jody\nDaniel she's going to talk with us about what we as consumers can do with our health data welcome to the program it's great to be here\nI Want to broaden the discussion out because Richards reporting focused on patient records but there are other ways that are health data can be collected by private companies especially now that they're smart watches and fitness trackers and things like that so um what are the rules around what can be collected and how it\nCan be used right now there are no federal rules governing the use of health data disinformation apart from what they say in their privacy policy is basically the wild west any only limitation on what they can do with that data is what they stay in their privacy policies\nAnd you and I know that most people don't read the privacy policy is because they're very hard to read a hard to understand it very complicated and we just want to use the tool that's going to help us in managing our health care\nThe seals crazy to me because when it comes to the smart watch business which is only growing if you look at a company like apple they're kind of doubling down on this technology is it because we are basically by agreeing to use the product handing the stuff over to them like how come the rules are different for them\nThe rules were designed when all of the health data was in the doctor's office and hospital and in the health plan and said the rules apply to those entity is but yes when we sign up for a smart devices smart watch how fat where basically giving them permission these companies permission to use our data\nHowever they see fat and they usually outlined on their privacy policy which could also mean they could sell it that's correct if a company gets access to your information because you give it to them they may be able to sell it and I might be perfectly legal unless they specifically say they won't\nDo they sell it is there a market right now for and people's data about their blood sugar or whatever\nYeah health information is incredibly valuable and a lot of companies that collect vast amounts of health information from individuals are selling at least aggregate or do you identify data to pharmaceutical companies are trying to understand how their medication might work or what might be an opportunity for them\nHelp improve diagnosis or treatment of and he said\nHe identifies I mean you're a data point in a large spreadsheet\nYou can be a data point in large spreadsheet but there isn't necessarily any prohibition on them selling identifiable data and say you really have to be careful and make sure that the state that they will not use your identifiable data in ways that you don't want like for sale\nIs there a movement to give us more control over our health data or privacy protections or something\nWe are seeing a lot of conversations in Congress and we are seeing some changes at the state level for example the state of California has recently passed\nVery privacy protective law regarding data generally but they've carved out health information that's protected under federal law or under California state law says he's added privacy protections actually don't apply to the health data that already a subject to a mix of the law\nWhich is kind of a big deal given that it's home to Silicon

the president's behavior while explaining his own concerns about the debate over the nominee I spoke with ... earlier today about political divisiveness it's the subject of his new book them we started with what happened with the Kavanaugh hearings and his take on the me too movement\nThe me too movement is a very important movement it's messy and it's complicated and there are places where it's going to overreach and we haven't fought throughout a process all of the due process issues but fundamentally I think we have a culture of\nSexual assault in this country for decades we don't have a shared sexual ethic and the me too movement is very very important and we need to handle it with a lot more delicacy than something you can handle well at a campaign rally so that was an unfortunate move\nBut what's your response to many conservative and Republican women out there who have talked about this idea of him to movement that they're worried about their sons that\nYou know they've kind of move from one part of the conversation to apart that says men are at a disadvantage here that there are radical feminist women who were coming after men in your life with false allegations [noise]\nWell I mean it's clearly the case that we need to figure out how in an American tradition that's always had writes for the accused as well how we navigate things that are regularly going to be tried in the media\nSo I I think that that is a false choice to divide the world and to whether or not we want to love and protect our sons and whether or not we want to protect and trust our daughters um this is a cultural movement and moment that it's much better than politics the me too movement doesn't belong to Republicans or Democrats the me too movement belongs to women\nWho are having the courage to come forward and say this is wrong people should be protected we want that for all of our daughters and all of our sisters um we also want there to be writes for
