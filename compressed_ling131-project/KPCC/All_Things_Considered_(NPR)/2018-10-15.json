by former boyfriend\nThen friday Netflix debuts the second season of it hit true crime program making a murder here to talk with us about these project is NPR TV critic Eric Deggans Hey Eric huh All right let's talk about the sentence first this was filmed over a ten year period by\nRudy van ... says he's the brother of the woman sentenced whose name is Cindy shank how does this show expose issues in the criminal justice system\nWell first I got to say I've been reviewing TV for a long time I was crying by the end of this uh I mean it the sentences the surprisingly emotional story about a couple of things mandatory minimum sentencing and prosecuting people for crimes committed by their romantic partners so\nValdez his sister Cindy was in this relationship with this guy who was involved in drug dealing and he got killed\nAnd it's six years later after she's married she's had three kids federal authorities arrest prosecute and convict or on conspiracy charges so in the mandatory minimum sentence for that was Fifteen Years\nNow we've got a clip of Cindy describing what it was like to face that sentence which check it out\n[noise]\nWhere I felt like I got ... not going\nTo take my daughter\nAt forever\nSo her brother Rudy Valdez a documented the struggle for the family to cope and so we see her kids grow up over nearly a decade we see Cindy you'd move to a prison far away from her family and then there's this emotional twisted and that just drives home how much she's lost or all this time\nIn that clip we just heard she says she's guilty\nShe's guilty of knowing about the crimes that um her boyfriend was committing and not calling the cops are you know doing something to try and stop it having knowledge of a crime a can mean that you're part of the conspiracy to commit the crime\nAnd this Friday the second season of making a murderer is debuting the first season with such ahead tell us about the second season\n[noise] so the first season or expose mission to the story of Stephen ... who's this guy in Wisconsin and he was exonerated in two thousand and three by DNA evidence after serving almost Twenty years for sexual assault and attempted murder\nThen he gets arrested and convicted of committing a different murder or a few years later along with his nephew who's named uh Brendan Bessie so the first season raises some doubts about the evidence that they collected against Avery and expose allegations that the nephews confession was unfairly coerced this season is about every ... appeal of his conviction and\nEfforts ... to have his confession throwback\n... it sounds very like getting into the nitty gritty of the legal process\nWell I think that's one reason why the show might be less than Paxil because it's a more mundane story about how tough it is to appeal these kinds of convictions\nDid you find a link between the two documentaries\nYeah I I think they both trying to humanize people who've been convicted of crimes and show the really brutal impact of these really long prison sentences I mean we're incarcerating a tremendous amount of people in this country for long stretches of time sometimes for non

the president praised FEMA director Brock Long for his job is agencies doing\nBen Sasse Republican senator from Nebraska doesn't except that it's divisive and it was a mistake ... as a member of the Judiciary Committee and frequent Trump critic in fact on the Senate for the day after that rally fast took issue with the president's behavior while explaining his own concerns about the debate over the nominee\nI spoke with Ben Sasse earlier today about political divisiveness it's the subject of his new book them we started with what happened with the Kavanaugh hearings and his take on the me too movement\nThe me too movement is a very important movement it's messy and it's complicated and there are places where it's going to overreach and we haven't fought through how to process all of the due process issues but fundamentally I think we have a culture of\nSexual assault in this country for decades we don't have a shared sexual effect and uh the me too movement is very very important and we need to handle it with a lot more delicacy than something you can handle well at a campaign rally so that was an unfortunate move\nBut what's your response to many conservative and Republican women out there who have talked about this idea of him to movement that they're worried about their sons that\nYou know they've kind of move from one part of the conversation to apart that says men are at a disadvantage here that there are radical feminist women who were coming after men in your life with false allegations [noise]\nWell I mean it's clearly the case that we need to figure out how in an American tradition that's always had writes for the accused as well how we navigate things that are regularly going to be tried in the media\nSo I I think that that is a false choice to divide the world and to whether or not we want to love and protect our sons and whether or not we want to protect and trust our daughters um this is a cultural movement and moments that as much bigger than politics the me too movement doesn't belong to Republicans or Democrats the me too movement belongs to women\nWho are having the courage to come forward and say this is wrong people should be protected we want that for all of our daughters and all of our sisters um\nWe also want there to be writes for the accused and right now we haven't yet navigate it to a place that will hopefully be a lot healthier than where we are now\nIn the meantime we've heard Mitch McConnell mothers call me to activists and angry mob is that what you see is that what you saw in the hallway and that is that how you feel about that activism [noise]\nI didn't hear a leader McConnell's comments about the me too movement as a mob I heard leader McConnell speaking to the fact that there are politicians in American Life today\nWho are saying to people if you'd differ on a policy issue you should be handed out of a restaurant that's actually happening right now where your politicians going to cameras saying don't let people eat dinner with their kids that's wrong\nI'm Dr Ford's family and Brett Kavanaugh's family both suffered repeated death threats over the course of the one month circus that the Senate conducted a politician who has to for a time of serve in public life and I get death threats and it is what it is because you put yourself out there in the public square\nBut if you're going to serve on the judiciary or if you're going to raise allegations about a sexual violence in the past the fact that we don't just have those people suffering death threats having to move out of their homes\nOn but we also have other politicians calling on people who you might differ with on policy to be handed out of restaurants that is wild like behavior\nWhat is your response to the activists who says if you are paid by me the taxpayer and I see you in public it's perfectly fine for me to tell you what I think and it's perfectly fine for you to be held accountable for policies that are harmful\n... this is why I wrote them most fundamentally because political tribalism is rampant in our time\nThere are all sorts of important debates that need to be had inside politics but the idea that politics should swallowed the whole public square\nThe idea that there is no civil society that there are no cultural debates that there are no economic debates there are no religious
