prison\nWe feel much differ about turkey today than we do this\nFor Saturday October thirteenth this is all things considered\nI'm Shereen Marisol Meraji will get the latest from the White House and get more on a mysterious case of a missing Saudi journalist\nThere are in a really tough position if they can explain what happened to him\nLast will need Sarah Jones who takes on Nineteen characters and one big theme in her one woman show I'm On a\nContinuum of women who are negotiating their relationship to sex and power in a male dominated culture that's all coming up first news\nLive from NPR News in Culver City California I'm Janine Herb's President Trump welcomes pastor Andrew Brunson to the White House today celebrating his released from detention in Turkey as NPR's Tamara Keith reports the evangelical pastor had been held in that country for more than two years\nThey haven't produced any solid evidence and there are in a really tough position if they can explain what happened to him\nWhat's the reaction here in the U.S\nWill President Trump has been talking about it in sending pretty mixed signals here he says he wants to get to the bottom of this but he's also saying he doesn't want to jeopardize these big contracts which are mostly arms deals between the U.S and the Saudis the Saudis are are huge buyers of American weapons\nSaudi Arabia said to hold a conference called the future investment initiative which has been dubbed Davos in the desert and executives from over the LA Times CNN\nHave all dropped out so as the president of the world bank Saudi Arabia is young to factor ruler Mohammed bin Salman mine has been trying to modernize the Saudi economy and make it about more than just the oil and he's been investing in Silicon valley and he's been ... western partners\nCould this event threatened all that\nAbsolutely and and again as you as you rightly pointed out this\nBig conference that scheduled for later this month is is the centerpiece of this vision he has which is to reshape the Saudi economy and he\nBrought in all of these big name people and one of the real irony here is this conference was held last year around this time\nAnd it's held at the Ritz Carlton a very opulent over the top hotel in the in the capital Riyadh um and it was it was very successful a lot of big name people came it seemed to be\nGoing to the point that he could bring in a lot of investors modernized make Saudi Arabia very high tech place\nBut shortly afterwards it was really turned into a prison this this very strange episode where many of the wealthiest Saudi businessmen were rounded up and kept at the Ritz Carlton for weeks or even months in some cases and ultimately had to turn over a big\nPart of the era of their fortune so it's this this conference in this hotel as sort of representing\nBoth the the crown prince his effort to modernizing change Saudi Arabia but also points to his autocratic behavior in many ways [noise] you've\nBeen following this story closely what do you watch them for going forward\nFirst how is Saudi Arabia gonna respond or they just gonna keep denying and denying denying when Jamal could show he is a has disappeared second\nGiven Saudis extensive oil supplies that it's a big buyer of many western products will any kind of big boycott of Saudi Arabia really hold for the long term\nThat's NPR's Greg McGarry thanks ... thank you\nThree days after hurricane Michael hit the Florida Panhandle with a hundred and fifty miles per hour winds\nResidents are assessing the damage and rescue crews are still going house by house in some of the worst affected areas the town of Mexico beach is one focal point with entire blocks flattened by wind and storm surge NPR's Quil Lawrence was there today and sent this report\nThe main roads into Mexico beach are clear now even if trees and the power lines and debris sometimes narrows them down to one lane so people have been coming back to see what's left\nWere actually most of ours the damage was on the bottom level that most of everybody that taught for were able to salvage\nCrystal McClellan and her husband and son are here with the U Haul trailer trying to save what they can from a beach rental but they're permanent home was also in the path of the store\nWe live in one town over yeah okay this is an hour here so we actually this is we\nWere we got hit it twice that house will\nTake a few months to repair she thinks but looking around Mexico beach on many streets there's nothing left to fix they used to be palm trees and three story homes now some looked like vacant lots wouldn't houses flattened or picked up and moved into the road a block away and it's still not clear how many people stayed through\nTwo thirty is the is the upper end of a number that we receive\nFire chief Joseph ... reading a rescue team from Miami he got a list of residents who told the police they planned to stay\nBut that's about an accurate number the problem is you don't know from the time that they did that survey until on land fault if other people ended up leaving because as you saw this um ramped up so quickly it wouldn't surprise us if a lot of people got scared and ended up evacuating\nHis team spent the first day or two looking for survivors who needed help combing through the town rescue dogs\nFor that off the street all the area right there I got a really strong smell\nAnd now they're making them much more methodical surge house by house room\nLooking for people who might not have survived using a dog trained on body\nEven for the houses that fared well the big question is when this town could be rebuilt\nBrian Joseph invited me and NPR's Becky Sullivan into his wrecked living room he and his wife have two kids six and ten their books and toys and bikes are littered all around the house they were finally settling down after he did twenty two years in the air force which took them all over most recently to Japan\nAnd they bought this house eleven months ago just across the road from the beach it's new to the latest coach of the main house high up on post structure is good but the wind pushed in his front door and then blue things out the back for a quarter mile\nThe surging water moved his car over the next driveway if he could fix it up right now maybe they could save the house but that's not going to happen\nI can imagine that anything's going to be actually rebuilding and the ticket contractor so I'm sure everyone's concern even if they ever partially usual houses is he going to get worse\nThere aren't more high profile celebrities who are engaging in the political process are willing to voice their opinion or political issues you know in and it's interesting how despite this being a country where we talk about how much it matters to be involved in the political process\nWe deem that is bad for business to be vocal about it and so here we are in this room where\nToo loud voices are seen to be diametrically opposed but a bit that it wouldn't look so split down the middle if we heard from more voices that words are profiled as they were\nJuliet do you agree with that that we need to get more celebrities talking about politics I can\nHear a lot of people saying no no no that's exactly what we don't need\nWell obviously like the rest of your as a journalist I think anyone should be able to say anything that they want to um within reason personally\nDon't care if more celebrities talk about politics or not\nBut I Do think that was the Taylor Swift tiny west thing um ... that's shockingly not a few between the two of them this diamond right I think that what it shows us is just how deeply people's political views are linked to race ... um\nBecause right now Democrats particularly black ones are mad at ... because he's supporting someone who has a history of saying racist things has a history of doing racist things and we'll Taylor Swift people are upset with her because they thought that she was there\nAnd queen or whatever that is most of the main so yeah I think this whole situation really shows us that we can't separate race from politics because so many voters don't do that\nAnd tests but I'm Wondering if people are really going to stop being fans of these musicians\nWork stopped being fans of their music just because they decide they're going to get into politics and because they you know have controversial views or if they're just going to be like whatever ... going to be amazing I'm Still listen to it anyway Taylor Swift she's poppy and great and they left to listen to her on road trips I don't really care if they get into politics\nWhat I Will say about Taylor is that for a long time she didn't speak about her political views and she said back in two thousand twelve that the reason she didn't speak about her political views was because she didn't feel like she had enough life experience to for anyone to to really like take her advice and she didn't want people to vote\nBased on what she said because she didn't feel like she knew enough about it\nSo I think that there is something really powerful about the fact that she is speaking up now that she's speaking up after you know playing this important role in a sexual harassment lawsuit that she won last year I think that she really has come out with her political views in a way that is\nPowerful and is thoughtful and I think that you have to take a holistic view when you're looking at this\nAnd that was Rolling Stone reporter tests as Stewart Julia

Romero keep viewed as a national hero although still controversial for some his ... has been generally quite well received even by people who aren't Catholic\nAnd part of this because when he was archbishop in the late Nineteen seventies and up until his death in March Nineteen eighty he he was from that spoke vote in his weekly ... these very forcefully on issues such as poverty giving a preference to the poor\nAre also things like minimum wage justice in unity and ... and ... in you know in the context of the times of the Cold War and also somewhat of a conservative elites here in Central America\nSpeaking on these issues brought accusations of being a communist\nThat language has softened somewhat one colleague of his back from that time to jazz it freeze put its knee the critics now have a much more civilized language but\nThere is some opposition but generally speaking at the time or Romero's now seems somewhat of a national hero in a figure that transcends politics and\nYou see his image everywhere in the country to the point where into stamping my passport has his image on it and you see little quotes of his\nFrom his horror movies as well so\nHe he's a very revered person and especially among the young who you know don't even remember him but ah with the country's going through such difficulties especially with violence I think there's there's sort of people are looking for a voice uh someone that's a credible this time and uh he fits the bill\nAnd how does that love Oscar Romero manifest itself in San Salvador today\nWere marches people are professions I should say was a large one that does not want its way through the city people were carrying his image lots of people with T shirts lots of lots of friends that were somewhat political would carry quotes\nIs from his ... his ... were you know ... at the time and people had little snippets from them basically saying there's no worse than the taking you know the kicking bread from Hungary person that would be an example of one every parish in the city they also held candlelight vigils\nPeople were planning to head out after the ceremony and do as well as more marches in the morning it's been somewhat celebrate tore um\nEven in areas that were somewhat you know more by violence you know these places you can go out a bit of a pause right now so it seems like a respite for a country that that really needs one right\nNow and the people that Oscar Romero stood shoulder to shoulder with as a revolutionary back in Nineteen eighty many of them have become the elites we'll never know of course whether he would have stayed true to his principles\nYou know that's interesting he was only ... three years so\nHe had very little time what's interesting\nToo is back then he was a a lone voice and the Catholic Church the church in the elites were very tight and in his funeral only one of the country's bishops came to attend I interviewed a priest you as a seminary and was kicked out of the seminary for just displaying image\nRomero that's how that's how lonely he struggled was at\nThe time so in some ways it feels like his message has stood the test of time in that it's still resonates with people\nBut at the same time and it just feels like I don't know if enough\nPeople are are heating it because you just look at the difficulties of the country with the gang violence and corruption sort of feels like the ... the elites are still in there seemed positioned not paying taxes being exploitative in their in their ways of treating their employees it's hard to know what would happen with Romero had he had he lived\nIt would have been enough she'll struggles especially the time considering that it was it was in the midst of the Cold War and they'll see the church in the Nineteen eighties was very conservative\nForce anyone that was associate with liberation theology that was in Rome metal that\nWere treated quite harshly and made to feel unwelcome so it would have been a tough for him had he not been shot\nDavid ... from El Salvador about the beatification of the new St ... archbishop Oscar Romero who was killed in Nineteen eight feet as much more

across the country are disciplined more often and more harshly than men for low level violations that's the finding of an investigation by NPR with the ... school of journalism at Northwestern university\nLow level violations typically are not violent but they can result in serious consequences like time in solitary confinement or extended prison sentences are going to spend this week digging into that finding on all things considered Jessica ... starts our investigation and Chicago\nMonica Cosby spent Twenty years in Illinois state prisons for murder she says that during that time she and her fellow inmates were disciplined a lot\nSo you'll get it for you for having like a piece of candy or like you have a library book that's overdue and you're on your way to the library\nOnce she picked up a shift working in the kitchen she thought she had permission but a correctional officer gave her a ticket for unauthorized movement and send her to solitary confinement for sixty days the offense she says she received the most tickets for was insolence things like talking back to an officer\nOr the Twenty years and we read a lot of I mean there's only like three of you would I Know that never got a ticket for influence\nWe couldn't get Cosby's prison records but at twenty sixteen audit done in collaboration with the state's department of corrections found that women are disciplined more than men women received on average almost double the number of disciplinary test\nIt's and the biggest disparity in those tickets the ones for influence\nI Would say as a whole we disciplined based on emotion rather than on\nSafety and security Maggie Burke is the former warden at Logan Correctional Center in Illinois She recently retired after three decades but that apartment she says officers tend to overuse extreme punishment like solitary confinement also called segregation or stock\nIs a facility safer because I put a woman's egg longer because she talked back with

... school of journalism we analyzed data from Fifteen states the track disciplined by gender visited four different prison systems and interviewed dozens of current and formerly incarcerated women academics and prison staff\nWe found that across the country women are disproportionately discipline for low level offenses in Indiana women had more than double the rate of tickets than men and three times as many tickets for refusing to obey an order\nIn Vermont female inmates are three times as likely to get a ticket for making a derogatory comments and in California women or two and a half times as likely to be ticketed for disrespecting an officer\nAlyssa Benedict as a national expert in a small but growing movement to address this disparity she says this system of punishing women for mostly non violent behavior is causing more problems than at solving\nAll people are suffering right now under ... what were funny however is that women are staffing very unique impact\nBenedict says that's because women in prison often have a history of trauma\nAccording to the Illinois audit Ninety seven percent of female inmates have been the victims of sexual or physical abuse they show signs of post traumatic stress disorder more than any other study demographic including combat vets that's according to a twenty ten study by the Illinois criminal justice information authority\nAnd the ways that women are controlled and punished in prison with things like isolation strip searches or loss of phone privileges Benedict says these responses exacerbate that past trauma\nWe're leaning on very outdated school and an instrument of discipline that have no rounding psychological research and I actually in that article Henry care than China and recovery\nAnd the isolation doesn't only affect inmates Monica Cosby the woman who went to solitary for taking on a kitchen shift had three young daughters when she was arrested and a common punishment while in prison was losing phone
