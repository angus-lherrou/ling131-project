to pay attention to all those new judges below the Supreme Court level\nUltimately very few cases actually make their way up to the Supreme Court and the vast vast majority of cases are decided in the lower courts that means that things that matter to your life and nine into our family's lives are really decided in the lower court\nSomeone else is watching the federal judiciary it's attorney general Jeff Sessions he delivered sharp remarks about the role of judges in his speech Monday Night to the conservative Heritage Foundation\nBut an increasing number of judges are ignoring the boundaries and view themselves as something akin to roving vectors general for the entire executive branch with\nThe White House and the Congress both in Republican hands judges are sometimes serving as the only check and balance on the Trump Administration and Sessions is objecting he\nPointed to recent court rulings that demanded more details about the administration's decisions on immigration and the origin of a question about citizenship on the census judges in those cases appear\nTo be skeptical of the motives behind some of those policies they've ordered the commerce secretary to sit for a deposition in order to homeland security official to turnover notes from a White House meeting would judges like its actions asked if someone from the Congress of the executive branch wanted to see their correspondence with law clerks\nIs monumental disruption should not be done lightly and there's no basis for subjecting the executive branch of this kind of discovery is not acceptable it's just not and we engender Biden and wind gender when\nMeanwhile in the Republican controlled Senate there's no let up in that campaign to confirm more judges still lifetime appointments lawmakers that schedule to hearing for Wednesday on six more nominees even though the Senate is actually not in fashion again they need to go up to\nSenators can't be hiding nominees records they shouldn't be ending debate prematurely they shouldn't be rubber stamping these judges through they need to hold hearings on the Senate is in session and and not be jamming three controversial judges\nFor President Trump there's a lot more work to do to reshape the courts\nBy the time we finish maybe fifty percent of the court you know what that is fifty Brazil\nAnd those judges will serve long after this president leaves the White House Carrie Johnson NPR News Washington\nAmong the revelations of the interview that President Trump just gave to sixty minutes\nIs that hanging on the walls of the White House the president has placed a picture of himself in the company of past Republican presidents some of them sit at a table in a crowded room there are drinks looks like Trump is drinking Diet Coke and they all seem to be laughing I\nReagan Teddy Roosevelt both bushes Ford Nixon and Lincoln it's called the Republican club and it was painted by Andy Thomas who joins me now from Springfield, Missouri Andy Thomas welcome well thank you for having me when you first find out that you're painting was hanging in the White House\nIt was Sunday night I finally settled down and was watching the football game and Dean I had checked her a social media and dean is your wife\nYour dean as my wife okay so I actually my phone's been ringing quite a bit it was reporters but I thought it was a robo calls me answering\nPlus you're in the middle of a football game so there's more important stuff going on that's right and you started learning that the Republican club which you'd painted had been hung by President Trump who who's at some point cold you himself what happened\nWell Daryl actually who's become a friend to Dina and I was just a Congressman Darrell Issa yes from California he had told us early in the summer that he was going to try to you at some point he would show the painting to President Trump\nAnd apparently he had told Dina that he had a five o'clock appointment so Dina sent me a text and just said you need to be around the house around four o'clock four o'clock central time she didn't tell you what you know so I was out mowing the lawn I came in had clippings all over and\nI came in I said well what what I Need to be around for and she said well Daryl showing the painting to the president\nAnd I thought that's a long shot I'll just wait a few minutes ago finished alone but they indeed did call and was very gracious and what did he say what it what about the painting he's a testament pain so I can sympathize with this he said I've seen a lot of paintings of me and\nI've really usually don't like them but I really like this one huh I didn't bother to tell them that I pay their distaste two or three times you know what\nHe's a hard man to paint how come\nWell like my family has dark eyebrows dark eyes you know there's something to grab a hold of with a President Trump you know his hair and his face in his eyebrows you know there is no dark you know so it was a challenge and and getting the right smile\nI I don't think I'd be offending anyone if I had pointed out that he looks a little bit slimmer and the painting than he perhaps [laughter] well no wonder he liked it\nThat's true but several years ago this is the third version of this of these paintings that I've done\nAnd I decided on the very first one that I Would try to make each man is good looking as I could still be recognizable and so I I fried or immoral if I can how come you because when I Do it when I even did a self portrait one time I looked like Clark Gable when I got into\nIt just you know there's just an inclination is to you know I like people don't want to point out flaws in them\n[noise] I Need to ask us something going on in this in this painting it looked as though President Trump is grinning at something that Abe Lincoln is saying to him you can't quite tell but you can just see you see Lincoln and ... what we're talking about\nI Would like to believe that Lincoln was using that great with that he had in his told her you know some insightful thing that was funny in Donald Trump is responding to it and everybody you know try to have the whole table

Stephen ... is still going\nCEOs have been left to make these hard decisions what's on the line for the CEOs wise at such a hard decision\nThe Saudis look at attendance of something like this as a show of loyalty and so the idea that somebody like gave me a diamond J.

to take a position on immigration or same sex marriage you're saying there could be consequences if they did not take a position on this issue\nAbsolutely these executives have come out so forcefully

see I suspect that they're much shorter\nAndrew Ross Sorkin writes the ... column for the New York times thanks for joining us and if you're having me\nWhen I was a little girl I spent hours poring over the Sears catalog I had my eye on highly hobby often\nAnd aside from the fact that you could make cakes and what I loved about shopping from the Sears catalog was nobody knew I was a kid I can browse that my own pace no shop assistant ignoring me or talking over my head to my parents\nIt turns out that feeling the ability to shop without being judged resonated in a different more profound way for black Americans in the Jim Crow era Cornell historian Lewis highland argues the Sears catalog was radical in its day\nBecause it allowed black Americans do have these same shopping experience as whites he's been pondering that legacy in light of this week's news that Sears has filed for bankruptcy professor highland welcome to all things considered thank you so much for having me\nWhy was the Sears catalog such a game changer for shoppers in the Jim Crow south\nIn the Arab Jim Crow race was everything and for black Americans most of whom were rural farmers access to goods on an equal basis as whites in faraway cities at reasonable prices was a godsend and that's what the catalog was\nI mean from a practical point of view of what had happened previously was they would show up and they would be asked to go to the back of the line behind the white customers and if you're shopping back catalog nobody knows what color you are\nNobody knows who you are and in the era of Jim Crow there was a constant active differences you're black you had to wait until all the white customers were served you had to wait until the white store owner let you buy whatever you want it and he may or may not have let you 'cause it was largely on credit\n[noise] so the Sears catalog appears people could read it at home that could decide what they wanted to order but there were still challenges Redmond southern store owners fought back\nOh definitely because if you were an African American and he wanted to shop and some other way you were confessing their power and not just the power of the store owner and the power the landlord but basically the power of white supremacy of Jim Crow itself\nAnd so you had lots of store owners pushing back you know burning catalogs and the street very publicly from Sears catalog and burning Sears catalog and bond fires in the streets all kinds of incentives to destroy these catalogues\n[laughter] so what did you do to keep all their customers are able to order their products\nWell he published instructions in the catalog how to simply give the requirements to the post men so you didn't have to go through the story and a lot of places\nThe post office was also the general store so it was pretty complicated even get your order submitted to the catalog but they found lots of ways to do this for rural African Americans as well as immigrants people who didn't even speak English they had all kinds of clerks available to take your order and nearly any tone\nSo your take away is what that this is a reflection on on buying power on retail as as resistance\nI think it's a story of the deep contradiction between Jim Crow and consumer capitalism they can see in lots of places particularly in this moment in near around Nineteen hundred but also later in the Nineteen fifties and sixties as African Americans acquire were ...\nAnd department of education under secretary Betsy ... had a very means to delay and replace the rule but will now

hurricane Michael barreled through Florida it also crashed\nRight into the middle of too hotly contested political races Florida is of course a swing state and a critical one\nAnd candidates vying for the governor's seat and a U.S Senate seat were quick to jump into relief efforts here's Democrat Andrew Gillum he's running for governor and wielding a chainsaw to help clear fallen trees\nUp their meanwhile here's his opponent as his Republican Ron dissent is on his way to the panhandle to help out all in tears\nWhy why\nAre we in the morning\nThe folks in northwest Florida need you well let me bring in Steve ... he's the Tallahassee bureau chief for the Tampa Bay times he's been out and about today covering current governor Rick Scott at sea bass gay welcome to the program thank you so much for hurricane Michael shaken up these two big races\nIt's had a major effect and the governor's race in the race to the United States Senate because the Democratic candidate for governor who's the mayor of Tallahassee which got hit hard by the storm and the leading Republican candidate for the U.S Senate Rick Scott sitting governor is a it pressed into his other role as commander in chief in an emergency\nTo sort of a help the state recover\nTell me a little bit more about how the candidates have adjusted what they're doing we heard a little bit there from the gubernatorial candidates out on the campaign trail meanwhile Rick Scott who as I mentioned is currently governor he's running to be senator I hear he has turned his campaign over to his wife at least temporarily so that he can focus on cleaning up after the hurricane\nThat's correct Rick Scott has suspended campaigning\nAnd his wife first lady and Scott who is really not had much of a ... first lady has stepped into the role that's very unusual and I just left Rick Scott in Gadsden county which is the next county west of Tallahassee Rick Scott though he's not formally campaigning\nHe was listening a post for people's concerns about storm problems but everyone wanted to have their picture taken with the governor everyone wanted to shake his hand the point I'm making is you can't ever completely separate governing from campaigning\nLet me ask you one practical question early voting in some of the hardest hit parts of Florida is supposed to begin at the end of this month October twenty sevens are those polling places likely to be up and running\nNot in a place like bay county which is the hardest to copy of the mall and which is by the way the biggest county in the hurricane zone\nThere are scrambling and I've talked to elections supervisors who are asking governor Scott's issue an executive order that would dramatically reduce the number of\nVoting locations so that you have these super voting centers maybe every five or ten miles people would have to travel further to vote but every one vote would be protected\nHas the hurricane changed the issues that voters say they want to vote on it but I'm thinking of climate change which is not often mentioned first and foremost among things that drive people to the polls but hurricane Michael ... was a part the intensity was impacted by warmer waters which was of course linked to climate change\nI'm skeptical whether that's going to be elevated as a major issue throughout this campaign for both governor and US Senate\nDespite all the problems we've had here with red tide and the algae and sea level rise environmental issues are not polling nearly as importantly as health care and education and the economy\nWhat a hurricane does to alter the dynamics of politics and campaigning is it reinforces\nTo people that without government you have nothing in a in an emergency you know everyone's asking where's FEMA everyone's asking you know we're first responders are and they're grateful I'll go out there getting from first responders but everywhere you look you see the hand of government trying to give people a you know hope\nSteve ...

confusing and conflicting advice I mean for one thing I think my counselor said people with higher scores don't get into Ivy League schools really consider\nSome backups and another counselor who said don't write an Asian immigrant story don't write something that's already been told before and it's been heard before and it isn't going to be compelling and I think those two things were really unsettling I think at the time to think that there is this idea that\nMy story or makes variances would not be valued or would not be interesting\nAnd you know with scores that weren't valedictorian scores it was really tough bind to be in despite that\nI I decided to speak most honestly about what made me who I Am and when I you'd my mission style and major viewers really kind of saw the value in the ways in which I was making these connections from my experience as to what I wanted to do\nIf a student says to look I Want to be judged on my merits alone I Want to be judged solely on my accomplishments how do you respond to that\nI think there is a really beautiful sign at the valley that I helped organize at said merit means nothing without context conversations on campus has evolved\nA lot to reflect this idea that we should\nYou know beyond this case rethink how we are structuring our education systems and how we are viewing merit as if it is something that is reflective through test scores through reductive quantitative methods only the kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of\nThe ways that they overcome and work despite these barriers I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead\nThere seems to be a good chance that this case could reach the Supreme Court where there appears to be a solid majority opposed to affirmative action what are your fears about what happens if this lawsuit proceeds\nI think knowing that you know when it reaches the Supreme Court they won't take additional evidence so student voice that comes through here will be the only voice that they hear when it gets to the top there\nWhichever way this case ends up being decided I think that in the long term thinking about how I think I Want to get a message to future applicants that their stories matter and that they have mattered\nSally temp thanks so much thank you so much she's and Harvard's class of

critics like Roxanne gay wrote in the New York times that she liked the show but wouldn't watch it because it was quote normalizing Trump and his wart harmful political ideologies\nWhen bar sent a

Shapiro\nAnd I'm Mary Louise Kelly last name the two U.S Senate candidates from Texas debated in San Antonio three weeks before election day there was an important opportunity for democratic congressman Beto O'Rourke an incumbent Republican Ted Cruz to make their cases to voters\nThe debate like the race was downright nasty as NPR's Wade Goodwyn reports\nSenator Ted Cruz is reelection campaign has not been shy about attacking his opponent congressman Beto O'Rourke on TV\nI'm Ted Cruz and I approved this message medical work is more extreme than he once you didn't\nWant to attack ad which eventually seemed to backfire Cruz's\nCampaign misleading edited video tape\nTo make it appear as if all work said he supported flag burning which he did not say\nFederal organizations are too extreme for them just to protect it\nUntil now better work has declined to participate in negative campaigning but with the poll showing cruise with anywhere from six to nine point lead the congressman relented and has gone on the attack\nRepublicans and Democrats alike know that we've got to lead on immigration reform and yet Ted Cruz is the only senator to vote against moving forward with that conversation vows deport every single dream\nLast night or their debate in San Antonio this trend continues cruise painting O'Rourke is a dangerous extremist\nIf you work in energy if you work in oil and gas congressman O'Rourke record on this is extreme he didn't just vote for a ten dollar a barrel tax on oil he's also voted for aggressive regulations of fracking\nBut unlike their first debate last night O'Rourke hit back\nThis is what you can expect over the course of this debate a center crews and not going to be honest with you is going to make up positions and votes that I've never held or have ever take is dishonest why the president called ... and it's why the nickname stuff because it's true\nAlthough cruise would force all laugh when a war attacked him his face revealed is true emotions and the senator didn't like it but the debate in San Antonio was more than just battle it was substantive to\nCruise has the numbers on his side there are hundreds of thousands more Republican voters in Texas the Democrats as a result Cruz spoke mostly to his base\nThe state of Texas is booming we got right now the lowest unemployment in forty nine years Texas is seeing the benefits of low taxes in low regulations and congressman O'Rourke position is always always always in favor of higher taxes\nIf cruise generally play to Republican fears of what would happen if Democrats gained any power or war tended to speak to voters better angels\nWhether we will remain the inspiration of the world is an open question right now the partisanship the pettiness the dishonesty that defined so much of a national conversation we're in desperate need right now of inspiration\nAlthough we're workers running way ahead of other Texas state wide Democrats close still get you know cigar\nI think that a very good democratic candidate running against a flawed Republican candidate has a chance to break through that why O'Rourke came up so strong on cruise\n... a professor of political science at Southern Methodist university\nCrews ... is an acquired taste people respect him as a conservative fighter they don't necessarily like him they gave O'Rourke a luck but Democrats have to recognize that competitiveness is a decade or two decades out\nIt's not two years it's not for years it's longer than that because demographic change is very slow\nBetter work well up here and an hour long CNN town hall event tomorrow evening and my talent on the Texas border Ted Cruz declined to participate so work will answer the voters' questions himself Wade Goodwyn NPR News\nHarvard is defending its admissions policy in the Boston courtroom this week the question is whether the school discriminates against Asian American applicants the case could go to the Supreme Court with broad implications for affirmative action and schools\nYesterday we spoke with an Asian American student who believes Harvard should consider factors including race Kelly ... has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she is a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered\nKate thanks for having me well why do you believe Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think race nearly treats and illusion of diversity and I'd love to see the missions policies change not to have racing it\nNow Harvard says that when they do consider race it's one of many factors and that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from the list of factors that Harvard is considering when it assesses the students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to it raises sort of something that is becoming not just nearly factor but often change the fact that decision is based on\nI think Harvard as saying that they don't do that but let's ... missions has been showing in the past few days and has really brought to light is that oftentimes is the single race factor that comes down to someone's rejection\nStudents don't there's missions as a group that brought this lawsuit we should say\nYes yeah and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of get this a Jewish applications as well and sort of use the personal rating artificially keeps saying I'm very slowly although they were going higher and everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nAnd go one or two that are going to the dairy industry or you're going to the\nCows don't mind gossip all the justice system
