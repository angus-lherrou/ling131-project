Russia is threatening to retaliate if President Trump follows through on his decision to withdraw from a long standing nuclear arms control treaty\nWell is there are a couple of perspective that you know I've tapped into a I started writing about this on and off in two thousand two as a reporter and what I noticed was initially a lot of anger toward us and how dare you\nBashed the church and that has faded significantly\nIn the last several years as I've done more reporting as as more grand jury work has come out as I've done my own investigative work on this\nIt is overwhelmingly a different story I hear from people who describe themselves as Catholics who are now disaffected who are angry who want to side with the victims who say enough is enough with the bishops\nYou know people are wondering my goodness every time one of these headlines comes out were devastated we're heartbroken were wounded were hurt\nAnd then six months we hope okay it's behind us and then it's back and now it's back again and now it's back again\nDo you think that this sense of anger and distrust do you think it goes beyond a practicing Catholic people who are connected to the Catholic Church I Wonder if it it it affects the community at large doesn't make them question what's going on in their world\nI think a lot of people it's very difficult for them to see what has now become document based ... of systemic practices within this institution and not wonder what the heck\nIs going on there is a deep distrust I think in shock that this institution seems to have shown such a pattern internally a very very bad behavior and no sanctions\nIs there a sense that the federal investigation is a step in the right direction or is that optimism hard to come by right now\nWell it's hard to say right I mean anything can happen nobody knows which way a federal probe will go and whether it will yield anything\nBut I remember talking to the victims even a couple of weeks back months back about the statute fight and having one say something on Thursday when the story broke about the federal pro which is\nI'm not holding my breath about a statute of limitations change in this state and the one thing that will bring me peace is if and when federal authorities finally decide to explore whether the Catholic Church is an organized criminal network\nThat's Maria Pena writer she's a columnist with the Philadelphia Inquirer Maria thanks so much for talking with us thank you so much for having me\n[noise]\nAnd now another story in our troll watch theory [noise]\nFor this program we've been trying to keep track of the ways that Internet trolls especially those directed by foreign governments have been trying to influence American voters by pushing fake stories are hyping up stores with a partisan or mean spirited edge\nNow we've heard about an army veteran who's trying to eliminate this information on Facebook that targets service members and veterans he's flag about one hundred Facebook pages of millions of followers and he's with us now Chris Goldsmith is the assistant director for policy and government affairs at Vietnam veterans of America\nAnd he's also founder and president of high ground veterans advocacy and he's with us from NPR's bureau in New York schools with thanks so much for talking to us hey thanks for having me so let me let me ask you to walk me through this now this started because you were trying to understand how well you are\nLegitimate Facebook pages were doing and then you realize that somebody had what stolen your logo and was pushing content with it and had more followers and you tell me about that correct\nYes so I was just helping communications team manage our social media pages and um I typed in Vietnam veterans of America and one day I noticed that there was another page that came up before hours and it had an even larger following\nSo I investigated the page found out that they've been using our logo pretending to be us but they were sending everyone to a European\nWebsite the vets dot edu but that was the first red flag where it's you know these people aren't just trying to sell T shirts or something they're creating an entire environment to support the fake Facebook pages\nYou tell me about that what kinds of things where they using their page to say\nSo most of the stuff that this particular group of trolls was pushing a we eventually located them and in Bulgaria\nOne particular incident was there was a legitimate news story in rural Massachusetts there was\nA Vietnam veterans monument that had been defaced some kid took some berries and rubbed in on it but what they did was they took that local news story in loops the fifty second video for four hours as Facebook Live video\nAnd over that they put a phrase that said do you think the criminals must suffer and encourage people to respond\nNow it was based in truth but it was made to look more urgent and it looked like it was happening live this wasn't just you know one person in Bulgaria you know trying to build the following this was a conspiracy\nWhat I'm basically doing is is leaving a trail of bread crumbs so that Facebook's threat intelligence team can take the actual experts to analyze the data that I've found\nSo that they can get more information about who's behind it\nWhat does it do you think is attracting people as it is it because I could combine it with this kind of deep patriotic sentimental what's the appeal\nSo the reason why they are going to the right is because that's the type of content that the extreme right is producing organically\nSo blends in their goal is to blend in with and amplify the extremes in this country that the ultimate goal here is is not veterans is to make the United states in a permanent condition of paralysis they want for us to not be able to function\nSo yes this happened actually in February of where right groups and a Fifteen page letter to a TV station and in the letter besides a saying you know a few things about the night in question in Nineteen Ninety nine he talked about how much he wanted\nTo get to know chancellor Lee Adams and in fact\nThat he wanted to have custody of his son wants Sondra Adams died in fact in the letter he said quote come on this Adams you know you're not going to be around forever\nAnd that sort of sparked outrage as you can imagine that he has no real parental rights due to the prison of having been in prison for Nineteen years now\nLet me tell you a short clip from uh your your conversation with fungi ad was one of the many that you had with her over the years\nI'm Still failing forgiving and I'll what deals for him to me it's not but I Do want him to feel\nThe effects of what he did 'cause that's what I've been looking at every day since November sixteenth Nineteen Ninety nine\nI should mention that chance or has multiple disability a link to the circumstances of his birth I mean the fact that his mother was short was shot four times the fact that he was you know deprived of oxygen the fact that she was born\nOn several weeks prematurely nevertheless you said that she really made a big impression on you I Know that you've you've mentioned several times that sound to Adams has really had a big impact on you tell us about that\nShe has honestly I I mean the ... the love that she has for her disabled grandson is about is pure love as I've ever come in contact with I've been doing this a long time now and\nUh she is inspirational and one reason for the group pod cast was because I wanted more people to hear her voice it's one thing to see it in for him but when you hear someone talking about forgiveness for the for men conspired to kill your daughter it's powerful\nBut in fact that's kind of where I Want to end up here which is after spending all this time following this young man you know the highs and lows and the impact that he had on this family's life did you come up with a ... of a sense of why why did this happen to begin with\nMy only theory is that\nHe wasn't used to being told he couldn't do something at the end the court testimony it came out they're not here to impregnated in another woman at one point and had threatened her and kind of pressured her to get an abortion and that one and she did and that worked out and then he had had this other son\nOf four or five years before and then ... Adams was absolutely adamant that she was going to have this baby I do not think he enjoyed being told no at any point in his life\nAnd so that's the only I I guess you know there's far more to it certainly been just that but I think\nThat's part of it is that you know athletes have to learn that no means no just like the rest of us need to learn it and it's a it's a lesson that I think a pro sports is trying to teach but still has a long way to go\nThat Scott Fowler the Charlotte Observer he's produced a seven part pod cast and printed series called curve Ruth about re route who is released from prison tomorrow it's going to finally thanks for joining\nThank you so much [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nIt's been more than a month since natural gas fires and explosions ruptured across three communities just north of Boston thousands of homes there still don't have heat and now things are starting to get chilly in New England Craig lemoult of member station WBUR GBH has the story of families they're bracing for colder temperatures\nOn that September evening Kelsey grinding in Tim Kurdish noticed the smell of natural gas in Lawrence apartment\nAnd then we actually felt the explosion from the house I Believe on ... street\nAbout eighty homes into three neighboring communities Lawrence Andover in North Andover were on fire several houses blew up including one explosion that killed a teenager I mean if it's if it was scary thousands of homes were evacuated including theirs and they stayed with family for a few days\nBut they're back home now with their one and a half year old Ricky who titles around holding a rubber ...\nGrounded worked at a pizza shop down the street but it's out of work because it's been closed since the natural gas was shut off more than a month ago and they don't have any eat at home\nAnd the cold and then here I mean we're in a basement apartment so naturally the concrete as it got me call just what that alone\n[noise]\nA small space heater sits in the middle of the floor Ricky keeps tunneling towards hot\nDon't touch that pain can since the incident utility\nColumbia gas has been working to replace forty four miles of old pipeline there also busy replacing thousands of damaged furnaces water heaters in home appliances and they say they're on track to meet their target restoring all service by November nineteenth Curtis doesn't trust that'll happen and says he just doesn't know when they'll have heat\nNope no idea I don't even know how this happened you know that's\nUnder investigation a preliminary report faulted Columbia gas for not taking proper safety measures to prevent the disaster as it gets colder utilities putting people up in temporary housing and grinding says she's been trying to get one of those spots they told her the family could have a hotel room in Nashua New Hampshire about twenty miles away\nSo unfortunately that's not gonna work we don't have a vehicle\nAnd her stepfather who also lives with them is getting cancer treatments nearby and can't be that far away Andrew mailer the manager of north Andover says a lot of people would rather stay home\nBut I think as it becomes multiple days of the next week or so were steadily in the thirties up in the evening that's not something that can be sustained in a safe way\nEspecially since there is a real concern that some space heaters might start fires Columbia gas spokesman dean Lieberman says they've taken in more than Twenty one thousand claims from customers for everything from damaged appliances to lost wages and they place more than ...

future tickets at LA film dot com [noise]\nWelcome back to the frame I'm John horn and today we're visiting with Mike sure ... on the universal what were they produce the NBC comedy series the good place\nTo show recently launched its third season and what began as a show which for people find themselves in a bizarre afterlife\nThat first seem like heaven but was actually kind of held by now has proven to be a show about people grappling with what we're all grappling with on some level and that is how to be a better human ears ...\nI think that the response I've gotten from people who are fans of the show has overwhelmingly in a very flattering way and I think might get this too is like\nThank you for making a show about being good in a time where he feels like a lot of things are bad and people are not treating each other well like it's easy to write off and say hey it's just a TV show cares but the truth of the matter is is\nWhat an incredible privileged to be able to make things that get blast into people's homes and these ideas that you played out into the world are things that they hear and internalize and think about\nAnd so the fact that the show has resulted in people saying like it's actually made me think about how they treat people in being a good person and ethics like that to me is is the most rewarding thing that can come out of it\nAnd Mike what about you in terms of like the workplace because\nThere have been a lot of stories over the last couple of years but you could written these stories for decades about the way that people are treated in Hollywood but it could be people of color could be women could be people with disabilities\nIt could be pay equity there are any number of issues that this town has not been really good about\nSo when you're thinking about how you're going to apply ethical behavior to the running of your own show the way you're going to talk to other people the kinds of people you want to work with the kinds of people you're going to fire because you don't like the way they behave\nDo you feel that you were a different producer having thought about these issues in making the series\nUm I think I'm a different person and I suppose being a different producer would be part of that I've become more interested you about more aspects of human life I'm an ethics because of the show I I think that would be accurate to say I would also say\nThat um you know you said that Hollywood has not treated certain people so well let's be clear Hollywood is treated almost everyone terribly Hollywood as a shameful and miserable passed\nAnd frankly present about all people of color all women especially a it's only in the last couple of years that most of the\nMisery that Hollywood as a machine has created has even begin to come to light\nAnd um it's disgusting it's horrible it makes me feel ashamed to be a part of the industry I'm thrilled that it's changing which it is it's finally being exposed and it's finally sort of like coming out of how deep and systemic problems really are\nThere's a thing that happens in Hollywood because creativity is elusive and its gossip rumor and it's sort of it floats in the air and no one can quite defined it or recreate it sometimes you know it's what does it mean to be a movie star who why is this person a movie star why is that person not a movie star how is this you know writer\nCapable of writing this amazing thing and then one year later this terrible thing it's it all feels very slippery and as a result when people sort of a show it for whatever reason they have the ability to be consistently\nGood at what they do in the past they've been allowed to get away with anything and that is how monsters are made its its when they're the system of basic human checks and balances breaks down\nPeople get away with anything they want if they're making enough people enough money and if they are ... if they're sort of like just driving forward in this kind of crazy big power machine\nAnd I as a result it's one of the ... one of the bad side effects of that is if people have begun to say for years and decades have said\nWell I this part of the creative process right this treating people terribly it's just like that's you just have to accept that as part of the creative process\nThat's saying no you don't it's no one should ever treat people terribly for any reason and certainly it doesn't there's certainly no moral calculation where you'd say like it's okay to treat people terribly in whatever way that means\nIf you create something good I mean that's absurd what kind of world are we living in if it's okay to be deeply cruel to some people in order to get something like a a good like screen play or something that's an insane calculation that people made and have stuck to for decades and decades it's finally changing your you finally began to see\nCompanies and individuals and people in Hollywood say we're not going to tolerate terrible behavior in exchange for either successful product or just creatively interesting product and thank goodness\nMike let me ask you this last question I think what's interesting and this is totally anecdotal is that the show was watched\nBy families how unusual is that for you to have a show where families watch a show that's hitting people at very different levels based on their age their education and where they are in life\nThat anecdote of like I watch it with my family has been said to me about parks and recreation it's been said about Brooklyn nine nine um it was said about the office which I did not create or adapt that was great Daniels but I wrote on that show\nAnd um I think that if there's this sort of unifying idea behind all those shows it's that first of all there on NBC and so there's less you know cursing and nudity and stuff and parents feel like it's a little bit safer even if some of the humor is a little bit more adult but it's not so adult that you have to worry\nBut I think that those shows are ensemble shows they have a large number of characters who represent a large number of viewpoints on the world um and there is some kind of unifying theme there that I learned from Greg which is that\nYour life is your relationships with other people at some fundamental level that\nIs what makes your days pass it is your sort of bonds with other people that matters in the world and so I Would guess in this I'm not a psychologist but I Would guess that if there's a reason that families gather to watch those shows that has something to do with it [noise]\nMy can Jen thanks so much for but it has come visit thanks for having us ... make sure it's the creator of the comedy is a good place Jens that as a writer and producer on the show it airs

it in Trump says the U.S intends to begin cutting or reducing aid to three Central American countries for failing to stop thousands of migrants were heading towards the U.S speaking out of a trip to taxes is his reports Senate Republican Ted Cruz Trump said those countries have received millions usa dollars over the past fiscal year\nThe president does have some latitude to curtail aid payments lawmakers might not like that's the top Democrat on the house foreign affairs committee has already lost a protest but presidents in the past have used this power to hold up to countries they don't believe are acting in us interest\nNow aside from his authority some of the experts I spoke with said it would be counterproductive for President Trump to follow through on this trip they say cutting off aid might just make conditions in the Central American countries worsen created even bigger push for people to try to pack up and escape from the north\nHas called on Mexico to stop the caravan and said that if that doesn't happen he will call up the U.S military and close the southern border I mean he is commander in chief so can he unilaterally do that\nTrump and other presidents have mobilize the national guard in the past uh usually in cooperation with state governors you might remember that President Trump mobilized about four thousand guard troops this past\nSpring to lend a hand with more security in general those guard troops have been playing a support role they're not actually patrolling were sealing the border\nBut also that's not really the point you know the migrants the president's been talking about are not as a rule trying to evade the border patrol on the country they have been deliberately turning themselves in when they reach the border and asking for asylum so it's not really clear what bringing in more troops would actually accomplish\nHe's trying to turn away migrants if they don't first apply for asylum in Mexico can enforce that\nLongstanding federal and international law says immigrants who present themselves at the border\nHave the right to seek protection as refugees at least to apply for it and that's what many of the Central American migrants have been doing many of them are also doing so in family groups and that has posed a challenge for the administration because it limits we've talked a lot about on detaining young people for example\nWe have seen a surge in the number of family groups crossing the border illegally but we have to keep this in perspective overall the level of illegal border crossings is still way down from its high point around the year two thousand okay\nAnd how we heard in the interview with reporter James Frederick just right now migrants advocates\nAre refuting Trump's claim that Democrats are to blame for the caravan of ... what are you know about that are these threats just a ploy I had a ...\nThe the president has been claiming without evidence that Democrats want open borders a lot of Democrats the point to the two thousand Thirteen bipartisan bill that passed the Senate actually would have substantially beefed up border security\nBut that said this is certainly an energizing issue for the president's base and so it's no surprise he's stressing it not only on his Twitter feed but at the campaign rally she's been holding around the country\nWith just over two weeks to go before the midterm elections\nAll right That's NPR's Scott Horsley thanks Scott you will come\nFor years airline passengers have complained of being squeezed
