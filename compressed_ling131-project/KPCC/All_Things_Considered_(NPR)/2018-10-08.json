{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "I was a marine detaches car they had stopped at a gas station they let the gas station and we're driving down this a highway when\nHe and his little cousin or get pulled over by to a white officers\nDoctor said he saw him without a seatbelt turns out Rodney was wearing a seatbelt and these two officers approaches vehicle one is kind of standing in front of the car about several feet away towards like the driver's side and off two approaches his window according to run these cuts and says boy why didn't you pull over sooner\nAnd a and then orders Rodney to put the current park and ride he's got both hands at this point on the steering wheel and he reaches down to put the current park\nAnd this is where things in this story started to bridge because the cops said the Rodney put the ... part but then quickly put it back and you drive accelerated at the officer in front of the car Romney's cousin gets two conflicting accounts as to what happened there was apparently and I witnessed across the street who said the car had yet to move\nBut what is clear is what happened next which is the deputy in front pulled his gun fires two shots into the windshield the debt you right by the door\nHere's the fire he pulls a gun and fires twice\nOne bullet went through brownies left hand which you put up in self defense another bullet entered through his left temple and the car lurched forward and Koreans across the street for about three hundred yards until they clashed with this gas station rod nice cousin at this point gets out of the car fleet from the scene unharmed then she paramedics arrived and pronounce Romney's got at the scene\n\nIn my mind is always on Rodney with us she says when she does think about that night she always comes back to this one question\nWhy would the gospel why why what ... what was that all about what do you think the answer he's black and it's just it\nZero moment where you try and put yourself in the mind if those two officers\nAbsolutely not because I Would never do I see it like that that never how long I Would never do that\nYou feel like it's like ... do you feel like the cop in that moment it's rod nice black is what frightens a cop and that's why he pulls this guy no\nNo he's a bully yeah let's see if somebody gets hurt us the money gets injured or killed he's going to get off he's behind that blue bad she's ability is that what you think of cops like writ large that's how it is that's exactly how it is no ESPN and that's about it\nBecause it's hard for me 'cause I think like like it's clear that there's discrimination that exist within the police force and the people who they are sworn to protect and serve but like at the end of the day there's probably a hand like oh I don't know I couldn't give you a percentage but a number of officers and which like\nYes they are probably violent individuals who don't belong in a police force but I Would assume that like a majority of the cops meanwhile\nHas probably probably have some sort of biased where they don't think I see a black person and I'm like I'm going to get that boy bite that there is like a like there's some sort of triggered response and and that the police\nAre constantly being put into different situations where they feel under threat and concerned and that like just like a whole host of factors leading to these moments where somebody is shot and killed it's not just sit there out your polling people as\nYou say that because you're you're white\nThat's why you say that I tell you what I tell you what we can try this go to my sister will make sure we could each week they'll ten Islam get yourself spray black and I guarantee you get a different response\nOkay you try I bet you we can make you look like a black boy I'm telling you you'll see a huge difference\nAnd that's just it like sitting like sitting there\nIn that moment I I felt I felt the Gulf and I just kept wondering like\nHow long does it take to fill that golf like how many ... what does it take a how many conversations to happen\n\nIn any case um do you want us to Ben still had to give ... those files on Rodney to get those documents for yeah for sure okay [noise]\nYeah same grab this huge folder of paper out of the trunk of our car walked back inside [noise]\nUm sent put the stack of brand new files on this glass kitchen table so [noise]\nUh like ten a\nCrime scene photos [noise] because I don't want to be the person\nTo give you those unless you want me to go get 'em right now\nBut there are [noise]\nYeah when I'm ready out [noise]\nSomething and then eventually the [noise]\nThree days later Natasha contacted Ben and said that she was ready to see those photos\n\n\n\n\nHuge thanks to

failed to stop at an intersection crashing into an an occupied SUV before landing in a ravine everyone in a limo Eighteen adults were killed along with two pedestrians National Transportation Safety Board chair Robert Sumwalt says it's one of the worst accidents he's seen in a while\n[noise] well I think they're very very serious the degree of polarization is the single biggest weakness in\nAmerican society and in the American political system which means that we can't make routine decisions like appointing Supreme Court justice it also means that it's seeping into society so it's not simply that were disagreeing over\nYou know policies like abortion it also means that as Americans as as individuals we are increasingly just trusting one another disliking each other on a on a personal basis and\nYou know I think the the hearings demonstrated that we're even perceiving the same events and the same facts in such different ways that they're really doesn't seem to be common ground for having actually a civil discussion and so I think this is a continuation of a process it's been going on for quite a few years now but it's really accelerated I think in the last two\n... and ... with you because you wrote a piece in the times where you mentioned that people across the west are expressing these concerns with not just in the United states but you also said that understanding history would give us optimism for the future what makes you so sure about that\nOh well if you trace the oscillation the ups and downs of the Democratic project\nReally on both sides of the Atlantic you need to have I think that transatlantic might that I'm not just saying that because I'm calling you from Prague at if you do that you see that ah that\nAre democracies have come through equal and greater challenges are more substantial than the ones we face now often there's agreement there was disagreement about\nUs entry into World War one time disagreement before World War two the Marshall Plan was fully funded until after the Cold War at but God and every time we're able to come together is the genius of the Democratic\nProject chartered in my new book the last ... looking at that century from here in Prague and so I'm confident\nThat we'll be able to overcome that and perhaps the last\nYear I might take a caption perhaps\nThat's his view is I think it's a symmetrical do not think this is a matter of both sides I Believe that there was a tremendous breaking the Democratic process in the way that Kavanaugh's nomination was handled and no one\nWants to redress those you know as we always are I think we'll get back to the U.S has a more normal ... democracy that instead of its current extreme version\nI invested or what should we do about it then\nWell I think on the on the uh\nTake the example of the\nThe Kavanaugh nomination um uh but there's so much more and the Trump Administration they the same could be set up we need to acknowledge what the baseline it this was not a normal process I worked when I was in the White House on two Supreme Court nomination\nWe turned over every page of justice Elena Kagan as White House documents as White House withheld hundreds of thousands of pages you had\nAn FBI investigation I wrote about what a normal one would have looked like I mentioned to many of them mhm this was an abnormal unlimited one you had an extremely unusual unprecedented\nParty's been shipped by the nominee I knew\nYou know what I'm going to ask you we don't have we have limited times I'm going to ask you briefly to tell us what direction we should go in going forward and then I Want to turn it over to the professor again\nWe have to acknowledge what was wrong and it must be made right I Believe there will likely be some regrets in the mid term\nUh when some more accountability may come to at least want it not both houses of Congress and that read drafts will help heal what broke\nProfessors you actually belong to a project called better angels which is an effort to bring conservatives and progressive together to reduce polarization used very it's very structured it's very intentional oh how is that going and what do you hope to accomplish with this\nIt's one of a lot of grassroots efforts to build civility across the country but\nI actually think that that by itself is not going to turn on the trick because this is something I think that really needs leadership I I agree with the ambassador that the the blame has not been symmetrical I mean we have a president who instead of trying to actually unite the country around some common interests has done everything in town\nOr to try to increase the degree of polarization\nBut in a certain sense that means that uh you know there's grounds for optimism because if it is a result of\nThis kind of what I Would regard is really bad leadership it means that somebody with a different agenda you know could actually begin to emphasize you know common national identity things that are Americans actually hold in common and walk us back a little bit from the precipice of ...\nFor ... really have a minute left So Professor ... leadership is not there what should people be doing in the interim\nShould vote I mean I Do think that fundamentally you know a lot of this is a political fight and\nI think that if you're you know I I really do think the upcoming election in November is one of the most important in American history because I Do think that that's the ultimate way that Americans have holding their leaders accountable and there's going to be big implications drawn depending on the way that this election goes and I think that's really\nThat's the way that in a democracy you exercise your agency and you you know express your democratic will\nSo much more to say I'm Sorry we're running out of time but more to come hopefully we'll have this conversation again and we'll talk about how things are proceeding in that way that's

prominent Saudi journalist has been killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul the Saudis denied us the journalist is ... he's been a vocal critic of the Saudi Government and he's been living in Turkey in self imposed exile\nEarlier today we spoke to Dominic Avon's he's the Reuters bureau chief in Istanbul and he says ... went into the Saudi conflict last week to get some documents or his upcoming marriage\nAnd he never came out\nOf them ... days four days off to you went to the mall we had from Turkish sources bought their initial assessment was that he had been killed inside in what they said was premeditated murder\nIf that is true that the Saudi Government has indeed killed ... can you can you give us a sense of what he has written about that has so tremendously offended the Saudi Government\n... important to remember that he's not always been seen as an opposition journalists for for many years he was he was a a newspaper editor in Saudi Arabia he also worked as an advisor to have a a prominent Saudi ...\nOn on on a year ago last on the right to say he was worried about possible retribution for what he was watching he has been critical of\nSaudi Arabia's foreign policy including the war in Yemen and he has also criticized\nThe Saudi just shit or just come down on dissent within the kingdom\nI understand that Saudi diplomats gave you a tour of their consulate in Istanbul to try to prove to you and and other reporters that Reuters that cause Yogi was not there I'm curious how convincing was that tour tell me about it\nWell it was certainly a very unusual event as you say we went to the consulate\nWe interviewed the consul general to repeat what Saudi Arabia has set a schmuck shirts you went in on Tuesday I left shortly afterwards he then showed us around the country so that you said this was an extremely unusual never done this before but they were trying to show\nThat ... with not being held in constant so they took us from the talk to the awesome on the even the ...\nConditioning when they open the cupboards yes to show that there was nothing suspicious that exactly\nBut to show you that he's not there doesn't exactly disapprove he hasn't been abducted and detained or killed somewhere else\nYou know I'm not trained investigator that we were carrying out such but it was their attempt to show transparency to show up enough to show cooperation\nAnd Turkey's president has spoken out about this thing that they will investigate what is at stake for turkey\nWell sucking Saudi Arabia are hot pretty ... relations in recent years at the same time it's been interesting that although we've heard from him name sources under the ... the president\nAbout this allegation the president has not publicly come out and launched so scale criticism of Saudi Arabia reflection of you know the you know what may be at stake and if there were a full scale route between the two countries\nIt is confirmed that the Saudis killed show the how might that impact the US's relationship with Saudi Arabia [noise]\nShe wants to show you with us resident us restaurant he has written for the Washington Post so they're all us connections that it would also look pretty bad for the United states will or any western country not to take some kind of response to the country\nAnd again we're talking hypothetically not not improved but if it's

Chang we're going to take you back now to the late Eighteen hundreds when eating food in the U.S ... taking a calculated risk\nThe country was growing people were moving into cities and industrialized nation Gaye food producers new sometimes dangerous ways to stretch their products they were very inventive\nWith fake re back then because there were no rules against it right it's completely legal to do whatever\nThat's author Deborah Blum her new book explores that era before the U.S enacted food safety rules my co host Ari Shapiro talk with her about it\nThe book is called the poison squad one chemists single minded crusade for food safety at the turn of the twentieth century I started by asking\nDeborah Blum what someone living around Nineteen hundred might find in everyday foods like coffee candy or milk\nMilk was a great example of just how bad things could get for a number of reasons one dairy man seeking to sort of stretch their profits would Senate with water it wasn't always clean water at one point there was actually a case in Indiana which it was pond water pond water\nBond water and and and it was a notice when the family found worms wiggling and the bombs\nAnd pond water was actually some of the safer stuff the milk was contaminated with\nThat's exactly right because once you would then the milk you add to reconstituted in all kinds of weird ways what shocked us that people were plastered us in a\n... a coal tar dies and sometimes toxic dies like yellow lab ... make it more gold and again instead of kind of grayish are bluish and then because it was prone to rot so this is before ... and before refrigeration\nThey would dump preservatives and and the most popular one was formaldehyde which is an embalming compound\nWhich is not good for humans to ingest\nNo and so you actually go out and can see the newspaper headlines around the country during this period was embalmed milk\nScandals so along comes the protagonist of your story Dr Harvey Washington widely and his title is she ... the U.S department of agriculture why did he care so much about this issue\nAlways thought of him as kind of a how holy roller cameras right you of Harvey Washington while he was the son of itinerant preacher and farmer in Indiana he was\nFather was a conductor on the underground railroad he was really raise I mean there's a real mid nineteenth century kind of child and he was really raised to think of what he did needing to be a higher call it and he would describe chemistry that way chemistry in the service of good\nAnd so when he became the chief chemist at the U.S department of agriculture I mean this is at a period where there is no FDA there is no consumer protection agency this tiny group of chemists that he commanded at the department of agriculture was it\nAn food safety he took up that cause\nAnd your book is titled the poison squad comes from project which he undertook it really shows his commitment to this uh described the poison squad was\nWell this is an experiment you could never do today because he basically goes out and recruits other people at the department of agriculture\nEspecially young clerks to volunteer to dine very dangerous lay and so the idea of the poison squad\nWas that three three meals a day seven days a week super fancy meals are cooked by a professional chef all the ingredients are amazing and they only catches you have to agree\nThat half of you at any given period in this experiment are going to be adding capsules that contains suspect food additives\nAnd the other thing about it when you say is this crazy or what you were testing\nSuspected toxic compounds on human volunteers\nWas that he felt that was the only way he could deal with this you had this rising tide of really dangerous food additives there was no safety regulation how do I make a case that perhaps this is not a good idea I'll just tested on people and so he did\n... no one surprise if you feed people formaldehyde arsenic or lead they will get sick and when you demonstrate that why does it still remains so difficult to outlaw formaldehyde arsenic or lead in food why was it just not an obvious thing that everybody got on board with right away\nAnd doesn't that sound like the most logical response so look you've ... you've poisoned people let's get that out of the food supply the the food industry\nHad been organizing itself to fight regulation probably at the point that widely starts these experiments in nine to you know to he had been advocating advocating advocating and working with congressman to try to get some kind of basic consumer protection ... regulations out there\nAnd if nothing else labeling and as he does these experiments and ads they catch national attention which they did they were a front page news there were\nSongs and you know musical numbers about them every one is suddenly realizing that there was a lot of bad ... stuffing their food there's just a lot of bad stuff in their food and\nSo there's this in media push back\nRight in which suddenly congressmen or on the side of food business or getting offered more money and the food industry actually organizes they create a food Manufacturers Association and and and coalesce against making sure this doesn't happen", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "08"}
