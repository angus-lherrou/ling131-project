towards Iraq a bomb and has been of African American heritage well I never say that a President Trump and those around him created this they didn't but they they lit a fire uncensored\nSo walk me through the range of incidents that you were seeing emerge over the last several years\nWell during the presidential campaign the number of reporters who posted slightly critical things of a Donald Trump or even of millennia Trump we're bombarded with anti Semitic comments on a Twitter\nFacebook Instagram et cetera et cetera so online harassment online harassment but now we're seeing\nThat uh the online harassment can move further over to real danger and that's I think has left even people who have been somewhat are worried about this feeling much much more concerned about\nAnti Semitism also appears to be on the rise in in other countries it if you look at a incidents being reported in the u._k. and ... for example which has nothing to do with the political right here in the U.S [noise]\nUm well I think what we're seeing a certainly in certain countries we see it in Hungary we see it to a certain degree in Poland we've seen it with the AFC the alternative for Deitch land party in Germany and Austria\nIs a certain populism anti democratic liberal democratic as as as one leader called it populism a which plane paints Jews in traditional anti Semitic stereotypes they control the media they control the finances\nThey are foreign to our country a et cetera [noise]\nSome\nJewish families are drawing parallels in light of this past weekend events parallels to Germany in the Nineteen thirties and I want to put that to you for some historical perspective on this I mentioned you're a professor of Holocaust studies\nDo you see parallels or are we nowhere near that point yeah um\nI see certain parallels and I see certain ways in which the analogy does not apply at all in Nazi Germany this was the government doing this\nUh what we're seeing in this country in terms of anti Semitism is may be a willingness on part of ... certain segments of the government and certain people in government\nTo look the other way but this is not government sponsored\nHowever there are parallels a the parallels in the attacks on democratic institutions or institutions which are at the bedrock of our\nDemocracy the judiciary are elected members of Congress you can disagree

more today about the man who's believed to have killed eleven worshippers at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday he was arraigned in a courtroom in Pittsburgh earlier today\nJulie turkey which has been reporting on his background for the New York times and she joins us now welcome thank you thank you for having me you've been speaking with people who know Robert powers including a childhood friend of his what have you learned from them\nSo most of the people that we've spoken to describe him as very quiet very isolated lived alone to watch television in the night he used PO box for not the sort of a mailbox and his apartment which is just south of synagogue\nBut I spoke to a friend of his has known him for years and years\nThey went to elementary school together they went to middle school together they went to high school together\nAnd he said that that I'm Robert hours as a child was very smart but also seemed to really struggle with social cues and the two of them were friends and they play together they were built things together that would keep things apart [noise]\nAh they would build bombs together and sort of pranks and law watermelons but as time went on the cure them sort of grew apart\nAnd Robert hours became quieter more isolated\nAnd then in high school eventually just disappeared and it's not clear if she graduated and it's not clear to this man what happened after that\nPaint a picture for us of his life at this apartment complex the man you portraying your reporting almost seems like a ghost like he's not even there\nYeah um so he lived in is sort of low slung apartment building that twenty five minutes south of the synagogue\nAnd the people they're sort of described him as so unremarkable that they didn't even remember his name\nThat he was pretty much go she would come and go\nAnd sometimes disappear for days come back\nGo inside and that was pretty much it\n[noise] and there's such a contrast between vet demeanor in person and who he was on line tells about the person he was on social media\nYeah so at least in the last year he spent a lot of time on the Internet and see\nA lot of really terrible things about\nJews about immigrants he was clearly very angry and he seemed to find a like minded community on Gabrielle crucial media network that has become more popular\nAmong All right activists among white nationalist people whose views are on ... in places like Twitter and Facebook even the president and didn't escape his anger\nAnd he's interesting that the president had not gone far enough in completing the goals that Mr Bowers\nAnd can you tell whether those online communities shaped informed his hateful views or whether he just found a home for those pre existing beliefs when he joined these communities\nI don't think that we know enough yet to see that I think than is one of the things that he's going to come out over the next couple\nWeeks on the next couple of months as investigators go into his past\nWhat else are you still hoping to learn about him and his motives\nI mean we would certainly like to know more about how did she\nBecome as hateful as he did and how long I've been going on and what role do Internet playing\nDid the current political anger and conflict playing\nUh so I Know that investigators are going to be going through his computer finals are going to be going through his home they're going to be talking to folks who know him who might have worked with in family members friends I kind of thing\nBut Julie ... which is the New York times who's been reporting on the background of Robert Bowers the accused synagogue shooter thank you very much\nCan you President Trump will travel to Pittsburgh tomorrow at today's White House briefing press secretary Sarah Sanders condemned anti Semitism and said the hatred stop\nCritics of the president said his campaign rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as the country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd fears I usually Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all this hey there hello so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blamed the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or\nEven though the country's doing well and that the media beers responsibility for the divisions in the country and she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media\nAnd number two the marriage counselor had to be a woman why I just that I've asked myself that I mean part of it was that my marriage culture was a woman\nAnd I believe most marriage cancers are women and it just felt right it just felt like it had to be that way how similar is a marriage counselor and I spoke to the one that you used\nSo the marriage during the book is different but the themes of the marriage counts or the technique of the marriage counselor or very much the same way explain what do you mean one of those themes and techniques\nSo for example the marriage counselor says there are no deals you know you can't make any deals with each other we're not going to do exchanges of promises\nWere not going to say okay I'll do this and you'll do that and therefore marriage is all going to work out there is none of that you know to go to a marriage cancer who says that to you is really an interesting experience\nAnd then the second thing is if you want something from your partner you've got to make them want to give it to you so in the simplest situation if you want your partner to love you then you've got to become to kind of person that your partner's going to want to love\n... you know those are the kinds of insight simple but I think critically important insights\nThat my real marriage counselor and my fix your marriage counselor share\nWould you mind reading a section of the book for me no sure page thirty eight [noise]\nUsually Sandy didn't pay much attention to the world beyond her small office the illicit meeting in New York where the rest of them was going for the weekend what bill's wife knew everything that happened outside the office she didn't care to Sandy the important story was what happened inside or office\nIt was what you had to focus on it was the story it was what was really happening\nOf course all the time it was tempting to get caught up in the outside story the affairs the sex the trails the soap opera\nBut the real work was here insider office\nThat almost feels like a thief a statement for the ... it is actually and I put that in because I didn't quite trust of the reader to get it ... you know those two paragraphs or a marker for the reader saying look guys this is where the real story is\nI Know that's true of the novel is that really true in life it's hard to imagine that the trails and affairs cannot actually be what's important to whether American lives or dies\n[noise] I have to say that in the long run they don't matter the stuff that happens outside the office doesn't matter and and I can tell you that by analogy\nSo what happens in really good marriage counseling the marriage counseling illustrated in this book\nIs that by the end of the process when you really begin to get it when you can actually understand for the first time in your life or your partner is really saying to you you feel like a new person it's as if you shed everything that happened before\nRight I mean so if you had an affair before it's as if it happened to a different person that doesn't count anymore you're you're new does that make any sense\nIt does and it makes it sound like the marriage counseling is about much more than marriage it's about real transformation of each individual\nIt has to be it absolutely has to be and that's why it takes time because it's\nIt is not some kind of blinding insight that you're going to have oh God this happened to be and I was fourteen now we understand it I'll be different it's not about that at all it's about learning lessons that you should have learned when you were growing up maybe by watching your parents but your parents didn't have it together they weren't didn't have a great marriage\nIt's about learning these lessons of how\nYou can relate to the other person how you can understand what they're thinking and you have to practice you have to practice it again and again and that's that's what the couple of dozen this book there are certain little things that the marriage cancer leads them through for example throughout the book to show stopping to say I want you to look at each other and told me what you see\nAnd as you read the book you'll see that they see more as they learn more until they're really can see the other person in a in a deep and meaningful way [noise]\nI said that we only me three characters in this book which is not exactly true because the way you right that's right it really is sort of a fourth character there is which is the marriage itself it's the marriage itself\nAnd the marriage scouts are actually sees the marriage as a distinct and real character she's actually listening to the marriage as the marriage changes in the office\nAnd she's trying to get the couple to be able to do that as well to see their marriage as as something that they built over time that's very important and its allies in a way that's different from each of them\n[noise] marriage rates have been going down for decades according to the Pew Research center today just about half of it\nThat's our married down from about Seventy five percent in the sixties your book is clearly pro marriage why do you think this institution still matters well\nI mean you're absolutely right my book is pro marriage um but it's not pro marriage in any kind of transnational sense that we have to have marriage is pro an important relationship because it makes your life so much better you know I mean there's a reason that everybody wants to have a relationship it's like\nThe two of you individually are one thing but if you can get it together you literally become more than the two of you if you if you can create a important fulfilling relationship together\nDo you think every marriage could benefit from a good marriage counselor or is it really just sort of for people in crisis and dysfunction\nOkay I I think that every marriage could benefit from a good marriage counselor you know you may not have to go for four years\nBut I think that um you can really learn a lot I don't think you should settle for a marriage that just you know is okay I mean it's it's the critical thing in your life you want to marriage that's wonderful you want to marriage that that you can seal and talk to and that gives it back to you [noise]\nWell

Pittsburgh tomorrow to come for victims of Saturday's deadly synagogue shooting NPR's Scott Horsley reports the White House spokeswoman brushed aside suggestions the president's language has contributed to a hospital climate and the country\nBut head field says the president has ignored what Bowers posted online about immigrants\nThe reason he had targeted the Jewish community on this particular day is because he he saw Jews is helping refugees come into the country and the President Trump didn't mention that\nHad field argues there is a connection between the Pittsburgh shooting at the administration's rhetoric about immigrants\nHateful words always lead to hit blacks and that's exactly what happens here words matter and the especially matter when they come from the president of the United states\nWith just over a week to go before the midterm elections there is no reason to think that President Trump is planning to change his tone on immigration\nBy the end of his speech at the weekend's rally President Trump was back to familiar talking points about quote criminal immigrants and vowing to stop the caravan of migrants that's slowly making its way across Mexico to the southwest border they have to come in legally\nLike all of the people that are waiting on\nRight now they can break into our borders they're not going to\nToday the department of defense announced that the president is sending thousands of troops to the southwest border and the White House is mulling an executive order that were closed the border to migrants president supporters dismissed any connection between his rhetoric on immigration and the motivations of the Pittsburgh attacker\nTrying to understand this kind of behavior is impossible\nDan Stein is the president of the federation

Jewish community and across religious denominations\nAnd how are you talking like your members of the shooting I mean what do you say hey about something like this\nWe simply at this point to acknowledge just are deep sense of shock and sadness and how will support each other through this and we need each other will rely on each other and how the strength of our relationship tool will carry us through\nUm the image I've been coming back to is the way which Pittsburgh manufactured steel for so much of the last century and how that steel was strengthened and forged a in a kill\nAnd in that same way as we go through this this difficult trial I'm confident in our community will be strengthened thereby as well\nHave you heard President Trump is in Pittsburgh today and some Jewish leaders there asked that keep not come now at least not while the funerals are still underway right do you agree with them that it's just the wrong time for the president to be the thing\nI don't begrudge the president has visited all and I've been gratified by the comments he's made in the pronouncements that have come out of\nThe White House in recent days against anti Semitism but I'm troubled by the president's ah unwillingness or perhaps his inability to actually recognize the power of words and the responsibility has for the rhetoric that he puts into the public dialogue\nAnd in the absence of his taking responsibility for that I think he becomes a divisive figure for many and I worry that his being here is not going to be a source of comfort that you might hope it otherwise be\nWhat does the community needs now you think as as it is trying to ...\n[noise] I think this community needs time I think it needs the patience of our of our country and at the same time it needs a

up the heat or and and the the tree all on the defensive posture and instead what we really need to come together and appreciate the ideals upon which our country was founded which is a an embrace of of the refugee and a stranger and\nThose who want to make this land of opportunity there home\nRabbi Aron ... now and the ... congregation in Pittsburgh thank you so much thank you very much\nThe man accused of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting also frequently expressed hostility toward immigrants Robert Bowers wrote on line that he liked the idea of calling immigrants invaders\nThat echoes the rhetoric President Trump and Fox News have used to describe the caravan of Central American migrants still hundreds of miles south of the U.S border as NPR's David Folkenflik reports these connections are causing tension within Fox News\nThe Washington Post just reported the group of migrants quote looks like a less less massive exhausted bodies played in any available shade you might not get that impression on Fox News take Laura Ingraham on her ten pm show last week\nThe sympathetic overall coverage of this invading hoard if I Can't go to Karen is a misnomer and frankly sickening work\nSampled the chipper morning show Fox friends I've got so many emails from people who said don't call it a cat caravan call it an invasion yeah is that fair ... put the question to conservative pundit Michelle milk and\nOf course it is it a full scale invasion by a hostile force and it requires our president and our commander in chief ... any means necessary to protect our sovereignty\nCNN's Brian ... found that Fox News featured segments using the phrase invasion more than sixty times this month about the migrants on Fox Business network Lou Dobbs his program invoke get dozens of times\nTrump ordered five thousand troops to the border he tweeted yesterday quote this is an invasion of our country and Trump has without evidence claim to gang members and criminals and middle Easterners are among them\nOver on Fox guess have similarly without supporting facts suggested people from ISIS and the Taliban might be among those migrants even so the network's chief news anchor Shepard Smith tried to ...\nAnd the brakes yesterday Morrow\nIs one week before the midterm election which is what all of this is about there is no invasion no one's coming to get you there is nothing at all to worry about\nThis month Fox hosts and guess have repeatedly questions whether the migrants might bring an infectious diseases again without evidence Laura Ingraham we don't\nKnow what people have coming in here we have diseases in this country we have an ad for decades\nThat was just one instance the Lou Dobbs gently push back on such claims made by gas last night get last week dumped suggested the mailing of improvised explosive devices to prominent liberals might be a hoax he deleted to tweets on this subject after sharp on line criticism\nThe liberal investor George Soros who is Jewish was among those targeted by the would be male bomber Chris Farrell at the conservative group judicial watch appeared on ... show federal tied the migrants to soar us without any proof\nA lot of

from NPR News I'm Ari Shapiro\nAnd I know that Chang Saturday's shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh has focused attention on the rise in anti Semitic attacks an anti Semitic rhetoric\nAnd to talk more about anti Semitism and white nationalism we reached out to them on a Kaufman she works on racial justice issues in the Jewish community welcome thank you it's great to be here\nAnd we'll start with a very basic question but it's a question that's still confound me why are Jews such a focus for white nationalist [noise]\nYou know for white nationalist theirs is deep deep commitment to maintaining political historical um an institutional supremacy in the United states I'm an around the world in terms of you know global white nationalism there's a perspective that a certain kind of lightness is superior and\nA real intention to maintain that kind of superiority both on on the inter personal level in terms of attitudes or behaviors and beliefs and how to transpire between people\nBut also on institutional and national levels through our politics um through the way that we talk about documentary history on through the way that we manage our institutions and it's um an effort to maintain power and to keep people who are different um marginalized 'em and separated in in our communities\nYou mentioned in a certain kind of white nests in much of the American Jewish community is of European descent and identify as being white but you're kind of thing that makes no difference to white nationalist why do you think that uh\nEighty to Ninety percent of Jewish Americans are are white or come from a white background to white nationalist or you know are Jewish community here in the United states already comes from immigrant backgrounds are to come from backgrounds have strong ethnic identity when we came to this country\nAnd all we were among the whole group of people from different countries who were other because of our our our national origin and just certain kinds of white and as we're both elevated in celebrating in this country as far as history goes back\nWe should mention that you are Jewish but you're also black that for white nationalist hatred of Jews different from racism against blacks Latinos and other minorities that they see a threats\nPeople of color are visibly different and because of that we've been an easy group to target and we've been an easy group to keep separate\nFrom those who have more skinned privilege because their skin presents later or whiter and then in contrast we think about the hatred and Jews and if we assume that most user white in this country than we have to find another way\nTo separate Jews out and so this this particular brand of white nationalism in the United states as a particular kind of Christian white nationalism is designed to take away from this idea that we are stronger because of our diversity and to scare people into thinking we are stronger because of our individual identities\nSued you see something new about the anti Semitism we see in the U.S today I'm anti Semitism has persisted for centuries but if there's something different about it now\nWhat's different about this time is that we have people in power who are using their institutional positions that have traditionally been is designed to bring us together as a country to separate us of the country through anti Semitic you think that's new\nI think when we have our policy makers amplifying ideas as a real amplifying stereotypes as fact\nAnd using fear to marginalize Jewish people\nIn a way to elevate the fear mongers it is different and the other thing that's different is the empowerment of the anti Semite sue expressed their anti Semitism in ways that are terrified\nSaid what new strategies can we or the Jewish community in particular employees to combat the new forms of anti Semitism\nI think the thing that we need to remember\nIs that white nationalism is designed to marginalize all of us and so this is the most important strategy we can develop\nIs to come together to develop friendships and trust and relationships\nSo that when we need each other as neighbors and friends and when the white supremacist come knocking on our doors or when they come marching down our streets\nThat we know each one of us is going to come out of our houses to support the other that we will not question who needs who needs this kind of advocacy but it becomes part of our culture it as a as a as a as a nation and as a people that is our most important jobs right now\n... is director of the Jews of color field building initiative thank you very much for joining us today they so much with imitation with my privilege\nVictorious Boston
