at Pasadena dot edu\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm ...\nHurricane Michael the powerful category for storm that made landfall in the Florida Panhandle this week before moving inland and dumping heavy rains on Georgia the Carolinas and Virginia has obliterated some communities\nHave encouraged mob rule\nMob rule can was some sort of coordinated strategy this week he thinks that will Republicans who just happen to use the word mob\nWell I think they've decided this is a good talking point of course it wasn't all that long ago that the sound of a you know angry protesters was actually music to Republican airs back when it was the Tea Party\nA masters who were making it impossible for members of Congress to go to their own town halls without a police escort and of course we have a president in the in the White House who has on a regular basis encouraged people at his own rallies to inflict violence on on protesters there\nBut I think that the Republicans have decided uh first of all I guess piracy is nothing new in politics but they have decided that\nThey see their own base a lot more energized in the wake of this um this whole fight over Kavanaugh and they also think that\nThey can use this ... this idea of mob rule as a you know as a way of bringing home the idea of what would it be like if Democrats are given back any of the levers of power\nBut did it I mean the use of his were mob a lot of the protesters these Republicans are referring to are women could describing women's response to all of this mob like backfire for Republicans among women voters this maternal\nI don't think so [laughter] you know uh we we we ... we live in an age of political polarization on what what they call negative polarization which means you don't particularly have like your own party or you just have to really hate the other one so the crucial or the crucial issue is are you appalled\nDo field appalled at this moment and that's what motivates people to get active in the polls and Democrats have been appalled pretty steadily for two years the Republicans had little to be appalled about but now they feel really appalled\nAnd the core message in a world of negative polarization is the people who say you are bad a really bad themselves and this is essentially the message Republicans are now driving home and they've eliminated the Democratic advantage and in enthusiasm and in red states and blue states but in red states you begin to see the poll swing over to a Republican direction\nHow about that I mean David right both sides have clearly been galvanized by Kevin ... confirmation hearings were less than four weeks away from this midterm election turns you see this fresh energy driven by the confirmation hearings reshaping battle lines\nHave selected absolutely if you look at the polls and again we have four more weeks before this election and in this era for weeks is what you know for years used to be um it does appear that\nThat this may be helping the Democrats in the house races but it could be helping the Republicans in the Senate races in part because where those Senate battlegrounds are they are\nUh the the biggest prize is in this in the Senate elections are largely democratic held seats in states that Donald Trump won\nAnd um we are seeing a significant amount of movements in those polls toward the Republicans but do you think it could help Democrats and house races because of the suburban women don't it's about the the biggest battle grounds there are largely in the suburbs where we had you know again the the women's vote is going to be absolutely crucial\nOkay I'm going to switch gears now Karen\nLate last week you were a paper or the Washington Post had\nA big blank space on the opinion page where a column from one of your papers journalists democracy Yogi should have been ... has been a critic of Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman he's he disappeared about ten days ago after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and he has now\nSeem to be dead your paper Karen tied his disappearance all the way to the crown prince personally how your colleagues make that direct link to someone\nWell you're right that the you know increasingly the presumption a by intelligence sources on Capitol Hill in ... in the White House is that our colleague a Jamal ... is dead end that Saudi Arabia is to blame and one of the biggest pieces of evidence or U.S intelligence reports that\nThat shows that the crown prince actually ordered an operation to lure him back to Saudi Arabia where he was supposed to be detained that the timing of all this is unclear but it is\nUh if if what we're hearing from from Turkish sources is true which is that a essentially is a hit squad of Fifteen people was waiting for him in in the consulate\nUm it is just impossible to imagine that some kind of that an operation like that would not have happened without the knowledge and approval of the very top levels of of the Saudi Government\nAnd when President Trump was asked about 'cause she'll be in the oval office yesterday about an arms deal with the Saudis and this is how he answered\nWill like it John would all like if we don't like it even a little bit but as to whether or not we should stop a hundred and ten billion dollars from being spent in this country knowing they have four or five alternatives to very good alternatives that would not be acceptable but\nDidn't let me turn to be let me turn this you should the u._s. be selling arms to Saudi Arabia right now\nWill give the president credit for almost a usually when people sell their sole they tried to deny that there certainly is a pretty honest that were selling a democratic principles were selling human rights were

story is recovering at five thirty three\nLA Unified School administrators announced this afternoon that state mediation has failed the breaking impasse with the districts teachers union that means is only one stage of negotiation left before United teachers Los Angeles can legally call a strike\n... cc's Kyle Stokes has come downstairs to join us in Studio to break down the next phase of contract talks it's called fact finding ... give us an idea what fact finding is\nYeah so fact finding actually is kind of a misnomer it's not just about determining what's true and what's not there is actually a fact finder who comes in\nAnd says that and kind of take sides basically looks at the arguments that both sides have been making and in this case had been rehashing over about Eighteen months of a protracted dispute over what this contract should be a fact\nFinder comes in and decides basically\nWho's right who's wrong issues are recommendation in the end that neither side has to take that recommendation they can just ignore it if they want but after the fact finder is done that's when the district can you know kind of go to the nuclear option and impose its final contract offer or the union can say hey we're we have we've had enough we're going to go strike\nNow I have some experience with this because the same same kind of process when a happen at the California State University with the professors and the fact finder lean to the side of the professors and then what are you know settlement in putting me came pretty quickly is a settlement likely\nWell I I mean we're still seeing a lot of of disputes between the two sides right after the announcement that we'd gone to a ... a fact finding that mediation had failed the district issued a statement\nAs saying that they filed a complaint against the union for coming into mediation and basically not engaging\nAnd all that and he sent us it as a formal complaint from the district there the union came back and said well the district didn't offer any substantive proposals in mediation so the two sides are still\nVery part far apart if not in substance certainly in rhetoric how much of that is just noise I mean there's you know this is part of the posturing of this whole thing those labor expert I talked to today though said\nThat uh you know it's not that if you've gotten to fact finding there's still hope so I don't know if you're looking for hoping this whole thing\nYou know you've got that working for you that it's not over until it's over neck\nKP cc's Kyle Stokes a given us an update on the

Russian intelligence officers\nFirst we're going to dig into these headlines about the G argue Russian military intelligence and here to help us do that is NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre eighth grade and Hi Mary Louise so that you are you\nHas been around for a century since ah around that time of the Bolshevik Revolution but safe to say for a lot of us here in America the first time we heard about them was twenty six team that's correct\nFrom the election hacking but these are very busy guys and girls um\nThey have been involved in this ongoing case of to G R U agents the alleged agents who were accused of poisoning Sergei Skripal and Britain he's a former G R U agent himself who had had a trader this why spot flop was living in Britain\nThe difference though this case is filled with lots of glaring almost comedic screw up some first of all screw ball in his daughter survived the attack in March which was was clearly not the intent\nThat assassination attempts that did not manage to assassinate the two people who were being targeted go on that is\nCorrect and the two suspects were seen on the security cameras which are all over Britain and then the suspects go back or back in Russia and they make this very strange appearance on on Russian television to explain what they were doing in solitary\nBut if we were so the\nSo there are blaming their explain that solved there is this beautiful town and they were just tourists and of course if you were going to to England\nYou would make a trip to solve fair and just see this tower the hundred and twenty three meters high um and then they said well it was cold and fluffy and so they turned around after a couple of days and and headed back to Russia\nOkay so fast forward to this month to October and to some equally questionable spy craft on display and then other ones right\nAnd so this is sort of the follow up the Dutch announced that just last week that they've caught for they say gee argue agents ah with high tech equipment in a rental car outside the office for the prohibition of chemical weapons which was testing\nThe the chemicals apparently used in the attack back in March\nUm now they were caught in a rental car they apparently tried to smash some of this equipment one of the phones or was apparently traced to a G R U headquarters in Moscow had only been used a couple of days earlier\nEven found a receipt for a taxi or from the barracks to the airport in Moscow\nIt sounds so clumsy it almost makes you wonder if they wanted to be caught or at least didn't care if they were\nThink what we could say is they really don't see\nAnd to care if they're caught the Russians just deny deny deny on there's no indication that they're they're stopping these kinds of actions\nBut what does the U.S trying to do to stop these kinds of actions and we keep hearing about indictments for example against Jerry officers\nThat's right the indictments against you argue officers are seven were announced last week twelve from the Mueller investigation in July [noise] um so there was this naming and shaming in providing details that level we really haven't seen previously now one of the interesting developments is how to respond or two months ago President Trump has signed a directive\nThat would streamline the ability of a U.S agencies to to take action so this is something to look forward to do see if this detour as the Russians in any way\nThat parents garden ... thank you thank you turns out that the two Russian operatives behind the u._k. nerve agent attacks have their identities blown by a team of Internet researchers NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has the story of who they are and how they did it\nOkay so here's the one thing you need to know for this story everything is on the Internet\nA problem is is that there is no to the conclusion other than the Russians that was ... do the attempted murder\nBack in September British authorities held a press conference they released passport photo said names used by two men and they believe tried to kill a former Russian spy with nerve agent\nIs likely so they were traveling underwriters says I'm

he's an illustrator who collaborated on such a companion with Lynn man well Miranda as in Hamilton Lin Manuel Miranda\nI was aware of him much earlier than he was with me [laughter] but eventually I think we just we started realizing that we were kind of floating in the same space and um that's sort of how we got to know each other\nThat's base was on Twitter of all places and that space was happy encouraging one Miranda want it to collect his daily tweets that he called the morning and night in a book he writes things such as good morning good gracious are smile is contagious and\nConnect then good gracious year one for the ages\nSon tweeted at Miranda that he had ideas about how this book come together and that is how Johnny son ended up illustrating around his words in their new book can morning goodnight little pep talks for me Andy you Johnny ... explains some of his thinking behind it\nThe Twitter feed and kind of social media in general is meant to be\nEphemeral and I think when when I moved from like on line to off when it becomes more of like this capsule or something\nAnd it's meant to be visited and it's meant to be a little more time with and I think the the difference between like the affair morality of social media and sort of the permanence of a book was the reason to do the book\nI Love that Twitter can be memorialized tastefully [laughter] so do you have a favorite illustration in this book or our favorite pairing between when a your drawings and one of lens tweets\nOh man there are so many I think the\nThe real joy of it was really working with Lynn to make sure that the illustrations were reflective of him we spent some time going through each of the tweets and he kind of gave me like the director of commentary of each kind of passage and told me like here's how he was feeling this day here's what he was thinking of\nAnd um the George for me was taking all of that stuff and trying to fit it into an image\nSo I was looking for you this book and I came across this tweet do not get stuck in the comments section of life today make do create the things let others tussle it out\nNeither Lin Manuel Miranda words that they made me think of you because because you started your whole public persona on Twitter any by definition you were stuck in the comments section\nOoh why Twitter why did you choose that medium to introduce yourself to the world\nIt's it's funny that they do you frame it as like choosing to do this thing because I think for me I just had\nTurned to Twitter as this organic way to sort of connect with people\nThey had um just moved to the U. S. for school I had a a grown up in Toronto\nAnd um I realize I had lost touch with a lot of my comedy friends and a lot of my writer friends in Toronto and so I sort of turned to Twitter because I've found a lot of people doing really interesting stuff on Twitter they were writing\nUm humor and writing fiction and just sharing interesting pieces and thoughts on that aspect of their lives on line and I thought like this is\nSuch a great space and community to play and and I just wanted to like I just wanted to be an optimist [laughter] I mean I mean it\nSeems easier talking about and say this is so vital and toxic and poison right\nAbsolutely I I absolutely don't mean to discount any of that because that is such a huge issue with um with Internet culture and just like the social media space in general um\nI I Do think though that there are pockets of of genuine like goodness and I think that's that's the really hard part to find is to is to is to find those find those people and find those communities that are just people trying to connect with each other and I think that's really powerful\nYou talk about dealing with depression on Twitter were you able to find a community of people who got what you were saying got your struggle like\nHas Twitter helped actually deal with that part of your life\n[noise] [noise] yeah absolutely I think it's actually it's I feel like it's the other way around where like Twitter was the thing that made me understand my mental health better ... like I had not grown up knowing that therapy was\nAn option for me and it was it was only after I got on Twitter and sort of started falling a lot of people and I saw them talking about\nMental health I'm really for the first time in an an stigmatized away and in a way that felt just normal and every day I realized a lot of this stuff is stuff that I feel and they started talking about therapy and\nI thought maybe this might be something that would help me\nAnd it turns out that it did help me and it turns out that um I Do suffer from anxiety and depression and um\nAll of that stuff I Would not have realized that I Would not have sort of um\nBeen able to address had not been for signing these people on line that we're talking about it yeah so yeah and so I feel like this enormous I guess responsibility to pass that forward in the hopes that it might reach someone else\nJohnny son he illustrated and new book by Lin Manuel Miranda called the good morning goodnight little pep talks for ... and ... thank you very much for speaking with that this is science thank you so much for having me this is such a pleasure\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\n[noise] support for NPR comes from this station and from PBS with the eugenics crusade American Experience explores the history of the early twentieth century campaign to breathe better American rates the eugenics crusade Tuesday at nine eastern on PBS [noise]\nFrom Elijah crank family owned makers of small batch Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey Elijah crank ...

house arrest he's case considerably strained relations between the U.S and turkey just over an hour ago he spoke at a press conference at the White House with President Trump\nWe want to spend time with our children especially and then take some time to pray and we love this country\nAh last night we arrived in Germany and the ambassador to Germany met us there at one thirty in the morning I couldn't believe it and he had an American flag that had flown over the Berlin and I took it and I very naturally just I just\nI Love this country and we prayed for this\nWell Tony Perkins they commission there with the U.S commission on international religious freedom a company pastor Brunson on the journey back from turkey so how's the ...\nAh he's doing well or he uh I can see the the relief come over him when we were wheels up out of turkey a friday night and ah once we got out of the Turkish airspace or he began to relax\nAnd then of course when we uh we stopped we were stopped for about seven hours in Germany and then made our way of today and to to D.C and as we got closer\nCloser some anticipation he hadn't seen his children in a while it was it was a ... a sea of emotions I think that came over him as he and his wife both as we landed at Andrews Air force base\nAnd did you get any sense from him of weather when he turned up for the hearing a few days ago whether he knew he was going to be released\n[noise] no no one knew exactly what was going to come of a friday's hearing\nIn fact a there'd be hearing a started off with a two witnesses retracting their statements are saying that their statements were incorrect so it looked like the government's case which was in a case to begin with what was their here say was falling apart but then the prosecutor in the afternoon\nOr read by the sixty two page or what's similar to an indictment a calling for him to be in prison and removed from house arrest and that was his greatest fear is that he would go back to prison\nAnd so at that moment panic came over him and his wife and his supporters that were there and that lasted for about forty five minutes until the judges or a recess came back in and then issued their opinion which led to him being able to leave the country\nAnd what did he say about the conditions in which he was held in how we go through it\nWas difficult I I didn't go into a a lot with him uh regarding the conditions I mean there were cramped conditions that initially but there was just the the the ... the ah confinement that he was not able to to move about he was separated from his wife or his family\nMany milestones within the family occurred during these are two years is daughter\nAh graduated uh got married uh there were deaths in the family and so\nIt's been a very very difficult ordeal and in part of it was the uncertainty not knowing and anticipating a potentially thirty five years in prison or ... that weighed very heavily on them certainly relief now to be back in the United\nStates and just earlier in the White House the president joked with the past that he so he didn't suppose you'd be heading back to ... any time soon but pastor Brunson said we actually had you know deep love for turkey in the Turkish people\nWe discuss that they that was why he was there for twenty five years or he loves the Turkish people and and what's fascinating ah John is that he harbors no bitterness no anger toward turkey\nOr he is just grateful grateful to ah to the United states to diminish ration President Trump the vice president secretary of state ... it's a great day for a lot of people here in the United states\nAnd that was Tony Perkins what did not Whitehouse press conference President Trump repeated what he's earlier in the day said on Twitter name they that they've been no promises made in return for the past is really\nThere was absolutely no deal\nFrankly the only deal if you could call it the deal is a psychological ones we feel much different about turkey today than we did yesterday and I think we have a chance of really becoming a much closer to ... maybe even having a very very good relationship we know the people as the pastor said these are incredible people\nSo that really no deal made and busted the rubber ... is a former U.S ambassador to turkey from two thousand two thousand and three and a scholar at the middle East Institute\nTechnically that's right but in fact the Turks are going to expect more than just is\nYou see thanks to president aired won and frankly the United states should be doing something now to show turkey that it really does want to move back to a closer relationship so uh I think we should be watching for what the us does that would make the Turks feel like\nThey can now um get into a\nBetter discussion and dialogue with us about the problems that still could front us\nFrom what might those things they want to get in return\nWell there are two or three options there a is a question of the tariffs on aluminum and steel\nWhich were the latest ones impose the latest uh sanctions against turkey another possible issue which is a great point of the American attention to the ... case\nThe fact that President Trump is going to receive hockey changing is the ah fiance of a\nA Mr could show me a is another sign of solidarity with the Turks in this issue\nYou'd take with a pinch of salt than the president's saying these two big stories happening at the same time ... in Turkey just coincidence he said\nWell in that sense in a chronological sense they were ... but in terms of substance or one gives the chance for the U.S to show solidarity with turkey a and in a way and at a time when it can't help but be beneficial\nPresident or the one for his part he said an entirely independent judicial decision same thing that you don't buy it\nThere is no independent judiciary in Turkey I Wish there were but there isn't\nJust one final thoughts way less than a month away from mid term elections in the United states watching those images that in the White House of the pasta kneeling and praying that with President Trump it's hard not to see that that is going to sit pretty well with evangelical Christians\nAre just a few weeks away from those elections\nThat is true this will be a a boost to a voter turnout and to the president's campaign before November six\nUsa usa a boost you think that the timing coincidental that\nNo it's not coincidental but in any case the\nTurks had the right to decide when they would release a pastor Brunson\nOctober twelve was a perfect moment for that to happen I think they were driven by their own calendar rather than the American calendar but these events all will help President Trump in the November six elections\nAnd that was the ambassador Robert Peace and bringing this additional use that to a close for me and the rest of the team\nIt's one fifty nine and coming up next on eighty nine point three

five house and thirty five Senate seats on the line every weekend leading up to election day we're here with a special broadcast\nTo guide you through what could move to vote this November I'm hammering this week one phrase dominated the political conversation angry mob\nHow President Trump and Republicans are using democratic outrage at ... confirmation to activate the G of the day but most people don't come out from mid term election\nAre these non why don't they don't and what would happen if they did [noise]\nAll of that and more after this news\nLive from NPR News in Culver City California I'm Janine hurts President Trump is celebrating the release of pastor Andrew Brunson was released yesterday from nearly two years of payment in Turkey Trump welcome triumphant into the White House today and thank Turkey's leader for the pastor's release\nUm and the like they were upset [noise]\n[laughter]\nYou know they were frustrated I Would say the violence quote unquote was pretty minimal and there isn't really that much violence now either but there is a lot more confrontation that sort of idea of civility in the public space has kind of gone away\nAnd you know not all Democrats are totally comfortable with this approach either they they may feel that it's good to be pushing back on Republicans on substance but they also worry and I've talked to him a particularly a number of aids who are working on political issues\nWho tell me that they are concerned that this could backfire that it could alienate people moderate Republicans or independents who had made up their mind yet who will start to associate these kind of tactics was all Democrats\nAnd that's not what they want right now when they're trying to be a bigger tent party rather than a you know at ... cultivating an image of themselves as simply the resistance\nI'm trying to figure out what exactly we're talking about here though are we talking about the women who came to the capital and told senators about when they were assaulted are we talking about people with signs out on the Supreme Court steps like where where does this become a mob\nYeah oh isn't that kind of the point of using the term on is that it it transitions away from the conversation about those very different groups of people that you're talking about and makes it a conversation about a group of undefined people right\nAh I talked to a George lake off who is a professor emeritus from a University of California at Berkeley focused on linguistics he is a liberal and he said that by using this you're you're saying that these are not rational actors these are people who are making a point that they feel passionately about\nTheir kind of acting irrationally and that they're not thinking for themselves or just part of this group think\nUnless the over think this this is about trying to keep the Republican base fired up after Kavanaugh getting confirmed we saw a spike and enthusiasm with ...\nAnd base during the Kavanaugh fight well there's a big risk that they won't be that motivated as one Republican strategist Ken Spain who was the communications director for the ... the arm that gets ... tries to get Republicans elected to the house and he said look Republicans have been suffering from an intensity deficit over the course of the last few months\nAnd raising the threat level will hopefully translate to generating greater turnout\nAnd he said this really has to do with those red states like Texas in Tennessee\nFor the Senate to try to maintain the Senate because this fires up Republicans\nThat was NPR's ... this is the politics show from NPR and we are talking to diminish go Ayesha Rascoe and Kelsey Snell Kelsey\nAnd that's precisely what McConnell said when I talked to him he said that this is coming at the perfect time that it's coming on the eve of the election and when I asked him to predict how many Republicans were going to be in the Senate next year he declined to give me an actual number but what he said to me\nWas that voters are going to know that the Supreme Court fight underscores\nFor Republican voters that the Senate is what he called in the personnel business\nAnd that the project of confirming judges is over for the last two years for President Trump is Republicans lose\nDemocrats reacting to all of this\nDemocrats haven't been really able to come up with them clear message and to frame the message in a way that people could relate to to to say that this is what we're fighting for this is what we're concerned about this is why people are out there screaming or why people were out there who why people may be so passionate\nThat they haven't been really able to articulate that\nWell we saw the former attorney general Eric Holder who's been involved in these midterms\nGo out and say ... says if you don't when they go low we go low we do\nThat for all kinds of outrage\nOn the right uh you know people going after him saying he was spring on violence and he said they should stop the fake outrage but it's certainly feeling them\nAnd it it seems like all of this moment people are tired when you talk about civility when you talk about uh going high they're saying that didn't work for it and they're saying that the other side has not done that so they would argue that the Republicans have not gone high\nThat the Tea Party was not polite that President Trump is not civil and he's he's not always polite and he says a lot of things are so why shouldn't they fight fire with fire\nWell also when I talked to activists up here a couple of them said to me that they don't see a point in being polite when they feel like they're ... they're very real risks to some of their core beliefs in the political system right now and then when\n... when President Obama was being polite it was when he was in power and that there's just simply a difference here that knew that Democrats feel that they have no power and the situation and their visceral reaction is coming from that place of of fear\nAnd frankly there's a frustration on the part of Democrats you know President Obama thought that he could get a lot of things done with Republicans and a good faith negotiating way and it just\nDidn't happen that was NPR's Ayesha Rascoe Kelsey Snell and medical ... thanks everyone thank you thank you and Dominican stick with it now it's time for race so she\nRuns the United states and\nThis and that is that people of color need your help we will never backed down from white and if we buy lately but\nEvery week we focus on one race in the country that speaks to a larger theme playing out in races all over the place this week we're looking at Minnesota's eighth congressional district diminished\nOut you're still with us and I want to bring in mark the deck like of Minnesota Public radio hey mark thanks for joining us\nIt's my pleasure I'm a big fan of the show thanks for having me\nOff thank you so mark what's it been like they're on the ground\nWell Minnesota's just a hot bed of political activity this year and not just in the eighth district remembers sooner Al Franken he resigned in January\nHis seat needs to be filled in a special election Minnesota center ... is up for her regular reelection Minnesota's also choosing a new governor and three new members of Congress were really busy over here\nYou know the sixty a competitive districts that the cook Political Report says either lean to one party or as a toss up only three of those are democratic held seats in Minnesota there are two of those seats and one of them is what we're talking about here today\nSo again we're looking at the age congressional district in Minnesota diminish ... who is in this race well\nThis is an open seat that's because the Democrat Rick Nolan who's the congressman holds the seat is not running for reelection in Minnesota the Democratic party is referred to as the Democratic farmer labor party and that candidate\nIs Joe ... he's a former state representative he's thirty two years old uh the Republican candidate is Pete Stauber\nHe's a St Louis county commissioner he's a retired Duluth, Minnesota police officer and there's an independent in this race to show how he's going to shape this race is going to be interesting his name is ray sandman people call him skipped so this is a district\nWhere in sort of an unusual thing for twenty eight team Republicans\nAre on off right and if Democrats want to try to take back the house they need twenty three seats to not to do that and you know they need to hold places like this if\nThey want to have a real shock marquee this district like\nWell it's massive it starts just north of Minneapolis St Paul and spends all the way up to the Canadian border it's really been a democratic stronghold Democrats have held at since Nineteen forty seven with the exception of a Tea Party upset in twenty ten\nEver since that upset if he has been in play Republicans every two years to have a run a campaigns that have come close to winning\nThey're very optimistic this time around because Donald Trump last Minnesota but one by almost sixteen percentage points when the district they think this area is one of the best if not the best chance for them to flip a seat\nYeah I mean this district is heavily union white working class it was actually\nThe largest wing of any district in the country from President Obama to President Trump and ... the demographics tell a lot of that store totally\nThey do and the Republican Pete Stauber has been campaigning since the summer of two thousand Seventeen he's doing with it with Donald Trump's blessing the president was here in June campaigning for him\nDemocrats on the other hand were taken by surprise when Rick Nolan said he wouldn't seek reelection earlier this year they fought a primary battle resented which came out on top but that was just mid August ... out a significant jump on Democrats at least when it comes to campaigning\nMark what are the issues at play\nMining is a big issue up in the district the third party candidate is talking about opposing the mind he says it could threaten the water resources that could have a significant effect on the raise the Independence Party candidates you support that would have otherwise gone up a Democrat\nBoth ... been talking also a lot about taking back our government here is a Democrat ... debate\nWith a ... control from the special interest in Washington DC and invest power and the people in rooms just like this\nHealth care is another big issue in this race ... like many Democrats is calling for single payer universal healthcare Stauber says it's a bad idea here is we're done if it's going after sub or on the issue at that same debate\nBasically feels like his vote doesn't matter he's unemployed he used to work on in the restaurant business but the last time he voted at all for president with two thousand four for John Kerry ah\nI just I don't think my vote matters not at all not on the hill or one popular vote we still have Trump for president so so that kinda makes you down a little yes\nAnd these are places and we thought is it a lot of the places we visited that often have pretty dire financial situations like that the poverty rate is particularly high and some of these places you'll meet a lot of folks who are unemployed\nAnd they don't feel like politicians come talk to them they don't feel like politicians are spending time with them and you talk to them about you know have you gotten mailings have you gotten leaflets none of them like their contacted by politicians even\nYeah I mean it's obviously something that President Trump capitalized on and twenty sixteen being able to run on sort of an economic populist\nMessage a and the cultural grievance message where he's able to talk to especially whites without a college degree to say that you're the forgotten men and women and we did see an uptick right from a rural voters in a lot of in a lot of places\nThat sort of helped Trump get over the line but I have\nHeard from a lot of people that they feel like their vote doesn't matter right because\nYou know you look at the electoral system and if you're a liberal state your state's probably going to go that way and if you're in a red state than your ... your vote probably going to go towards the Republican\nBut you know I Will just say that especially when it comes down to the local levels votes really can and do matter because I went and looked up at least half a dozen races over the past ten to Fifteen Years in state house races in particular that were decided\nBy one vote that's amazing that's incredible it's also incredible that lesson forty percent of people who could vote do vote in midterms\nAs only you know it's made easy you know we vote on Tuesdays ... which was designed for an agrarian society you know in November\nSo you know this has not been updated and we definitely have one party that has more of a sense of urgency to go and make these changes to make it easier to vote because a lot of these voters we've been talking about our core key democratic group\nYou're right to make and there's one other group actually I really wanted us to talk a bit about anti Europe intimate go they also tend to lean more democratic and those are folks have color in particular Latino and Asian Americans have really low voter participation rate there even lower in mid term election years\nAnd ironically the two fastest growing groups in the country\nBy ... exactly and and and so you hear this time and again and you can even go to places you know\nThis election cycle people have talked a lot about Beto O'Rourke who is challenging Ted Cruz in Texas for the Democrats or the Senate\nAnd and what that could mean and we have one of our colleagues who also went down and spend some time in El Paso\nThat is where ... is from and and she met people who didn't know battle was\nDidn't really know who's running for office and it just felt like they didn't put their face in politics because they felt like they've never banked on political institutions changing their lives and there's one woman in particular who made this point uh her name is Christina Rodriguez she was in El Paso\nBut I\nReally don't think about it\nI kind of sad to say but I don't think about like okay well what can be better and I think I Do what I can do to make my life I don't depend on them\nTo change things for me\nThat's an amazing quote there is this sense of powerlessness that I met from a lot of people that they don't feel like things have changed so therefore whoever's in office you know they're just sort of moving along because they don't notice a change from President to president\nAnd the races that could make the biggest difference in your life like maybe city council or school board or or the state legislature\nThose aren't the sexy races they everybody talks about those are the ones where it's really hard to get information about who the candidates are and that and that leaves people feeling like they they don't know who to vote for\nAnd it's a huge issue in the southwestern particular me look at Texas Arizona we were talking about Nevada where you have this huge surge of Latinos and yet\nOr not registered to vote so every time you hear people talking about how Democrats could turn Texas blue for example that is really reliant on Democrats being able to not just get Latinos to vote against Latinos registered to vote and then be fired up to vote for them and in fact there's actually a growing gap\nOr that's been seen between the number of eligible Latino voters versus the number of Latino voters who've cast a ballot over the years\nSo what would happen if all these non voters showed up on the first Tuesday after that first Monday in November well first of all they might not be able to vote because you have to be registered before the deadline so people need to go look that up if you're if you're considering it and many of those deadlines that attack\nBy the way or passed right but if that were to happen\nHey or polls would probably be a lot more accurate because we have a better sense an ability to to map out by demographics how people would likely vote or it would certainly changed the shape of not just the races in this country but I think ... has been making the point about public policy as\nWell that was NPR's off for holidays and medical ... thanks so much guys You're welcome [noise]\nThis is the politics show from NPR I'm camera Keith and it feels like there are always stories that we just can't get too because there's so much other political news so every week we take a few minutes\nTo dig in on some of those headlines that you may have missed and to do that we always have Ron Elving however I tell her time\nSo let's start with spying the Justice Department unsealed charges this week against a suspected Chinese spies for allegedly conducting espionage fill us in\nOkay that we're not talking about the usual kinds of cloak and dagger military spying here this is about high tech competition between major economies\nSo what does the U.S government allege\nThe individual in question the Chinese individual posed as an official of a tech association but was in fact when official in Chinese intelligence\nAnd he invited a GE engineer to visit China stayed in touch tried to get specific proprietary information and so he was arrested in Brussels by Belgian authorities\nAnd has been extradited to the United states to face trial up but this could be a big deal because even though it's economic as we say it's the first time someone believed to be in Chinese intelligence has been brought to the United states to stand\nTrial huh OK moving on the environmental protection agency has taken some new actions to weaken regulations is that right Ron\nThis was the week with the United nations came out with a big report giving the world's governments essentially a decade\nTo get serious about climate change before it's too late that got a certain amount of attention but not so much attention has gone to some of the individual things the EPA has been deciding are having to do with various kinds of pollution and this particular week\nOf the weakening of regulation had to do with just spending the scientific advisory board\nFor particulate pollution now that's the kind of air pollution that doesn't come at a gas form it's made up of tiny solid particles that can get into your lungs and this follows on the heels of other UPA proposals are weaker regulations on radiation exposure and mercury emissions and\nAh last month or so we were talking about the administration rolling back restrictions on methane emissions\nFrom oil and gas drilling and transport so when the president talks about all the regulations that he has rolled back some of those regulations have to do with the environment\nRight the last story involves health insurance plans and a vote in the Senate\nWe had a close Senate vote in fact as close as the Senate can be in a division between the two parties it was a fifty fifty built up perfectly but almost perfectly along party lines this week [noise]\nAll the way back into Obamacare they created these little short term plans they don't cover a lot but they're real cheap you could have this for three months as a kind of absolute minimum stopgap\nWhere you got a more permanent arrangement of the Trump Administration like those plans because they're cheap and uh so they said why just three months or let's let him go for a year and the Senate had a chance to roll back the change and that opportunity failed this week when the Senate tied fifty to fifty so the regulations remain in place\nRon tell us about the potential downsides to these plans\nThese plans don't have to comply with all the usual rules under the Affordable CARE Act so insurers don't necessarily have to cover all those basic things that people think credible care guarantees they will get perhaps including maternity care perhaps including emergency care perhaps including an ambulance that takes you to the hospital after a car accident\nAnd of course at the bottom line they also divert dollars and patients from larger insurance pool that makes Obama Care work so in that way it's one more way that the White House has managed to undermine log they could review\nThat is NPR's Ron Elving each week he catches up on some of the headlines that we might have missed because of all the other news is happening\nThank you Ron that you\nSo [noise]\nI don't think\nHe would say yes I think he would say now that\nJust goes back to ... [noise]\nI think spend so much more in a mountain was\nJust the possible side effects them off raining on that regional rent [noise] and how he might not turn out nearly the same afterwards\nIt was very risky\nThey altered the questions over and over in their heads for twenty four hours the truth is that they were faced with the small but very scary possibility that Spencer could die without the surgery so like most people do when faced with these options they opted for life with at risk that that life would be depreciated the audition\nFor potentially worse off life over the fear of no life at all and that Thursday they watch this into which we'll often brain surgery\nThey pay the holes in the hospital about round of coffee in the cafeteria [noise] just\nLiterally watched this analogue clock on the wall kind of ... through the minutes and\nI Would go to the cafeteria and playing the piano they hunt for gas and that calmed me down a little bit classical music is playing out of the time\nYou know finally Dr Kim uh came through the double doors into the cafeteria and he still\nHad his scribes on in his mouth was pulled down hanging around his neck and he looked or it's just it was just this little corner of his mouth that was turned slightly upward and that told me it\nIt went well and he said you did the right\nThing so [noise] yeah that sounds good [noise]\nVenture was alive he was vegetative but that was expected he woke up very slowly at first you couldn't walk or talk to take care of himself but over months and months and then we had with his family by his side he re learned it all\nAnd everyone was watching every step of the way to see if the surgery would had to pass right through every important region of the brain had somehow fundamentally changed Spencers spending [noise]\nHe and his career had come true [noise] I feel like\nBefore my brain surgery after I'm like a completely separate person\nYou know they they took out a piece of my school for already know how many weeks like back in ... three weeks or something like that and and there's like a picture of me in the hospital had ever be the tape my brand of my head as you said you know just all and like I Can't I own a stir can't remember\nWhy any thing before my whole surgery\nSo this was his worst fear supposedly becoming a new person but ironically it doesn't matter because he doesn't remember that old person who feel that\nUm I Can't I Can't it's like I woke up in a new life so different person you know it's like two separate lives\nThat okay with you is that okay with me yeah I mean\nIt doesn't matter if it is or is it like it is what it is I there's been times when I haven't been okay with it but then I get worked up and it's like why am I getting worked up or if there's nothing I can do to change it so I've learned for it to be okay and I'm totally okay good now but maybe like a year ago I must have been okay with it\nIt doesn't give you your age I think you know wages have changed no no not at all\nIt just seemed to me that this is really great new\n[laughter] thank you thank you yeah\nIf you ask his family his mom and dad his brother they say he's been accusations changed and these memories messy\nBut that thing that made Spencer Spencer that's still there\nAnd just let me ask you a question they asked you your brother and your parents ... what do you think our nature what makes it a that determined by her brain oh and what happens or green or is that you can buy something else something spiritual doesn't live anywhere to go\nI don't think it has to do to your brand new a little bit I think has to do with your heart and white or metaphysical harder like her are you know like the\nRed heart that downtime say heart pretty much I think it has to do it that kind of heart\n[noise] ooh\nBank you Stuart Spencer Steve and Dr Kim for being a part of the story\nWould have a link to any rules podcast is called fury\nOr that link on our website snap judgment or gee also anyone article for day magazine about what may have caused each for children to have brain now from mission don't want to check it out of a link on our website and snap judgment dot org the original score was performed\nIn composed by ... the story was produced by any roost and assessment\n[noise]\nNo but [noise] now the story is never over if you missed even a moment promoted the full episode on your podcast delivery system snap judgment here to play with a gift to glance snap judgment\nAnd it used to use them for either walk [noise] will the documents looked real people tell their stories coming face to face will be given the couple snap judgment presents for the part just because\nThe truth is stranger than fiction ... on your pot testify you stay while you still Pan Am snapped just rely on\nIs going on tour the world's top\nStory tell us backed by the bunk of Bell's battling the joy of pain and the purpose of laughter and meaning of life is a bottle snafus drink ...
