White House tonight\nFor Democrats efforts to take the majority the one vote that probably helped Democrats was when Joe Manchin of West Virginia voted for ... that probably help solidify his effort to get reelected\nBut Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota Claire McCaskill of Missouri those are two more moderate Democrats who voted against Kavanaugh you think that will hurt their chances\nCome November yes I mean I think especially high temp in North Dakota was already probably trailing in her race she is not getting a very good reception at home about her vote against Kavanaugh so I think it makes it harder for her to get reelected\nIn Missouri Claire McCaskill talents on some votes in rural areas to put her over the top I think that this vote against having all will cost her those rural votes\nLet's turn to the house now where Democrats would need to pick up twenty three seats to control the chamber suburban women were already expected to play a very large role in determining those contests but how do you think this fall out from Kavanaugh might amplify\nThat I think a lot of the take in the house has already bake Republicans or help somewhat by new enthusiasm in their base a lot of the data we've seen shows that Democrats\nWill know committed to this mid term almost at record levels so the question Democrats have is how much more growth do they have that vote what is their ceiling or had they hit it already huh so what they're more concerned about is how much this energizes the Republican vote\nI mean obviously the Supreme Court confirmation and is still raw in people's memories now a Kevin I was just seated on the court this weekend more ceremonial leader today could only be overstating the influence of his confirmation this November because we're in this moment now\nAnd other issues like health care for instance could actually come to the forefront come November\nI Do not think we're overstating the impasse I'm not sure a lot of Democrats appreciate\nThe importance Republicans put on the Supreme Court I mean they view it as the last line of defense on a number of issues you know Democrats are artists are fired up I think that this has truly angered\nAnd frightened a lot of women on many levels so I think that women are as engaged as they were I think that they are just a lot angrier about it\n[noise] Jennifer Duffy is senior editor at the cook Political Report thank you very much thank you for having me\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo has been in Asia for the last few days he spent several hours and young with North Korea's leader Kim Jong un they talked about denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and scheduling a second meeting with President Trump called it a good trip\nThen he was in Beijing Today and that does it was notably not as good Chinese foreign minister ... had some sharp words for ... about the state of U.S China relations NPR's Anthony Kuhn is in Beijing and he joins us now hey Anthony hey they're also\nSo what exactly was sat in front of reporters what were these remarks that were so critical of the U.S from China\nWill whiny really started out on a pretty harsh note saying that the U.S said constantly escalated trading tensions with China it harmed China's interest in regards to Taiwan and it it made a lot of baseless accusations against Chinas foreign and domestic policies\nWhile he noted that Pompeo would come to brief him about his trip to North Korea and to seek China's cooperation and he said this is exactly why we should be cooperating and not confronting each other\nDid pay a respond to any of these criticisms in front of reporters\nWell he said to us and China where in fundamental disagreement on ... points and I think what came out through this was that China feels that the U.S is just launching an all out sort of Cold War on every front\nAnd I think this has something to do with the speech that vice president Mike Pence gave last week\nWhere he accused China of malign effort to undermine President Trump in the upcoming elections\nYeah that was just one of the things I mean really it was across the board from stealing American intellectual property to human rights as a treatment of the week or a minority in she's young it was really confrontational and very little talk of cooperation\nWhy with Chinese officials take such a fence at Mike Pence's speech if the vast majority of what he was saying substantively is that the U.S has long been saying about China was it the particular tone Pence took or\nIs it the timing that right now you know ... trying to keep good relations with China when it comes to North Korea and this was just an inconvenience speech to be giving welcome hails making this trip\n[noise] you know this has been building up earlier this year we had a national security strategy an official document which basically named China is one of the main threats\nFacing the U.S so that's part of the attitude\nYou know I I think it's really just China feels that this marks a shift away from cooperation and towards confrontation this this depiction of China is really a rogue regime in one of the top threats to us security that that has to be dealt with harshly\nI really think that's the tone that China is reacting to and I think it will be reacting to it I think that's going to be sinking in for quite a while\nNow under previous administrations officials have been reluctant to push Beijing too hard on on trade or or other issues the U.S has been critical of when it comes to China or because of this idea that it needs China's help when it comes to North Korea so could President Trump's tough stance with China hurt you\nTo his home state of Montana to sign papers that put a hold on mining of thirty thousand acres of federal

News this is all things considered ... mid term elections have often been seen as a referendum on the president and his party many presidents try to shy away from that idea but not Donald Trump he has a lot on the line next month and she knows it as NPR's Mara Liasson reports\nWhat does Donald Trump think is at stake on election day well just about everything Democrats\n[noise] they're then\nThey're going to raise your taxes you get a crime all over the place you're going to people across the border you lose your rights to those guns you're going to ruin your Medicare watch\nAnd that's not even the worst of it\nThey want to America in June Venezuela\nEven for Trump that's pretty alarmist but according to Newt Gingrich the president is right to be doing everything he can to scare his supporters into voting getting rich who became house speaker when a Democratic president lost a midterm election knows the midterms can have serious consequences for a White House\nLosing the house is is a problem losing the son it's a catastrophe\nAnother way to put it no Senate no judges no house no legislation\nHave you suddenly had McConnell in the minority and Schumer controlling the calendar you would get virtually no judge approved than the house the big the big problem will be the judge is endless investigations of everybody\nEndless investigations including possibly impeachment of everybody meaning not just people in the west wing but every Trump cabinet official an agency had done high is the former communications director for the Republican National committee\nDemocrats are going to investigate this president in an intense way that we've never seen before and Republicans were pretty intense on rock Obama this will take it to a to point out pretty quickly\nYou mean like the been God's the investigation on steroids\nThis has been Garvey in every committee affecting every department an agency and also means that Trump's I is necessarily going to be taken off the ball of job creation and doing those things that he should be able to tell voters\nFormer Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says on the other hand if the Republicans hang on than Trump style of leadership is validated and he has a free hand to do pretty much what he wants\nIf the Republicans are reelected majority of the nation of the president's policies and that means his opportunity to continue to get his America First agenda accomplish\nOther presidents who've lost control of Congress managed to find some areas of common ground with the opposition think Bill Clinton Trump could try to do that says former George W. Bush advisor Karl Rove but it will be harder now\nIt is possible to try which is another way of saying working across party lines and finding allies on particular issues but we're talking about climate today that is much different than the climate that we had Twenty years ago and so you know if the Democrats were\nIt would be you know an ugly would not find\nSome supporters of the president paint a different picture if the Republicans lose the house they say Trump could use the Democratic speaker Nancy Pelosi or her successor as a foil and cruise to re election way Bill Clinton and ...\nA bomber did with Corey Lewandowski isn't buying it\nI've heard people say that it will be shows that you should learn we fired she's clearly it no understanding of how politics works like this president and his agenda and what you've been able to accomplish he's only been able to do because the Republicans have been in office\nOne thing both Democrats and Republicans agree on is that this White House is just not prepared for the consequences of losing former Bill Clinton advisor Paul the Gallo says no White House really is\nThey have no idea what it feels like I Do real fifty six Estes going through a bunch of people would have felt when there were sixty three it's a gut punch there's a very real psychological and political price\nPart of that price the rock solid hold President Trump has on the Republican Party in Congress could be shaken\nTrump rules his party by fear we're going to see them a lot less if they get their books he loses so much\nSo for Donald Trump whose entire persona is about always winning the November election could be the first time he's a loser\nOr not Mara Liasson NPR News\nWe may not know what's going to happen in the November midterms but we do know one thing Taylor Swift is voting Democrat\nIn a lengthy social media post on Sunday the pop superstar explained why she would be supporting Democrats filled bread is in for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house she also slammed Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn for her record on women's and el GB T rights\nAnd all this from an artist who has famously refused to talk politics in the past we reached Emily yard of the Washington Post who's been following all of this welcome Hi so how earth shattering uses the dealers will make some political endorsement\nHonestly and an era where I don't know if anything can surprise me anymore really surprised me why the shock yeah so I think it surprised me and a lot of people because ah for the last few years there has kind of been\nThis steady drumbeat to get Taylor Swift just sort of say anything political anything about the current environment and she never has and then all of a sudden Sunday she drops his Instagram posted there really link the almost like scorched earth of post about how she really feels about the upcoming\nI was nine years old when I first got to talk George I knew you base the scene on talks you yourself that growing up what light to film a scene that fictional but that represent something completely real to move to the black community\nUm you know it was a very emotional scene I remember um Russell Hornsby plays map Carter would choke up because he has kids himself\nI have a Fifteen year old son so it was a very emotional time because in the African American community that is something that ... have been through a one way or another\nFor me it was with my uncles and my dad you know they came out of MLK rights you know in sixty eight with family members in Detroit Milwaukee, Wisconsin so all those things were planted inside me\nSo in the movie you know those as two young kids who actually hearing the same for the first time it was just emotional is deals with history his deal with survival and how we can continue to stay on this earth without police brutality or being shot or being killed the you know this part of the the fear of the African American community\nOne of those fascinating storylines for me is how star feels like she has to be two different people all the time and she thinks part of that means literally ... doing her blackness while she's walking around her mostly white high school Williamson ...\nSlang makes them cool thing makes me put those kids face gas basically Williams and star doesn't give any one of the reasons that color and get it and I hate myself for doing it\n... I read that part of the inspiration for stars double life came from your own life because you also lived in a mostly black neighborhood while attending a mostly white private Christian college in Mississippi what was that like feeling like you had to be two different people all the time\nIt was a struggle um I did I Lived in a mostly black poor neighborhood in Jackson, Mississippi and I went to a mostly white upper class private school just ten minutes away from my home but\nIn ten minutes it was like going into an entirely different world so I over compensated by doing what's called ... um I Would make myself more presentable I thought I'm I was careful of ally spoke I was careful of how much emotion I showed\n'em and it was a struggle because so often I was silent on things that matter to me um and I would experience a micro aggressions from my classmates and I was I don't know about him I never called up the racism like what\nWell one time one of my professors had a party at his house for Christmas and he had a huge Christmas tree with a big pile of gifts underneath and we could all pick a gift and it was like get gifts like we'll be Christians and all of these others and if he's just trying to get rid of\nAnd when it was my turn I pick the gifts and\nThere was a prescription drug book inside and a toy water gun\nAnd one of my classmates goes oh my God the black girl from the ghetto got the drug book and the gun how funny wow and because some of my classmates were laughing and I just made myself laugh because I thought I had to\nUm and that was one of those moments where I was so angry at myself for not speaking up and honestly that was a defining moment for me because I had to realize that I was worth speaking up for if nothing else and that they needed to know that even a joke like that is not okay so for me that was the moment I said you know what I Am not going to be silent again\nYeah one thing that was so fascinated with this movie doesn't only look at the disconnect between black and white it also touches upon where the black community can disagree like when stars uncle Carlos who's a cop straight up tell star how he would react to a black suspect\nA lot goes through a cops mind when they pull someone over audit hiding something it costs though\nBut you still don't know if they did anything wrong\nThat's why we searched but if they open the door or reached through an open window they're probably going for weapons so far I think I see a gun I don't have to shoot it was so\nInteresting to hear a black man own that in this movie because it shows that you know this isn't just wide against black racism it's much more complicated right you're you're saying George that it's not just white people that are to blame for the racial bias we've seen policing\nYes definitely use 'em that scene was a very important moment in the book\nAnd I really wanted to show off the side you know to is this the idea of how the system you know uh for police officers and how that goes all the way back to the idea of a slave patrols with free slaves and that's a system\nThat is taught in some time that system could be taught African Americans as well so you have that version and then also you have another\nOn top of that is that sometimes as African Americans we have racism and buys them inside ourselves and how we see other African Americans as well and she ...\nTold this story through the eyes of the sixteen year old ... do you think audiences are more capable of empathy when they're watching it kid rather than an adult for Apple with this kind of trauma receiving is kind of trauma unfortunately yeah yeah\nYeah when I first decided to write it I'm I'm a huge young adult fiction saying anyway and I always knew I wanted to write young adult fiction\nUm but it was a definitely a decision early on to write this from the perspective of a sixteen year old girl for several reasons I'm the first reason for me was because so often victims in these cases are teenagers or young people\nAnd Trayvon Martin was seven genes mirror rice was twelve and I think about those kids who look at them and see themselves and I wanted to talk to them first and foremost\nUm but I also knew that when adults pick this book up they would be more likely to empathize with a sixteen year old girl than a thirty year old woman\nFor some audience is there something about getting it from the perspective of someone who has so much innocence\nWho has so little experience you literally witness this girl become a woman you see her forced into adulthood because of her trauma and I think there's something about that at least for adults there's something about seeing a child go do this\nAnd my hope was that people will look at real life sixteen year olds in these cases and actually see them as children and not as adults\nWriter Angie Thomas and director George ... their new movie is called the hate you get thank you both very much it

off he went in that we have from Turkish sources that their initial assessment was that he had been killed inside confident in what they said was premeditated murder\nIf that is true that the Saudi Government has indeed killed ... can you can you give us a sense of what he has written about that has so tremendously offended the Saudi Government\nShow I mean it's important to remember that he's

from NPR News in Washington I'm jak spear US ambassador\nTo the U.N Nikki Haley is leaving the Trump Administration at the end of this year she surprised many with their decision today but as NPR's Michele Kelemen explains President Trump is holding out the possibility she may return\nAnd I think the expiring date has always bothered people but probably what bothered this administration more than anything else and it is a troublesome\nFactor is that ah the agreement didn't do anything to curtail it runs a aggressive behavior throughout the region how\nWould you assess Nikki Haley's time at the un has she been successful in advancing U.S foreign policy goals\nI think as defined by the president of the United states and the current administration yes that'd be my first point the second\nIs I think she was very well suited for the job she's an outgoing politician\nThere's quite a political aspect to being ambassador to the United nations you gotta go schmooze with on the delegate you got to walk around and get to know everybody I think she also got interested very interested in fact in the substance of the work and she was a proactive and it was at the time I think a marked contrast to\nThe secretary of state Mr Rex Tillerson who was really kind of a shrinking violet than closeted himself in his office and didn't ah stabbed was much of a public\nPersona nor much of a relationship with his environment one claimed\nThough that Nikki Haley made is that the U.S is now more respected at the un do you think that that's a fair characterization is that accurate\nLook I think we've always been respected uh\nYou know maybe in one respect or another you might be able to point to that but I prefer to view it as the fact that we're the most powerful country in the world was still\nHasn't seen that the status of the U.S has been elevated under heard the well the un\nI you know ... she can make that argument I'm not gonna quibble where there but I'm also going to say that I think for a long time since the end of World War two of the United states has been the largest economy the largest military in the most influential countries in the world\nI think she's taking seriously the responsibility of trying to maintain our influence at the United nations she hasn't laid back she's been forceful she's been a bit forward on her ... but I think she's taken seriously the idea of playing a leadership role\nOn behalf of the United states at the un and for that I commend her\nWhy do you think President Trump should be looking for when considering as he's considering the replacement for Nikki Haley\nWell first of all I mean president should always consider people who they are going to be comfortable working with secondly ideally somebody with a some international experience of whatever kind whether it's international business or a think tank or or politician mhm somebody who's\nGot a a mind that the you know it's OK America First for the American
