administration's position on the killing of ... and Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nHas been evolving the president has condemned the killing that still has not condemned the Saudi crown prince or said whether he believes NBS as he's referred she played a role\nWhen Republican senator who has been a vocal critic of the Saudi king in his policies and the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman himself is Indiana senator tot young he has called the crown prince impulsive and reckless and says the U.S should send the Saudi\nLeader a message senator young welcome thanks for having me also so what is the message the U.S should sent to Saudi Arabia right now\n[noise] um it's crystal clear Americans won't stand for this sort of behavior we've seen in recent weeks and I would say over the last couple of years of the behavior coming from\nThe Saudi Government and more specifically from the Saudi air a parent a prince Mohammed is contrary to our values our international laws in our national security interests\nHasn't been a mistake for President Trump to put so much trust didn't didn't Solomon's pledged to reform its country then\nLook I think it's really important that we work with security partners in the middle east there aren't many options to choose from\nA but we do have leverage or as a country to use against the Saudis to bring them in a better behavior so that they're not repeatedly killing civilians through airstrikes using our weapons in our fuel is they've been doing for the last couple of years in Yemen so they're not murdering journalists are like\nIndiana states a graduate ... in Washington Post journalist so these are the sorts of things that we need to not only highlights but we need to begin holding the government in Riyadh to account on on account of these actions\nAnd on honing Riyadh accountable some of your colleagues in Congress have been calling for a regime change in Saudi Arabia for the crown prince to be replaced do you agree that that would be a good step\nWell look we're still confirming certain details with respect to a this most recent tragedy in the interim I've been encouraged that the administration is revoking the visas of individuals we already know had been involved in this ... situation\nI'm but I'm not prepared to rule anything out uh I I think we should suspend all arms sales until we know more and we should most certainly should stop refueling Saudi coalition aircraft are engaged in this sort of atrocities I'd just referenced in the country of Yemen\nRight you mention that you would like to see Saudi arms the Saudi arms deal with the U.S get ripped up the President Trump has talked a lot recently about all the jobs that would be lost if this White House tore up that arms deal with Saudi Arabia you share the president's concerns about jobs being lost\nLook I think that the number of jobs are the ... levy loss from this ah or frankly fairly minor ah I I don't see that as a major consideration I see this instead as a matter of\nHolding our values and um let's not forget our national\nSecurity interests here the country of Yemen has been destabilized by Saudi action that country happens to be the headquarters of al ... in the Arabian Peninsula the most dangerous out due to affiliate out there so um it's essential\nWe've talked about what Congress could possibly do to address the situation in Saudi Arabia but what about the presidents do you believe that President Trump has been vocal enough calling out Saudi Arabia enough in the wake of democracy oh jeez death\nWell I think uh the president's message I gather\nMore information ah it's of all he's in a good spot now in fact he condemn the good showed you death as the worst cover up ever that's a pretty strong condemnation for a country that has historically been and will remain I think an important security partner of ours\nBut should President Trump had been so reticent to criticize Saudi Arabia at the beginning\nI think reticence when you're dealing with national security partners is probably a positive impulse but right now he's in a situation having together more facts are that we have just been experiencing the worst cover up ever him and so that's pretty strong language coming from the president of United States\nDoes it concern you the close ties the Trump Administration has with members of the royal family and Saudi Arabia specifically Jared Kushner the president's son in law has cultivated a very close relationship with the crown prince Mohammed bin some on does that concern you\nKnow we have had strong relationships with Saudi government's for generations and uh that's uh something that has continued with this administration recognizing that the Saudis have\nBeen in can continue to be very important security partners uh they provide as valuable intelligence but I have to admit that relationship or gets undermined as the Saudis\nAre Deceive Us and as they engage in a

I feel confident that they'll be able to link these devices but then the real work will be can you link it back to a person or persons unknown and I know they're really looking at how were these delivered\nAnd the fact that none of these devices actually exploded that that fact does help investigators right when the devices are still intact and might still retain fingerprints for example\nAbsolutely and that's why the um the first responders are are taking so much time to render these devices safe\nWithout destroying the evidence it's not like they're going to put another an explosive device next to it and blow it to smithereens they have techniques used to preserve evidence this'll be important as the investigation unfolds but right now\nThere are devices that could be in the mail not yet the uh delivered we saw this in central Texas recently were devices were going over time\nRight that David shipment former special agent for the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives thank you very much for coming in today\nPresident Trump addressed the suspected pipe bombs tonight at a campaign rally in Wisconsin He\nSaid and aggressive investigation is underway and he promised to bring those responsible to justice the reports of suspicious packages today definitely affected the tone of the president's rally tonight and NPR's Scott Horsley joins us now to talk about that Hey Scott Hi also\nShould tell us about the mood tonight what was it like at the rally\nThe audience was pretty raucous a typical Trump crowd as they waited in an airplane hangar on what was a fairly chili Wisconsin night but the president himself was unusually restrained or this was definitely Donald Trump on decaf\nEven though it was obviously a partisan event the president said he wants Americans to work together in peace and harmony and he's stress of the way to solve our policy differences is peacefully at the ballot box\nGauge the political arena must stop treating political opponents as be morally defect after\nOf moral condemnation and destructive routine these are arguments and disagreements that have to stop\nAnd Trump himself tried to follow that advice tonight as he talked up his fellow Republicans and loud relatively mild criticism that their democratic rivals\nNow how big of a change was this from some of the other rallies the president has been holding in the past several days\nIf you've been watching the rallies throughout this midterm campaigns uses I have it was a very noticeable a tone change or the present himself commented on it he was he was criticizing democratic senator Tammy Baldwin Wisconsin who's a reelection battle against a his favorite candidate\nAnd while he painted Baldwin as far as the left you did so in fairly restrained term saying I'm trying to be nice\nTo see how nice of having to that this is like have you ever seen [noise]\nAll very well [noise]\nI mean we can keep it that way\nThe president seemed to be deliberately keeping himself in check and he acted a little music his own ability to do so\nOn target so far the packages we've been hearing about today had been prominent Democrats this comes at a politically charged time less than two weeks before the midterm elections but it's not like I guess the president didn't stop campaigning altogether [noise]\nNo I mean he had his usual campaign notes or he touched on hot button issues like border security and the Supreme Court\nBut it was as if someone had apply to mid western nice filter to the president microphone this evening\nHe also talked to a good deal about trade but in less apocalyptic terms and he usually does he drilled down a bit on the revised trade agreement that his team negotiated with Canada and Mexico\nThat's a big deal for Wisconsin dairy farmers and he actually suggested those farmers were a driving force in the negotiations with Canada although as usual he kind of exaggerated the extent to which candidate has agreed to open up its dairy market\nAnd just quickly earlier today the president took part in a rare bipartisan bill signing at the White House can you tell us a little bit about that\nYeah he sent some sweeping legislation to address the opioid epidemic and that bill passed both the house and Senate with near unanimous approval\nThat is a sign of just how big the nation's opioid epidemic has become a and how big the drug overdose problem is in both red and blue states big enough that is GOP Senator Rob Portman of Ohio said the two party were willing to put politics aside and worked together\nAnd That's NPR's Scott Horsley thank you Scott You're welcome\n[noise]\nThey're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe it's on members' support it eighty nine point three K.

seeds and Mark Swed who's been with the LA Times since Nineteen Ninety six and Alex Ross the bi coastal music critic for the New Yorker\nHad been following the LA feel for a very long time yesterday we spoke about the philharmonic three pivotal music directors DJs even made up as a pack Solomon And Gustavo due to meld but the LA fell also had two very important general managers who was largely shaped the image and direction of the film as we know today\nThey were earners Fleischmann from Nineteen sixty nine to Nineteen Ninety eight and Deborah border from Nineteen Ninety nine to two thousand and Seventeen Here's Mark Swed on flight ... like I say\nHe was a brilliant figure who's a brilliant promoter he was able to figure out how to really make made a star\nAnd the orchestra prominent and do things that no other orchestrated ever dared to do\n'em take huge political chances be involved in anti Vietnam War rallies all kinds of things\nAnd he had a great great vision that the orchestra would be more than an orchestra it would be this kind of community of musicians that was involved in all kinds of ways with in the community itself he was really able to give the LA feel prominence\nBut it actually was a very very good and very important work ... long before\nDr out of temporary conductor in general musical director of the Los Angeles philharmonic orchestra now

extra different [noise]\nHas the LA feel negotiated its place in Hollywood and its relationship to the movie\nBusiness the TV business at how was that evolved over the years that you both have been watching the orchestra\nBack in the thirties and forties\nThe orchestra in one sense was completely removed from the growth symphonic music in motion pictures and the German immigrate composers who came here to write and wound up writing for the pictures [noise] New York strip no interest in that\nThey thought this was sort of walk\nBut the young film composers were very interested in the orchestra because Yorkers who's playing shrimp or it was ... and they were extremely influenced by that and they would come to the LA feel to find out what is going on in music that they could then incorporate in their work\nAlex Fleischmann was succeeded by Deborah board up who came from the New York film and she's since returned to New York what was her impact on the LA fell what did she bring and what was her legacy even though she's only been gone short period of time now\nShe's just a brilliant manager of orchestras keeping everything in line and and handling the budget and and so forth\nShe also has a gift which I think she she shares with Ernest Fleischmann even though you can think of two more different personalities but I think both of them had this lack of caution and a kind of instinct to go with a riskier ideas a\nAnd Deborah but it was very good about promoting a female conductors a mere ... ... a made a really some of her first uh internationally prominent appearances uh with the LA still ah Susanna Milky as principal gas has done\nReally remarkable things and is very likely to continue doing so or this season with her upcoming projects are and I think it's really developed a following with the the audience um and then female composers which is\nA necessity at this point because so many of the of the dominant names and the most inventive
