Lopez you name as you're twenty six years old she said like many of the other migrants that she started had joined the cabinet and competition but but she regretted that decision along the way she has four children back in Honduras and she says she knew the trip would be hard but it's even worse than seeing match\nAnd\nShe\nSaid to me she'll suffer back and enjoy that at least we'll keep her life and she was first of the fact that yesterday the Mexican police deployed tear gas against migrants to enter Mexico and that people got hurt and so she's had given these condition it's better that she returned to Honduras but\nYou said that there are still several thousand people there so that suggests that most of the people are going to try to stay in and move on moving with the caravan\nThat's right I think the point I mean I think there's maybe two to three thousand people on the ... most of them are moving forward\nI talked to a twenty four year old Kevin India he's traveling with his younger sister and a friend or they've been travelling for three days they camped out on the bridge last night with thousands of the other migrants 'em and they want to reach Florida with their friends here's what he had to tell me\n... he's has become friends\nSo scared you use that to your favor and it pushes you forward and he's going to try and get across to Mexico anyway they pan and that includes by boat or trying to cross the spreads that I'm On right now\nYou know President Trump has reacted furiously to this has been speaking about it a campaign rally demanding that Mexico closed the border by any means necessary he claims will send us troops to the southern border I I was wondering if that message is getting through to the people that you've been talking to and what sense do you have from all the book the markets and the authorities there\nI Would say that virtually none of the migrants on this spread to really know what time is saying they don't have cell phone service or they don't have money to charge your cell phone so it's basically\nOf mouth they know something doesn't want them they they absolutely no that that that's almost meaningless to them what they want to do is leave their lives\nOn what happens to a family traumatized by the death of a neighborhood boy stars childhood friend ... one night the two of them were pulled over by a white police officer ... was unarmed when the police officer shot and\nThe hate you give is based on the book at the same name by novelist Angie Thomas last year she told NPR she was inspired to write it after the shooting death of Oscar Grant by a transit officer in Oakland grant was unarmed at the time he was killed Thomas says she was struck by the media coverage\nMore people were talking about what he had done in his past and the fact that he unjustly lost his life like star\nAngie Thomas also grew up code switching and so did ...

John Grisham plays not my job on wait wait don't tell me and just twenty five minutes and then at seven o'clock it's live from here with Chris ...\nIt's been almost three months since the death of LA Times food critic Jonathan Gold the paper's been steadily rebuilding and expanding Its Food coverage and on Thursday announced its hired a new food writer and contributing food editor Peter me hand\nMe hands known for his twenty five dollar and under column in the New York times his Netflix show ugly delicious and the food magazine he cofounded lucky peach he spoke with KP cc's Libby dikeman on friday\nI'm so excited by the challenge I mean I don't think that there's a better or more exciting eating city in America and I think that there's a great opportunity to tell a lot of stories there which as a as an editor is is the thing that you want\nWhich Los Angeles spots do you plan to hit first\nI was out there last week and and went to a bunch of places I hadn't been before but the places that I'm most\nExcited to get back to a change your taste assessment place out in the ... the I had read and you should do loves books about the complexity of such on food and I have eaten a lot of central improved but that was the first place in America where I really tasted all the different\nIterations of uh of such long spicy and now the numbing cooking and so I Love that place I Love going there and I'll be going there when I'm back next week I've never been to Leo's tacos for talk was all cost or which is a terribly embarrassing thing to admit\nBone and you have to remedy that immediately\nExactly you know so there's so there's there's some some places that I Love that I've gone to in the past that I Want to get back to I mean I think that I think that Michael ... is one of the best chefs cooking in the entire world and the fact that he has not betting knowledge does such is\nA crime against Los Angeles and I think the Providence or the place where I hold Jonathan I couldn't understand why it was at the top there's less because we never went there you know he gave me as a kind of like OK Kid and then he took me there in the meal was so amazing so I Would love to get back to Providence this city feels infinite possibilities and I think that\nFor as many places that I Know and I want to eat out again there's places that I've never been to that I Want to discover for myself and hopefully help shepherd into the pages of the paper\nYeah I'm hearing you mentioned Jonathan Gold quite a bit and obviously he was a friend and and the official announcement of your higher he's mentioned a couple of times the papers seems to be kind of drawing similarities between your sensibilities as a food writer and his um what do you think about that comparison and and what do you think is distinct about your style\nAs he gets an unfair to the greatness of his legacy but no we were we became really close friends uh and he was a you know he\nWas a mentor but more than that he was a friend and we ate together constantly when we were there and I learned a lot from him I remember the first time I met him we went to a barbecue restaurant in Kansas City I engineered a profile of him basically as a ruse to get to know him\nThe journalists classic ruse\nYou want to be here heroes or write a story about the ... thing and we're sitting at this restaurant and I said something like sharp about the barbecue but I you know I didn't like it or you know cost a little bit or whatever and Jonathan just shut me down in the most magnificent way explained to me that\nThat was my take on their barbeque but what I needed to do was appreciate the style they were cooking and how they were making it and judged against that you know it's okay to\nNot like something yourself\nBut it's as a as a journalist and food writer you need to do the work to understand the food that you're eating an average of just went from there\nKP cc's Libby

S. dot O. R. G.\nSome of the deaths make the headlines for example prince than they are to Philip Seymour Hoffman the most ... unreported another trajectory statistic\nOccasionally though the statistics take on a human face last week and a bit trip it into the ... local paper for such a year old woman my little muddy ... who died after long addiction to wipe your it's about a ... rural angry heartbreaking went viral it was written by her sister Cape\nMay be funeral was today when I spoke to ... to head of the service and also to her she and her family were coping with ...\nIt's been a really difficult a couple of weeks I'm definitely shocking and we're going through all the\nI think feeling all the grief that is common for people when they've lost a loved one in which as not either ... has gotten all this attention and we've realized that far too many people feel the grief that we're feeling right now\nYou mentioned the reaction to the country where you taken by surprise for how much attention it has received very but it's meant to look to you has it\n[noise] it has it's meant a lot to my family it's been bittersweet and that the outpouring of support and just love and compassion and the stories people have shared with us have been a real source of strength and it's also just a reminder of how many people this disease effect\nAnd it is a disease is good for you it is a disease and who do you think is to blame for these deaths and it's a difficult question pumps you know blaming anybody but if you were to him and who wants to play\nI mean I Believe that ... death was absolutely unnecessary and I believe that our system in the U.S is to blame for the fifty thousand opioid overdoses and twenty Seventeen and for all of the deaths related to opiate addiction that are not counted and that number\nThese institutions are failing people with a serious disease so I Do think that the system is failing and as to blame for her death\nBecause er ... on a prescription level of being used to frequently and that's how many people are becoming addicted\nI mean that's part of it so it starts with the over prescription also starts with the fact that they're you know that he wasn't prescribed Arctic cotton and that's the first structure you try when she was sixteen years old she was given one recreationally at a party so those drugs have flooded the market they're everywhere\nIt's very difficult to get treatment when you want it the first time that he wanted to go to rehab we had to drive two hours across the state and by the time we got there they had given away her bed and there wasn't another one available for a week\nMedication assisted treatment which is when people take drugs like Suboxone zone or methadone which are highly effective they are not available they're very difficult to get\nAny doctor in the United states can prescribe a highly addictive opiate painkiller but to be able to prescribe one of the medications that addicts could use to stay clean doctors need to get a special training they have to get a waiver and they can only have one hundred patients on that truck\n[noise] we might be first tried all she comes up a pause to I mean did did you become addicted immediately very quickly off to the\nI don't know that it was a media than my family didn't know that it was happening at the time that he told us later the story of how she got to the place where she was an IV drug user but I think she tried it she loved the way it made her feel and so she continued to use it and then started to get out and then was physically dependent on it\nShe continued to use a George for many years what was it like during that period\nYou know there were a lot of pretty extreme lows they're also high you know ... tried again and again and again to get clean and I think that's another way in which the system failed her she would often go to Twenty one day or twenty eight day rehabilitation programs\nBut every time she was so full of hope and silver we completely believed that Maddie would get clean and she would make a good life for herself after she had her son we completely\nBelieved in her ability to parent him but this disease is quite strong my sister as\nWas very resilient very strong and the city's a stronger\nAnd tell us about what you have a son does that give her a new impetus to try and give up\nYeah she really transformed her life when she had her son and again she was clean for I think six months after she had him and then she relapsed at that she got clean again and was clean for another eleven months and then she relapsed again but she tried so hard I mean she wanted more than\nAnything in the world to raise her son\nAnd she was a wonderful mother died when she was clean but you know we'll alone will ...\nHelp someone to recover from this disease you know it requires more than just well\nSociety and some cool to is often blames people's weakness or doesn't recognize just how powerful that addiction ... dismisses people saying well you know if you really want to the to give it up to be good for those little as possible as you\nKnow and it's funny and the U.S you know if somebody had the disease that's related to a behavior for example if somebody smokes and get lung cancer if somebody overeat and gets diabetes we don't deny them treatment we don't blame them and said no you can't have this medication we're going to make it really really hard for you to get it's absurd\nThese are highly addictive drugs\nDoes he not a choice nobody wakes up and said you know what I Want to be a heroin addict when I grow up\nAnd be a big tree you talk about how the disease ... to ... places of incredible thought this was she like in those dark moments them somehow hauled was that for you as a sister\nI mean it was extremely difficult for my family and when he was in the dark places she would generally disappear you know we were never estranged from her\nYou know even when we didn't know where she was she would always just try to reach out by text or you know Facebook and just let us know she was okay but when she was in the dark places we often wouldn't see her for a couple of months and then you know she would resurface\nBut I think terrible terrible things happen to her and she did terrible things in the name of her disease and and that's part of this I think it's very easy to look at that photo of Matty at her best with her son she's beautiful ... face white woman\nBut I think it would be harder for people to empathize with Matty when she was at her lowest and that's what I Want is for people to show compassion to people who are in the throes of their addiction whether or not they look like my sister\nI Want to sort of an Dona on an up most of possible I mean you could just tell me what your memories of morality oh\nYeah you know ... he was an incredibly fun person that just being in her presence being around her whether you are doing just the simplest thing like you know watching a movie or going for a walk with just always a really great experience she had a wonderful sense of humor and\nYou know it was up for anything she would teach us than you know they're just being in her presence of such a pleasure and I'm\nSo sorry that I won't have that experience again\nMy other sister or new speaking to me a little earlier [noise]\nA lot of

War nuclear arms treaty between the U.S and Russia is on the brink of collapse\nPresident Trump says he intends to withdraw from the Nineteen eighty seven agreement accusing Moscow of violating it for years Matthew Bodner reports Russia is threatening to retaliate\nDo these headlines stop pouring out what do you think people are going through\nWell is there are a couple of perspectives that you know I've packed into a I started writing about this on and off in two thousand two as a reporter and what I noticed was initially a lot of anger toward us and how dare you\nBashed the church and that has faded significantly\nIn the last several years as I've done more reporting as as more grand jury work has come out as I've done my own investigative work on this\nIt is overwhelmingly a different story I hear from people who describe themselves as Catholics who are now disaffected who are angry who want to side with the victims who say enough is enough with the bishops\nYou know people are wondering my goodness every time one of these headlines comes out were devastated we're heartbroken were wounded were hurt\nAnd then six months we hope okay it's behind us and then it's back and now it's back again and now it's back again\nDo you think that this sense of anger distrust do you think it goes beyond a practicing Catholic people who are connected to the Catholic Church I Wonder if it it it affects the community at large doesn't make them question what's\nGoing on in their world I think a lot of people it's very difficult for them to see what has now become document based ... of systemic practices within this institution and not wonder what the heck\nIs going on there is a deep distrust I think in shock that this institution seems to have shown such a pattern internally a very very bad behavior and no sanctions\nIs there a sense that the federal investigation is a step in the right direction or that optimism hard to come by right now\nWell it's hard to say right I mean anything can happen nobody knows which way a federal probe will go and whether it will yield anything\nBut I remember talking to the victims even a couple of weeks back months back about the statute fight and having one say something on Thursday when the story broke about the federal probe which is\nI'm not holding my breath about a statute of limitations change in this state the one thing that will bring me peace is if and when federal authorities finally just\nWhether the Catholic Church is an organized criminal network that's Maria Pena ran it she's a columnist with the Philadelphia Inquirer Maria thanks so much for talking with us thank you so much for having me\n[noise]\nAnd now another story in our troll watch theory [noise]\nFor this program we've been trying to keep track of the ways that Internet trolls especially those directed by foreign governments have been trying to influence American voters by pushing fake stories are hyping up stories with a bipartisan are mean spirited edge\nNow we've heard about an army veteran who's trying to eliminate this information on Facebook that targets service members and veterans he's flag about one hundred Facebook pages that have millions of followers and he's with us now Chris Goldsmith is the assistant director for policy and government affairs at Vietnam veterans of America\nAnd he's also founder and president of high ground veterans advocacy and he's with us from NPR's bureau in New York Christopher thanks so much for talking to us hey thanks for having me so let me let me ask you to walk me through this now this started because you were trying to understand how well you are\nLegitimate Facebook pages were doing and then you realize that somebody had what stolen your logo and was pushing content with it and had more followers and you tell me about that correct\nYes so I was just helping my communications team manage our social media pages and um I typed in Vietnam veterans of America and one day I noticed that there was another page that came up before hours and it had an even larger following\nSo I investigated the page found out that they've been using our logo pretending to be us but they were sending everyone to a European website the vets dot edu but that was the first red flag where it's you know these people aren't just trying to sell T shirts or something\nThey're creating an entire environment to support the fake Facebook pages\nYou tell me about that what kinds of things where they're using their page to say\nSo most of the stuff that this particular group of trolls was pushing a we eventually located them and in Bulgaria\nOne particular incident was there was a legitimate news story in rural Massachusetts there was\nA Vietnam veterans monument that had been defaced some kid took some berries and rubbed in on it but what they did was they took that local news story in loops the fifty second video for four hours as Facebook Live video\nAnd over that they put a phrase that said do you think the criminals must suffer and encourage people to respond now it was based in truth but it was made to look more urgent and it looked like it was happening live this wasn't just you know one person in Bulgaria you know trying to build the following\nThis was a conspiracy\nWhat I'm basically doing use is leaving a trail of bread crumbs so that Facebook's threat intelligence team can take the actual experts to analyze the data died found\nSo that they can get more information about who's behind it\nWhat is it do you think is attracting people as it is it because they could combine it with this kind of deep patriotic sentimental what's the appeal\nSo the reason why they are going to the right is because that's the type of content that the extreme right is producing organically\nSo blends in their goal is to blend in with\nAn amplify the extremes in this country\nThat the ultimate goal here is is not veterans it is to make the United states in a permanent condition of paralysis they want for us to not be able to function as a democracy in the way that they do that is they sabotage any\nIdea of bipartisanship not just for our elected members of Congress but for the electric and we use a society need to start educating ourselves\nOn the issue of cyber hygiene we need to understand that it's it's very important to everything that we share we need to make sure that the source is reliable and when it comes to politics we need to make sure that it's generated from inside the United states\nThat was Chris Goldsmith the assistant director
