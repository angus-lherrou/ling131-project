Kavanaugh but as NPR's Scott Detrow explains one of the few remaining undecided Democrats said she will vote no\nEach of them and I think in the case of judge Kavanaugh he literally responded to more questions in writing than any other Supreme Court justice although a lot of\nNew information has of course come to light since since ... has written responses came and let me let me let me ask you this basic question how is it not in everyone's interest especially judge Kavanaugh's if he wants to clear his name for the FBI to given to be given the space and time to run\nAll credible current allegations to the ground\nBasically the agreement was that we would take a week and that during that time the FBI had full availability to do what ever they felt needed to be done and that was being made at the request of a group of senators who still wanted more information\nMost of the individuals who did not a plan to vote are the ones that are saying delayed again look let's be honest this is a political maneuver on their on their part\nHe advised look the story behind says is the Senate is supposed to be advise and consent and then this particular case they're strong feeling up here that Republicans are the Democrats simply decide this was going to be a search and destroy a mission from day one\nYou're renting pilot and just let me and then I put on that in the moments we have left because distracted when William ... absolutely they agreed that says about politics that says Republicans trying to get your guy confirmed before the midterm election\nOh I think there's a lot of truth to that we've said number one we would do it in a normal order a we were up to I Believe in Ninety One days now and the average is about sixty were about three weeks past the normal for the last five United States Supreme Court justices\nSenator rounds thanks so much you\nBet my grounds of South Dakota and we'll be speaking with a democratic senator elsewhere in the program\nBloomberg has a big story out today about eight tiny microchip not much bigger than a grain of rice\nThat ship has been found in the type of computer servers used by at least thirty major American companies including apple and major banks also servers used by the Pentagon and the CIA Bloomberg describes this chip as quote\nA stealth doorway into any network that included the altered machines and historically Bloomberg reports was built in China\nMichael Riley is one of the reporters who broke this story today Welcome thank you very much tell me a little bit more about this microchip and what kind of damage\nPotentially it's capable of doing\nYeah so it's a basically a chip that was built in to a mother board out it's made by a U.S company called super micro super micro even though most people have never heard of ... of the company is incredibly important in the business of making servers\nAnd several of the neurons of the cloud of the basically the Internet these big data centers with tens of thousands of service on them and these particular service for being assembled in China the actual mother boards were being built in China\nChina basically makes the vast majority of all technology in the world today it's all been off shored and most of it has gone to China\nAnd governments have long pointed out that this is a risk because if the country allows its spies to mess with that process it's a major threat but companies always assumed that that's too valuable to try to to mess with\nThe what the story tells us is in fact at least when the targets are viable enough for specific enough they're going to be willing to do that\nTo the critical question of who did this you quote sources you point to a Chinese military unit has her at China denies that they have\nDone this that they have anything to do with it how confident are you based on your reporting that this was trying to\n[noise] well that's certainly what the US government has assessed it to be and they as I said well U.S intelligence U.S intelligence what's right and that's that's a very high confidence\nAnd it's interesting when we asked China's foreign ministry for ... a lot of times they'll say things like you're crazy we nothing nothing about this their response with a little more nuanced and protect stolen environment we're in now basically said\nWe are a victim of these kinds of attacks to and you know they're right with the U.S government it's very very good at these kinds of hardware attacks and on a subtle way that the message that we're liberating was don't pick on just on us if you guys want to talk about very sophisticated hardware tax you have to talk about what you do as well you're\nCiting sources and U.S intelligence and I want to push you on that because some of the company's caught up in your reporting a ... which include Amazon which include apple which include super microbes they dispute summaries of your report and you've got their full statements on your Web site that's right\nThey say they want to respond they basically said nothing like this ever happened when you give me a sense of how many officials you talked to who were informing you're recording\nI'll give you some sense of the cluster of ah sources 'cause that's really important so we had\nSeveral sources inside of U.S intelligence community we had several sources inside a lot worse than we had sources inside the the other parts of the U.S government but we also more importantly had sources inside the companies who where these chips were found the interesting thing about apple and Amazon is they\nAre two very big very viable companies but they also have pretty good security of the fact that they found these chips was amazing in itself\nNow companies are gonna be responsible for what they what they want to say but based on our sourcing and the way it was layer for so many different places including inside of the companies were really confident that we had a story down\nSo what are the implications of this well they're large\nThey're really they're they're really march in economic and national security that's right in part because\nThe global economy is built on sort of global outsourcing trade model and again especially where it comes to technology China is a huge player in that\nAnd the implications of this are companies now have to think well do I have to worry about what's being put in the technology that's being manufactured how do I try and counter that is it should I go someplace else and make things I mean it's a it's a really big hard issue to solve\nA for a lot of companies a lot of companies the reason they operate and as cheaply and can sell products as cheaply as they can is because many of those ... products are made in China they have to rethink the entire model you could have sort of a tidal wave of decisions that could impact the the global economy [noise]\nYour reporting continues on like that is Bloomberg reporter

at the Capitol viewing one copy of the FBI's report on sexual assault claims against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nThe reporters confidential and reactions have been divided Democrats called incomplete Republicans say it was Thoreau\nA final vote on Kavanaugh could take place within forty eight hours and there are just a few undecided senators for more on that we are joined by NPR's Kelsey Snell like health care as you've been talking with senators today does this report seemed to have changed anyone's mind\nIt seems to be comforting for a lot of Republicans a Senator Bob Corker announced that he would vote for Kavanaugh after a briefing this morning he talked with some of us leader in the day as he was heading into actually read the report for himself and he said there was nothing new there to corroborate any allegations against cabinet and he said he felt he was comfortable now\nAnd then you have people like Lindsey Graham who's a huge Kavanaugh supporter before he says if anything this report made him feel stronger about that support here's what he said\nAnd I think after all this is a stronger in terms of understanding the facts and are looking for and I am ready to vote\nBut what about those three undecided senators we've been talking about all week what have you heard from them\nYeah we're focused still on Susan Collins of Maine Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Jeff Flake of Arizona those three Republicans are really critical here\nMurkowski has mostly been ducking reporters and she's gone in and out reading that report for much of the day\nOthers like Susan Collins of Maine and flake\nDid they say they haven't said exactly how there but they both say they found this report helpful\nCollins called a thorough and flake who is one of the people who actually called for this investigation he told reporters he thought it was Thoreau as well and he says he hasn't seen any new corroborating evidence which is the thing that he said before he Libya yes if that was the case if there wasn't that corroborating evidence that would be out\nThere were still kind of reading the tea leaves on how they're going to vote what about the contents of this report how much we learned about what's in it\nHonestly virtually nothing because they can't tell us anything it is confidential is locked behind those closed doors in the basement is the capital and we we do know is that it's about forty five pages and they spoke to about nine people and NPR's confirm the names of six of them and most of those people are friends of cabin on Fort from high school\nThey also spoke with Deborah Ramirez who was a classmate at Yale\nAnd she's the one who accuse cabinet of drunk and exposing himself to her in the early to mid eighties so like I said there's that one copy and the senators are just circulating through and telling us that and you know that these are mostly interviews and I'm a transcription as of the conversations that they had\nWe also know that Ford and Kavanaugh were not interviewed so they are not a part of this and denser pretty upset about that [noise]\nSo senators now have to report the Senate majority leader has said he wants to vote in the next forty eight hours what happens in that time\nUh sometime likely tomorrow morning there will be a procedural vote that is necessary for them to move on\nThey need fifty one votes to pass that and that makes this a really key test because fifty one of those is all it takes to approve his confirmation when that comes up so if they can get to the fifty one votes now it's very likely they'll be able to get to it wants to find a book comes up\nAnd you know it it it well it is procedural it's really extremely rare for people to change their minds after procedural votes\nIs and you know just as a reminder there are fifty one votes Republicans have that right now and they can afford to lose one person and still approve Kavanaugh because president Mike Pence could step in and cast that tie breaker then I found all kinds of not thirty hours later and sometime maybe Saturday afternoon or early evening for a final the\nHealthy we reflect on the political consequences of this controversy were about a month out from the terms yesterday we heard about this NPR Marist Poll signed a Republican enthusiasm had jumped over the last month perhaps because of Kavanaugh do you expect that this confirmation vote could have a real impact on congressional elections\nHonestly it depends on how you're looking at it for House Democrats it's great they're fighting a battle ground in the suburbs and they are eagerly courting women there and this has energized then the Senate battleground on the other hand is in states that Trump won and twenty sixteen\nAnd that's a much harder situation for Democrats up for re election in those states so far only one Democrat in front of that group is something we haven't heard from that Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nAnd yesterday Heidi Heitkamp said she was a no and this is what she said\nThe process has been bad but at the end of the day you have to make a decision and I've made that decision\nPolls are showing her down and this might be the thing that you need to do to kind of remind people she is a Democrat and this is in the state of North Dakota right that's right and I mean a lot of Democrats that they think Republican enthusiasm may said if a cabinet gets confirmed so we will see\nNPR's Kelsey Snell thanks so much Frank\nYou well as we just heard Kelsey no they're the FBI interviewed nine people for its report not Ford or Kavanaugh or some of the others from the judges past who have stepped forward to share thoughts on his nomination ... went to Yale with Kavanaugh he says they used to drink together\nThat would Kevin I'll drink he got belligerent and aggressive that he wants to sell Kevin I'll throw a drink and a man's face prompting a bar fight and that he believes Kevin not may have lied under oath I asked ... did he offered this information to the FBI\nOr yes I did um I ah eventually did reach them by phone from the did than telling me what exactly to do first and that entailed sending a request for a form to fill out\nAnd then I filled out the form in fact when the former arrived it had been pre filled by the uh presumably the Asian I spoke to a with my testimony unit that took up most of the three thousand the characters bases of bailout\nThey're really yes\nThey call their state's senior senator just Lisa off for no her even ... who's twenty seven and by far the youngest she says Murkowski seems receptive to her constituents\nBut he said at a table with her you know she's is very important person but she still like look you in the eye and is very warm and my experience I've had with her other\nGroups are also sending Alaskans to meet with Murkowski Molly Hague helped organized Capitol Hill visits for sexual assault survivors on behalf of the Alaska grassroots alliance she says Murkowski's willingness to listen is the reason so many want to make their case to her\nI think that Senator Murkowski throughout the years has shown a lot of women's issues and we're really hopeful we're hopeful that we can love her to the right side of that one the limiting factors now\nAre the senators appointment schedule and airline seats there's only so many flights out of Alaska

would stop me\nAnd said don't\nHe goes\nNo I have to say I was not an educated musician when it came to the United states I was Eighteen I went to Berkeley I could barely speak English really so I kind of left words for a long time and it was really interested in worthless music and singing along with instruments doubling line so\nI don't know what am I\nAn edited another but then once I became more comfortable with that then I felt like I could go back to the ... and also I think after I came to LA I I married ... who's a record producer bass player he's again like my mom and avid\nReader I Love spoke a tree and it was really good friends with Leonard Cohen and you know I find that that also helps me arrived at this moment with this record I don't know and\nSo one day Larry my husband brings home this book and it's one of these things that I just kind of carried around and was in the car with me and I was going here and there and going on the road and carrying around and I just love the there's a drawing of Leonard's on the front I Love the cover and the first bomb in the book is\nThe book of longing and it's just remarkable I think there was a sense of rhythm and his poetry then that's what attracts me to\nGet the\nMessage\nWho I'm living on the Lewis thank God\nOh calls\n... which is a you know for the crash\nWhen I had to come to the music it's always the same\nI start by falling in love with it and then I memorize it and I walk around and it becomes a part of me and uh and then I think it's mine and really for myself into thinking I wrote this because I kind of have\nTo in order to take the liberties that I Need to take and so I just repeat align a few times and then my hands considered the piano on a certain way and then a rhythm comes and then ...\nAnd I find that the most primordial thing that we have the most primary thing that we have in life is whether it's the walking that we do it's right at the breathing that we do we're commanded by that\nEvery day every second that\n... ...\nI ended up setting seven if these phones to music and I went to Leonard and asked him if I'm if I could continue and maybe make a recording of it and he he declined slightly who said no\nAnd I was devastated but he stayed with me and uh I didn't go any further because I knew that maybe this will be an impossible project and I didn't want to fall in love with it and then be disappointed over and over again\nBut I ended up asking when I did my record in two thousand and Fifteen called speaking in tongues it was a record all were less no no words at all but I had these two plumes that I really thought it would fit so well in the record and I asked him again in this time he said yes a war\nThat my\nKnives lab pet nicely to love\nMy no I can only\nWhen Leonard passed away it was as if a family member had died had been at our wedding and he just you know I felt close to him because I so admired him\nBut it was it was quite sad in for Larry of course it was devastating um but it's losing more than more than the friend\nI think for us also for artists is losing that voice that Lucy boys I mean these last record is brilliant and and you just keep hoping that folks like that would keep putting out music and poetry so you can keep\nLifting yourself to do that and learning to read so we sat on so many levels ... know\nMarriage has been\nPretty young for kids in those ... and\n... to me sometimes it's almost an act of resistance like\nPersonally so it's not that my poems of political but for some of the record called these things it's not a poem about love which some of the other poems on the record our but it's a poem about to me about the state of things right now we carry flags we say things but what are these things that were doing all these\nI also think that the act of just being contemplate isn't just be reflect teen and reflects in about the world around and taking time to read something\nAnd to\nSee what that does to you is an act of resistance right now because the world is incredibly loud and fast pace in a way that the velocity of things is overwhelming to all of us so sitting with one poll and for a few minutes or one song or\nOne record the act of concentration required to read poetry and to listen to [noise]\nIs an act of resistance nowadays because it brings you minimally\nThe book of longing available for

I Hope you'll read Susan Collins a statement today she has a lot of faith in him the things she said about him as being a moderate\nIf he takes us to hoard and that really works is service on the court it will be a departure from was critics expect\nDo you think the Democrats miscalculated by shining a spotlight on a victim who originally wanted to remain anonymous opening an FBI investigation that ultimately provided cover for senators on the fence to support the candidate and doing a long term harm to the reputation of someone who is not likely to sit on the Supreme Court for decades\nHow could we walk away from a credible charge of sexual assault against the nominee to the Supreme Court in the United states how could we ignore that we couldn't\nAnd there was an effort made by Senator Feinstein to deal with the coals for confidentiality and protecting her identity eventually came out and I'm Glad that Susan Collins made it clear that Senator Feinstein should not be accused of leaking this I don't believe for a second that you would have ever considered that\nBut the fact is it became public fact a public issue on a critically important in a timely issue we couldn't walk away from it had to ask for an investigation to ask for hearing those are just normal request on Capitol Hill\nJust in our last thirty seconds or so do you think that this bitter and divisive fight will have long term consequences for the Senate\nI Hope not I think what we need to do after this is finished mixed week roll up our sleeves and find a bipartisan measure to work on we've been doing things like the opium bill and the federal as a a reauthorization bill\nThey do not have been getting much tension next to this issue we need to get back to business roll up our sleeves be bipartisan show that we can work together and restore some confidence in his buddy\nSenator Dick Durbin Democrat of Illinois thanks for joining us here on all things considered thank you\nOh at the heart of the sites of course the Supreme Court one of the most respected institutions in the country\nAnd a lot of people are asking would affect the partisan fight over Kavanaugh might have on the high court\nIt questioned no one is better poised to answer then NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg Hi Nina high so speaking of partisanship I'm going to get to the effect on the court in a second but start with the partisanship that a lot of people saw on display when Brett Kavanaugh testified last week he talked about that\nThat he was being targeted as revenge\nThe Clintons that you've covered a lot of Supreme Court confirmation fights have had you ever seen anything like that\nLook in historical terms nothing like this has ever happened before a Supreme Court nominee using partisan language to describe not just the senators but all of his opponents and couching the opposition\nPurely in terms of anger over the over the twenty sixteen presidential election Kavanaugh's performance in fact\nCause retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens a lifelong Republican to speak out against the nominee and he said that he'd like Kavanaugh as a judge even put his picture and one of his books because of a decision that Kevin wrote\nBut Kavanaugh's demeanor and partisanship Stevenson Steven said demonstrated a potential bias involving enough potential lit against before the court\nThat he would not be able to perform his full responsibilities and might have to recuse himself because of that ad parents bias here's here's Stevens speaking to a group in Florida yesterday\nFor the good of the court who it is not that healthy they get a new justice you know well they do a part time job\nNow I don't really think that Kavanaugh's likely to recuse himself and indeed you saw him today and the wall Street Journal and an op ed piece trying to somehow walked back some of his comments without specify which ones\nIt appears are based on how things are shaking out in the Senate today that a plenty of senators enough senators are prepared to vote to confirm Kavanaugh despite all these questions being raised by Justice Stevens another so what does that mean for the politics of the court or at least the appearance of the court that it shouldn't be above politics\nWell the justices will grit their teeth and and they'll put on a good show in public and private I suspect\nChief justice John Roberts knows and has stressed that the courts best currency is the notion that it's not a partisan institution that there may be ideological differences but not partisan once\nAnd all of this cannot be sitting well with him\nYeah Republican Susan Collins of Maine a made a dramatic speech today weighing in on some of these questions she was announcing her support for Kavanaugh here's a little bit of what she had to say\nFervent hall is that Brett Kavanaugh will work to less than ... ...\nThe Supreme Court so that we have far fewer five four decisions\n[noise] how big a challenge is that going to be enough for for Brett Kavanaugh at this stage to lessen divisions\n[laughter] well you don't even have to go there just are you have to do is look at his record\nCollins framed it as a quite moderate record today but there's a reason that President Trump added cabinet to that list of potential candidates for the court\nAnd that is that on questions ranging from gun regulation to executive power to abortion to overall regulations he's firmly in the conservative some would even say ultraconservative vein of judicial ideology so\nI Would indeed expect eventually anyway lots of five to four votes\nWhere the five justice conservative majority firmly entrenched a court that is far more conservative that end than any we have seen in this country for\nI Would say probably three quarters of the sense of a century how fast that happens well that remains to be seen\nJust a couple of seconds left but if this vote goes as expected this weekend how quickly would you expect him to be seated I Would expect him to be seated probably Tuesday Morning [noise] wow NPR's Nina Totenberg thanks as always thank you [noise]\n\n\nYou're listening

has secured enough votes to be confirmed to the Supreme Court and the final Senate vote is expected tomorrow\nThat's despite Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual assault against the nominee\nShe says Kavanaugh pinned her down uncovered her mouth when she tried to screen while they were both at a gathering in high school he has strenuously denied those claims are calling Michel Martin spoke earlier today with one of Ford's lawyer's Lisa Banks and Michelle started by asking how professor Ford is doing\nI think she's doing as well as can be expected and I think she's keeping an eye on things and and following what's happening but mostly she's trying to work on getting back to a life as she knew it before she thinks she's going to be able to do that\nWell I think she hopes to do that uh she's not living in her house yet she continues to receive threats but she also continues to receive a thousands and thousands of messages of support\nMany Republican senators even the president initially talked about how credible they found her to be so what does she now make of the fact and what do you now make of the fact that so many of the same senator say that they are nevertheless planning to vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh what do you think that means\nI think that means we're in a very political environment and she certainly was credible I think everybody recognizes that she was telling the truth\nThe committee members had to take that information the senators have to take that information and make the best vote they can or to cast the best that they can and I think it's not surprising in this day and age that in large respect this is coming down to a party line vote\nJust professor Ford wish you could come forward sooner I mean knowing that Republicans have now describe this as a last minute ambush down from her perspective obviously it wasn't I mean she did try to reach out to her representatives some months ago but given that this is how it has now been characterized\nHow does she feel about her decision to come forward into should we should come forward sooner\nWell she came forward when she learned that he was on the shortlist of nominees she came forward to her representative\nSo this was not politically motivated at all he hadn't yet been nominated and at that point she had to make the a difficult calculation of the desire to come forward and performers civic duty with what she knew would be the tremendous personal cost to her and her family\nUh and so she had to weigh that and ultimately she did come forward and that was partly because of her name was leaked she had initially wanted her name to be confidential\nHow does she feel about coming forward as she glad that she did she regret that she did\nI think she has always felt that it was the right thing to do to provide this information to the Judiciary Committee so they could make the best decision possible and so she does not regret the fact that she did it\nSo if judge Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court [noise] what do you think that means\nI don't know that I can say what that means other than we are going to have a debate I think in this country about what it means when women come forward a and how our institutions handle that information and and respond to it\nBut I Do have to press the question though if judge Kavanaugh is confirmed even after this messy process will doctor for feel that she failed no doctor Ford's\nGoal here was never to impact the process to derail the nomination what she was trying to do was what she thought was the right thing to do as a citizen which is to provide the information\nTo the U.S Senate so they could make the most informed decision possible her goal wasn't to derail the nomination it was to inform the nomination and she's done that so there is no way anybody could look at what has happened here and determined that she has failed\nThat's Lisa Banks attorney for Christine Blasey
