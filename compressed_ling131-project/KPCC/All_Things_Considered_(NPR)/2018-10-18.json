S. but also that Yemen itself\nI imagine there's also contracts that you can follow tracing Saudis reaching out to lobbyists who they want to reach out to the private sector or for talking ...\nYes so a great example of that is um one of the lobbying groups that Saudi Arabia hired recently was founded by Howard ... who was the former chairman of the house armed services committee\nAnd one of their other clients is Lockheed Martin which is one of the defense contractors that sells arms to Saudi Arabia fairly regularly\n[noise] I also mentioned think tanks and those donations and grants those are a little bit harder to track explain why\nExactly so the foreign agents registration act is not well enforced by the department of justice they rely on a policy of voluntary compliance and they haven't really clarified what activities in relationships are covered by the law\nI think tanks have traditionally not been required to register under the foreign agents registration act\nThere is a rule in the house that when non governmental witnesses particularly think tank experts are asked to testify they have to file what are known as truth in testimony farms\nIn which they have to disclose any foreign funding received within the last few years as it relates to the subject of the hearing unfortunately Haiti as it relates to the subject of the hearing\nHas ended up being very narrowly interpreted so\nFor instance a hearing on Iranian backed militias which has a table of experts from I think tanks who specializes in Middle Eastern policy and receive millions of dollars from governments like Saudi Arabia Qatar and you're and I'd ever ever since which really do have an interest in this topic they'll undisclosed\nSo this is a long standing practice of countries such as the kingdom of Saudi Arabia providing grants or other donations to big think tanks are that are influential where do you didn't think so much for stopping by thank you for having me she's an investigator with the project on government oversight\nPresident Trump often criticizes people he has appointed two top jobs and the government lately he's going after someone who sets monetary policy\nThat none of my biggest threat\nIs the fed because the fed is raising rates too fast and\nIt's independent so I don't speak to him but I'm not happy with what he's doing\nThat with Trump attacking Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell on the Fox Business Network last night there is a history of tension between the White House and the fed and NPR's Uri Berliner joins us to tell us more about the fiery ... we'll start with what's happening right now why is the president going after the chairman of the Federal Reserve\nWill back in July he said he wasn't happy with the fed rate hikes he suggested that they could interfere with the economic expansion\nAnd then more recently right after the stock market so off you complain again the some a lot more strenuously you said the fed had gone crazy and was out of control\nThen yesterday he dug up even more saying the fed was his biggest threat now the president's been criticized for these attacks including by some former members of the fed you know they say this can create political pressure that interferes with the feds independence but others say you know the fed is fair game and should really be able to defend his policies if they get criticized\nYeah we heard it on tape Trump saying well the fed is independent so I'm not going to attack them but they're crazy out of control the direct he's not the first president to attack the Federal Reserve tell us more about the history here\nIt was true or not it hasn't happened up so much recently but you know back when Lyndon Johnson was president he clashed with his fed chairman William McChesney Martin this was in Johnson was spending a lot on anti poverty programs in the Vietnam War\nMartin was a fiscal conservative and he famously said the Fed's job was to take away the punch bowl just as the party is getting going so they didn't get along and then Nineteen sixty five LBJ someone Martin to his ranch in Texas for a stern talk\nAccording to Martin's oral history LBJ said to him Martin my boys are dying in Vietnam and you won't print the money I Need\nAnd then it was Richard Nixon Nixon pressured fed chairman Arthur Burns to keep rates low in the run up to the Nineteen Seventy two election or the first President Bush he didn't criticize Alan Greenspan publicly when he was president but years later when he was out of office he said he thought Greenspan cost him his reelection\nSo it sounds like President Trump who is known for violating norms is keeping with a long established an army or is there anything different about these attacks happening now\nHis rhetoric not surprisingly how blood that is also it's been very public ah you know I Can't also think of any of the prison who said the fed is crazy\nOr what when presidents are unhappy with the fed is almost always the same reason presidents want lower rates easier credit flowing through the economy that can boost growth and not coincidentally my presence more popular but I can also lead to inflation presidents\nI'm an earthquake early warning system was rolled out today by California officials in Pasadena is designed to give folks a few seconds to brace before the shaking of a major

leaders are trying to one more time to agree on terms for breakfast\nBut it keep person is missing from tonight's talks British prime minister Theresa May earlier today may briefed her fellow European leaders on progress that negotiators have made so far\nAnd then the other twenty seven leaders met over dinner without Mrs Maine to decide what to do next NPR psoriasis already Nelson is in Brussels watching the ... and goings at the summit Shariah\nHi Mary Louise let me ... street to the basic question which is whether or not they're going to reach a deal before the u._k. scheduled to depart the use this coming march where does that stand well\nThat's the question that nobody seems to be able to answer tonight uh everyone's trying to put on a optimistic face chance or ... tonight said there Ninety percent of the way they're Merkel of Germany go on Iraq\nUm and ah but the problem is that there is a key sticking point about where to basically put the border between the u._k. and the ... you have to have a hard border with customs and passport control and that's what I think the border that they are that they don't want is between Northern Ireland\nAnd uh Ireland Ireland being part of the EU in Northern Ireland being part of the u._k.\nAnd so they can't agree though exactly where to put it elsewhere who would run that border that sort of thing and that's what's holding everything up\nAnd it's really frustrating because everybody felt that this week was the week they had to come to a deal in order to get enacted before brags that happens on march twenty ninth of next year slow that prime minister Peter ... captured the dire or our mood as it were the best\nThing he's usually an optimistic person but not today\nMy hope was that today we will have already some folks have a solution on the table but it looks like it will not be a deal today\nBut he and other leaders are saying that they're keeping an open mind what\nAbout Theresa May the British prime minister she's still sounding optimistic\nI well I Would say she's the cheerleader today I mean she says that the u._k. position is still on the table she feels that they're getting close a but she wouldn't say whether she's presenting any new proposals which the e council president Donald Tusk and other leaders want\nThis seems to be with you very hard in order to ensure that was the address these issues of what we've seen is that we've sold most of the issues in withdrawal agreement I Believe in ... she says she's not at the time to make sure she also wouldn't say\nWhat she thought about extending the transition period the u._k. would have to leave the EU which is something that some leaders including the Irish prime minister we're talking about\nElaborate on that I mean what would that mean to extend the transition period after Britain leaves the you\nWell right now the agreement is more or less that ah when the u._k. leads on twenty ninth of march next year that basically until the thirty first of December the following year in other words twenty twenty or economic and trade deals between the u._k. and he would remain unchanged\nAnd now they're talking about extending yet another full year in order to increase the chance of negotiating a full treaty\nAnd meanwhile hanging over all this is the specter of a Britain might leave the EU without a deal might just crush out yeah\nAnd that's something that everyone is is quite worried about um besides the fact you have snarled borders and price hikes for good or it's\nIt would be a problem for a lot of the countries including Germany for example where analysts say that the cost of ... feet a hundred and Fifteen billion dollars if there is a hard bread that as it were\nA hundred and Fifteen billion while NPR surround sound hard enough and reporting from Brussels thank you so you're right You're welcome Mary Louise\nSo what would a hard Brexit means for British and European economies\nGeorge Parker has written about this she's a political editor at the Financial Times joining us from Brussels where he is following the negotiations welcome back to the program ... if there were to be no deal at all what immediate changes would take effect on march twenty nine when the u._k. leaves the\nWell they could be quite severe it all depends on what kind of no deal we actually end up with if it was a totally chaotic an acrimonious no deal with\nEverybody ended up throwing places each other in person left to you in very bad judge and indeed then you could see some very serious impacts of the border so you would have\nA immediately you'd have checks on old goods coming in and also the u._k. which doesn't have the moment that will quickly to huge queues at the ports coming into person and very quickly the companies in person which rely on seamless flow of goods across borders in Europe they would run out parts factories were closed down\nOn the bank of England is focused this could be actually a very detailed chicken damaging upside for the British economy which could last for months there's all sorts of contingency planning guy on the u._k. in case this happens to cook stockpiling of medicines\nThere's the fresh food wrote could run out very quickly there are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of informal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool\nIt will be quite bad and the pursuit call me will take a very big ...\nSo you're saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves the lack of medicines and pharmacies\nYeah I mean there's been some sort of stockpiling some certain types of medicines\nOnce you've ... place with a ... you can have she's running for miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile cues things just wouldn't be coming through so so there are concerns that they will be shortages certainly in more distant pilots from the pool so pretty serious sets us in our series of being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nThese new officers get five weeks of training but just the four hours rocky teachers on how to deal with women prisoners everyone's\nSaying we're supposed to treat everyone the same for ... and says that's why is there you our listeners\nAcross the country some Fifteen states are teaching new ways of treating women prisoners\nGender response of corrections is built around the understanding that women prisoners are different they're less likely to come to prison for violent crimes in prison are less likely than men to be violent but the discipline system in prison is set up to control violent men so those rules country women more harshly were unfairly\nIt's an insight that came out of decades of academic research from feminist historians sociologist and other academics from women consultants who specializes in prisons and from that minority of women who made a career in corrections like Maggie Burke\nShe was the warden of a women's prison in Illinois but she too started as a corrections officer at a men's prison\nYou do firearms your very first week of training and then that screens everybody out you can't pass with a weapon than you can't do the job and and I'm going to tell you that you know twenty nine years in the department and I've never had usually on\nThe second thing she says corrections officers learn how to use handcuffs\nAnd so that kind of set people up with an expectation that the work we're doing is physical as aggressive as learned orders paramilitary but the work we're doing is talking to people in the changing lives and you don't do that by barking orders you don't do that by forcing people to do something\nAbout Seventy five the Ninety percent of women in prison had been victims of sexual or physical violence when a corrections officer especially if it's a man yells or boxing order the woman's reaction is often defensive she might just shut down or she might yell back and that\nCan result in a ticket she gets disciplined\nTypically when you tell them in to do something a male and he he's either going to do it but he's not ... he's not going to talk that there isn't a whole lot of emotion to it\nBroke worked in men's and women's prisons\nWhereas with women emotion is in their\nThis sounds like a generalization but we heard it over and over from experts on women's prisons\nAnd it was she's just like go ahead write me a ticket it just feels a fire and so then it's an emotional ticket\nPrison guards are trained to keep it made under control women in our society in general are expected to be compliant and if they push back which in prison they do more than men officers use that tool they have pre control they hand out punishment\nNow she's got influenced cause she's talking back at me and maybe she said something that I can perceive us threatening and I'm In a right you know that she threatened me\nNPR and the deal school of journalism at Northwestern university collected data on prison discipline from Fifteen states\nWe estimated rates of punishment for men and women and our numbers show that women typically get disciplined at higher rates for the more minor violations of prison rules\nOften uh twice or three times the rate for men for those smaller things like disobeying a corrections officer or cursing or talking back who send the Gillum as a prisoner at the Iowa correctional institution for women serving time for robbery\nShe remembers when not that long ago she get into a lot of trouble for talking back\nOnce a corrections officer made an announcement on the overhead speaker for the women to be quiet but ... says she was on another part of the cell block and didn't hear it\nWhile I was coming from upstairs and I have to end up and I said well but that and he said hey I said no talk and whatever and now it's like well you don't have to yeah and I let him down here and he made a comment on our site well this is America I can say what I Want [laughter] and he wrote me up for it fell my response that smart Adam\n... and I got a a major report\nTypically when women prisoners by weight rules even a lesser violation that can lose privileges like getting visits are using the phone they can go to solitary confinement or have days added to their time in prison\nNow the prison in Iowa trains officers that if it's not a security issue that some of those things go de escalate situations that we the tickets\nBecause officers the new ones that I've noticed they they talk to us more they interact with us more to access how we doing not trying to be our friend realized that where people on that we've made mistakes they get ourselves here you know they they're kinder\nAnd ... says that's changing the way corrections officers responded to her help premature\nShe's been taking college classes and once you leave prison next year she wants to complete her degree and get a job counseling people recovering from substance abuse as states start implementing these new ways of treating women there is a small amount of research that shows women like who send the Gillum men do better when they leave prison\nSo are there lessons in this women's reformed to make present work better for men to\nBecky Nate thanks so women lead the way yes she's a pioneer of gender response of corrections she started the national resource center on just a symbol women\nMen probably have trauma in their lives men probably been victimized in their lives men have lots of discipline issues\nAnd men make up Ninety three percent of people in prison\nSo maybe we will find some opportunities to take the work we know about trauma and give it a male fan and have that be very helpful to them as well\nJust like women's prisons learned from studying what specific about the trauma of women may says men's prisons can learn by studying what specific about the lives of men she says there's already an example\nMore men's prisons are trimming corrections officers how to de escalate conflict to figure out what it is about men that causes them to ACT UP and to use that gender based knowledge to avoid situations that we'd be getting disciplined for violating prison rules Joseph Shapiro\nNPR News [noise] and you can find our entire

Fifteen ... airplanes to to carry out airstrikes United States supplies the weapons the maintenance the training if the U.S threatened in any way to to live\nCooperation that would severely restrict the way that the Saudis could carry out that that war there been high civilian casualties\nAnd that's something the U.S could press the Saudis on if they so chose the other is this boycott of Qatar Saudi Arabia's neighbor well Qatar's of very wealthy country it's also a close us ally a major us airbase there um and and so that\nUh is something the U.S could could stress and say hey play nice with guitar we want these are all we're both were all in this together um let's let's end that boycott\nOut Saudi Arabia reacting to the possibility of these sanctions what would their response likely be\nWell they they came out this week and said that they would respond with greater action if if some sorts of punitive measures are imposed on them um they could always pump less oil and try to drive up prices although that goes very much against their the way they've always done business\nUm interesting factoid or the Energy Department announced just last month the U.S has surpassed Saudi Arabia and Russia as the world's leading oil producer about eleven\nMillion barrels per day so Saturday El Al is just not as important as it is it used to be a but this uh this ... is a reminder that relations are often strain the thing you often hear when talking about the U.S in Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is these are countries that share the share interests not values\nNPR's Greg Myre we thank you thank you yesterday President Trump compared the show gee case to the debate over Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh he said both are cases of quote guilty until proven innocent\nDuring the confirmation debate the Supreme Court justices themselves largely kept quiet now the Kavanaugh is on the court chief justice John Roberts is speaking publicly trying to make sure that the bitter fight doesn't cast a shadow over the high court\nI Will not criticized the political branches we do that often enough in our opinions\nAbout what I Would like to do briefly is emphasized how the judicial branch is how it must be very different\nTo chief justice gave that audience at the University of Minnesota law school a de facto civics lesson about the role of the Supreme Court in American democracy\nOur role is very clear we are to interpret the constitution and laws of the United states and ensure that the political branches act within them that job obviously requires\nIndependence from the political branches the story of the Supreme Court would be very different without that sort of independence\nRoberts highlighted some of the difficult decisions the court made that ran contrary to popular political opinions of the day and Roberts said when the court has made mistakes it is because the court gave in to political pressure for example the Korematsu ruling that upheld internment of Japanese Americans during World War two he\nShared a tradition the justices have one that's designed to reinforce their shared commitment to working together despite ideological differences\nBefore we go on to the bench to hear argument in the case and before we go into the conference room to discuss the case we pause for a moment and shake each other's hand it's a small thing perhaps but it is they repeated reminder\nThat as our newest colleagues put it we do not sit on opposite sides of an ...\nWe do not serve one party or one interest we serve one nation and I want

Fifteen I\nA tooth [noise] and I was on the way to the dentist\nAnd I was in a very introspective mood at the time asking myself questions around my fears around my anxieties but I was with a to take\nAnd saw today ... got in my car and I'm riding on a highway and that is when I had the idea for so afraid\nOkay talk about all the things that you're afraid of in this very moment and whenever I have an idea how pull out my phone and out press the voice memo\nI'm afraid that you are let me I'm afraid I'm afraid not like I'm afraid that you know my family that I'm not who I Am I'm afraid it I can never ever be on the ground\n[laughter] I was like okay let's get it out let's get it out let's get out what are you afraid of what are these things that have been holding you back giving you a ... let's just talk about that I'm Still a great\nOh yeah oh really oh\nWhat I ended up doing was getting back to the studio and planning for Nate wonder who is my music collaborator and telling him exactly how one of the song ago [noise] and\nSo right now you hear Nate wander playing the guitar whenever I'm building the song I like to start with Qatar or piano because I I think that great songs are able to be played with just the minimal instrumentation and it still resonates with you and I wanted to really be about my voice\nHow the kids running around playing ... around the gang\nI Wonder if you just highlight kids in my neighborhood back in Kansas City Kansas run into the ghetto would not a care in the world [noise] I envy kids sometimes because they don't know about the world you know they haven't dealt with police brutality that haven't dealt with\nGun violence there's just so fewer and it's just like this moment where you wish like man if I would've known what I knew and I was seven years old I Would have been saying thank you every single day for those days but then\n... food to watch their children grow old daughter Sharpton\nThe knives in my home for food is a metaphor for girls and women and how tough we have to you know I Am square black woman who grew up the working class parents\nWho every single day is reminded by those in addition of power that we don't care about women had to have more armor because in this world that I'm growing up and\nIt's not always going to be safe for me\nAs I kept recording the song I started to realize that there was power in vulnerability\nAnd I realize that the times that I connected most and that I was encouraged and inspired most was by the vulnerabilities of others the way that they were able to talk about their insecurities did something remarkable and I'm a friendly [noise] oh\nI'm so afraid there's so much power in a meeting that we are afraid afraid of loving the person that folks that you should love afraid of forgiving America\nFor the things that they've done to the black and brown folks are so the ... community you just afraid to trust your country and you're just afraid to love yourself\nAnd so I think that this song represents that what it means to to live in such a fearful state\nWhat if\nThere's one other thing do my sense of fun and much shit yeah I'm afraid of it you know afraid of loving you\nKnow\nOne of the things that I've always wanted to do is to make timeless futuristic music [laughter] that you can play it in the future you can play it if you travel\nBack and so the thing that I Love most about the song is\nThis and they bring the sense of like earring is\nJust on the future is in\n\n... lighter after I recorded so afraid\nI felt like I Am pacts and things like what it really means to love myself and what it means\nTo allow myself to be loving to fall deeply in love with another person\nI think that openly talking about fears keeps us connected I feel so much more inspired and encouraged to move forward when somebody's telling me about their infections\nAnd then they come out of them is just like how is the leader made how is a broken person able to become a brave person\nVulnerability there's so much power and\nHow the kids run around magazines on a lot of the doubt level around the gang all\nWe can listen to a longer version of a

Montana today president Donald Trump took questions from reporters about the alleged ... member meant and murder of a Washington Post columnist NPR's Mara Liasson has more\nDuring the Mexican revolution just stop raiders from coming across into border states but today we're talking about families with small children seeking asylum their longstanding federal laws that give protection to immigrants who qualify as refugees they have the right to cross at legal ports of entry and ask for asylum\nWhether troops could be sent to the international bridges to block them is an interesting question the policy come Titus act prevents the military from being used for civilian law enforcement\nIt's interesting that the the most relevant precedent to eh you're saying that you have to go back a hundred years took to withdraw Wilson right\nLet me let me ask you that the Trump Administration frames all of this in terms of crisis but the situation at the border is a crisis and sell appropriate measures are required is the situation at the border right now a crisis\nWell a homeland security spokesperson told me that they're compiling the urine figures right now and she says the numbers of immigrant families arriving at the border will likely break records on a monthly basis and now it's important to keep this in context Mary Louise because\nBack in two thousand they were arresting one and a half million undocumented immigrants a year so far this year it's been under four hundred thousand but still the Trump Administration is upset and frustrated they continue to blame everything on Congress for allowing what they called catch and release loopholes in the law\nThe d._a. just spokesman told me that the agency is examining all options to secure the border\nAnd when that spokesperson talks about all options family separation is back on the table this policy that was so controversial that the president had to walk back and and reverse it when they tried that earlier this year\nAnd so now homeland security is considering a new sort of watered down form of family separation but also to act as a deterrent to families speaking about crossing a such as those in the caravan right now here's the president on the south lawn of the weekend\nIf they fail the separation in many cases they don't do\nThat of course is the case that the administration made when they rolled out of the family separation policy right earlier this year or so what would a watered down version look\nLike well they're talking about something called a binary choice detained families with their children would have two options one that could give their kids up to a government use shelter where the kids would eventually be sponsored by a relative or a foster family who are already here in the U.S\nAn option to they could keep their kids with them in detention indefinitely\nUntil their asylum cases resolved currently a court ruling says the kids can't be locked up with their parents for more than three weeks rate of this would extend that and immigrant advocates are appalled here's Michelle brane a of the women's refugee commission on a call with reporters yesterday\nLet's be clear it ... it's a binary choice policy that the administration is considering it punish and Cher families for taking this is round two of the administration family separation policy\nJohn Burnett ... round two or watered down whatever we want to call this revisiting a family separation the same challenges are there right I mean for example if they want to ramp up detention of immigrant families the question of where they would put all these families\nRight and of course the binary choice is still being considered it's not policy yet but if they put it into practice the question is where would they detain all these families currently there are a little over three thousand spots for family members and what are called special family residential centers\nBut you're talking about thousands of these immigrant families that are arrested every week at the southwest border these days um the government doesn't have enough detention bed so for the foreseeable future you'll see a continuation of families\nBeing arrested their process for a few days and then most are released with ankle monitors with their kids to show up for immigration court and that's what's been the devil in the Trump Administration all along\nNPR's John Burnett reporting thank you John you bet Mary Louise\nInterior secretary Ryan Zinke has been one of the most controversial members of President Trump's cabinet there are numerous investigations into his conduct a secretary when the day began there were reports that think he was planning to replace the independent watchdog leading some of those investigations\nThat department now says that's not happening and parents ... reports\nAll started with an email from housing secretary Ben Carson telling hug employees that Suzanne Israel tops HUD assistant secretary for administration was leaving that agency to become acting inspector general at the department of interior\nThis came as a surprise to many in Washington perhaps even to the current acting inspector general Mary candle\nFor one thing inspectors general are appointed by the president and the White House hadn't announced anything and lose Hempel which of the project on government oversight systems didn't have the experience that would qualify her to be an inspector general\nThey look at really are they should be non political issues that oversight hearing that had an investigative background that kind of crime than are the kind of watched outlaw\nTops is a former Trump campaign aide who was brought to hug by Carson to replace the staffer who blew the whistle on Carson's plans to use taxpayer dollars to buy a thirty one thousand dollar dining set\n... ethics have also been questioned the inspector general's office has been looking at among other things his redrawing of the boundaries of the grand staircase Escalante national monument in Utah the benefit of Trump ally\nThere are other investigations as crusader director of the western values project a Montana based conservation watchdog group\nThere's another that involved a real estate deal that secretary they keep Family Foundation with potentially involved within his own town that what it then finance in part by the German Halliburton which of course has a lot of it before the department of interior\nBut today in a statement to NPR Interior Department spokeswoman Heather swift said Carson's email had false information in it that no decision was ever made to move tops to interior that while she was referred to the department by the White House as a potential candidate for a job in the inspector general's office quote\nAt the end of the day she was not offered a job and interior Brian Naylor NPR News Washington\n\n...\n...\nIt's all things considered from NPR News and it's on

G is a mystery but one that could be easily solved no need for a huge long investigation\nThe post to the reporters at the Washington Post have been out front on investigating this story in terms of trying to piece together what may have happened [noise] based on information available to you have to ask do you believe he is dead\nYou know we we held onto this call and then he filed the day before he entered the consulate [noise] uh in the hopes that we could edited with him as we normally did\nAnd um we waited and waited and I think the fact that we published today has kind of an acknowledgement to ourselves as well as to the world that we don't have much hope that we're going to be able to edit this one with him or that will ever be getting another call them from him\nFrom everything we know it seems as if he was in victim of a monstrous crime\n[noise] I'm going to ask you about the dual role that the Washington Post is playing\nHere there is of course a firewall between the newsroom and reporters an editorial page but you run a firewall that's always there but in this case has it been tricky with post reporters trying to aggressively investigate what happened even as your editorial pages calling on the Trump Administration to do more to investigate what happened you\nKnow I don't think so I mean you know in the editorial side were often taken positions\nI Know but is it different when it's a position on one of\nYour own you know we are all in the post newsroom dependence side of the new site I think everybody is feeling this very personally\nAnd I think we're all determined to show that you can't do this do one of ours this can't be a world where our government can lure a journalist to their own diplomatic compound in a foreign country\nThen the worst is true dismembered him and have him disappear\nYou just spoke about feeling this personally um how has his disappearance affected your team and affected you\nKnow it's it's very painful a first of all he was well loved by many people you know if this could happen to gym all it can happen to any journalist and pets to my mind not the kind of world and it was one of the women\nOf the many things that struck me about his last column that you published today one is that he thinks the posed for publishing his work not only in English but in Arabic to reach obviously uh Arabic speaking and reading audience I don't want to ask how common practice that is and why you chose to do that in his case\nBecause we feed our mission as I'm presenting a range of opinions\nAcross a wide ideological diverse landscape especially in countries where people can't get it from their own media and Jamal was you know the reason he left Saudi Arabia\nWas she felt she could no longer do it at home and the a lot of people who wanted to express themselves in Saudi Arabia where muzzled or in prison and so he was willing to take some risks to do what they couldn't do\nAnd uh if we can do it in their own language as well as an English all the better\nHe writes in his last column about uh the regime in Saudi Arabia clamping down on on the Internet or do you have any way of tracking how widely read his columns have been either an English or Arabic in his home country in Saudi Arabia\nSo we have certainly seen when we translate our editorial or ... or other pieces\nInto Arabic when you get a big spike in readership from the region [noise] one of the most heartbreaking things about this is that\nHe was a patron he supported a lot of the reforms that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia says he's four but he believed that the best way to accomplish them was to allow people to debate them and uh to express opinions and I'm In the long run that's the way his country was going to succeed\nAnd I think we're trying to contribute in that same vein\nFriend high it he's the editorial page editor of the Washington Post and a colleague of Jamal ... thank you thank you\n[noise]\nFor years there's been a debate about what to do with the aging headquarters of the FBI which happens to sit across the street from President Trump's Washington hotel a newly released batch of emails indicates the president influenced a federal decision to keep the FBI on the same site\nTrump's involvement in the fate of the property is being investigated by Democrats on the house oversight committee who are concerned about possible presidential conflicts of interest NPR's Peter Overby reports\nThis all has to do with the FBI and it's old elaborated headquarters in D.
