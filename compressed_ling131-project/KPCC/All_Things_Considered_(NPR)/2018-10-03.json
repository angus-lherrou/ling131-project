they catchy nickname but the planet maybe most memorable for another discovery it portends NPR's Joe Palca has more\nThere are several things that do make the new object nicknamed the goblet remarkable Scott Sheppard says size is not one of them\nOn the small end of a dwarf planet we don't know exactly how big it is but we think it's about three hundred kilometers in size which was about six or seven times smaller than what poodle is\nShepherd is an astronomer with the Carnegie Institution for science he and his colleagues first spotted the object in twenty Fifteen\nThere's only one thing we know immediately when we find an object and we know its distance from the sun but that's all we can say we can actually say anything about order\nThree more years of measurements have revealed the new objects orbit and it's a doozy first the goblins orbit isn't even close to round like er it's it's a very elongated ellipse next it takes forty thousand years to make a single revolution around the sun\nAnd it never gets closer to the sun than six billion miles about twice as far as Pluto is from the sun\nObjects this far out with really elongated orbits or just weird occurrence models of solar system formation don't predict these objects Juliet Becker is an astronomer at the University of Michigan\nNow it's possible that these models are wrong but Becker says a better explanation may be the giant planet some astronomers thinkers out there\nIn easier solution is the existence of planet nine because it naturally creates these objects in the solar system\nThe gravity of big planet like Jupiter are Neptune Ken sling smaller objects into weird orbits if they happened to wander by\nBut the goblin doesn't get anywhere near Jupiter Neptune so some astronomers think planet nine might be out there doing the swinging Becker says right now only a handful of objects points to the existence of planet nine so there's plenty of skepticism that it really exists\nGuess I have kind of a take her in my mind is how many new objects do we need right now we obviously don't have enough but this particular object is such a unique orbit and it's so useful that

when that paper came out this was your first scientific paper ever right\nThat's right so in the simplest way you can ... can you explain to all of us when his shirt pulse amplification\nUh actually it was done in radar we didn't realize that you know it during World War two so it was quite a few years before we did it the Kennan optics\nBut it is the idea that if you really want to a huge a force on something like an electron electric field you need a the peak power and peak power energy per unit time and at the time of a CPA invention you could have either big energy lasers or you\nCould have short puff lasers but he put a shortfall through this enormously electric field actually destroyed the amplifier so you couldn't have both\nAnd so the idea of church false amplification is if you ... where ... comes from a bird's chair 'cause they changed the frequency time as they came up or down\nAt it really means that all the different colors of the light travel

majority leader Mitch McConnell says the Senate will vote on President Trump's pick for the Supreme Court later this week NPR's Kelsey Snell reports McConnell expects the FBI will soon simply the supplemental background check on nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nAsked about that I'm asked about a Yale classmate named Liz with her\nShe said I'm Brett Kavanaugh um drank more than a lot of people he'd end up slurring his words stumbling is not credible for him to say he had no memory lapses and the nights you drink to excess I Know because I drank with him um how should we assessed that\nGoes on if you if you kept reading and says she actually can't point to any specific instance like that\nUm the quote that jumped out at me was Britain was a sloppy drunk and I know because I drank with him um there's also I don't\nThink I don't I I Do not think that's a fair characterization\nAnd this back and forth for people who are looking for\nBrett Kavanaugh not being fully truthful about his drinking this this back and forth would be where you would find that uh there have been a lot of people who've come forward and said\nThey think that actually was a pretty fair characterization I should add though that the White House has delivered to me statements from a couple of people who have not went to college with including a sweet mate\nWho says that he saw cabinet and not just at the end of the night but also in the morning and said that he did not see behavior that involved blackouts or anything at the level that has been described\nBy others so what do you make of these dueling narratives that we heard represented by President Trump and Senator Schumer haven't listened to the testimony about whether he was truthful or not\nPresident Trump said today that lying to Congress would not be acceptable\nBut President Trump does not believe that Kavanaugh lied to Congress he believes in and talking to people at the White House who are working on Kavanaugh's nomination they believe that in cabinet opening statement that clip that we played earlier where he says\nI drank to access I drank a lot of beer I liked beer and I did things that I look back on and cringe that that although we didn't broad and not specific\nCovers just about everything they say you know he admits to everything except blacking out and when it comes to blacking out that is much more difficult to answer definitively\nIs all of this likely to have an impact on the three or so senators who appear to be on the fence\nIt's hard to know a those three Republican senators say that they are waiting for the FBI investigation to come through they keep getting asked in hallways by reporters whether lying matters to them but\nYou know the definition of lying may be different from Chuck Schumer and Democrats who are predisposed to have concerns about this nomination than it is from Republicans and President Trump and Kavanaugh's backers who say this started with sexual assault and now\nTalking about whether he had through a drink at somebody at a bar in at Yale\nNPR's Tamara Keith thanks a lot of time You're welcome\nThe political firestorm over Brett Kavanaugh has raised lots of questions about how judicial nominees are evaluated like could lead to changes in the process NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson has been posing those sorts of questions to lawyers who've been responsible for vetting judges carried joins us now hey Carey I also\nSo that they will judge has already have to complete a pretty thorough and very long questionnaire is it surprising that the White House didn't touch any of these allegations of sexual misconduct and Brett Kavanaugh's case\nIt's true that judge candidates get asked a bunch of questions known in shorthand as the sex drugs and rock and roll questions things like did you abuse alcohol or drugs did you have a wrap sheet what about\nFinancial improprieties but those questions usually start at age Eighteen and go forward in this allegation by Christine Blasey Ford against Brett Kavanaugh\nHappened when he was Seventeen years old to be clear Kavanaugh has denied any sexual misconduct but\nThere were plenty of hints about his use of alcohol from that high school yearbook injury to his fraternity at Yale which was known for rock is parties his own speeches once he got on the federal appeals court here in Washington DC words like what happened to Georgetown Prep stayed at Georgetown ...\nIn a time in a speech when he reminisced about a baseball outing at Yale where people stumble drunk off the bus in the pre dawn hours\nI mean what could what is happening with Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation lead to changes in the way the FBI conduct background investigations in the future you think\nThe lawyers I've talked to have

it just sounded better as my long that's architect Elizabeth Taylor who first had the idea of turning the high line\nInto a performance space okay so it isn't a mile long is it an opera\nOne thing that I really liked about opera which is really fun is that um there's a story that goes from start to finish composer David like normally what happens is you sit in one space and the singers in the activity change in front of you and that's how your experience moves from start to finish\nThis piece works exactly the opposite in this opera the pieces stationary\nAnd the audience moves through one thousand singers or position all along the high lines mile and a half\nSo it's not a traditional opera in fact it's almost like a living sound installation [noise]\nElizabeth dealers for ... video and

this piece in which these tax or some by community members who are not trained singers the idea is to make something that is simple and understandable and small and very very very easy to understand the tax\nChanges\nElizabeth Taylor points out that some of the tax or just about the mundane aspects of everyday life\nSo there's an intimacy\nBetween you and the singers and you walk by every single one of them and you can stop a little bit and you can lean and then you could hear their voice this thing from a cloud of voices\nIt's interesting you both used words like small and intimate for something that that was people at a mile and a half four\nCats really that's very funny it is very intimate look at the time too early on the cat's right right it is really really big an ambitious but at any moment you're basically with one or two singers at a time\n\nAnd of course you're outdoors which means the entire experience happens within the much larger soundscape of the city around us

loan from his father\nMy father gave me a small amount of a million dollars I came into Manhattan and I had to pay him back and I had to pay him back with interest\nThat identity as a self made success was central to Trump's presidential campaign now a major investigation by the New York times demonstrates the ways in which that story is false\nThe reporter show that Donald Trump received hundreds of millions of dollars from his father over the years starting as a toddler and the story reveal schemes that Trump family used to avoid gift and the state taxes schemes that stretch and possibly break tax laws rescue there was one of the reporters who wrote this story welcome to all things considered Thanks Ari\nHow did Donald Trump require so much wealth from his father over the decades it's\nA complex story we found two hundred and Ninety five unique streams of revenue that Fred Trump's set up over the years to funnel money to his children especially to Donald Trump who was always sort of his favorite child\nI Want to get into a couple of those streams in detail but first just to talk about where the story comes from you write that you had more than a hundred thousand pages of documents as well as interviews what kinds of documents are we talking about here\nBy the time we were all done we had more than two hundred tax returns related both Fred Trump personally and to his various business entities we hide general ledgers bank account statements property records and some court records that were helpful to tie him to pieces together\nOkay sort of dig a little bit more deeply into this reporting you've got about ten blockbuster stories and this one sprawling article and I'd like to tell me about one of them\nYou're right about a company the Trump family created called all county building supply and maintenance and in theory this was a company to purchase and installed refrigerators and other appliances and proper to use it for Trump owns in practice it allowed for Trump to transfer huge amounts of money tax free to his kids how did this work all county\nLooks like a company you know when you hear the name but it actually had no existence in the world other than on paper\nFred Trump had always negotiated personally the prices for the things he bought boilers roofs but in Nineteen Ninety to ... bills for those items began being invoice from a company called all county building supply\nAll county would invoice should get the money and then they would create another in voice to Fred Trump's businesses with a twenty percent thirty percent like\nPat added on to that or a hundred percent in some cases you say and some ... in some cases there were some cases right where they're\nGetting things for free and then building Fred Trump's businesses whenever the cat was would just be split between Fred Trump's for surviving children who are the owners of all round ...\nThat's right and they were performing no work for that the only work was done by an employee Fred Trump's who is also a nephew of his and not employees secretary who handled these billing things are among her other tasks\nFor Trump give gifts to all of his children but Donald you write more than any of the others you describe him bailing out Donald Trump time after time there's an instance where he bought three and a half million dollars in poker chips to rescue in Atlantic City casino\nBut there was one time the father pushed back against his son Donald us Fred Trump was beginning to suffer from dementia Donald Trump tried to change his father's well\nWhat happened that was right in Nineteen Ninety at Donald Trump's darkest financial moment he was facing being forced into bankruptcy by his creditors\nAnd he had some lawyers right up a ... a change to his father's will that would give him much more control over all those assets\nHe didn't tell his father or his siblings who was doing this you just had the lawyers show up at his father's house I believe it was and put the piece of paper in front of him\nHis father's so many of the room realized right away this is not where we want to go with this and he pushed back and ultimately called Donald Trump sister who was then a federal judge a lawyer obviously and ask her to intervene and to make sure that\nDonald's creditors couldn't come in and pillage Fred Trump's empire and the Donald we wouldn't have any more control or input over the state than any of those other siblings would\nThe White House has responded to your reporting by attacking the New York times and saying that the IRS looked at these arrangements as they were happening and found nothing improper how do you respond to that\nWell we think that's not true um we know there are cases where there was no audit
