Bush\nBut he was known for spontaneous moments like right after nine eleven there was this moment where he was standing on the rebel at ground zero the twin towers were still smoldering in the background\nA bull one with the president was there to tour the ruins and looking around with that sense that we all have\nHelplessness someone shouts out\n[noise] we can't hear you\nSuddenly heard that\nPart of what made Bush's spontaneous remarks such a hit and so much history was because he addressed this issue of retribution revenge revenge was with the country\nWas thirsty for but sometimes and more often a president's address at a moment like this is also responsive to what people are feeling but he's calling\nFor forgiveness I'm thinking about President Obama it was shortly after the shooting at Emanuel AME church in Charleston in twenty Fifteen he breaks into song during the University of one of the [noise]\n\nUh\nHe was so moved out literally first song in that fashion and of course counting on the\n\n\nEastern moments that really draw out the distinct different kinds of leadership skills in Egypt he's president\nAt times of national tragedy the nation is in the habit of looking for someone to play the role of sympathetic parent if you will someone to provide reassurance empathy uplift we want someone to organize our grief for us rally our spirits and begin the process of healing\nLet's talk now about how President Trump has tried to sell this role\nAfter some of the hurricanes that we've had during his presidency President Trump has gone to the site in Texas and Florida Puerto Rico and has tried to represent the country and the country's\nEmbrace of these victims at times has worked at other times it's been quite awkward particularly in Puerto Rico and then there was the quickie news conference that he had after the Charlottesville disturbance in twenty Seventeen equating or some people felt he was drawn up on to quibble it's between some of the people who came to\nTo rally as white supremacist as white nationalist his Nazis and the people who came to protest that route\nI think the blame on both sides and I have no doubt about it you don't have any doubt about it either\nDo you think this way that Trump reacts in times of tragedy do think that that's a decision he is deliberately making about how to react or is he just someone use uncomfortable playing the role of the empathetic controller\nIn fairness of public shows of empathy or not President Trump's strong suit he he did not promise that sort of a presidency when he ran\nLet's face it he has a great talent for bonding with rally audience is and it's just less comfortable for him to acknowledge the sour full details of a tragedy such as Pittsburgh and far less comfortable for him to you to critics who urging toward introspection but should presidents be\nJudged if they're not good at consoling the country in times of tragedy\nNo president should be judged solely on that one particular part of his role that he has least control of book there are going to be those people who are going to feel that the president should be able to provide something at a moment such as this that goes beyond a political observation\nAnd address the nation's needs and hunger at the level of the soul\nThat NPR senior editor and correspondent Ron Elving thank you so much

and we're going to take a look at the money that has been pouring into these races\nBillions of dollars have been spent on advertising and most of that money is going to democratic candidates\nThe center for Responsive Politics a nonprofit that tracks campaign money projects that a total of\nFive point two billion dollars will be spent during this entire election cycle the group's executive director Sheila Krumholz joins us now to talk about how all that money is being spent welcome thank you glad to be here okay so fine point two billion how some compare\nTo previous mid term elections spending\nThis is way up from the two thousand fourteen mid term elections so five point to this cycle versus just three point eight billion in two thousand fourteen that's at thirty five percent jump and a record\nAnd how is this money getting spent TV radio Internet social media like where would you see most of the money going right now\nTV is still tops in the most competitive races and overall kind of pulling back we see that a almost a billion dollars has been spent already this cycle on media\nWay uh uh from two thousand fourteen at this point in the cycle so a media advertising on TV for the competitive races a digital advertising across the board for all races yeah especially on Facebook\nYeah here it's through the roof this year Facebook spending a yes why is that you think\nWell it was certainly successful in the two thousand sixteen uh election cycle for a lot of actors are so far I think as of today face because now to two hundred and Ninety six million dollars\nAnd uh as in terms of FCC report it digital ad spending a it's one hundred and five million a with a almost ten million of that going to the presidential race so that that race has already taken off\nAnd actually said the vast bulk of all the spending is by Democrats right right you know I'm curious when you see one side vastly outspending the other side is that a sign that that side has a good shot at winning or is it more of a sign of some insecurities and lack of confidence\nI think both come into play on the one hand the Democrats are thrilled to see big numbers are in their columnist cycle and that is an asset they these candidates need money to get their message out\nOn both sides so uh that's a positive sign for the Democrats on the other hand to the degree that this money is coming from voters in other states\nThat is not so helpful and election day so there is a lot can backfire it can it can be viewed as outside meddling a by voters in other states that have nothing to do with the interests of the district or the state\nThat represents people who may be energized about a candidate but are unable to help them on election day when it really counts\nSo that's one way a lot of money can backfire are there other ways for instance could spending a lot of money on ads actually annoy voters because I talked to a lot of voters who hate getting bombarded by ads could that ... de Presse voter turnout\nCertainly some of the advertising is designed to suppress voter turnout they are in opposition to a candidate as opposed to a supporting a candidate so those are going to be a especially tiresome for the voters\nSo more money does not necessarily mean more votes\nMoney does not necessarily mean more votes on election day the candidates who has spent the most typically wins however will see this ... this year whether a the Democratic a fundraising advantage will help\nTo drive down the reelection rate which has been impervious to change especially in the house races Sheila Krumholz\nIs the executive director at the center for Responsive Politics thanks very much my pleasure thank you\nThe U.S has had three alarming incidents in a matter of days the shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh another at a supermarket in Louisville, Kentucky and the bomb scare suspicious packages mail to prominent Democrats these raise the question are we entering a period of increased political violence in the country NPR's Tim Mak has our story\nLast year after a shooter opened fire on Republican lawmakers at a baseball practice outside Washington a CBS News poll found that Seventy three percent of Americans felt the tone of the political debate encourages violence\nCarolyn Lukens fire is the head of the national Institute for civil discourse formed after a nun other shooting injured congresswoman Gabby Giffords in twenty eleven the incident killed six and wounded Thirteen\nI have to say to him I've been surprised\nAt the number of times where we're in we're holding a discussion were holding a conversation across differences and some of them will actually say\nThat they believe we could come to a civil war again in the United states but then she said many people back off from their initial conclusions they do say no I don't I don't really believe that will have a civil war but I find some of what I see happening\nFrightening enough to think of it that way\nModern civil conflicts don't have to involve marching armies are Pickett's Charge conflict emerge when episodes of political violence become more sustained so could have happened in our era here's ... again\nSo at least in part because of Johnson's daddy issues California voters got a ton of power state has one of the most extreme inflexible direct democracy system in the world\nOnce an initiative passes legislature can't touch it needs to make simple logical improvements any change has to go back through the initiative process for a vote by the people in fact three of the initiatives on this year's ballot are revisions or reactions to previously past ones\nWhich leaves many voters like cloud back is thoroughly confused\nAnd there are many unintended consequences and
