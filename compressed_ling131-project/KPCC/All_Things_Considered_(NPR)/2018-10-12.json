on to this Congress\nAnd really the only measure to support but we we um we're able to move on so many different trunks are in fact if you're an American who prefers the country right of center option before and I would say you have to do this has been the best Congress and the time I've been on the son of\nA college at your party had a significant gender Kathy cussing you've talked about quite a bit in the past couple of days and they're also behind with minorities in some other great what do you mean for the long term viability of the year ... if the party increasing the appeals mostly to like that\nWell you know we've done pretty well with Hispanics and the uh\nAnd uh even the car for about the voters and a lot of people thought I think it's also important\nTo remember the President Trump or non out of town Republican votes and twenty six day not that every one of those nine or ten ... voted for him was thrilled with every aspect of what he was a\nA I think we're on a pretty good position I'm going to lose a midterm elections I'm I'm pretty optimistic will be able to hold our majority\nThere was a talk at one point in time about no dissecting where these officer happening for Republicans particularly in the Hispanic community is it time for that to happen again\nWell I don't think there's any question that we would like to be doing better than we are with a Hispanic Americans although some of the most prominent Hispanic politicians in America are having to be Republican with regard to women voters would always had\nSomething of a drug or it's never been as wide

for for sure [noise]\nWith African Americans we haven't been able to make much although I think it is noteworthy that a temp Scott there was a member of our conference and who should arguably the most popular politician in South Carolina so\nThere is hope with African American voters as well but I'm a more optimistic about closing the gender gap and by improving our position with his father and\nYou're looking ahead we talk and just like three and a half weeks away from this election how many Republicans will be in the Senate next year you know I'm not gonna [laughter] I'll\nSay out of their production goes\nSometimes to know the answers are telling that was Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell speaking with our Kelsey Snell on Capitol Hill today and Kelsey was there anything else he just wouldn't answer\nWell yeah I think it's important to note that this is a little longer interview that we kind of ... it down for time and they talked about a lot\nAnd one of the things that really struck me is that he was criticizing President Trump Adam ... in most species particularly on the economy and on President Trump's comments from last night that the fed is crazy for raising interest rates McConnell just wouldn't go there\nAnd in that section about health care when we heard him say it was a major failures gave you say it sounds like he wants to repeat and that's not what a lot of conservatives want to hear they wanted to hear that and Republicans are going to go back\nIf they still have control and try again to repeal the Affordable CARE Act\nAnd on that same issue we got into an extended conversation about Republicans and protections for people with pre existing condition uncommon\nTo Senate candidates are involved in lawsuits to weaken those protections and he told me that Republicans are campaigning on keeping those protections and gave a contradictory response about how they can support those seats but still want protections in place [noise] one\nThing that looked out at me listening they're back to your health care point he described as a failure to pass health care overhaul is the only major disappointment and I was thinking I I can think of others but what about comprehensive immigration reform they wanted to get that done it's not that\nThat really wasn't on his list and you know I haven't been on the list for a lot of Republicans that I've talked to who they were kind of immigration many of them said that they still hold out hope that immigration could be part of a broader conversation later in the year potentially around spending [noise] I'm\nSpeaking of spending and speaking of immigration did you ask about the border wall which people are talking about again funding for Trump's border wall with Mexico\nYeah I asked him if he thought there was going to be a shutdown fight in December over\nThe border wall with Mexico he says he wants to try to get funding for the wall but he's talking about a lot less money than House Republicans\nHe said about you know money for about one year roughly the amount that they've been spending on border security altogether and now that the down payment or major investment that some in the house are talking about and that sets up the possibility of any immigration conversation other big spending fight\nOther thing that you that you raise the same way as women and where women are left coast Kevin a confirmation battle um he acknowledge that there's always been something of a gender gap in terms of voters for for Republicans and acknowledge that is going to be a challenge\nYeah

we have the right Debbie hey their pride I'm here to tell us what is it like there now\nWell it's utter destruction and you know I've covered a lot of hurricanes and that is probably one of a you know the ones I have\nWhat they are in the top ranked in terms of just every where you look\nThere is something wrong nothing is right um you know people here talk a little bit about losing their bearings in some places because things are gone trees are snapped into their down everywhere they're on top and through all kinds of structures\nThat huge metal light post or just twisted like they're a crumpled paper straw ribs have been ripped from buildings windows have been blown out and when you try to go down any street um they're covered by felt trees or power poles\nThey're also all kinds of

about rescue efforts how are they going so far well\nUh it's been difficult to get to people but there were underway I'm right now people that the the the those front lift things I'm the word I'm

the the that things are back\nOut of the way for them to get to where they can put the power lines back up so right now it's just a matter of trying to get everything out of the way so that that the

think right now people are just trying to figure out what's next for them um I went to this apartment complex and Lynn haven which is just north of Panama City um and it's a mess you know you can see

information online new research is showing just how easy it is for law enforcement to use this data to zero in just who may have committed a crime NPR health correspondent Rob Stein has the

finally been captured California investigators and jet match dot com to named Joseph James Dean Angelo as a setback genealogy website to try to identify the ... state killer\nAnd that was just the beginning police around the country of started doing the same sort of thing to solve other cold cases so young ... early kept the company my heritage wondered just how easy is it to use databases like his to find people\nWe wanted to quantify how powerful as these techniques to identify individuals\nSo Ehrlich and his colleagues analyzed the DNA for more than one point two million people in this company's database and discovered something startling for more than sixty percent of people of European descent they could identify or relative as distant as a third cousin most of the people's

as to actually identify you the same way that a GPS system\nUses multiple satellites to find a location\nAnd when the researchers combined their data with other information like we're person probably

your your mom so\nClearly you know you have Harvey Milk here stake in this line and the sad but if you really want to get to where the energy for the gay rights movement and coming out came from you could track at all the way back to where the root for the civil rights movement and gay rights movement and women's rights movement came from which was\nPost World war two activism started by black soldiers\nOkay so you're taking us all the way back down to the Nineteen forties\nHarvey Milk was this huge inspiration in the seventies then coming out day gets foreign allies in the eighties but just thinking of eating I mean this is it gets formalized in this decade that was that was turbulent and scary and and really heartbreaking for much of the gay community\nYeah in many ways it was awful for the gay community and this was in the throes of the AIDS crisis you had this groundswell of activism from the algae beach community over the issue while the government was very silent\nOr in the same decade in eighty six you had the Supreme Court uphold a state law from Georgia again sodomy which allowed gay sex to be treated as a family and so the thinking was if coming out day was the thing that happened and it proved that people had gay and lesbian folks in their lives everywhere and you know them\nSome of the way the law treated them or ignored them would have to change\nIt feels like a lot has changed I mean let me ask you is coming out this same kind of moment now to marketing it coming out day feel as necessary\nYeah I think the answer depends on who you ask but for me it feels very very different in large part\nBecause the language that we have around sexuality and gender is constantly evolving you know a thing that we talk about in the episode is how the increased prominence of queer identity of trans identity of people declaring themselves and their sexuality in these ways that are new to many people\nThat almost doesn't fit what you could call the old model of coming out and there's also you know this phenomena we go we go from Ellen coming out some Twenty years ago I went to artist exactly to artist like Frank Ocean\nWho came out but didn't use the word gay or Janelle Monet who didn't come out as gay or lesbian or by she came out as pan sexual\nIt's just a different language and a different rubric almost so of course that just changes were coming out is\nDid you walk away from that forming an opinion about\nYourself [noise] um I think it helped me in my own coming out story to stop being angry about how long it took or feeling guilty about my path in my process\nAnd just a little bit more proud of who I Am and there's I don't know there was just feeling throughout the entire episode where the listeners we talked to coming out is not just declaring yourself to the world\nIt is declaring herself to every earlier version of yourself and tell him that person their culture\nThat's NPR's Sam Sanders you can check out his whole episode on

actually get anything done yes it does\nAnd\nIn order to actually get something done we're gonna have to have people like our clients and the Senator Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham and Lamar Alexander and John Kennedy who will\nReach across the aisle and form bipartisan coalitions these are all kinds of ours was our clients had done repeatedly and will continue to do\nYou mentioned Lindsey Graham is one of your clients yes he had quite the term and the Kavanaugh hearing where he came out about his angry as I've ever seen him know me too yeah how do we square that with the politics of getting

years in twenty sixteen murders jumped to the highest rate in two decades something Trump talked about a lot during his campaign since then the murder rate there has fallen some but gun crime remains a stubborn problem and this week the president said he wants to help\nWelcome back to the frame I'm John horn will return down to my conversation with to advocate for people with disabilities in Hollywood writer producer Deborah ... an actor Denny would burn the real abilities film festival which highlights work by disabled performers is in LA this weekend\nWould burn who's the little person has had a long career in film and TV several people in our office recognized him from his work on Seinfeld he played aspiring actor Mickey Abbott and this scene Mickey and Kramer talk with Jerry and George about Kramer's new job\n[laughter] yeah make it he looked me up where stand in for the actors and all my children Mickey he's a stand in for an eight year old kid and I stand in for the\nKid's father but I'm going to say from the standing for Heathrow [noise] he was for the last month now it's like two and a half to shut up two and a half inches I can do for two or three distress [noise]\nI'm going to be doing that there are legal crash\nI told you you should offer him some cigarettes [noise]\nAround what his mother's always hanging around\nSo I have a couple of questions about that first of all did you feel that that was a good representation of a person who wasn't defined by his disability\nI Do I Do um you know as the clip goes on Jason Alexander's character George refers to my character as a midget\nWhich you know has been a derogatory term for like forty plus years as far as people in the little people community are concerned\nAnd so because Seinfeld was never a show like there was ever like a very special episode of Seinfeld and they will say that we had to work out a way in which I address that without making it preachy without making it\nYou know some other kind of show so what happened was it sparked sort of a violent rage and make\nA little people you got that [noise]\n\nKramer says easy Mickey easy and that that because of that little conversation that I had with a Jerry and Larry that you know I didn't want to just let that were to go because of that conversation the character itself\nWas sort of born like the violent nature of Mickey was born out of that conversation so when we open the door to have conversations about disability other things come from that\nOne of the things that I think this and other parts touch on is this idea that the character should not be defined by how he or she looks\nThat the script could call for somebody who played the president and it could be a woman the script could call for somebody to be the head of a fortune five hundred company and it could be an African American and yet I think\nSo often people with disabilities don't get to play people who are not defined by their disability is that part of the problem\nI think I I I've been lucky enough to make a headway in my own career with regard to that but I think that is part of the problem the idea that\nThe next door neighbor or the pizza delivery guy might be a visually impaired or death for a double amputee pizza delivery guy\nYou know these kinds of things just don't get seen in television and I think it has to do with who's writing shows so uh for example Glen Missouri he runs a I'm sure when I was a sort of class and he uh he brought me in a great fully to have a discussion\nWith his students regarding depictions of disability but he also\nSaid you know you have to welcome conversations with women in the in the room and you have to welcome conversations with people of color into the room and if they're not there there's got to be represented somehow so as a result of that the WG a I Know was pushing an initiative to create a tax instead of all I think in the state of New York\nTo any production company that work with the writers of color or women would get some kind of tax initiative\nBut my complaint to that was we were not addressing writers or disability and a lot of times the the the back talk to that the argument to that is well if the person who is disabled happens to be a woman who happens to be a person of color than it's fine\nBut that's not really how the marginalized aspects of disability works it's not specific to that\nAnd Deborah I think this is a very important point and that is that it's not just about what we see in front of the camera is about who is making the creative decisions behind the camera that if that group of people using diverse than the stories that they are going to tell naturally I think by default isn't going to be that the verses were\nAbsolutely because it because I Am involved in the community of people with disabilities every piece of of every project that I got involved with I make sure that there is a character with disabilities\nAnd that's because I Am thinking about it so ... what we deal with constantly is unconscious by us so what Danny said about the land\nIs really important because it all starts with the writing and climbers are is a show runner\nAnd together with Shonda Rhimes and maybe five or six other folks there is a a committee at the Writers Guild\nThat is going to the studios that is talking to other show runners and saying hey when you create stories when you pop your late your writer's room you must populate you should populate\nWith people that are different than yourself not because it is the kind of thing to do but is the best thing to do because\nWe bring in stories that are particular to our human experience\nWhat I've seen happening in in the last few years to some of the studios are are opening their doors more and more to this conversation for example NBC Universal is\nSponsoring us a further we'll do this film festival as well as CBS a diversity inclusion so this is a this is sort of a great\nTransformation that idea what's happening right now ah and I'm excited by the idea that this continues and that that we don't just keep creating initiatives of diversity that are exclusive of people with disabilities\nDanny I'm Debra thanks so much for coming on cue thanks [noise]\nThe real ability film festival continued through Sunday you can find more at real

tech world are supposed to be gathering in a couple of weeks in Riyadh for a huge investment summit Davos of the desert as it's been dubbed the hope was it would attract much needed foreign investment to the kingdom\nBut the RSVP list is suddenly shrinking among those pulling out the head of the world bank the c._e._o. of Viacom the editor in chief of the economist British entrepreneur Richard Branson\nNPR foreign affairs correspondent Jackie Northam has been keeping track of this ever shifting guess blessed and she's here now hey Jackie Hi matter so is this all down to concerns about democracy and what's happening there where people pulling up\nWell part of me is the fact that turkey is blaming the death of the show gate on Saudi Arabia so it doesn't seem like a good idea for a lot of these participants to show up in Riyadh talking business or for a photo opportunity with the crown prince Mohammed bin some on\nUm some like tech venture capitalists Steve Case said they'd been looking forward to attending the event\nBut they want to find out what happened to show the first and until then they're going to put their plans on hold\nMany media organizations such as the Financial Times and New York times CNBC and Bloomberg among others which I just mentioned earlier on I'm going out there all pulling out as well in a number of the reporters and editors were due to be on panels despite this uh the Saudi said at the conference will go ahead\nFrom Saudi Arabia is perspective how were you is this I mean how big a deal is this conference to Saudi Arabia and its economic plans\nOh hugely important to Saudi Arabia foreign investment in the kingdom has been falling quite dramatically over the past year and there's also been a major flight of capital so sad either\nPulling their money out and putting it in real estate or offshore banks or or shell companies so this conference was seen as a way to renew interest in doing business in Saudi Arabia and organizers were probably hoping for a replay of last year as conference which really generated a lot of excitement about doing business in the kingdom\nBut just two weeks after that conference the crown prince rounded up more than two hundred Saudi businessmen and government ministers are the ones where they were all\nIn in under house arrest and the Ritz Carlton and\nRaul under house arrest with almost three months and the Ritz Carlton which by the way is where this conference is taking place again this year\n[noise] uh and I know you have recently visited that hotel you've just been reporting for NPR in Saudi Arabia I mean to what extent does the kingdom remain an attractive investment opportunity for the rest of the world\nIs it still remains an attractive place to do business for sure and there are still keep business leaders that are going to attend this conference\nBecause of those opportunities the head of the major Wall Street banks um such as J. P.

lot at stake here I'm also by the way a treasury secretary Steven ... is also expected to attend\nHuh All right so for now at least the Trump Administration will be there are several Wall Street will be there of what Congress where what are they saying about the situation\nWell there are caused by a number of members of Congress for suspending our ending arms deals to Saudi Arabia\nUm and this is something that President Trump has really been pushing back on he says\nThat ah these arms sales produce jobs for Americans many jobs for Americans he announced about a year and a half ago that there were a hundred and ten billion dollars in New arms sales to Saudi Arabia although many analysts feel that those numbers were inflated but still it does represent jobs for American\nAnother facet of the fallout over the ... cars shaggy situation NPR's Jackie Northam thanks so much things\nMatter with President Trump has stepped up his attacks on the Federal Reserve this week after stock prices plunged Trump ripped into the fed for raising interest rates which it's been doing for the last few years\nI think that it's gone crazy I think the fed is out of control I think what they're doing is wrong\nAll right for some perspective on this we're joined by someone who worked at the fed for forty years until twenty ten ... was vice chairman of the Fed's board of governors thank you so much for coming in today\nThank you for having me here also so how usual is it for a president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like this\nIt's been very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush the president and its ministry should an often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's\nA monetary policy but maybe didn't call the fed crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve on for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known private lead to the chair and other members other decision makers but not with this public pressure\nOkay so up until now fed officials had been defending the fed from the president's attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fad Charlie Evans he was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hikes so does Evans have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question these rate I\nThe great variety or variety that it's made from and the vintage you're blindfolded to entice you can't even see it right

G. yeah [laughter]\nOh alright explain how come okay\nSo frankly LA's just bad for everyone on the roads maybe there are some Angelenos out there who said things like the roads are will maintain their room enough for everyone other drivers are polite\nBut I don't think so and if you think the roads are rough for cars it his way worse for bikes how bad can it actually be so bike infrastructure is a big problem both from the lack of people hating them being installed\nAnd eventual compromise of what's fair so here's my own opinion about a new one it's downtown springs street that's my own neighborhood I bike at all the time\nThe city plans to re can figure it so that bikes wouldn't conflict with traffic and buses as much\nThat just finished last month and it solve some of those problems but I actually think it introduced new ones some new problems like what\nSo springs street is a one way street the bike lanes shifted from the right side to the left side of the street now just imagine you're going down springs from left to right it's curb bike lane road of parked cars that's supposed to insulate bike from traffic lane itself now\nFor this first phase of the remodel the bike lane is ask actually as wide as Carlin and because it's that wide well here's what happened when I recorded myself earlier this week\nAnd here comes another car that just arriving directly into the bike lane what is this\nWhat are you doing [noise]\nKnees and I haven't been seeing cars end up ... every day since the street was redone it doesn't help that cars can automatically feed that it's a bike lane if not green for example and\nThat's actually a result of a deal between the city and Hollywood who said Greenland mess with filming so there's actually a limit on which ones get painted\nHi Leo once you get outside of downtown Los Angeles do things get any better for people who are riding bikes\nWell I haven't traveled every mile but there are two things I think the city lax first signage the other better roads and let me give people a sense of what that's like for bicyclists\nI talked to my to my wire by fast you can hear every time the road is not good it could hear the thing [noise]\nYes I mean it's like mountain biking sometimes it is not fun it's exhausting\nAnd it's actually very serious last year the city of LA paid out more than Nineteen million dollars to cyclists and their families because of injury and death on local street Nineteen million dollars is a lot of money\nAll right tell me something good is there anything good about riding a bike on the streets and it's actually kinda tough because I don't want to pull punches newbie cyclists out there it is rough\nBut if it is your first time I Do think there are some areas in the LA area that are better than others parts of Santa Monica in Long Beach personally I think I'd better resources but you can also tweet me with your own experience maybe have a better time than I Do maybe they're a butter areas just we meet at Leo has a cat so that's ... has a cat thinks well like you\nSay PCC reporter and take to producer Leo Duran breaking down why LA streets are so bad for bicyclists Eli Manning Arab guy said he is also a bicyclist K PCC tracked him down this afternoon to ask how he plans to make LA's biking experience better and safer\nI Want to see more protected by half not just laying the get painted that's one of the reasons we put in for instance though a river by fast which I think will be the most ambitious and biggest bike way that we've seen an urban area in America in our history and I was putting measure him we're going to keep moving on that one\nThat's selling their Eric Garcetti says Los Angeles is also working with\nElectric scooter companies doing business in the city there feeds might be used to offset the cost to build improved bike paths or live with local were rallies NPR leader eighty nine point three K PCC coming up next on all things considered FEMA is busy", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "12"}
