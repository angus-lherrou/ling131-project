is all\nThings considered I Know for Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro and just the past week we've seen three high profile cases of domestic extremism\nToo are deadly shootings one at the synagogue in Pittsburgh the other at a grocery store in Louisville, Kentucky\nThe third was the explosive sent through the mail a prominent Democrats all three of the suspects now in custody are men born here in the U.S NPR's Greg Myre he joins us now to talk about the common threads between these incidents I grab hey are we hear so much about international terrorism and efforts to stop people from other countries these incidents are all homegrown how common is that\nA absolutely you know nine eleven really concentrated the mind on radical Islam from abroad but the numbers since then tell a very different story\nDeadly attacks by the far right white supremacist outnumber those by Muslim extremist by a ratio of three to one about Seventy attacks versus twenty three\nThe ... the death toll passed Seventeen years about the same about a hundred and twenty five on on on both sides here the far right tends to target a small minorities in smaller numbers than him indiscriminate attacks are that many of the radical Muslims have carried out\nAnd when you look at the three people who are accused of these attacks in the last week they all look similar to each other a men born in the u._s. should we read something into that as if the new face of extreme is\nA it's sort of been the face of extremism these are American men acting on their own and they account form a solid majority of extremist attacks\nReally started picking up about a decade ago the man accused in Pittsburgh made anti Semitic remarks on social media\nThe Louisville suspect had a reputation for racist comments and the mail bomb suspect in Florida\nAre always told worker co workers that he admired Hitler and thoughts of gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated I spoke to Bill Braniff the director of the

seen so much in the way of government efforts to fight Islamic extremism is they're the same effort to stop this kind of domestic far right extremism\nProbably not the same level or Christopher Wray the FBI Director was before Congress or just a couple of weeks ago he ... he said Islamic extremism he still sees that as the greatest threat\nBut then he noted very quickly there are a thousand active investigations inside the U.S and he said this covers everything from right to left and everything in between he didn't break it down further than that but he specifically said this was not Islamic extremists he was talking about here\nI'm In the challenge of course is how do you find people there are is the social media trail but there are so many American men expressing the thoughts these days it's hard to tell a who will act in who's just ranting\nWe're going to hear more in a moment about one social media site that's become a platform for these ... but first the FBI is describing the scope of the problem what is it and the Trump Administration more broadly doing about it\nThe Trump Administration hasn't shown a lot of interest the Obama administration created a program countering ...\nAnd one extremism given grants to local groups to prevent radicalization the Trump Administration has cut that way back then has really focused on far right threats despite the

white supremacy are saying the only way to get the job done is to do violent acts in public as a way to get media attention\nCan you describe how gab became a home in the first place for white supremacist views\nYes in the lead up to the election of twenty sixteen ...\nThe CEO of gab was looking for users for his platform and he saw that in the burgeoning maggot coalition\nThat there was a question of free speech on line and who's content was going to be able to stay on line and so he actively started recruiting people that were part of alternative media networks\nAfter the election and
