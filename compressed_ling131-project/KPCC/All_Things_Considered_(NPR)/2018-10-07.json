where a trial on a high profile police shootings and with an historic verdict weight is you're\nGuilty of murder plus\nAmazon is about to raise its hourly wage for hundreds of thousands of workers but some worry it's not a great deal after all\nWe're worried about not getting or pay out and making less will try to do the math but first this news\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Janine hurts President Trump is campaigning for Republican candidates in Topeka, Kansas tonight where he praised the Senate vote today that made Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court justice and Trump told a cheering crowd they need to remember the bitter bipartisan fight at the mid term elections have you on\nLater we're going to hear from one of Christine Blasey Ford's attorneys about what this episode has meant to her professor Ford of course being a woman who testified that judge Kavanaugh assaulted her years ago but we're also going to try to examine some of the divisions that this whole process has laid bare including in the legal community\nAnd a remarkable development retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens said publicly that cabinet is not ... for the high court\nEarlier this week more than twenty four hundred law professors or to send it in a letter not to confirm judge Kavanaugh needless to say other support and defend him UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh is one of them\nHe refused to sign a letter or he mentioned that he clerked with judge Kavanaugh previously and socialized occasionally with him and he is with us now by a sky professor Volokh thank you so much for joining us very much my pleasure thanks for having first of all I just\nWanted to ask how you reacted when you saw the letter I understand that a law professor were circulating this letter I just wondered what your reaction was well\nI sort of imagine how would I have acted if I were publicly accused on national international television of extraordinarily serious crimes and if I was innocent and\nThe letter was was based on the assumption that to a judge Kavanaugh's reaction was bad whether or not he was in I Can't imagine that I Would completely keep my cool\nUh I don't think most people with maybe a few good but I think a lot of people would be extraordinarily angry\nOr that would feel kind of publicly humiliated and a ... even somebody with a reputation for ... and judicious in us as judge Kavanaugh has developed a in his uh many years now and the DC circuit and could easily slip I think that's just human nature\n[noise] one of the reasons that we called you is that you wrote a blog post that caught our attention and you mentioned that you clerked uh at the same time as judge Kavanaugh and that you socialize occasionally with him do you think that you're the fact that you know him\nPlay some role and how you respond to this\nYou know I expected probably does in some measure uh we're not terribly close we just I don't think we've seen each other for for for quite a while and we didn't see each other that often or even back then socially uh but uh my influenced by that sure I'm a human being like usually when being like all of us are\nAnd and as you know other human beings are many of them women are reacting very differently to this they are bringing forward experiences that they have had where they have been assaulted I'm\nPhysically in some cases threatened with assault and their reactions to it are also very important then one of the reasons we can't use that we're interested in as I said earlier kind of the fallout from this and the kinds of divisions that have been laid bare in this do you think\nThat people's personal reactions are guiding that response to this or do you think it's something else even among your colleagues\nI'm quite sure that personal reactions are guiding lots of people on this just because that is human nature I Can't speak any particular person\nIt's an surprising that this would be so I don't I don't think it should be condemned but again if you're asking\nSomebody to maintain complete composure\nUm and I think you're expecting something that is too much to expect of of normal people occasionally again you could have someone who does keep his cool under such extraordinary circumstances but I think that's the exception rather than the rule and I think if you're asking about judicial temperament a much better guide for judicial temperament is how\nA judge Kavanaugh behaved in about ten years more than ten years on the DC circuit bench and everybody seems to say that his temperament as but excellent\nThere okay except professor you know the defendants are accused of terrible things all the time but they may or may not have done and they are not allowed to behave in this way I mean a criminal defendant who presented himself in court or herself\nWho was accused of something terrible that he or she did not do would not be allowed to scream at people would not be allowed to be patronize singing condescending toward the judge or toward other parties\nOr if I were a member of a jury and somebody was on the stand accused of effects could be anything else I and I saw him reacting in anger when questioned by the prosecutor and interrupting say the prosecutor\nI I'd like to think I wouldn't hold that against him of course I'd look at the evidence I'd want to know if he's guilty uh but uh\nUh I Would say if you behave angrily that anger is not inconsistent with innocence and it's not a fine of bad character is a sign of someone who is reacting to very very serious accusation\nAnd let me go back to the question of the legal community um it I I Do you agree that this is a an episode on and what else to call it I don't mean to minimize it by calling it that a a a moment that has risen\nYour a profession one of the things she noted in your blog post is that a lot of people disagree with you people who've respect they disagree you disagree with other people whom you respect and that you've had a lively dialogue about it has this been a notable moment for your profession and why do you think that is\nWell a yes of course it's notable this is something that's very high profile\nAbout a very unfortunate matter a people sharply disagree on this of course the legal academy is overwhelmingly liberal\nAnd uh and as you pointed out a war one is coming from colors ones perception and are just as conservatives are predisposed to respond one way to such things liberals and other way so it's an surprising that there would be a lot of\nHeat coming from kind of a hard one political reactions but also or just even people who are not particularly partisan I feel very strongly about this because it's in the news or\nA and because it is about somebody who will be a very important to\nA bigger in legal life for decades to come\nThat is Eugene Volokh he is the guarantee switched\nIt's so striking the tone if you went back if you look back over thirty or forty years of diplomacy Americans were actually quite careful not to be directly confrontational this is very very confrontational very aggressive in almost has a feel to me\nOf a Reagan evil empire speech what it's signaling is he sees China as the greatest threat to the United states\nAnd in terms of the why now later in the speech he talked about the vice President Pence talked about trying to trying to influence the mid term elections so we didn't provide any solid evidence and that could be a pretext to blaming a bad results for Republicans on China but there's a much bigger picture here that we should be talking about\nI hold that thought from it but I Want to ask you have you seen a shift in how the Trump Administration has been dealing with China what\nI see with the Trump Administration\nIs it coincides with a sea change in attitude\nAmong scholars in the United states American businesses in the old days of going back to the nineties do thousands American business extremely supportive of the Communist Party they're making a lot of money there they now feel that the playing field is not level at all they do feel sometimes held up to give up intellectual property\nSo there's been a big shift here in attitude towards China and I really think actually Beijing is just catching up to it\nSo you're saying that the sea change is not just this administration's attitude that goes beyond that in fact there was a clip from vice president Pence a speech where he spoke to that let's plant\nThe Chinese Communist party is rewarding or for worse thing American businesses movie studios universities think tanks scholars journalists and local state and federal officials\nIs that true not just one example absolutely a and somebody to sell censorship I'll give you an example with in movies\nThere are a lot of movies that you might have made in the nineties early two thousand that might have been critical of China you couldn't get the financing for them now because the Chinese audience has grown so much for a movie it's so important to the bottom line of a global\nFilm a great example would be a remake of a movie called red dawn in which\nThe Chinese soldiers were to invade America in post production they had to change the Chinese soldiers in North Korean soldiers 'cause there's no way the Chinese ever would have ever let that movie into China\nWhat about academics scholars absolutely in his mouth and journalists to it is it's much harder now are getting visas can be more difficult they use them as a way to punish scholars you write about subjects\nThat they don't like about like ... far western\nArea in China as well as Tibet and Taiwan and so there are certainly a feeling that some scholars do self censor in order to get visas others are very brave and and are willing to not be able to get visas to go in\nSo one more question for us as you know it's very focused on Russian influence in elections and a Russian efforts to interfere with us all elections when it comes to undermining confidence in democracy particularly let's say in the United states which country is the bigger concern Russia or China\nOr I think Russia has been very overt about it I think China what's concerning about China is that it's much more of a challenge it also would like do undermine\nThe message of the United states which is freedom and democracy the difference being that Russia does not have a business plan it's a relatively small compared to China in terms of economy China's an enormous economy getting very close to surpassing ours in the future\nAnd they're also a much more sophisticated and will run country and so I think it's a much much greater challenge but these days because of what happened in the south than than sixteen election this is what we focus on which is Russia\nThat NPR's London correspondent Frank Langfitt visiting with us here in Washington DC Frank thank you so much happy to do it [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nGood evening it's five thirty five and you're listening to all things considered on eighty nine point three K PCC we've got wait wait don't tell me on the way it's six than at seven o'clock the season premiere of live from here with special guest Lindsay Buckingham that live from here at seven\nFour members of Southern California based hate group were arrested this week and charged with inciting violence at last year's deadly rally in Charlottesville the group is called ram\nFor rise above movement and investigators drawn reporting from the non profit news organization ProPublica to build their case including the work of A.C Thompson\nRam it was founded by a man who went to prison in New York state for ... six times and the founders name is Rob ... do and he lives in orange county and basically when he got out of prison moved from New York to California\nHe started a group that was sort of one of the new breed of white supremacist or white nationalist groups that are out there but this group rat and which is based in Southern California with members going from San Diego up to Los Angeles is perhaps the most aggressive most violent of the new breed\nA violent what are you talking about\nThose what we're talking about is is a group of young men and estimates range from twenty to fifty at any given time who spend\nTheir days working out training and martial arts training and boxing going out to the desert and engaging in shooting practice\nWho are actually just much more skilled at physical combat than you know most of the other members of this kind of white supremacist movements that are out there and so we've seen them engage in byland altercations in Huntington Beach in Berkeley in Charlottesville these guys are sort of the band guard the tip of the spear the people that really go out\nAnd aggressively assault counterprotesters leftist anti racist that type of thing\nYou said that ah that Rahm has been violent in public acts of violence but police haven't taken much action\nWhat I'm seeing is over the last year a single harassed or Rob ruined do for\nAllegedly assaulting a police officer in Berkeley those charges were dropped but what I Believe is gone on is that there has been interest in the group from local law enforcement as well as federal law enforcement and interested in building a more significant case against them and I think that's what you're seeing today\nWhat is it that sets ram apart from the groups that protest and you know they may be they may have ah repugnant views to us but they just protested they're exercising their First Amendment rights\nI think when you see he ran ran members are showing up to engage in physical violence that is their cause that is what they were built to do that is their agenda and I think that's different than some of the other groups that are out there\nYou know I've also had members of the ... left the group who came to me and said look at the larger long term agenda is to prepare for a race war and to arm ourselves and equip ourselves to engage in a race war and which we will go out and slaughter or people of color Jews Muslims and immigrants\nWell as Rahm using the Internet the way all the other groups are\nYeah they are and they've been repeatedly kicked off of social media platforms are they'd been repealed kicked off of Instagram and Twitter and they kinda keep popping backup I Would say they're not as savvy as some of the other groups and they're less Internet based than some of the other groups\nSome of the groups out there are really excellent at hacking at social media at means all this kind of stuff ran use the Internet and social media but really their world is in the flash it out there in the physical space\nReporter A.C Thompson from profile [noise]\nComing up and wait wait don't tell me the NPR News quiz that six minutes seven o'clock and Lindsay Buckingham

all very very few but from that point of view he's no longer\nThe leader of that's quite there because you know at the same time the other news today goes is that we have a confirmation from Beijing

must have thought that you have protection and friends in the right places\nBut in any case is his wife who raised the alarm about his departure new today gave a press conference again or you know

they told us much\nWell the polls haven't closed in the presidential elections yet because Brazil has it turns into the further to the west and say well it's going to be another just over another out before they close and we get the exit polls the presidential elections but what we have had\nAll the exit polls for some of the uh governor and state races the sentences insightful and all those exit polls suggest and of course a negative caution as ever with exit polls rule they suggest and they suggested uniformly is that in the three most populous states\nThere is a ... great swing to the people who are either in giant votes in the fall writes presidential challengers policy which so far I mean in in recent years been miniscule thing\nThat all people who are aligned to him has said that they will throw their weight behind and so you go governor races Senate races where the [noise]\nBut it's all I mean they they\nFrankly been no collusion to the opinion polls have suggested in terms of just how big a swing they offer drifting a is taking place in the three most populous states including here in ...\nTo ... so there is there is a loss of the the tool from very experienced political journalists here in Brazil that Mr ... minds just might\nBe on pools to win in the first round which would mean him getting more than fifty percent of the votes and we think that they were

that it's a matter of both sides I Believe that there\nWas a tremendous breaking the Democratic process in the way that Kavanaugh's nomination was handled and no once we're able to redress\nThose you know as we always are I think we'll get back to the to the more normal ... democracy that instead of its current extreme version\nI invested or what should we do about this then\nWell I think on the on the U.S to take the example of the\nThe Kavanaugh nomination um uh but there's so much more and the Trump Administration that the same could be set up\nWe need you acknowledge what the baseline that this was not a normal process I worked when I was in the White House on two Supreme Court nomination\nWe turned over every page of\nJustice Elena Kagan's White House document\nThis White House withheld hundreds of thousands of pages you had an FBI investigation I wrote about what a normal one would have looked like I mentioned to many of them ... this was an abnormal and limits your one you had an extremely unusual unprecedented party's been shipped by\nThe nominee I Know what I'm going to ask you we don't have we have limited time I'm going to ask\nYou briefly to tell us what direction we should go in going forward and then I Want to turn it over to the professor again I should we do not\nI mean we have to acknowledge what was wrong and it must be made right I Believe there will likely be some regrets in the mid term\nUh when the more accountability may come to at least want it not both houses of Congress and that regret will help heal what's broke\nProfessor if we can you actually belong to a project called better angels which is an effort to bring conservatives and progressive together to reduce polarization used very it's very structured it's very intentional oh how is that going and what do you hope to accomplish this\nIs one of a lot of grassroots efforts to build civility across the country but\nI actually think that that by itself is not going to turn on the trip because this is something I think that really need leadership I I agree with the ambassador that the the blame has not been symmetrical I mean we have a president who instead of trying to actually unite the country around some common interests has done everything that you can\nUh to try to increase the degree of polarization\nBut in a certain sense to me that uh you know there's grounds for optimism because if it is a result of this kind of what I Would regard as really bad leadership it means that\nSomebody with a different agenda you know could actually begin to emphasize you know common national identity things that Americans actually hold in common and walk us back a little bit from the precipice of ...\nSo is there for ... really have a minute left So Professor ... leadership is not there what should people be doing in the interim\nShould vote I mean I Do think that fundamentally you know a lot of this is a political fight and\nI think that if you're you know I really do think the upcoming election in November as one of the most important in American history because I Do think that that's the ultimate way that Americans have of holding their leaders accountable\nAnd there's going to be big implications drawn depending on the way that this election goes and I think that's really that's the way that in a democracy you exercise your agency and you you know express your democratic will\nSo much more to say I'm Sorry we're running out of time but more to come hopefully we'll have this conversation again and\nWe'll talk about how things are
