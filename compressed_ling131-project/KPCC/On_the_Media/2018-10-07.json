calling yesterday Senate confirmation and swearing in of Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh a tremendous victory no mean new G A dean of member station Casey you are reports the president's celebrated at a packed political rally in Topeka, Kansas last night\nAnd said he thought he could get away with it and we all need sexual harassment was wrong we tolerated in any way that his than they think the line governing a lot of the me too movement and a lot of the response to it\nWhat truly surprising to me at this moment is that we're seeing a group that spent years laughing at the very idea of anything like quote rave culture suddenly not just admitting that it exists but arguing that it should\nMalfeasance is an unstoppable cocktail of culture and biology and the subtext stripped of all the pretense\nIs that the victims don't actually matter just by coincidence says all of this is happening I kept stumbling across news stories that almost laughable you confirmed overblown this panic about men suddenly being persecuted really is because these are cases where men were found guilty in a court of law\nOf sexual assault and received no jail time anyway [laughter] so in Anchorage Justin Schneider was indicted by a grand jury last month on for a felony charges and he was accused of offering a woman or ride strangling her until she was unconscious and masturbating on her\nThat he got no jail time Snyder\nDid not apologize for his actions but thanks for judge for accepting the deal\nWould you want to I'm In a group going on to me a year to really

yeah\nYou observed that a majority of the G O P has said that even if Kavanaugh is guilty of doing what he did it isn't this qualifying you think that shows real contempt for women's safety\nAnd that it gives the lied to the whole notion of Courtland us and especially chivalry what do you mean by that\nChivalry is at protection racket and always has been [laughter]\nWords you give us your field tea you allow us to limit your ambitions and control your speech and behavior and\nYou won't get hurt you won't get hurt and maybe it will be financially supported but if you don't you will be punished that's the flip side of that and I think that that has been exposed you see what happens to people who just\nAbout ... see how Dr Ford has been treated you see how the other women who have spoken up are treated by the G O P whether it's Dianne Feinstein whether it's centered club which are whether it's ... she was shocked\nThat her picture the state of shock [laughter] I'm not thinking that that's over there I Know you're not they can never do\nNo go ahead go ahead\nAnd tweak this weekend Mr President we are in a moment where the status quo is trying its hardest to hyper correct by saying out loud\nThe things that it used to paper over with a socially acceptable than Europe chivalry when you have a class of people\nWho had things are arranged such that in any situation that involves a man and a woman alone the woman absorbs one hundred percent of the risk to her physical safety ... and he shoulders none of course they're going to be extremely upset\nFerment you have to shoulder any amount of risk under those circumstances becomes intolerable there just dresses real one of the things that really struck me during the hearing was how angry circulated in that room and how the one person not permitted to express any less Christine Blasey Ford\nThe theatrics that the GOP demonstrated in the second half of that hearing involved a lot is grabbing the anger ball so to speak and just out screaming\nYou know what it reminded me of in basketball there's this thing that players do sometimes called flopping their touched by another player and then they fall hard on the floor hoping that the um sauce\n\nThat's so gay yeah that is a strategic performance that cannot be honored and I think that the me too movement has unleashed a lot of anger that has never been permitted to be expressed or felt [noise]\n[noise]\n\nAnd I think that that is a pretty potent tool and honestly I think it's actually very healthy for people who has been repressing and bottling up their anger into a socially acceptable performance for as long as they has been feeling it could be able to finally express it\nSo you're talking about democratic women or Lindsey Graham\nI'm Talking about democratic women I think when the Graham has been expressing just fine [laughter] I think he's okay\nBut when I see that a man is very angry it's a very instinctive reaction I'm a little bit afraid and I think to myself oh well he must be right in some way I should retreat a little bit and give ground that I find myself no longer being very impressed by I think I'm not alone\nThe intimidating function that male anger you sit there and I think is wearing thin [noise]\nThank you very much for having me\nLiterally lose ... is a staff writer for slate\n\nComing up the best seller

tears and the massacre at Disney David Dreier and Ojibwe professor of literature at the University of Southern California offers a re examination of Indian life and his forthcoming book the heart of Disney native America\nEighteen Ninety to the present he begins his counter narrative with the confusion that catalyze the harbor\nIn ... South Dakota in Eighteen Ninety Troyer says frontiers soldiers spilled a flood of innocent blood because they were by the ghost dance a religion based on the vision of a pie you spiritual leader named the Boca\nIt was a pretty vanilla vision\nHe basically said we have to get along with white people you have to work hard you can cheat or steal or drink\nIf we do all these things will then we will be reunited with her loved ones that are ... in the after world it was almost Protestant and it's his insistence other kind of work ethic as it's spreading crew and other tribes interpreted differently\nSome people thought they did the dancers and the right way for the red shirts and did all the right things that they would be among the chosen in the saved and everywhere else would be wiped away in a in a massive flood or some kind of catastrophe meaning all the white\nPeople meeting either white people and all the native people who didn't do this stuff so that goes to was a religion that was growing around the Pine Ridge agency and there was a troop buildup out of fear that this religion would lead once again to open armed conflict with the government\nIt was never going to go there but the increased because it's a troops put people on edge around the same farm sitting bull was murdered when they tried to apprehend him that scared most of the native folks at Pine Ridge and everyone was kind of running for cover\nAbout it and and didn't make it any better but once again what they did do was keep the issue of native life and native lives in the national consciousness\nBecause I did have an impact it has some substantial legislation\nYeah there was an amazing legislation finally passed the Nineteen seventies that improve American indian education I remember going to school this was in the seventies and eighties but\nI cannot have an American Indian teacher into graduate school by the time my younger brother and sister who are eight years younger went to school they had native teachers they had teachers who are like them and this meant a great deal to them\nAnd this was due to the Indian Education Act of Nineteen Seventy two\nA lot to do with that and in Nineteen Seventy eight I Believe Carter signed into law the American Indian religious freedom act mhm until Nineteen Seventy eight it was illegal for Native American people to practice their religion we weren't being prosecuted by the government if we practice I religions in the Nineteen seventies but for a quarter to finally grants\nNative American people religious freedom had an incredible effect no longer if you were a traditional native person where you suspect where you'd dismissed out of hand or or pushed to the to the side\nSo yes a lot of good things happen in the seventies and many of those good things happened because of bringing our case onto people's television sets\nWe're speaking ahead of indigenous people's day October eighth the movement to change the name of the holiday really began in the early nineties\nRights so Nineteen and she was the five hundredth anniversary of Columbus as a rival in the new world Nineteen and she was also the trusting of multi cultural wave especially in academia\nPeople an African American studies of people you know Latino people I'm Asian American people are saying no no no no no in fact the progressive human thinking in the evolution of human civilizations has never been the simply the progress of white people\nAnd people were not content to simply celebrate Columbus people were much more interested in interrogating the legacy of colonialism which was still being felt in populations around North America\nAnd so not only Native Americans were protesting that very special Columbus Day but Latinos were protesting an African Americans were protesting and we all were finding common cause as we look back\nAt five hundred years of colonialism and what it had done to us and how it had made the country\nAnd so when the Spanish government decided in conjunction with the American government that they're going to send some replicas of the Nina didn't do in Santa Maria across the ocean that around the United states it's pretty tone deaf on the part of the Spanish government if yeah if you don't mind me saying\nLike live in these ships to the places where they introduced slavery to native populations in the modern populations descended from the slaves that were owned by Columbus and his brother for instance\nThey were rebuffed it just fizzles\nIn the meantime our government was planning a\nClinton sing tenor eats you believe to kickoff Nineteen Ninety two yeah with its own replicas of the three boats sailing under the Golden Gate bridge but corporate sponsors retreated right the jubilee never happen\nExactly because American indian activists in American indian people just said enough with this Columbus crap we're not going to sit by and let you do this\nAnd by Nineteen Ninety two we'd had generations of native people complaining high school and going to college in serving in the army and serving in World War one and World War two in Korea and Vietnam by Nineteen Ninety two we'd had native veterans coming back from the first Gulf War for that matter and not with this\nSo now the state of Alaska and Hawaii Oregon South Dakota and Vermont don't recognize Columbus Day there are cities Austin, Texas Salt Lake city Los Angeles uh Minneapolis Seattle they celebrate indigenous people's day\nHas a ways to go but we've come a long ways\nSo why don't we jumped ahead the Standing Rock okay you take issue with a popular narrative that was used by the former chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and the author of a New York times op ed\nWho compared the treatment of Indian protesters and the Bundy brothers the protesters who sees the ... National Wildlife refuge in Oregon he wrote on the same day that the armed Malory militants were acquitted I watched as riot police with military grade weapons\nRounded up hundreds of peaceful water protectors in North Dakota\nProtesting an oil pipeline\nThe juxtaposition of these two events one system of justice for self styled white cowboys and another for Indians was stunning\nI don't buy it is a crucial difference that German Archambault was missing here the white supremacists wherever you might call them that at the lower refuge they were occupying federal and\nThe water protectors at Standing Rock were being arrested for trespassing on private land the issue wasn't that why people are being treated differently than Indians and I think to maintain that kind of us than Indian white\nCowboys and Indians discourse is to miss the larger point that the federal government privileges private property above all most everything else that's the problem\nBut weren't the protesters at Standing Rock trying to protect what would ultimately be damage to their own land well of course\nBut the problem was that Ninety percent of the pipeline was routed through private lands there were ways to rewrite it away from you you can meet with the pipeline and meet with the Army Corps of engineers as many tribes on the pipeline's route did\nAnd subsequently the pipeline was rerouted around those communities but Standing Rock missed meeting after meeting negotiation of negotiation deadline up to a deadline until the government finally without their input approve the pipeline under the lake and very close to the Standing Rock\nWhat you're saying is that this us versus them mentality was a huge missed opportunity\nOriginal sin is that the government broke it's treaty obligations and promises to the Standing Rock and other Lakota tribes which resulted in opening up Lakota lands to private non native ownership\nThat's what allowed the pipeline to go through because our government will bend over backwards for private enterprise to me this is the story of local communities against capitalism not cowboys versus Indians\nLike I'm Sorry but we already know that story where you know what happens to Indian or sort of re stealing our own faith let's face it you know part of the problem is an Iraq was that the government didn't show up for meetings\nYou know I think it's really important that are activists put their bodies on the line but I think it's also important that our elected officials should put their bodies and chairs and short for meetings don't get me wrong Standing Rock was amazing and important and powerful\nWhat was amazing about that protest was that they issued figure heads and I would say chauvinist sexist violent leadership like we saw in past iterations of Indian activism at would add ...\nWe had a collection of the diaspora that was coming to the defense of Standing Rock it was powerful and important and that the legacy of that protests will live on immediately after the protests was over at Standing Rock\nThe question of pipelines came up on my reservation my reservation council had previously approved pipelines through the reservation\nAfter Standing Rock there is no way they could possibly hope to be reelected if they approved more type blindly says so it had an immediate effect around the country\nAnd this was the result of healthy positive kind of activism the likes of which we had not seen before\nSo what is the narrative you want Native American native peoples to hold in their minds\nI Want it once and for all destroyed sort of the narrative of Indian starting out in God's garden of the new world enter a serpent and fourteen Ninety two\nExpelled from the garden to wander the earth and shame in poverty right [laughter] did you have that one already south right you've heard that story too you know so often we think of Indian life as lives that are defined by\nHaving everything stolen from us\nIndian lives our lives of loss that's how our lives are most often understood and I think a better narrative is to think of our lives as as for\nBut plenty plenty of injustice but plenty of passion and ability to to write those wrongs plenty of poverty but also plenty of creativity and hustle in order to sort of overcome it plenty of crime but also plenty of laws plenty of of exclusions and traumas\nBut also a surplus of grit and ability and intelligence and creativity to overcome them and to do better so [noise]\nIn my mind it's a story of surplus [noise]\nDavid thank you so much thank
