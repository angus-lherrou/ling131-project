transparent you're very open in your book about your decision to cast a Jeffrey Tambor who is not a transgender woman I'm In the role of a more transparent can you talk a little bit about that decision because it receives a lot of criticism at the time\nYeah well I'm I was really ignorant about trans politics I guess first before I unpack everything that happened I I always want to say that Jeffrey cameras portrayal of Mara was absolutely astonishing and beautiful and Jeffrey's a fantastic actor mhm\nBut also I was making huge mistake around trans politics by having assessment play a trans woman because for trans women they are being accused by people of quote unquote being men dressing up as women that's what makes transplants so vulnerable and public so having even\nJeffrey Tambor dressing up as a trans woman\nMay have translated to people who work in the know as this is what trans women are men dressing up as women so not only was it a problem with casting it really was a very very very dangerous dangerous thing for trans women you'd make a different decision now in casting\nPeople asking that question I think time machine questions are really odd because I couldn't go back because the world has changed so much and when I was making transparent I myself really didn't understand my own parents ... yet\nAnd I still had so much of my parents' image in my mind of when she was presenting as assess mail that it didn't even occur to me to cast a trans woman so I think you know it is what it was and what it was was was the show was with Jeffrey in it\n[noise] trying to censor I'm Jeffrey Tambor was accused by a former crewmember and a member of the cast of sexual harassment ... with us allocations a surprise to you yeah they were\nA lot of focus has been on what happened there and we've had so much conversation since\nThose allegations happened about believing people who say they've been harassed or assaulted 'em and after the initial allegations you were really worried about the effect on the show and you wrote I knew it was over for Jeffrey and that meant more on the show or TV family my own family my parents' reputation everything\nAnd you acknowledge that one of the accusers was upset about that reaction\nI I Know you don't like to go into a time machine but what did you learn from that [noise]\nYeah I uh it was so interesting because you know I was with the people of time is up and an agitating for this notion of you know one of the things that I wrote on posted as I was like saying what do we want right now in this moment I wrote it unlock all and ...\nAnd ... for non nondisclosure agreements I felt that what Hollywood really needed was to make an accounting of how much money had been spent to put tape over women's mouse\nAnd then I was faced with this instance on our show where some trans women want us to tell their story and I was confronted I think with my own trans massage name where I didn't immediately said to van and trace\nLet's stand up and tell your story\nInstead I went a little bit into protection mode and as you said thought about the show and thought about everybody's financial earnings I thought about what the world would think of a show like transparent if it was connected with this reckoning\nWhat I needed to recognize but it took me a minute was the ... of both tries and van for taking their stories and being willing to say them out loud and in many ways to sacrifice themselves and in retrospect yeah I Would like a time machine in that\nOne [noise] what's your relationship with them temperate now we haven't spoken in a little while [noise]\nThis is gonna keep happening my friend's artist people we admire are going to come under scrutiny and\nIt will be painful for their friends and their colleagues and I wonder if you have advice now for people who are in the situation you and\nFor me this was a time for emotional tenderness towards everyone\nEspecially towards the victims who are willing to sacrifice again is it's a very sacrificial act\nUm and in terms of the men and the people who are being accused I think it's really about men\nDeeply deeply deeply spending a lot of time and energy trying to understand how patriarchy protects their privilege and thinking of actual ways and tactics that they can take to begin to make up for the harm they've caused before they asked to come back that doesn't mean we don't treat them with tenderness and love\nDoes that mean the same for every ten more for you\nOf course I mean Jeffrey Tambor as a member of my family I never want to put the protection of Jeffrey Tambor as career over the protection of trace lives that's career and Ben Barnes career and I think that's what happens is as a culture where naturally patriarchal so we naturally go well what about him\nAnd I think there are a lot of straight white says men who have had positions of power and their expectation to continue and that power over there\nSo their lives is part of what I think has some unconsciously demanding that they place their pain first before everybody else's\nShe'll sell the way thank you so much for your honesty the

the moment that he breaks with the U.S and decides to\nLaunch his own aggressive foreign policy specifically with his invasion of Kuwait in Nineteen Ninety all of a sudden it becomes a sort of brutal

here you have an African American geneticists name Rick ... and a business woman named Janet page\nStarting this company in two thousand three that's based on scientific research that ... does as a

twenty three in the ... although it proceeds twenty three and me by about five years ago one of the first pioneering companies was a black owned genetic ancestry testing company that's still in business today\nI did not know that one of the first significant companies to do this was designed to help African Americans discover what their actual roots were been\nDesigned by people who are very\nWell versed in the history of scientific racism who could say we understand the limits of the technology we understand what the history of eugenics and genetics has meant in the world but we are trying to use it in a way that we hope can offer some new information\nTo communities that would otherwise not have it\nOne of the points that's most important to you is that it adds complexity to a kind of flattened notion of race slavery was a caste system and nobody seemed to care where they came from or what their cultural background was\nAnd this returns that information to people\nGenetic ancestry testing becomes a place to turn to offer those possibilities for new ways of thinking about oneself\nBut it's in the context of technologies that are making kind of inferences and are using certainly in the early days of the market a few genetic markers and saying that these few genetic markers are Poland or our ego or are in Mauritania\nAnd that's a kind of reduction of all of who humans are to a few markers even as the sort of intention here is to give fullness inhumanity the cost of doing that is too and view Barry obstructing technical things with a sense of culture and
