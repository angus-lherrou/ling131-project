{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Sing to Dana Rohrabacher\nSo they're here you know it's this idea that these guys are not addressing climate change you got a you know voters are seeing it so both accordingly in the in the upcoming bitter herbs\nI see what you're saying I think the thing that politically makes it a difficult sell maybe I'm for voters sometimes is that you know Republicans are framing this as an economic issue we hear a lot about deregulation and how'd you regulation\nHas has helped improve the economy and candidly the economy in doing pretty well by a lot of metrics right now so you you don't get a sense that there's a real motivating factor for Republicans to see climate change of the real tangible problem right now\nIt's the idea that if it ain't broke don't fix it right but is anybody who owns a car you know if you don't you don't change oil when it eventually you're not going to have a car\nAnd I think that's the argument that Democrats would make this is an existential issue while there may be some economic harm to begin with you\nHave to balance that against the economic harm that you're preventing\nAnd there were certainly be job creation with I mean we're seeing that with the solar industry right now with the renewable energy\nRight yeah so you were talking a little bit of go about President Trump he is the party leader at this point and he has been extremely outspoken in his belief that\nThat climate change is not necessarily a manmade problem he has talked about pulling out of the Paris climate accord he sees that in fact it's one of his major achievements in office and he brings it up a lot at rallies that he sees it as a way to potentially get Republicans out and vote\nWe knocked out of the Paris climate\nVery it's a job killing Paris climate accord\nChilling Paris climate\nWas a little bit more about what the Trump administration's approach to climate change has been the Trump administration's approach to climate change is essentially that it doesn't really exist and President Trump he\nWas just pinned down on this in the sixty minutes interview and this was his first time as president before he was president he called it a hoax do\nYou still think that climate change is a hoax\nI think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that is man made I Will say this um I don't want to give trillions intrusions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs\nI don't want to be put in a disadvantage\nDo we have a sense of you know really that the real tangible side effects of this\nSo the idea is by not pursuing climate change your protect these coal jobs even if you don't bring them all back but\nThen there's also this idea that if you make energy more expensive\nThan people will have to pay more companies that rely on a lot using a lot of energy will have to Jack up their prices it's like what you hear about the terrorists that may raise prices on consumer is basically the same thing that you'll raise prices on consumers and therefore consumers will have to pass\nWell yeah it's just an interesting thing though because I mean really what this is is it's it's a debate about I mean for sure if we were to address climate change tomorrow right let's just say that the Trump Administration somehow woke up tomorrow and said hey we actually think climate change is real and we want to do something about it in the short term for sure there would be job loss or it'd be an economic loss just because\nYou know that would require\nA complete change a mark on the way things work\nBut when you look at the implications of not doing anything I mean it's hard to put a number on the future right it's hard to know exactly what the effects of climate change you're going to be and how much it will cost but I mean the the research that has come out as saying it's going to cost trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars parts of the country to parts of the world are going to be unlivable\nRight so there are some really big issues that you're you're just kind of kicking down the road and at some point somebody's gonna have to pay that cost if we're not paying it right now\nSo let's talk a little bit about what is specifically at stake in the midterms right if Republicans keep Congress do we get a sense that anything would change would things be kind of acts but I did that we've seen in terms of the Trump administration's um [noise] rejection of climate change your gender\nOr the a lot of what you've seen right if you think about the Obama administration if you think about the Trump Administration is doing right now in terms of environmental policy almost everything that's happening is in the executive branch right Congress has not they're not really doing anything that habit for a long time when it comes to the environment\nToday on the flip side than if Democrats\nAre who do seem to see this as a pressing issue right now right politically you are hearing Democrats talk a little bit more about climate change and some of the threats they hear from the Republican opponent so if Democrats were to take control even if one chamber of the house I mean what could they do too I mean beyond say oversight\nThat's about it every Democrat I talked to said oversight oversight oversight which you know we shouldn't be what does that mean exactly are you hearing you know expect to see Ryan Zinke key uh Andrew wheeler the head of the EPA\nRuns it could be in the head of the interior um you know you would expect to see those guys are in hearings over and over and over again whether they'd be having to come up and explain a lot of the world backs that they're doing explain why they've\nGot rid of the mess and ruled explain you know the spending cuts for climate science at NASA or those sort of things where it makes it very difficult for them do their jobs because they're basically haven't spent all their time preparing for hearings and took a potentially slow down the process you're saying\nYeah could slow down the process you know there was another interesting thing that\nYou know Tom pile who is with the American energy alliance very supportive of Trump's agenda\nHe said it would actually also give Democrats an environmental groups a stage to you know crafting narrative that\nThat hasn't really gotten out there right now against what Trump is doing with the environment um which I thought was really interesting you said it's just so much other news happening that environment issues really haven't you know taken center stage um and it would give them an opportunity to actually really to craft that narrative and put it out\nThere that's basically what the Republicans did on climate\nInch under President Obama when they took over the house they would be bringing in a you know the EPA administrators and others and basically kinda yell at them and say you're going to put a tax on all these weird heard all these people they wouldn't they use that to frame their narrative and make any climate change\nAction seem like it is a tax and it's going to hurt people's [noise]\nAlright well thank you to you both and NPR's Ayesha Rascoe and eat round thank you

one from St the musical [noise]\nI've always I've always wondered what it would mean to try one of my radio stories as a musical you know I was taking so many musicals as a kid and I think because of that my basic sense of what makes a satisfying story actually comes from a musical it's much more than from from TV or movies if you think about like the classic\nOld musicals did were on the roof even chorus line it's like they're funny at the beginning and then there's something really emotional and there are about some bigger idea they take you into this world it's just I just love that\nAnd
