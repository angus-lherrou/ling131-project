although the White House would still have considerable leverage to make administrative changes in the law\nNow Democrats some Democrats on the left have been\nGoing to go further than the Affordable CARE Act and and pass something like Medicare for all which Bernie Sanders has championed if they were to control just one chamber of course they wouldn't be able to do that but they might be able to make some noise about it\nDoesn't really want to jump in and also point out what Republicans are saying about health care of this year which is it's not just playing defense is not just pushing back on democratic ads I mean one third of Republican ads are about health care it's less than Democrats but it's still a sizable\nAnd what they're doing aside from playing defense is also attacking Democrats on Medicare for all saying you know my opponent so it's so and so is\nJust too liberal she wants to or he wants to take away your Medicare as we know it take away your healthcare is you know if you like your employer sponsored health care so and so it's going to get rid of it if they vote for Medicare for all and and you can see that shaping the health care discussion not just this year but for years to come as more Democrats back that\nThere's a lot of fear mongering going on there we saw for example the president wrote an op ed for USA Today was widely criticized for factory factual inaccuracies in fact USA Today itself had to run a fact check the following day\nBut it has long been a successful gambit for either party to play on the fears of Medicare recipients that the other party might try to go after your Medicare in particular because older people are very regular voters\nAnd if Republicans keep control can we expect more attempts to repeal Obamacare or do you think the current climate the way this is laid politically the cycle would keep them from trying to do that\nI mean you can certainly imagine that there would be more attempts but then again I mean there's also\nGiven how fearful so many Americans have been about health care during this cycle especially about things like preexisting conditions I Wonder and I'm just guessing here because who knows I Wonder if they might be a bit ginger about the specific provisions they might be attacking like preexisting conditions\nI think there are definitely some Republican activist who will want to finish the job now that John McCain has been replaced and the Senate by a more reliable vote for the Republican agenda but Danielle is right there will also certainly be some wariness given the backlash they've gotten already\nAnd if for Republicans gained some seats in the Senate ah three Republicans wouldn't be able to stop or repeal effort like they did this year That's NPR's Scott Horsley and Danielle Kurtzleben thank you very much you could we would [noise]\n\nThis is the politics show from NPR I'm Scott Detrow so every week we focus on one race and we already talked about the Georgia governor's race in the show but here's the thing is just a week and a half left before election day a lot of big races to talk about\nSo this week we're going to add a second race of the week and to do that we've got to ... and our old NPR hate America hey there and we're gonna bring bread jasper's of member station ... in Phoenix a breath hey hey so dumb ethical let's start with you catch us up to speed who's running in this race why does it matter\nNo matter who wins here the Arizona Senate races going to make history is elected eleven senators since becoming a state Nineteen twelve\nNone of them though have been a woman and that's definitely going to change this November that because voters here will either elected democratic representative cure students cinema\nShe's a former social worker or Republican congresswoman Martha mix Sally she's retired from the military with the rank of colonel and she was the first woman to fly in combat\nThis is for the seat that's being vacated by Jeff Flake who decided not to run again because he said he just couldn't see myself getting elected given how the Republican Party has gone one way and and he's gone the other way Brett what is the strategy that that makes Sally and send them are taking into this campaign what if they both been focusing on\nWell both of them have tried to really make themselves to some degree cinemas project of remaking has lasted many years she was in the state legislature in a very\nProgressive member of that years ago and she's been one of the most moderate members of the house of representatives in Congress whereas makes Sally also started off as a moderate congresswoman but in this campaign she's really embraced President Trump\nSeparate we could really say this for for most Senate races at this point in election but this has gotten\nReally negative while we were in harm's way in uniform cure some cinema was protesting us any pink to to\nFor them it's always seem to think she can say whatever she wants as long as she shows picture of herself in uniform his shows are just to get a link to show why about\nIn the midst all this what are you hearing from the actual voters that you talk to\nPeople talk about the ads um they they are disgusted by them you know one particular voter you know it was really striking she didn't want to give me her name but she said that she drives two hours a day on her commute and she hears these ads on the radio\nOh my God those ads are horrible\nAbsolutely horrible honestly it reminds me of petty school ground catty girl just going at each other so\nI just prefer to distance myself from that\nSo you might not vote in that race because of that fact was talking to a a political scientist here who said she wasn't sure if that was a strategy by mix Sally but\nYou know the people who might be turned off from voting are people who are a less likely to vote in the first place and the women and so those might both be constituencies that cares and set them up what meat so you know the negative ads are definitely having an effect especially if they're like irrelevant to you know important salient issues\nYou know people like to say that negative ads don't work in that they don't like negative ads but the thing is negative ads do work\nOr the fact of the matter is that cinema was leading in these polls her favorability ratings were much higher\nAnd there's a reason why she is now a started to to lose some ground and it's all because of those ads and by the way if anybody is annoyed with those ads and you're in the car listening to the radio what are you doing not listening to NPR jasper's\nBetter with kj ... thanks so much for joining us thank you for having me and the medical much now thanks as always pleasure

sort of in retrospect but I think I had some sort of been clean up this idea at the time I'm just I'm just sort of not realizing that but I think\nI remember thinking that he was one of the few people that you had in her life and she couldn't even really depend on him\nYeah you're probably right even Straggler ... and you you may have been um at that point at that moment her only for him you know [noise]\n\n\nMy mom didn't have any idea where I could find Susan which made things difficult\nBecause eight Susan Jordan is a very common name\nAnd B it's probably not a name any more [noise]\nI called the county court records department to find out the Susan Jordan's married Cincinnati [noise]\nMy mom asked a friend who worked for the city to search on the Senate birth records\nI contacted high school alumni associations as friends at high powered newspapers to run background checks [noise]\nFinally there was one former season Jordan who stood up\nChoosing the right age she was married and living in Cincinnati suburb should a couple of kids her husband was a lawyer\nI got a number from information and it wasn't until I sat down to color that it hit me a phone call from someone you babysat Twenty years ago might not be a welcome surprise but in fact strange and creepy here I Am a practicing sounding benign\nOne to one to Susan Susan Jordan the Susan Jordan [laughter] [noise]\nFinally I made the call\n[noise]\nHello hello I this is Susan Hi um my name's Alex Bloomberg and I'm I'm calling from from a radio program called this American Life and I'm I this is a primary strange phone call to receive but I was wondering first of all you do you remember me\nIt turns out there are a lot of Susan Jordans you don't remember me a lot one guy even called his ex wife a former student Jordan and then called me back to tell me she never heard of me I was getting nowhere by myself so I contacted a professional one urban ...\nCertified New York city private investigator three days after putting him on the case I got a message saying he'd founder I called them back\nI call the morning early or roughly around the seven dirty mhm [noise]\nBut she didn't want to introduce myself or should or whether they were showing the rose bushes ... together in New York and I'm looking for someone I used to live in Cincinnati and what particular school there was a neighbor's attire wishes in Jordan\nShe should that me and I said okay and I should I or do you know anybody they the average Blumberg and right away she had babies [laughter] is um\nThe interesting part about the whole thing is she definitely like shoo remembers you and uh she's going to call you\n[noise]\nHello this is the Susan yeah this is Alex Bloomberg Hi\nFamily I'm doing okay how are you mind if you get my email I got your email yeah ... and I I called you at work and then I realized that I I'd also gotten this number from the from the private investigator\nSusan and I talked for over three hours on the phone is catching up comparing notes that I'm just about my sister and kids that used to live in the street or an old family dog how're you doing I'm\nDoing okay it was amazing how much she remembered and how much we remembered and comment even small incidents like the time that we were stopped at the traffic light and I stared too long at the guy in the motorcycle\nI think I remember that was the only area of new\nProbably probably and he said he says something to you and I said no he didn't say anything to me and you said he said something to you didn't and you were about to get out of the car and the guys that as I'm sure\n[laughter] I think I can remember your face\nI think you were sitting very ill with your hands in your lap where are you afraid\nI was terrified that [laughter] yeah I\nDidn't know that he would notice [laughter] but uh [laughter]\nWell don't worry I I Would have taken him now [laughter]\nI had no fear I'm telling you\nYou know we did there was like maybe six or seven or eight years after you baby sat us\nAnd I was working to restore you [laughter] yeah I remember [laughter] [noise] and nor would train our wasn't right at the thrift way yeah [laughter] I remember I guess you were you begging my groceries at this but I didn't recognize you I don't\nI don't you told me the word and then I did\nRight right I think he's a mop head\nThere [laughter] like I did warp you [laughter] people still call you that [laughter] [noise]\nSusan got married when she was still in college and went to work for the phone company as a repair person\nShe spent the next Twenty years or so hanging from a telephone pole and she said\nShe hated us the money was good\nAround the time her first marriage ended she finally got the courage to quit and find work using her degree\nNow teaches at a special school for mentally ill children she lives in Florida with her second husband she seems happy\nOf course when you talk back into the past like this you find have partial an incomplete your memory is\nFirst there the facts you get wrong turns out Susan had been a college freshman when she babysat us not in high school\nLike I thought my sister remember she's written a motorcycle also not true and the guy who she got in the fight with the cats who in my mind was her Harry seventies boyfriend turned out to be her roommates boyfriend\nBut besides the fact you change the fact you completely admit that fight or the cats Susan had forgotten totally that I'd been there and it was a little strange because my presence was the only thing she forgotten other details you remembered San even the names of the cats themselves\nAwesome and Tom [noise] we were hillbillies remember that uh [laughter] and uh but I Can't imagine what I took you over there for\nI'm sure it was for you know I think we were just running errands [noise] they're still lucky [laughter] it's it's funny because when I when I like you know I remember these very particular incidents and that was one of them in and\nProbably the reason I remember it is because it seemed very significant to you I think I sensed as a kid that you were that it was really upsetting to you because it it I think I felt at that time that you didn't really have very many people in your life at that point you can trust\nOh I didn't have I didn't have hardly anybody my whole family moved out of town I had no family oh let's see I moved out that day I graduated from high school\nMhm and I was Seventeen cars I started a year early I had I just wanted out at least that's I'd found out that I got the scholarship mhm I packed up that nine\nWhy did you want to get off of it because my family wouldn't the functional that my mother in ... it was pretty bad [noise]\nThe girl that I Lived with\nAt that time she was taken a lot of drug\nAnd her boyfriend and every time I Would come home they would always try to get me to take drugs with them or something\nAnd I I really do it much at all and um it was really it was it was tough to come home and\nI I guess I must have been suffering a little bit I missed I really miss my little brothers and my little sister and they were gone\nAnd I would I guess maybe trying to substitute\nI think maybe that's one of the reasons that I remember that we remember he used to follow those because I think it worked both ways I think that we felt if that didn't make you feel closer to us I think that we we responded and well\nHow desperately I guess I was looking for a family that I mean it it's only you knew you probably wouldn't hire me but I mean the people are complicated now what I really wanted to do with spend more time with your mom and dad but I was terrified\n[noise] I mean I\nI just couldn't I couldn't do it I was shy you know a lot of times they it was I thought they were asking me to stay longer and talk\nAnd I would just run out and I'm sure that we're [laughter] and they probably know what's wrong with her but I just couldn't do it\nSee sort of talk to us instead\nSo yeah I was comfortable around kids because you know I had kids in my family oh\nEvery time the subject of are hard times came up I hear a subtle hesitancy and Susan to it\nAt first I thought it was embarrassment but that wasn't exactly no\nYou know have punched the ah you know that you sort of bringing the remind the drama to come down and uh you know and have that you point just the uh the the towers for the ... you know [noise] and you forgot and this real estate unfair [noise] yeah [noise]\nI've forgotten\nWhat it was to um you know

not as much information grade such a brief sentence [laughter]\nNo it actually it was one of the great paradox is really ... I suppose that ah that it was great to do it cyber with amendments on stage where where are where you felt your age we just uh\nTowards the end you really feel yourself you know ... ...\nIt's like showing her up there I mean there's so much energy guy around\nUh you know if it's allowed to them on\n\nThe west had never seen you did this before\nOr is there must have been a part of it was felt so pleased that she could see it yes I I felt kind of like a\nYou know I've become this how the U.S and\nUm when I was over there and my life I've here seems to have a sort of hold my dream like substance and and of course as soon as I go back\n[laughter] the events in October in Japan and\nJust you know began to shoot and that sort of\nMindful of dream ... would\nYou\nI did three shows or two in a two in Tokyo and one in ...\nAnd all three just just great ... sold out in ... we set a club record for the largest attendance I thought\nIt was so packed we couldn't actually get on stage the only way out was over ... to sling myself over the orders and they carried me on the hands back through the crowd and generally deposited me at the stage don't be so this is your last game that was your last good yes\nAnd and it ended with the entire audience lifting you up and\nYou bodily ah out and gently depositing you out out of the\nClub at the well not out to the club but to the stage door yes well it was amazing\nI I don't think I've ever really been lifted by a mob of teenagers and people in their twenties um what what exactly is that like\nUm well\nIn ... I felt pretty good about it [laughter] I'm not sure how I Would have felt about it in London in Nineteen Seventy something whether scene was incredibly violent you know whenever you play your you're just as likely to get beaten up as you are to get paid\n\n\nDescribing it was like to come back after the ... it was hard for me to get motivates the game or to do my business off to the I'm off to the tool and [noise] it it just wasn't as thrilling as being on a stage in front of cheering well not many things a\nBit like sort of you know you know my my dad's generation you know off to sort of you know growing up as a kid you know being fired on an ... in in World War two and all that kind of stuff it was just kind of hard to getting getting it out for a for you know working at the shipping in the shipping industry again Mm\nMm shortly after I go back a\nSteve ... was in town and that is uh he's\nHe he he was the original producer\nAnd he was also my roommate at the time that that all the automatic stuff was going on uh and uh now he's you know incredibly successful us like you to take Matthews and\nAll that stuff you know and and anyway he was in town and he had some time and then so we hung out together for a couple of days in hunter was off um and a wife yes onto my my ah so um\nYou know we got to hang out and we talked a little about the old days and they told me you know big poll from from specs or a does catering in a you know ... and a nod Joe from the Mendez used in Australia and now and\nAh and Walter from the ...
