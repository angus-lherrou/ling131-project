Johnson out long before hers so there there was a a a platform that Kim car dashing was elevating\n[noise] so I think this is all very interesting and I'm going to let you finish\n[laughter] I Would feel let me see if\nI Would if they had one of the most viral political moments of all time this week\n[laughter] and that gives him applauds that awesome if that was that was great great thing to say that was like\nA little call back to the what two thousand nine be amazed when you're awesome\nYeah thank you so if you wouldn't have the two percent of people who are unfamiliar with the story let me just give you a quick recap uh on Sunday night Taylor Swift who has been famously apolitical posted a photo on her Instagram\nAnd she had a pretty political captured she more or less came out as being a Democrat thing she could not vote for someone who wouldn't necessarily fight\nFor all Americans and take into account people's race and gender or sexual orientation she also endorsed Phil Bredesen and the tendency Senate race that's the Democrat running and came out against the Republican Marsha Blackburn was incredibly notable because\nShe has been extraordinarily apolitical and a lot of people were wondering in the twenty sixteen election why she didn't chime in and you know and I have my own theories about you know do we really need singers are actors or sports stars to be political but\nPretty much like everybody else weight in I mean Katy Perry fiance everybody was like doing concerts for Hillary and Taylor Swift was silent I think a lot of people assume maybe she was a Republican evil\nAnd you know there's been some let's say series that after she posted this on Instagram she has over a hundred million followers on Instagram\nThat that there was some sort of upped taken voter registration you know we can debate whether or not that is entirely true or if registration always sees an uptick just a couple of days before the deadline but\nI mean look at the end of the day there is some indication that they're that a lot of young people were registering they let these last couple of days and and I believe that Taylor Swift who is noticeably been very quiet if you suddenly start seeing somebody who you are a big fan of post about it it might have made some people reconsider\nYeah I mean I'm sure she got some people to register I'm sure there are some young voters in Tennessee who maybe weren't paying attention to the race who now suddenly were but I mean ascribing any kind of real political power to a celebrity endorsement always makes me a little queasy and I you know kind of\nDon't necessarily think that there's a huge influence from that person and and sometimes they can really backfire frankly I mean\nI Know that brought us and braced this endorsement but at the same time her endorsement was kind of a pretty partisan endorsement you had to do with ... writes for example um I'm not so sure for someone like Brett is and that's the whole message that he wants to embrace because\nHe is running as a pretty nonpartisan guys a lot of people in Tennessee you don't even know Bredesen is a Democrat he was governor there and uh you know putting a celebrity or as a face of\nAs part of your campaign essentially you know that can be polarizing for a lot of people who may not have even realize that\nYou were a Democrat in the first place though I think\nFor younger voters eh LGBTQ rights is not really a partisan issue in the\nWay when I'm Talking about younger voters necessarily right I mean we're talking about Tennessee you know middle of the road a older voters the kinds of people who actually do vote in elections\nHey but there is some talk that younger people are showing enthusiasm levels that are not traditionally what we see in the mid term elections so they might surprise us all\nAll we can say is that there's some bad blood between Taylor and look at it as a navy Marsha Blackburn just wants to shake it off\nReally do it that that that was\nPretty mediocre but it's all I got four is less than New York everyone [laughter] I'm does\nThis whole thing with voted no\n[noise]\nOkay those were the things that we can't let go of we'll continue this conversation about Taylor Swift off line\nThis is the politics show from NPR and we're here every weekend with a special broadcast leading up to the mid term elections will be breaking down the major themes issues and races playing out this year and as the news keeps happening all week long you can keep up with our pod cast the NPR politics podcast\nTo get the inside scoop on the biggest political stories right as they happen I'm parakeets I covered the White House\n... though I also come in the White House ... political reporter I'm Dominican much in our political editor our show was produced by ...

Ohio that let us record on the condition that we not see their name on the air date people on this team only two teachers volunteered for the rest of the guidance counselor to custodians through administrators who run school one of them is the only woman on the team\nVicious pollock watched them doing this we used to so I'm explain how this work exactly okay so\nThe seven guns are locked in these small safe that have been installed in locations of at the school [noise] I saw the run a bunch of drills\nAnd then all of them the goal was to run to the near safe get the gun out of the safe and then get to where the shooter as as soon as possible and they time each drill\nOkay we're gonna play tape a decision to warn listeners they're allowed gunshots from blanks\nThat fire during his girls so the first little glitch they came to was that some of the team members actually had trouble\nThem five people died [noise] and the training of Douglas they address this exact thing if the fire alarm in a code\nRed happen to coincide ignore the fire alarm mind that the ...\nActually told her students the code red drilled Trump's all if you hear a fire alarm go off you stay put\nThe main question from students both Melissa and actually told me what if I'm In the bathroom and I hear gunshots what do we do then\nWe told them to run if you're out in the hallway and there's a code red you have to find a place to hide yourself so you either find a place to hide or you run and you keep running and you don't look back\nYou run you run as far away as you can end as fast as you can away from the sound\nAnd like Melissa actually been through this kind of training before out of school she taught before Douglas that school how to draw that really freaked Ashley out was very loud realistic sounds of gunfire actually says there were blanks the officer would walk around with blanks and they would shoot\nAt the door was open they'd go into the room and say you're all dead in here surprise drills with blanks well not the norm\nAppeal to some schools to say there are benefits to learning ... under pressure that surprise drills with blanks or controversial\nFor one thing they're disturbing there even been lawsuits about them\nAnd want to teach her claim she got pi TST after a man and a black lady came into her class when it a gun to her face fired and said you're dead\nThe teacher her to pop she smelt smoke she really thought she'd been shot she had no idea it was a trail I talked to several school safety experts about these drills with blanks surprise drills that are hyper realistic none of them thought there are a good idea [noise]\nOne guy who trains teachers using video simulations told me that teachers who've been through one of the surprise drills perform worse on his simulations\nAnd teachers who have no training at all\nThey forget crucial that like calling the police and commit more dangerous mistakes\nSometime in the blanks upsetting they can't even finish the simulation and there's a more basic problem the surprise drills\nIf you know when it's coming and if you're shots how can you tell if it's a drill the real thing [noise]\nIt's less actually and Melissa both thought this was kind of drill they'd have\nUnannounced for the fake shooter firing line\nActually told their students that's what they should expect\nOh yes one hundred percent I told them is that it can happen at any point in time so just be prepared that no matter what your classroom you're enter where you're at this could take\nPlace they said it was going to sound real and feel real I now have another faculty member who is that another high school and the district and they did the active shooter training at her school and they they used blanks they like it was it was simulated and it felt real and so that's why a lot of people were like\nIs this the drill is this not the drill but when you look at the time that it occurred\nThey don't run a drill it to twenty five in the afternoon Fifteen minutes before we dismiss and all these buses have to run kids all over the district\nWithout a question in your mind right away like it's too late for a drill\nYes which brings us to the day of the shooting at you twenty in the afternoon on Valentine's Day\nFormer student with an hour Fifteen began down the hallway of the first floor of the building that everyone calls the freshman\nAnd an adjacent building actually calling every class had just finished their shrimp can't be lab there are plaguing and cleaning up\nSo I'm standing next to my door pulling my door stop out I'm here to pops it was not rapid fire it was just like pop pop I'm not start off by it because I mean it Valentine's Day and you don't know if it's like a balloon popping or what and then the fire alarm went off very quickly\nAnd the fire alarm dusted off\nDust from acoustical tiles hit by a round of gunshots no one knew that at the time Melissa and a building farther out than actually didn't hear any pops just a fire alarm she went into action running natural the fire drill\nThe fire alarm goes off and I counted the kids as as they left the room as the last one to leave I close the door was already locked 'cause I leave it locked out the door with my phone my keys in my folder that are like the most important things my phone Mickey's ...\nHer emergency folder that's the training\nI went out the doors that security person who's posted outside my hallway she's there she's and I said oh what's going on because they have walkie talkies I don't the security personnel have I talked to she says I'm and set off a fire cracker and the twelve hundred building and I said OK and turned into other teachers and I told them and then as soon as I finish saying that to them she yelled out\nNo go back it's a code red go back at the code red and so we\nCall to the kids and I turned around and went back to my room which was right there opened up the door and kids start streaming in\nBut was this a real code red molested and now she knew a fire alarm could go off during a code red but the whole thing was confusing well it was\nWeird because we'd actually had a actual fire drill earlier in the day like like our plans scheduled monthly drill had occurred that morning so it was weird that it was going off again because\nThey don't do them in the last period of the day and so I knew it was something but I didn't think it was a serious something I thought it was like a the colon area was cooking with oil that day so who knows things is that oftentimes set up and fired for us we'll send them off if they burn something or whatever so\nOr other things that said oh well kids sometimes probably ... times kids will pull\nIt off sometimes there could be like a faulty that's why our system gets inspected all the time it just depends but most of the most is calling area because as the critical kill me but a lotta times it's calling area one time we went outside three times in one day because of the color and class three times\nYeah I mean we have three smoke detectors in my room so if you walk underneath it was a pot of boiling water you will set the fire alarm off that's kind of like the joke of our school\n\nTeachers that Douglas knew that code red Trump to fire drill they even had a plan for how to straighten that confusion out make an announcement clarify the code red\nOn that day and assistant principal Mr Porter did that was there an announcement on their wise but a lot of people are already out of the room so they didn't hear it\nIn ... actually heard the code red she's not sure about it but she's going through the motions she goes to her door to pull it shot and if she does\nTo always come running around the corner and they're they're just they looked terrified and they're screaming at shooter shooter\nShe calls them into our classroom tells them to get in the storage closet with her students but she's still thinking drill right there must be it must be for practice even seconds later when she hears\nPop up up up up up up up up and to me I'm like okay that's not what I experienced and the first real just because of the rapid session that was happening at the time I was like maybe they're they're up and their game on that\nIt's unclear how many teachers thought like Ashley and Melissa did that this was not a real code red but the promise code red drill and if this cost anyone their life I spoke to the Broward County chief of staff in charge of organizing the district safety upgrades were Douglas's he said he didn't know any teachers that Douglas\nCame out of that training expecting an unannounced drug blanks that age of fourteen teachers I spoke to said they were anticipating what Melissa and Ashley were a surprise active shooter ... using blanks\n[noise]\nAfter those two boys tour around the corner yelling at the shooter at the shooter actually stood for another second and our doorway still confused then she plans to her left all the way down the hall just set of open doors the face the freshman building\nI see like hundreds of kids running out of the freshman building flicking terrified you know when you see terrified kids running like that and it's\nThere they're not there there is no rhyme or reason it was chaos and then you hear that you can hear the gunshots and it's just it's that is not what the drill was\nYou know it was real [noise]\n[noise]\nFor like the next Ninety seconds as kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running don't stop\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building oh man I was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshots sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction\nWow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people in\nYes it was [laughter] yes it was and what happened\nThere were terrified people running and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that [noise]\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught\nYou can choose to follow the protocol and follow your instinct for some teachers that wasn't a choice at all [noise]\nMm Mm Mm Mm Mm [noise]\n... Robinson would produce or show\nComing up a couple of returns the worst thing that ever happened to them over and over again\nWhy in a minute and Chicago public radio when it program continues\nYou think you are to troll you think you have the final say but what if you discover that you're just living in someone else's world on the next step such [noise] real discovers he's really in charge snap judgment stores selling it to be [noise]\nDoing this afternoon it was eighty nine forty three [noise]\n[noise] your donation right now we've twice as vital because every gift to be matched dollar for dollar up to five hundred thousand he's before the midterm election to support balanced news and civil discourse and help us meet that challenge\nAnd now it keep you see the ... thanks DCCC supporters include political on the unconventional political convention poll we can Jeff debates panels and comedy with Kathy Griffin Michael ... and more October twenty and twenty first of yelling convention center tickets that political ... dot com\nJust American Life America last if you're going to regular course which is a theme bring a different kinds of stories on that theme today show before the next one and the mass shootings have become the new normal in our country we have stories of people preparing for the next one in various ways we've rented that two of our program to keep breathing\nSo there's a whole infrastructure that springs into action every time a mass shooting occurs there's Red Cross fire and police departments swat teams therapy dogs the Billy Graham prayer truck but then there's also a group of people who show up in the immediate aftermath for personal reasons\nTo the parents of kids who've died in other mass shootings\nWhere they do at these shootings is so simple and kind of amazing to hear producer Mickey make talk with two of these parents at a couple of names Sandia Ani Philips the daughter Jessie died when a gunman opened fire in a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado back in twenty twelve\nAnd ... and they have organize their lives to be able to reach out to other parents like themselves here's Mickey\nSandy ... Philips had traveled to eat mass shooting since Aurora it started with Sandy Hook and I live at stuff San Bernardino Orlando Las Vegas Sutherland Springs\nParkland end in Santa Fe Texas\nWhich is where I met up with them in may\nRight after a student walked into the high school and killed ten people they pulled up in front of the school and their truck even though they've done this a lot of us and he told me the discomfort and awkwardness they feel about showing up like the community has never gone away for this\nBut in Santa Fe they just lost themselves in any way\nFor each weighing the big button with a photo of their daughter Jessie smiling\nA memorial had just gone up on a big grassy lawn out front there were ten would crosses each with a red heart in a photo of the students per teacher who'd been killed people were starting to leave teddy bears flowers and balloons\nBut the Philips do here is just talk to whoever wants to talk they figure that'll lead them to families they might be useful to and within seconds of getting out of their trucks they bumped into a day's teenage girl wearing shorts in Santa Fe high school soccer T shirt\nStacy how are you doing not OK\nIn here to sound gets muffled because Sandy's tiny might get crushed when they hug\nIt's the main sound I remember from that day [noise]\nAre just so sorry this is happening to you and your friends and your family's in your community from one\nAnother girl a junior would light brown hair pulled back into a ponytail walks up to them and stares at\nTheir button [noise] we lost our daughter and I'm actually in six years ago\nThink she is inside and now she was just like your friends\nSandy is good at making people feel comfortable\nShe has around warm these brain by a grave odd that takes his maternal and keeps her comment was carrying briskly\nMoney stands right next to Sandy with his arm around her Sandy's the one who mostly talks to the kids here but he's always by her side listening intently his presence helps her do this he looks out for her sometimes when you had to start the AC in their ... before she climbs than Hi\nMy name's Tracey Hi you had a ... I was surprised how quickly people opened up to the Philips is Jesse Jesse the girl who suggested it was pretty she started telling them that she escaped the shooting by hiding behind a building with other students now she just wanted to stay at home but at home all she could think about what the shooting\nSeems from that day Capra planes had Sandy doesn't miss a beat here\nOver at the victims assistance they have trauma therapists over there I recommend strongly that any of you can really think\nAbout stopping by the victims assistance or do some trauma Sarah okay honey [noise]\nThe filters don't make money off to their volunteers and they're not wealthy either their retirees living in a two hundred and forty five square foot trailer surviving off of modesty beans and Social Security\nSandy sixty eight used to work in tourism for the city of San Antonio ... Seventy four he used to own some car lot\nLet them know\n... ... ...\nSo have you guys met one thing I quickly realized point to Santa Fe is that they are now so many of these mass shootings that they've become a grim reunion for all the people who show up to them as part of their jobs or volunteer work are you from Las Vegas\nSending money ran into an emergency responders or for the Las Vegas shooting and then bumped into this other guy who travels around clean up all those white crosses you see at almost every mass shooting anyone for their daughter Jessie in Aurora to ...\nBrown grass now the crosses money interrupted him to do this thing he and Sandy do a lot by one eleven they suddenly call at the time we\nHaven't water level to level Evan we're talking to your left five\nEleven eleven is a thing a lot of people see it as an auspicious sign for a time to make a wish and it was a lyric and when the Japanese favorite song\nOver get a lemon eleven twice a day we never really had a good day\nThey told me I Know it's silly but I take it as a hello regard week\nHello Miami in Denver what's your name is Cindy Cindy highs lawyer oh I'm so sorry for the day went on people kept dropping by the memorial in front of the high school parents and students to hold together staring at the crosses for writing messages on them you know it was quiet and hot and still\nThere was a low generator come from the gigantic Billy Graham ministry truck set up in the parking lot in this community and then all of a sudden this young guy started wailing Cindy me to be like\nFor him so he immediately threw his arms around her wasn't here here his pictures [laughter]\nIt's okay it's not okay it's not okay\nLet it go to Lydia Lydia go higher\n[noise] [laughter]\nOh God I'm so sorry for ...\nYeah two key honey you're doing it now okay\nHis name is Tom present ski he graduated last year there across the set up for three people he knew well one of them was a teacher named ms Perkins we really loved he said she always try to be strict with him the can never keep them that front for very long\n... nice to ... he can nice the rats [laughter] okay [laughter] okay [laughter]\nBreeze with me [laughter]\n\nAfter a few minutes he's kind of breath enough to talk he tell Sandy he wants to shootings to stop so he wants to take action somehow\nAnd then tried suddenly switches gears and start filling out his feelings about guns and gun control\nYou know the virus is going on in this world [noise] taking drugs is not going to change that because the strip or your drug stores are still able to get\nHe plans to get a concealed handgun license when he turns Twenty one later this year develop those are actually gun owners to have a twelve gauge shotgun they believe in the second amendment but they're also advocates\nFor universal background checks and tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and accessories like bump stocks person could buy however Sandy says they don't push their political beliefs on survivors when they're doing outreach\nTheir primary goal is to support but it's impossible for grieving parents to avoid the politics around guns there's a whole movement of conspiracy theorists who believe that the U. S. government stages mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones at our daughter never existed Alex Jones of course\nIs famous for saying that mass shootings or bake he's now a defendant in several defamation lawsuit when the Philips has ran into him face to face at a gun control of that he accused them of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life and your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and then I'm listening to him just going you are so absolutely crazy", "show_name": "This American Life", "year": "2018", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "13"}
