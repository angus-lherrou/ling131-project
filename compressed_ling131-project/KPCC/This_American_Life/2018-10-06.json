{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "The junior senator fought in Texas groups early on one of his you know his strongest speaking points was with what I think about immigration I can sum up and forwards legal good illegal bad\nWell Republicans really think this is going to work with their base voters the question is is this an important enough issue that it's going to make a difference with voters that they need to get they can't just when these races with their base alone\nThis is politics you from NPR I'm Scott Detrow my co host ... is talking to NPR's John Burnett and Mara Liasson about immigration and how big of a role it's going to play in the midterms\nMy isn't there the argument to be made I was speaking with Whit Ayres Jewish people or some months ago about this issue of immigration and he made the argument that the terms are different right these battles are going to be fought in sort of swing suburban districts\nYes it it plays differently in different races\nBut then of course you have the the unexpected effect or perhaps of\nSo let's say you follow through with this and all these immigration enforcement policies continue and there are fewer and fewer undocumented immigrants in the country to do the jobs that they have a hard time hiring Americans to do so now we have contractors in Houston we have growers in\nUh Southern California and they're all screaming for workers because they cannot get enough people to do the work and this is also you know a lot of the constituency of the G O P and\nThis labor shortage for these really tough jobs is is coming\nAnd it's only going to get worse\nIt's really hard to have these conversations about immigrants for not talking about turnout among those Latino voters an Asian American voters who've historically had some of the the worst voter turnout is not just in general elections but in mid term elections and\nI was just looking at some data from the NBC News Wall Street journal most recent poll they looked at enthusiasm essential your interest in the midterms and let you know when you're at the bottom of all demographic groups right I mean I think they were slightly above young voters and whatnot but the but the enthusiasm isn't there\nYet to me this is one of the biggest mysteries of the twenty Eighteen election cycle you had this huge burst of activism among the DACA kids they were fearless they were potentially open to deportation if their DACA protections were stripped away but they were going out in public\nThey were leading protests they were inspiring to a lot of Hispanics who weren't who were perfectly legal but generally didn't want to get involved but you still see this\nLack of increased registration levels among Hispanic voters why the Democratic party hasn't made a bigger push or why would ever push they have made it hasn't had more success if Hispanic voters can't get energized in the Trump era I don't know when they ever would\nBe there's a young woman I met in Las Vegas a she's a college student her name is Norma ... and I talk to her about voting and and what she thinks about President Trump\nYou know with President Trump I personally felt attacked because he had stuff to say about Mexicans and on and so that kind of play a very bad taste in my mouth\nSo I asked you know did you vote twenty sixteen nope she didn't go and I asked him do you intend to vote in the midterms probably not\nAnd you just happened to pick somebody to interview who was a member of the two demographic groups that turn out the least young people and Hispanics and this is a year where we're going to test the theory that there are a lot of reasons for young people\nEspecially round all those school shootings to turn out there are a lot of reasons for Hispanics to be energized and turn out and now we're going to find out if they actually do\nThat with my co host off Mulholland and NPR's Mara Liasson and John Burnett with his politics shell from NPR I'm Scott Detrow\n\nAnd this is a part of the show where we talk about the things political or otherwise that we just can't let go\nInto nearby NPR's Ayesha Rascoe and Danielle Kurtzleben hey guys\nHello hey OK throughout all the news that have happened the last week this one thing has kept me sane and I've gone back to it in my mind over and over again I'm going to start

our lives\nI miss it I didn't appreciate what a good thing it was when we had it I don't know about\nYou but me I spent a full week obsessively reading about judge Kavanaugh and watching videos on line and calling people to discuss it and I know this is just daily life and are totally to buy the country these days but can I say for me again for me of all the moments we've had these last few years\nWhere red America and blue America look at the exact same about income to radically different conclusions\nAnd to me this one feels the worst of all I think because the original hearing itself a duck to forward and judge Kavanaugh the testimony was just so wow like it was so many hours and then both witnesses were so emotionally wrong\nThat even watching it was a motion was upsetting\nAnd then since that hearing we've had this week of waiting\nFor the FBI report which held us off or a week in that same state vegetation and disbelief Republican disbelieve the Democrats Democrats just believe that the Republicans\nWasn't the base with what I was and when I got over there and saw the\nThe food fight just reception of yesterday we can or can't do this [noise] you know I Know this is being viewed people see this rush to judgment\nAs Republicans through and and look at the facts and just try to get this done as quickly as possible and that's not good so good long term does the institution is just horrible [noise]\n\nPreserving the integrity of the process on the Senate Judiciary committee is much less romantic story than the one about two survivors of sexual assault changing in senators' minds at the last second\nThat's what happened though\nAnd finally that day the world sees Jeff Flake find a third way something he's been looking for for a long time and a lot of issues we the boat with his Republican colleagues would stand for\nCertain principles but the Democrat is the weirdest nice neither weirdo right now ghost Republican he doesn't really have the constituency he's speaking\nFor being anti Trump broke his policies he's retiring from the Senate and a few months and he says\nHe could never have done something like this if you were still running for office there is no value to reaching across the aisle he says there's no currency for that any more you do that you'll lose so there's not much crossing over to the other side ever by anybody which is maybe why when you do cross over this is what happened\nWell real\nThis is the consequence New York city loves Senator Jeff flake I Know because the day after the committee vote and picked him up at Penn Station and got him a taxi\nBut I also called the ... yeah\nDon't know if that's the thing you're doing\nNew Capitol police protection new staff\nJust me and a lot of new Jeff Flake fans\nEnded up taking pictures for them\n\nI'm In Central Park west [noise]\nI don't know I was so starved for any sign\nI'm going to go ahead and say bipartisan in New York means you agree with the Democrats\nThis is all happening because on my way back to New York from Washington on Saturday I ran into Chris Coons on Amtrak he told me fleet was on the seller right behind us that we can invited himself\nAlong with Coons to the global citizen concert at the great lawn in Central Park broadcast live on MSNBC can't think of a blue or place to be honest more on the news location for the hash tag

Know where everything is but I don't and then we're running across the eighty sixth street trends were\nWe had to a little trailer backstage to meet up with Chris Coons outside tens of thousands of people are already out on the line [noise] these two senators are going to deliver a short impromptu speech about bipartisanship to this crowd\nHassle I won't say cruise companies perform for them is performing after\nCrazy [noise] ...\nWhat is after yeah you guys are the opening act for Carty be enough you know crazy [noise]\nThis is where flakes reaching across the aisle gesture gets ethical surreal and it's hard to top how surreal the weakest dinner ready\nAll these ... these people keep popping into the trailer what'd you say you're a\nI was just so funny that as a people do is to\nRobert De Niro who steps to flake with a finger in states like a scene from good fellas we rely\nToo much just goes down with this guy he's got to go\nAs I Know it's because they didn't want the

moment to sit down\nWith your legs [laughter] a sense of it is and I was well I mean you know it's not something you know this is the\nBoss is different than you know in a conference on Social Security reform or a sign that you know it's not far from\nSo it's not like having people like Robert De Niro and John Legend like you're a hero to for a week long it will it'll last a week to my next votes for Kevin our for something that a luxury that I'm all for I guess\nYou enjoy it for a week do you think they know you're still a Republican\nI'm you know I I think\nIs right away I Can't wait [laughter]\nDefinitely set or a few years he'd them on the right he keeps disappointing the lab is good for wants to\nDo like it [laughter]\nOh yeah every politician does that mean\nWe like politicians would we feed on it [noise]\nI mean that's\nThe way we admitted it off [noise]\nAnd then it happened just like he predicted\nAfter seven days of being treated as a Democrat\nOr at least a Republican defector fleet comes home to the GOP\nOn Thursday the FBI releases the report that he called for an friday week announced his decision he's a yes on Kavanaugh I reached Chris Coons that afternoon\nIt looked Jeff and I both went to the same place and read the same report 'em and you know I appreciate his friendship we are we are viewing this through a different lens a Jeff as a conservative senator he has always wanted a conservative on the Supreme Court I Am not and I don't\nWho's thought the FBI report was a disgrace to basically they didn't follow up on any leads the said was not the investigation he'd asked for last week he was mad frustrated kept going off the record and raging you would not tell me about his conversations with Jeff Flake after they both read the FBI report\nI'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticized him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is not appropriate here\nAs soon as late voted friday he fled the capital I talk to them in the car\n[noise] people are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes he said why did you vote yes I Am and presumption of innocence he told me over and over he was satisfied that the FBI report [noise]\nDo you feel better now you're kind of back among your people you had kind of a week with them you know the Democrats celebrating you'd be you're kind of back among among your people\n... people [laughter] that's a terrible bam chocolate chip are only about a party\nThere is no bipartisan right now there is no aisle to stand in the middle of the quote a film that Robert Deniro was not in the kind of don't ever take sides with anyone against the family\nEver\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nVery chase ... program which are not it is a recording that we found a Justice Anthony Kennedy Kennedy of course has the retiring judge who see Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for the swing vote on the Supreme Court for years the him being questioned into cue in a back in twenty ten\nAnd then they shot a multiple times\nStory's trial lasted two weeks and would have felt familiar to anyone who watches TV courtroom\nDramas and there were lawyers with big binders full of ballistics report and medical examinations character witnesses recalled and disturbing photographs of the victims body were shown the only thing missing was any suspense about the verdict\nThere was no doubt that he was guilty of murder and robbery and and so really as a jury or we have to worry about ... cents on\nThe jury to decide between life imprisonment or the death penalty is seeing the victim's family knew what they wanted\nThey should go without saying the prosecutor announced this fan than the other jurors that all the Jonas his family and everyone who loved and believed the death penalty is appropriated\nThe prosecutor asked the jurors to sentence Paul story to death instruction stated that for the death penalty to be imposed the jurors must judge three things to be true that Paul story was guilty\nThat there are no mitigating circumstances like say mental illness or provocation and lastly the story posed a future threat to his community\nWas the one I had an issue with\nI seriously doubt it that he would be a continuing threat to the prison in the\n... ... what what was it about a pause story that made you feel like you just didn't necessarily see him as a continued threat\nUm a couple of things uh his testimony\nThe young man's fence or in the courtroom that appeared confused in over his head and remorseful this was his first offense and some of the evidence suggested that it was stories accomplice who'd been the mastermind behind the horrible crime as well as the one who\nFired first on it so then was certain that Paul story should be punished or they didn't think it should be put to death but [noise] I'm\nIn the dirt chambers there was a\nVery different feel\nEveryone else was in favor of the death penalty so faced with you know almost a dozen other people who already felt strongly I\nDidn't think I could convince anyone to a of of what I was thinking I was I was I'll be honest I'm scared\nAt twenty seven then was the youngest your by several years and he was the kind of guy who avoided speaking up at all costs\nAt home his neighbor parked in space to let it go at the office if the boss told them to do something even if you disagreed he did it without question\nIn other words even though we've been looking forward to being a juror when he found himself in the jury room spend wasn't exactly Henry Fonda and twelve angry men the way he understood the jurors had to reach a unanimous decision and the idea of swaying eleven strangers over to his way of thinking seemed impossible [noise]\nHe was also afraid that if he opposed the group it would result in a hung jury in a mistrial they'd have to start the whole process over again with a new theory everyone would be mad at him just fence had nothing\nAn hour and a half later Paul story was sentenced to death by lethal injection\nIt was hard to look at him during the sentencing\nUm we [noise] we sat waiting for the judge to ask us you know what's the sentencing\nAnd everyone was really tense and the woman next to me and others are uh begin crying she's trying to hide it you know and I gave her my handkerchief and she just hopes [noise]\nIn the form unannounced the verdict [noise] and I think his mother cried out they had an accident for us to go through after because of their things and we were out of the courtroom fast\nIt felt like a mistake right away then went over to his parent's\nHouse where you had dinner and drink scotch with his dad he told his family about the trial and then he went home where you had more to drink before bed\nAnd then that was not than it was over and uh [laughter] and I went went on with my life or at least he tried to but what do you do with with these feelings\nUm I've I've I was just stuck you know it was done was cast in stone and um yeah no I felt terrible I felt massive amounts regret I felt [noise] I've I've you know I I felt guilty or you know sending someone\nOr to the fro\nWhen you think about the people that a trial affects you think of the victims and their loved ones and do you think of the accused their families and what they're going through you don't usually think about what it\nDoes to the jurors but for span the trial wasn't something he could put behind them at the crack of the gas all [noise]\nIn the days and weeks after the verdict he read every article about the case he could find\nThe more shame he felt so eventually he just stopped I realized it wasn't really healthy at a time span was a regular drinker\nAnd it only got worse after the trial I got a lot worse after the trial\nHe was drinking more beginning as soon as he got home from work and spending more days hung over his wife didn't understand what was going on\nIt may have contributed to my divorce which was the phone you're\nA year after the trial and spends life changed the new house with a hammock in the flagpole was sold and then moved out of Texas\n\nSen settled in Olympia, Washington started life over you found in an apartment for himself and his cat Nico but he couldn't shake his memories of the trial he tried to escape to alcohol but it didn't free him from a shame sometimes after a night out drinking you return to a Facebook page Paul stories mother had made for her son\nOne mother had already lost her son and now because fan had been too afraid to speak up another mother was going to as well\nI'm not trying to excuses crime it was terrible but\nTo send the guy that does not just the the presents and your mind the uh for for current thoughts about it cannot go away\nFor all the bad rapid gets shame offers a certain safety it provides a comfortable who'll to hide in the way from the judgment of others\nBut it can also lead to isolation and inertia and for eight years eight years in which Paul story sat on death row awaiting an execution date send barely talked about the trial with anybody\nBut then in two thousand sixteen year after\n... stories federal appeal it been denied\nA reporter writing a series of articles about the judicial system approach than about his experiences that your [noise]\nThan was tired of being alone with his regrets and so for the first time he opened up about his feelings [noise]\nI felt guilty you told a reporter and sad\nAnd a little helpless [noise]\nI don't think I made the right call [noise] Bennett hope they're talking about the trial might help and it did\nUp until the article was published\nThat was when ... received an uncomfortable phone call from\nA lawyer who read the article [noise]\nFearing his co workers made over here he took\nThe call outside behind his office building [noise]\nIt was there that he learned that eight years earlier he misunderstood a key part of the jury instructions\nI sought incorrectly essentially I Believe I Would have to convince\nEveryone to choose life imprisonment when\nIn fact all I have to do\nWas declined the death penalty and that's all it would've taken\nPreventing the death sentence only required one dissenting vote votes fan could have cast so they would have been known this trial no hung jury and instead of the death penalty Paul story would have gotten a life in prison without parole\nAnd that would that would have been nice to know\nI could have changed\nWho let them live [noise]\nAfter the article was published something else happened something spend\nNever expected or wanted\nPaul stories mother Marilyn got in touch\nShe reached out with an email filled with sentiments of forgiveness she had given me hands

didn't make sense why would Maryland want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive themselves for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that and like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match her message how do you mean\nWell I I wasn't sure how to reply with something as powerful as a a ... ... it just
