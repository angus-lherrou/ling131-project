had hackers try to break into the system well the testers were able to take over these systems completely\nJust guessing half in one case it was as simple as guessing a password and nine seconds the bottom line they found that an entire generation of Pentagon weapon seems to have been developed without cyber security in mind\nFor the test will be a wakeup call these one point six six trillion

with wired magazine thanks Emily thank you\nIn Indonesia thousands of people are still missing two weeks after a devastating earthquake and tsunami hit silly way the island\nAt least two thousand people died and many more were displaced and getting water food and medical supplies to affected areas is still a big challenge so what the Indonesian government announced this week may come as a surprise you said that only Indonesian aid workers can help out in the hardest hit areas\nForeign aid workers have to get approval from the government first and work with local groups the policy has people like ... ... worried she's with the Jakarta office of Catholic Relief services\nI feel like my hands are tied I tied up because agency like the IRS and we have limited number of stuff because you know\nA sometime to program in the country it's quite big sometimes you know quite small so the ... bought from ...\nIt's nice to have really accelerates a speed up our capacity to respond\nWe're going to take a step back now and check in with Jonathan Katz he was a pie reporter in twenty ten when a huge earthquake hit Haiti he later wrote a book some titled how the world came to save Haiti and left behind a disaster we wanted to get his take on the response to the current crisis in Indonesia\nTo get us started Jonathan why would Indonesia not want the services a foreign aid workers at the time like this it seems counter intuitive\nYeah I mean if you follow foreign aid a lot it actually makes a lot more sense there's been a lot of talk about the need to have countries lead their own recovery and try to cut down on basically foreigners coming in and invading and and taking over everything themselves\nThe Indonesian government is kind of doing what people have been hoping that national governments would do but of course it sometimes shakes out a little differently on the ground when your group is the one who's being told to stand down\nYeah I mean we we were talking to someone from Catholic Relief services on her concern and others is that\nIt's great to have a nation to itself but particularly in these early days when you're trying to rescue people you're you're trying to give immediate support aren't you missing an opportunity to have people with the right skills in quickly to help\nSome of these things actually don't work the way that people who are sitting outside of the disaster zone imagined that they might search and rescue is actually a really good example on Haiti's of course the example I Know best because I Lived through it about the disaster where between a hundred thousand three hundred and sixteen thousand people were killed\nThere were something on the order of about three million people who were in the disaster zone and the highest number that I was ever able to find for the number of Haitians were rescued by those international rescuers was two hundred and eleven I met a lot of the estimates are lower than that the vast majority of people thousands and thousands of people\nWere rescued by their friends their neighbors other people who are around\nAnd in Indonesia which is a country that has stronger institutions in Haiti does it would make sense that Indonesian rescuers will probably be already there and already better position to do some of those rescues to rescue is actually maybe one of the better examples of a place where foreigners are not as useful as they like to\nIn what cases are foreigners more useful\nHonestly that the system is a mess and the disaster response system internationally is kind of a disaster itself\nBut it is really interesting example\nIf you were told me kind of like a blind item that there is a country of is trying to crack down on or regulate foreigners after a recent disaster gave me like two guesses I think in the news will probably would have been one of the to the reason for that because back in two thousand four you remember the the opposite I was just\nAbout to ask you about that 'cause I wondered if the same policy was in place then\nYeah I mean it was a slightly different set up by what happened and that was really interesting was Indonesia\nReally tried to take over the response itself part of what happened was the initial response was a bit chaotic\nUm is the one of the things that the Indonesian government said at the time was they set up a a reconstruction rehabilitation commission and\nIt really became a model for much of the rest of the world on how a national government can take over an aid effort force outside NGOs aid groups to register with them\nAnd direct resources where they need to be taking money in themselves and govern how that money goes back out\nAnd it certainly wasn't perfect but it was a while he praised effort\nIt's interesting to hear you because when you're sitting in you know here place like Boston or New York or anywhere in the U. S. and you're hearing about some massive disaster in some faraway country that you don't know a lot about but you think might be kind of poor\nThe emotional response is sort of well wait you know wait you're ... you're not treating your people well and and that's not right I mean how do you counter that feeling that somehow that that people are being short changed\nI Know where people are coming from I feel the same way but what I learned when I was living through these disasters and especially the the experience in Haiti is that to be perfectly honest is not about us and it's much more important that\nPeople who actually live in these places where the survivors themselves who's societies and cultures these are are taking the lead in their own rescue and their own recovery\nAnd people are kind of scrambling and part of the scrambling is trying to figure out who's in charge and who has the power and that's something that the people who aren't experience will disaster might think is is kind of crafts or beside the point to something that should be dealt with later but we see in disaster after disaster that you have to deal with it right at the very beginning\nMy last question is you know you wrote a whole book about the whole Haiti experience and and the role of foreign aid what were your biggest takeaways from that experience what are the lessons learned and to what degree are they being applied now\nI think the biggest thing is that I think there was a sense from a lot of people in the world that\nHaitians were bystanders in their own disaster and actually being there\nAnd seeing the way that people came together and then ultimately took charge of their own rebuilding and their own reconstruction really showed me the way in which that completely backwards the best thing that foreigners can do is assist people in their own efforts and they kind of get out of the way\nAnd I think one of the most important things that we can do is respect that and try to help without making our own savior complex the big story\nJonathan Katz is the author of the big truck that went by how the world came to save Haiti and left behind a disaster\nHe's currently a fellow at the New America foundation thanks a lot Jonathan thank you\n[laughter]\n[noise] this is the world [noise] [noise]\nThe market plunges and President Trump signed the targets sibling\nI think the fed is far too stringent and they're making a mistake that rice said it's despite that we're doing very well\nI Know that change will talk to a former fed official about what the president's attacks me for the institution I'm an ex all things considered from NPR News we dated for money be nine point three K PCC\nKatie sci fi supporters include kids face children's museum in Pasadena visitors can celebrate the season at the twenty fourth annual kids face pumpkin festival on Saturday October twenty seven and Sunday October twenty eight with carnival gains phone\nCrafts picnic treats face painting pony rides like music a petting zoo and more admission to the festival is open to long the twenty fourth annual ... festival a kid's face offers activities for the whole family for more information you can visit kids face museum dot org\nI'm Carol hills with the world that new trade agreement that the U.S Mexico and Canada recently agreed on well it covers a wide range of issues but if you listen to President Trump you might think it all boils down to one thing dairy products from Canada\nSandy and says most people on the force have been affected by suicide in some way according to the city more than a hundred and fifty people have jumped from the bridge since it was built in Nineteen Thirteen\nUh twenty thousand dollar reward is being offered for information leading to interest in the shooting of a college basketball player\nChicago native said ivy moved here to play for east LA college LA county sheriff the IV was shot and killed inside a car you were as Monterey park apartment complex in twenty sixteen he died on his twentieth birthday his mother ...

World Service P. R. I. N. W. GBH in Boston\nOn American evangelical pastor walked free from a courthouse in Turkey today\nAndrew Brunson was found guilty of charges including terrorism and was sentenced to more than three years in prison but he was released in lieu of time served and for good behavior the case had been a huge strain on relations between turkey and the U.S journalists free but now is in Istanbul free but who is Andrew Brunson\nAndrew Brunson is an evangelical missionary who'd lived here for two decades and he was living in a coastal city called is near and very active in the refugee community as well as the Kurdish community\nAnd he was found guilty and sentenced but what were his alleged crimes\nThe alleged crimes were aiding and abetting a terrorist group converting PKK members who are seen as terrorists here in Turkey and by the United states which allows them to seek asylum as Christians were being persecuted these were some of the accusations against him\nSo this will be accusations but what heavy actually done what would it be literally do that brought these turtles\n[noise] well it seems like they were messages that the Turkish government intercepted that sided with the opposition he was meeting with members of American military members that injured like air base in Turkey\nAnd it seemed to to the Turks this seemed somewhat suspicious but he was a valued member of the American community here and he was a bargaining chip\nAnd of course this all happened um after the attempted coup so there was an atmosphere of a real crackdown isn't that right\nYes yes there are hundreds of thousands who were arrested after the coup there was a purge and he was part of that purge the ... that could happen in July two thousand sixteen and he was arrested in October two thousand\nSo why was the release now\nWell I think they're released would have happened\nAnd a couple of months ago and they weren't negotiation and play that fell through between President Trump and president ... they were discussing several other kings between turkey and the United states and that included\nUm hawk thank investigation of Turkish bank that was accused of violating sanctions against Iran\nIn in that investigation turkey was asking for a few more things they were negotiating like they do in the middle east there was haggling involved and President Trump last patient\nAnd said no we're not gonna give you any more and you have to release runs in now and this sort of made aired\nOn feel humiliated at this point he said no we're not going to release Brian then it was tit for tat you're going to respect our judicial process which ah this was the trial that came to be but there were negotiations still ongoing from what I understand\nMost everyone here that in the diplomatic circle was expecting a relief\nI understand that the Washington a accuses anchor of holding roughly twenty Turkish Americans and three Turkish employees um of of the American consular mission and turkey any any movement on their cases\nNow because they're Turkish I think ... and had\nBack in the U.S by the ... which is a very important constituency of vice president Mike Pence and President Trump that's why he became\nThe main sticking point or the most important prisoner American prisoner held in Turkey there's also a NASA engineer a Turkish American that Congo gay and he hasn't gotten half of the attention that Andrew Brunson did and he's still in prison\nI understand actually the secretary of state Mike Pompeo belongs to the same denomination of the evangelical Presbyterian Church that uh that burn some of that that's true now what happens to us sanctions or they were announced in August to try to to force turkey to release Brunson or they are they not going to be lifted\nWell that's what they expected at this point I'm the section ... because he was not being really I'm In fact he was put under house arrest so they ... didn't make you know one concession they took him from a prison put them under house arrest in August\nNow the expectation is that the sanctions will be lifted the Turkish lira will stabilize what degree what I've seen on Twitter from\nTurkish reaction is that they're excited that their economy will get better and this was a good move by the Turkish president to release Bronx that\nTurkey has been his home for the past twenty three years is he going to stay or move back to the U.S\n[noise] he's on his way from what I understand to Germany and then the United states is being a U.S actually deported as soon as he was freed and\nThat's the protocol promotes foreigners who were arrested they may spend some time in prison eventually they are deported and not allowed to return to get\nJournalists free but now in Istanbul excellent thanks a lot Carol\n[noise]\nA NASA astronaut and a Russian ... are safely back on the ground after being forced to make a dramatic emergency landing yesterday\nThe Russians so he was rocket carrying them experienced an unknown failure during lunch and the Kagan Alexi ... chin and landed safely in Kazakhstan lessen our leader the cause of the aborted launch is being looked into and there are concerns about how the incident may affect operations on the international space station\nLauren ... is a reporter for the verge she covers space learn walk us through what happened yesterday after the Soyuz rocket launch\nSo everything started off completely normal they took off from the buccaneer cosmic drown in Kazakhstan at four forty am eastern time and then about two and a half minutes into flight we got indication that\nSomething had gone wrong with the booster and if you're watching a live stream you could see that they were joking about kind of violently and there was some kind of break up in flight and that\nInitiated the emergency abort sequence\nAnd the capsule that they were writing on performed what's known as a ballistic re entry and that's when you come in and much steeper angle when you land on earth so I think they experienced nearly seven jeeze which is seven times earth gravity so pretty intense flight um but they landed safely and they were able to be reunited with their families and\nUltimately it was a good and happy ending\nSo how high were they when they had to start their land and\nI Believe there are about thirty miles up so they weren't quite and space yet but they were almost there the astronaut noted that they experienced a moment of weightlessness what you're not supposed to be feeling at that\nOf the flight and I think that had to deal with the fact that there were no longer with the booster and then at that point they start spinning and the goal is to a grand jury and then they're parachutes deployed to slow them down to that they could land safely\nThey're not spending as they're racing to the earth or\nYeah they are a God\nI've done what is now as a parabolic flight that's when you feel weightlessness for a moment in time and during the ... experience extra D's and it feels like something is pressing down on you like a ...\nI didn't experience nearly the level that they did but just imagine kind of feeling like you're pressed up against something you're ill so much heavier that's what they were feeling and it can be pretty intense\nAre there any new details about what might have caused this problem I don't know if\nThey've traced the exact origin but I Believe something happened during the stage separation so when rockets launched pieces of hardware shed a way to save on weight and the Soyuz has four main boosters around the center core and they were supposed to break away but\nRussia things that maybe there was some contact between one of the boosters and us in our core we're when really they are supposed to separate completely just won the sixty ... of this particular sway as rocket though it's been around for decades [laughter] I don't know if they know what caused that contact\nBut I think that's the leading theory at the moment", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "year": "2018", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "12"}
