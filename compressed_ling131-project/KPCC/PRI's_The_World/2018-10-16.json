countries and lead to violence and depression like a million more\nWe've heard a lot about Facebook's problems are reasonably like how fake news hate speech all sorts of problematic content went unchecked on the platform for years and how those pose for part of a coordinated campaign\nIt was a campaign meant to stoke already existing divisions in the country mostly against the real ... ethnic minority well we didn't know was who exactly was behind it all we do now an investigation by the New York times is pointing to me and Mars own military\nReporter Paul Moser says military was the main player behind the propaganda efforts on Facebook\nYou know twenty twelve twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen there was kind of this exploratory effort in and you know there was maybe ten or twenty thirty people\nPosted to do this but then as the powers to network became clear you know kind of from twenty four keen on words the military started during a lot more resources um so in recent years you had hundreds of military officers\nAre on it and these people worked in shifts they opened up thousands and thousands of total accounts it would use them to attack\nPeople would act the military they would use them to got to spew hate speech duties and even just just to provoke\nA adults in the comments so you know they would take both sides of the site started site and then move away as other people joined in sort of squabbling and then they also these really big fake accounts that they could use as propaganda outlets so ah you know pop star fan pages or\nBeauty queen and ages or make sort of fake news stages they would use those to spread rumors and ... and one of the sort of\nMost pernicious examples of this uh came last year on the anniversary of nine eleven basically there were two messages going around one was spread some Muslim communities and said Buddhist we're going to attack them and the other was prejudiced communities and said Muslims or go to wage jihad as attacks\nAgainst the so you have to take messages going out against the two major groups basically spring fear and the entire country you know at least the main areas you ain't got in Mandalay came to a standstill out of fear and what we found was that that was actually planted by the military and the idea was to create a kind of sense of insecurity and a feeling that there's the need to have\nThe military to have that security\nWhen we talk about the the Burmese military here uh taking on this campaign are we talking about extreme is kind of fringe elements within the military doing an ad hoc kind of thing or was it really\nOrganize from a top down\nYeah no this is very intentional and very well organized I mean there's three different groups in particular within the military that were responsible for this so this was extremely intentional this was run the way you would run to a military operation or campaign this was not some kind of you know group of people in a room that nobody else knew about this this was a sort of intentional\nThing that has been going on for a long time\nIt starts to sound a lot like the Kremlin's Internet research agency\nRight exactly and we're you know we were looking for links to that and and ... ... nailed those links but there is a Russian connection there the Myanmar military has had ties to Russia for a long time but I'm In the early to thousands that it's a little bit out of here from what\nPeople told us for being too reliant on China they started sending a lot of soldiers to Russia to study and they would study medicine they would study computers it would also studies psychological warfare and hacking\nAnd then they bring those lessons back so as this relates to Facebook we did learn how to manipulate Facebook ...\nWhat was more important actually was was less kind of the ins and outs of setting up troll accounts and things like that because just about you know you can figure that out you know how to use Facebook important part was kind of understanding the actual psychological warfare itself out to create compelling fake news and in in you know means that would get people's attention\nSo when fake news was kind of a new thing on the Internet a means of flying around Facebook didn't do much said what about once the military had their own campaign of fake news what did Facebook do to stop it\nRight so for a long time they didn't do anything um and there wasn't enough resources directed at him or to even understand that there was this big intentional campaign going on for years they basically in military waged at propaganda war with no actual opponent now over the past\nUm six or seven months starting at the beginning of this year Facebook started doing an investigation into this in may they found some pretty\nSolid links between the military and some of these campaigns and so at that point some of them came down but there were still a lot more out there and so you know as we were investigating we found\nThat ah you know for instance is entertainment links to the Raleigh said pop star pages that were being used by the military so once we sort of showed Facebook that they'd get some of their research and found sure enough that that was connected as well so I think it's one of these things where they they started to unravel it but like they are still you know if you keep\nYou can always find new strands because there's so much activity out there and so they're still investigation is ongoing\nWhat has been the biggest challenge for Facebook tackling fake news and man or\nA lot of it has to do with two things basically language and the cultural context you have to be able to hire people who can\nRead all these posts and understand the cultural context they're coming from a lot of people complain that the people that Facebook is hired some times haven't lived in Myanmar for a decade so they may not be sort of up\nTo date on the news means or the newest references and so they might miss some of the stuff that I think you know at this point they have they think about Seventy people\nDoing content used they're going to up to a hundred the question is you know when you're Eighteen million people doing this in a in a military campaign with hundreds of people you know how many people do you need to kind of personally review all this stuff and and at the answers a lot more than a hundred I think\nI mean it is really kind of extraordinary the story that you've got a government weaponized ... social media against its own people are are there any examples of governments anywhere else in the world that are doing this\nSo ... is a pretty galling example um I'm not really aware of that having been done anywhere else um\nAnd you know a lot of it comes back to the legacy of of the Myanmar military ... you know ... a very complex country but it's worth remembering that the most powerful political organization and Myanmar remains the military and it you know technically gave a power and and kind of\nBrought up this you know allowed for this democracy to happen but but it's still sits behind in the shadows and still the most powerful actor\nIn the country and so this is one of the ways that it's tried to kind of wheeled that power from the shadows to make sure it remains relevancy even as you know democracy starts to kind of you know take route and an end to come out saying in the country\nCongress as you know it's been a pressing a Silicon Valley to clamp down on this stuff by kind of tightening up their own systems making them more rigorous but are you also seeing evidence that Washington is not pressing these governments like ... the me andme our government to stop this kind of online campaign as hard as it could\nCertainly I I think it's the kind of thing that now that it's out there a government do need to push back harder and certainly we've seen US government you know in the Trump Administration to be somewhat flip about about the social media campaigns that the Russians have done and you know we see that playbook now spreading pretty quickly um and so I think\nIt's worth having governments do more in stand up more because also it's negligent ... because it's been to some degree it is hard to put\nAll of the onus on a on a company or you know if you're on corporate actor\nThey're dealing with the men were military and their Seventy years of propaganda history insane Man March in China\nThere talking to the Chinese Communist party and try and we'll deal to get in there than in Vietnam they're dealing with another\nCloistered secretive government it's throwing a new law them I mean basically if you want if you're Facebooking you have to manage this problem you basically need your own State Department and you need to start basically looking like a government so I Do think it's important that governments come out here and give some cover and gives some protection to these these companies because the problems are facing are intractable\nAnd there are so large that you need a sort of you know the power of real nation states to kind of way in and at least set some kind of a guy you know\nPaul ...

[noise]\n\nYes we could change the migrants after crossing from Honduras Guatemala yesterday\nToday President Trump threatened to cut off aid to Honduras if the migrants continue their march Guatemalan journalist Louisa ... has been watching the progress of the caravan\nIs heartbreaking to see that amount of people marching thinking\nPraying with children and babies and they'll learn you feel\nThe averages of walking and then his he they shoes\n... not ... to the weather conditions hearing what am I we have a lot of rain and the ones right now so they will reach the Mexican border I think on a Sunday and then we'd be a very huge crises in the border\nSo they're on their way now to Guatemala City the sixteen hundred marchers right what what is the scene as they're walking along or they're walking\nAlong a highway last night days that then if you were left his left is a ... near the border with that and\nThey were around two thousand people on the park and a shelter and everywhere they they were sleeping almost industry\nSo the caravan started in San Pedro Sula Honduras San Pedro Sula was once the the murder capital of the world it's still a dangerous city why do the marchers say they're fleeing Honduras\nViolence gang violence and the other part is they are with nothing not having jobs not having any money makes them very vulnerable\nYes so fleeing poverty we've heard a lot about that and the violence as well I mean there was a a Honduran congressmen highly Dixon who tweeted they are not seeking the American dream they're fleeing fonder nightmare so that certainly squares with violence and the violence stories we're hearing\nLuis why are they doing this march this time of year why now\nIn ... they gather people begin to march\n... it is legal to seek asylum in the U.S even if you don't have papers so people who present themselves at ports of entry or not violating any laws how much do these migrants no that large segments of American society are not going to welcome them\nAs far as I guess he only a few of them know about ... the other ones I just marching to the border I think they believe they can just entered the countries I don't think they are aware of the of the nation on the border\nVice president Mike Pence told presidents in the region in Central America this week to stop migrants from fleeing or than President Trump has threatened to cut off aid Honduras but our leaders in the region able to stop these marchers\nAs far as I can hear them all that they are not doing anything to stop them\nBecause it's not possible we don't have enough resources to solve them and get them back to the border with them because they are they are a lot of family a lot of children a lot of elderly people they are just crossing every road they can\nThe United states provides a about a hundred and Seventy five million dollars in aid to Honduras that was the last fiscal year if President Trump cut off that aid what would that do to Honduras do you think\nIt's going to be very very bad for indoors economy\nHow would Guatemala feel if a these Honduran migrants were to just stay in Guatemala how would people feel about the\nPeople that are not happy with the marchers here there are of course a lot of people helping them giving them food water Madison and because they are just crossing the country but the they want to stay\nWith no resources live no money justice thing and the part that is a huge crisis when it's ironic that crisis\nGuatemalan journalist Luis ... keeping his eyes on nearly two thousand Honduran marchers who are moving through Guatemala is with us from Guatemala City Luis thank you thank you\nThere is a lot of uncertainty facing migrants who make it to the U.S Mexico border especially families with children\nUnder the Trump administration's zero tolerance policy thousands of families have been separated at the border in fact according to a recent report by Amnesty International thousands more families were separated and the government has previously disclosed\nBrian griffey is a researcher at Amnesty International\nI imagine this a Brazilian grandmother named Maria ... death threats by a police officer who was involved with criminal groups in Brazil\nShe had a developmentally disabled grandson over whom she had legal custody we visited her in detention in El Paso she'd been there for almost a year after simply seeking protection at the U.S Mexico border\nAfter a day or two in detention is separate from each other and they remained separated for most of the next year\nThe grandson was put into the custody of Connecticut state children's services and they'd even stop to strip her of her legal guardianship this is clearly not the best interest of the child and it was something that was done fairly also to compel her to give up her asylum claim and go back to Brazil a few years ago this would've been a clear cut asylum case\nWill get back to the case of Maria and her grandson but first I wanted griffey to tell us about the new Amnesty International report\nBasically what we know is that the department of homeland security has not made public and official count on the families and the number of children affected what we hear from authorities are kind of a patchwork\nOf conflict in statistics the department of homeland security from April night seen to August Fifteen alone separated over six thousand family members who cross the border regularly\nBut from the numbers they shared with us it appears that numbers about twenty twenty five percent higher at a minimum even when they provided us with these statistics they couldn't tell us whether they were talking about the number of individuals with a number of families separated that's a big difference\nAnd they also went to back to a class action lawsuit under which there'd been about twenty five twenty six hundred families that were separated\nBut it appears that about eight hundred other people were separated beyond what they discuss in this class action lawsuit\nYour report lays out three ways that the Trump Administration policies affect people coming to the u._s. for a one of those is obviously family separation what are the others\nWell the reason that the Trump Administration was separated families was not just to be cruel it wanted to detain all asylum seekers indefinitely\nIf you're detaining refugees only based on their migration status and they don't present and you kind of risks of society or biscuit sleep that constitutes arbitrary detention under international law and then right now along the entire length of the U.S Mexico border the Trump Administration is pushing thousands of asylum seekers back into Mexico and tons of that it's safe for them to wait there\nWe also found that the U.S authorities have been encouraging Mexican immigration officials to deport this is Adam seekers back to the very countries where they slipped persecution or threats of death and that's slightly illegal under both US law and international law so there were these three interlocking policies\nAnd since we released a report both Republican and democratic members of Congress to come to us asking for more information we're hopeful that\nAs we get closer to the appropriations process that Congress can use the power of the purse to compel the department of homeland security to be more forthcoming\nBack now to Maria the Brazilian grandmother seeking asylum in the U.S with her grandson Brian griffey says Amnesty International\nWas president of Murray's final immigration hearings and it wasn't looking good for\nWe actually witness as the judge such compel her in the courtroom to give up her asylum claim in order to be reunited with her grandson with special needs before being deported back to Brazil\nThe implication was all of a sudden the names of merit less right she's saying we want to close the loop holes but we can reunite you what your grandson so you don't get deported without and so what you see here is a clear threat of permanently separating the grandmother from her grandson at the", "year": "2018", "show_name": "PRI's The
