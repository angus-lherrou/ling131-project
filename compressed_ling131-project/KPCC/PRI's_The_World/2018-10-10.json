India China and Africa old growing six seven percent or we go coal maintaining its role in the international stage and we've got the oil companies projecting the older bond will go on up\nHelen ... of the reasons in the sense not to be cheerful do you think it's realistic in the face of gross than change like that for these changes to be embraced\nReally we're going to need the most incredible political will and heavy lifting to get the policy setting some place to change one of the moment is not looking at one point five ... two degrees future but something much much worse with with catastrophic implications\nIf public opinion possibly the thing that could come to the age of politicians and scientists to public opinion begins to change is not the thing that can make the critical difference\nOh certainly could public's demand action\nThe problem is the public's not always so consistent author when I was prime minister I was aware of\nPolling evidence that said do you think the government should do something about climate change to nearly everybody says yes yes they should and then when you say well you prepared to pay more for your picture all to do something about well nowhere near as many people like they should do that so it requires very bold leadership\nIn which case detail do reports like this help to knowledge base governments on public into thinking about what their response but as he is\nI think it's to the credit they like the seat to push out this\nKind of science based reporter went off to be a little bit careful about how it's done so one of the great illusions that those who like myself I Want to do a great deal about climate change\nI've been guilty of propagating is telling the public but you know you can have the greatest transformation from my almost overwhelmingly fossil fuel based world economy to one that's based on renewables et cetera within the space of the few to ... do you know what it isn't going to cost you anything in fact it's gonna be economic growth in Homs and\nNow I don't think any practical votes or believes that\nAnd all the evidence is as having clock correctly said that when the public that confronted with paying for this and they've been told that he wasn't going to cost much they tend to react negatively and ended up ... will how you get the population of trying to persuade the Chinese leadership\nMetal on the Republican support base in America the trends Mr Trump's mind that he is really quite big ...\nAnd then talk if you accept that now that this could technology comes to the rescue bested that treats the so the pile up the cost of renewables and so on coming down\nOh definitely and I think we should also he the woods of next to where he said you are the pine now to make the transition all you got to pay ... light to that for the adaptation to the catastrophe that Jeff Sessions\nWho are in town now isn't it much easier to decide that costs to another day\nWhat it is but that's not responsible law the what we really need this transformational leaders who are prepared to tell the public that they can't go on and say oh he's a hell you all\nVery pessimistic I think it's sad to say do you see any reason to be optimistic about the way in which public perceptions government sections of climate change may change\nIn one respect extreme you missed it the way the pessimism is about the top down kind of global agreements the optimism comes from the transformation that technology is if you want to think further out the ... century for serious optimism\nThe day will come when it's cheap to produce energy from known fossil fuels than it is from fossil fuels but we should focus on\nThe big the technological transformation ... give up on the conferences and focus on the technology\nWell definitely invested in the technology and the and the transition I think it is time for civil society to a step up in China or in particular how to civil society make these steps in America is it really going to make that difference\nYou see in China I think the regime will have to move for its own reasons if for no other and that is that people are getting robbed with tons of breathing heavily polluted air and the city's whatever the reason for moving to clean sustainable energy let's grab the action the charge more of a\nHelen ... a former prime minister New Zealand and ... to ... professor of energy policy at new college ... talking to receive ...

I Can't say anything and I talked to him once he left and you know watch this sort of evolution read his columns and read his commentary spoke to him and so on\nJust on that level I think it's horrible I think it's terrible this is someone I knew someone that I consider it a colleague as well as a source\nSo it's devastating that there's something like this could happen\nI think I've some measure of protection from this kind of thing because I'm an American but I you know fuel for the other dissident journalists and activists\nWho are in Turkey the Arab Spring produced a lot of dislocation of many people people were you know spread out across the region and across the world and they you know suffered enough having to say goodbye to their homes and their families\nNow they have to be living in fear that the government that they escape from is going to hunt them down and kill them or kidnapped them with impunity\nReporter ... either and assemble President Trump has invited ... distraught fiance to the White House us secretary of state Mike Pompeo has called on Saudi Arabia to support a thorough investigation of the show he's case and to be transparent about the results\nMembers of the Trump Administration would seem to be on the same page but to what end\nI think they're unified view is please make this go away quickly it's causing a lot of problems\nThat's tomorrow Kaufman with us of the Brookings Institution she notes the U.S has had a close relationship with Saudi Arabia really since World War two she also says ... disappearance threatens the very personal relationship the ...\nAs a stylish when these guys do business together they get on the phone with each other or Mohammed been summoned the crown prince of Saudi Arabia calls Jared Kushner his son in law of President Trump directly rather than working through ambassadors are lower level aides\nAnd there's also the constant refrain from President Trump that this is my great friend\nAnd indeed this is a language that he uses with regard to a number of autocrats around the world whether it's Mohammed bin ... and Saudi Arabia a president Abdel Fattah el Sisi in Egypt where president to charity and the Philippines\nWhat would you say the ... relationship translates into\nAt least in recent decades American presidents have been at pains to demonstrate that while we have friendships all around the world\nWe do business with all kinds of government our best friends are most reliable friends are most valued friends our fellow democracies that's been a standard refrain in American foreign policy I'm pretty much since the end of World War two and and strengthened since the end of the Cold War\nAnd that's the language that President Trump has thrown out the window in essence a he's made it clear including in his speech at the U.N General assembly a couple of weeks ago that he's really not concerned about how other governments govern their own societies he just wants to know what's in it for him\nI guess I Want to know what difference it all mixed because I mean the Trump White house has been described as enthusiastically pro Saudi but are there really shades of being\nGrossed out because it's the world's biggest arms importer and one of the biggest exporter of oil I mean that's a that's a wild combination but you're either in or out where the U.S is in right and we've been in for decades\nWell the United states has been happy to have a very close relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia since the end of World War two the U.S and Saudi worked together to develop those Saudi oil fields and yes the kingdom of Saudi Arabia purchases quite a lot\nOf weaponry from the United states President Obama in fact sold a record dollar amount of weapons to the kingdom during his eight years in office and Trump looks like he's ready to top\nThat record 'em so there is continuity but there is a substantive difference in the Trump administration's approach in that President Trump has really signal that he's willing to give the Saudis have free hand\nNot just in terms of repression at home but in terms of regional policy as well under Trump the Saudis basically have a blank check\nSo what are you seeing as reaction from the White House right now about what could will be an assassination of this journalist or ...\nI think that the swift and fears outrage among all these other sectors in Washington pushed the White House into a response where we might not otherwise have seen one this is notable because it's the first public criticism that we've seen from the Trump Administration at any senior level\nOf Saudi human rights behavior\nIt's also notable because it's the first time that I can think of in the Trump Administration where we've seen this kind of coordinated release of statements from a whole set of senior officials at once which is meant to emphasize that they have a unified view\nHow much did U.S intelligence know about ... she'll be safety before he walked into this consulate in Istanbul\nThis is a very important question and one to which I don't think we have a complete answer the Washington Post reported last night\nThat uh sources were telling them that U.S intelligence intercepted communications uh among Saudi officials talking about their desire to lure them all back to place where they could get their hands on him\nThat's very disturbing if true because it raises the immediate question of when the intelligence community learn this information and what if anything the U.S government did to warn a resident of the United states about the fact that a foreign government was plotting against his safety\nAgain if it turns out the Saudi officials planned and executed this assassination what's going to mean to other I was like in Saudi Arabia get away with this on the world stage\nIf the United states is not willing to stand up against violations of basic human rights if the United states is not willing to stand up for a a journalist who was merely exercising his right to free expression\nThen other governments that also believe in these rights also think they are important but have less power less influence less ability to insulate themselves from the blowback\nWill be deterred from speaking up themselves and moreover those vulnerable people who most need the protection of international human rights lot dissidents journalists a civil society activists\nThey take on the risk of doing their work in the face\nThat democratic governments around the world will speak up for them if they are arrested or disappeared for exercising their rights and so it's a betrayal of those people around the world when the United states fails to play that role\nTamara Kaufman would have

I'm an engineer and I believe that all things or do we bought this base is not an island\nThis base is not an island meaning people have to get to it from somewhere and already I Norfolk there are days when the main road going into the base floods and people can't get to work which means they can't resupply ships that are docked there so this is already seen as a military readiness issue\nThe military has long been considered a one of the most proactive parts of the federal government when it comes to planet for climate change I mean the Pentagon very clearly a number of years ago called climate change a threat multiplier is that still the case are they still proactive\nI Would say yes and no one I was standing on a ups year without Rios at Norfolk naval base he said you know it's not my job to ask why sea levels are rising right now\nIt's my job to know what the projections are and plan for them um so this is sort of still the attitude of the military so even today secretary of defense Jim Mattis has said that climate change is a national security issue and we do need to plan for it\nYeah I mean planning a suggest the military has a really different attitudes of from the White House on on climate change what does that actually mean though on the ground\nSo there are directed being given an instruction being given to the military and the Pentagon to plan for climate change so for example the navy right now is required to plan for sea level rise and all of its forward planning\nAnd Congress recently directed the Pentagon to identify the top ten sites\nThreatened by climate change but these directed and is planning doesn't always translate to action or money allocated in terms of preparations for climate change today I talked to David Titley who's a retired rear admiral who actually headed to the U.S Navy's task force on climate change for a while and this is what he told me about the military preparations\nSince I'm now in state and I was going great students I Will give the military might\nOr its preparations they have done some initial work they have pulled out the over arching documents say what they're going to do but at the end of the day funding these type of\nInfrastructure improvement is very very hard\nTo lead did point out one tidbit of forward momentum on the funding aspect here which is that Congress authorized military spending to prepare for climate change\nIn outside of defense application so if we go back to the naval station Norfolk\nThe problems with people getting to work on that naval station how could you not with a military site but with infrastructure outside of the military base so there's been some funding authorized for helping military readiness when it occurs off of military bases\nSo I think this is an example of how what's happening with Congress regarding climate change specifically on military readiness as a little bit different than the rhetoric that's coming out of the White House\nWell for the good people along the Gulf Coast we wish them an a plus for dealing with the effects of Michael the world Carolyn Beeler thanks very much You're welcome Marco hurricane Michael comes in the wake of two related events this week the un climate report that I mentioned earlier which urge much quicker action to avert serious climate change consequences\nAlso a Nobel Prize in economics going to Paul Romer\nWho's focused in part on how innovation can help us tackled the climate crisis\nNew approaches and technology can definitely help but it also pays to look back to the way things used to be done that's what's happening in some remote parts of Australia a changing climate and damaging farm practices have degraded a lot of land there\nNow the Australian government has hired a group of people with deep ties to the land to rethink the way it's\nManaged unprotected you might say their consultants who noble and best aboriginal people using traditional techniques handed down over centuries here's reporter the buffer notice\nIt's a one morning in the remote community of ti tree\nI mean a jeep with a group of aboriginal women they're all ranges on line by women from the local original community who spend their days tremendous thing a large swath of land and ti tree and doing general land maintenance well nothing but these ranges a bit different and how they do that job\nSee they haven't caught a degree in land management they don't study textbooks to learn land protection techniques they stopped the week by consulting with The Elders the traditional bonus of the land\nIt's a name for the indigenous people who've lived here\nFrom the community tell us what we need to build like fencing\nI'd say ... from Campbell office on Capitol", "year": "2018", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "10"}
