Dutch government presumably with the blessing of the British Government they're providing this level of detail in an intelligence investigation\nI mean these kinds of details it's going to be a long time before you to your details like this coming out of probably any western intelligence agency\nWhat's been happening is every time that Russia comes up as being involved for example in the in the Salzburg poisoning\nEvery time that Russia is even remotely linked to any of these activities they just retaliate with countless smoke screens and tried to distort information so what I think there were attempting to do today is provide such irrefutable detail\nReleasing copies of these guys passports pictures of the car they had rented with the license plate pictures of the equipment that they had used\nIt's really an amount of detail that would never be released because they don't want to expose how they operate or how much they know and I think they just wanted to show look we've got you we caught red handed denied this\nAnd Dutch intelligence mentioned kind of a very elaborate and close cooperation between intelligence agencies across the globe this type of cooperation and type of coordination the collective condemnation of activities of the Russian military intelligence\nKind of sets the stage for ramping up political tensions and deteriorating already very poor diplomatic relations\nAnthony George bureau chief for Reuters him another one speaking with us from the Hague thank you very much my pleasure now on to China the other country being talked about in the news today as a national security threat\nToday in Washington and vice president Mike Pence took direct aim at Beijing he was speaking at a conservative think tank\nPence accused China of meddling in the upcoming us mid term elections he essentially told the Chinese government to butt out of domestic American politics and that wasn't the only warning you had for Beijing as the world's Matthew bell reports\nVice president picked up where President Trump left off when he spoke at the United nations in New York last week Trump had said that China was meddling in the American democratic system trying to influence us voters and undermined the Republicans in the mid term elections\nToday Mike Pence told his audience at the Hudson Institute that this administration is doing something previous ones\nTo do and that's a stand up to China's unfair trade practices Beijing doesn't like it Penn said and it's responding with a coordinated campaign\nChina has initiated an unprecedented effort to influence American public opinion the two thousand Eighteen elections and the environment leading into the twenty twenty presidential elections\nTo put it bluntly President Trump's leadership is working in China wants a difference American president\nPence said China is pressuring American businesses movie studios think tanks and government officials it's using front groups covert operations and propaganda he said to manipulate American public opinion\nAs a senior member of our soldiers community told me just this week what the Russians are doing pales in comparison to what China is doing across this country and the American people deserve to know\nPence did not offer a detailed new evidence but he did mention a Chinese Communist party document that he said outlines of Beijing's efforts to play up political divisions in the U.S by highlighting wedge issues like trade tariffs\nPence's speech was in part a reflection of reality says the saying he's the director of the China Institute at the school of oriental and African studies University of London the reality is that U.S China relations are in a bad place\nIt is a almost sci fi like climate change in the way how the United states is looking at relationship with China getting all looking at local change in weather cutting out to change\nAnd sang says things are likely to get worse because the trade war is not something that can be negotiated away in a matter of weeks or months as for the allegations about Chinese meddling in us democracy sang says some of its true\nSuch as the pacing of advertising cheerios in newspapers in such an American state but that is a lot different from the application of\nThe Chinese ... feeling into the need to electoral process or doing something which the Russians

get us electoral process and twenty two to U.S China\nPence's speech today was wide ranging he talked about Taiwan about human rights and religious freedom about intellectual property theft and the standoff in the south China Sea\nBonnie Glazer at the center for Strategic and International Studies says it reminded her of Ronald Reagan's Nineteen eighty three evil empire speech aimed at the Soviet Union\nThe Trump Administration is at going I think to throw the bucket China and vice president Pence says speech or maybe just the beginning\nFor the world I'm Matthew bell so far today we've heard about attacks from Russia and the threat from China and I'm about to ask the question that feels like we're back in the days of the Cold War which is worse Russia or China\nI'm going to get a quick hit on this from Heather ... with the New America foundation Heather between Russia and China which is the most immediate threat to us national security generally and why\n[noise] so like international relations professionals hate this question if a equivalent of which of your children what'd you save\nBut China is the bigger long term threat because it's the bigger economy and stronger more cohesive society Russia's the more immediate threat because ... ... needs wins against the u._s. to sack up his own domestic legitimacy show the U.S has to do in a way be able to stave off\nRussia's relentless probing as our institutions and social cohesion in order to be able to deal China in the long run yeah\nAnd as the U.S doing kind of the right things in terms of national security right now in addressing the long term threat of China\nWell the funny thing about Russia and China is that in some ways they're the same long term threat which is autocratic society's looking defeat if they can use\nThe tools and technologies of our open society to undermine that and protect their own more closed society so you know in some ways the things we're not doing to push back against Russia right now strengthening are hurting infrastructure\nStrengthening our institutions figuring out how\nA cohesive society on signaling to Russia that there are consequences for what they're doing those are also going to have negative attack against China and the longer term\nAnd my framing the question with the right word is a threat I mean you know Russia and trying to say you know Russia's definitely denied a lot of this stuff and trying to like what threat\nLook\nDo you like the idea that someone from another country can change the results in our elections that's a threat\nGood enough very concise answer Heather Herbert with the New America foundation in Washington Thank you yeah but I [noise]\nBrazil has an election coming up this weekend and guess what fake

elections in other parts of the world for the world Catherine Osborn in Rio de Janeiro\nHere at home midterm elections are just around the corner people like Jonathan Morgan are closely watching social media for signs of disinformation campaigns targeting voters Jonathan is founder and CEO of new knowledge it's a company that built technologies to spot these campaigns so far he says they've seen action from both domestic and foreign players\nThe foreign actors are the typical cast of characters Russia Iran Israel but here in the U.S it's a it's mostly political operatives and I think this is where there is a really interesting question\nThe the techniques are similar they might be operating a network of websites for doing it in a way that is opaque to the audience of those Web site so to to that audience it appears that there's dozens of publications and there's a consensus around important political issues amongst those publications\nWhen in fact it's not really a consensus of the few people are constrained in that message and that might be amplified by\nThousands of social media accounts that are coordinating their activity either because they're automated like botnets or their\nLittle armies of humans trying to spread a message intentionally as quickly as broadly as possible\nUm and so these are the characteristics that we associated with foreign influence operations but there again being done by folks who I think assume that they're just kind of hustling to get their message out as political operatives even if it's a little shady or a little disingenuous\nAnd in terms of foreign actors or Russia doesn't surprise me but but what are Iran and Israel up to\nVery similar things similar to Russia we see these networks of accounts focused on their foreign policy objective but what's interesting is that when there is a really contentious domestic issues here in the U.S like the Kavanaugh nomination sample they do\nTurn and focus on amplifying both sides of that issue kind of sowing discord which is again really similar to what was on twenty sixteen\nOr these campaigns are targeting specific races in specific states\nEven in races that have been very high profile\nFor example the cruise or work Senate race in Texas for a while there is a lot of social media engagement around that race and there are some tactics being used again by we think domestic actors that are arguably manipulative we're not seeing a lot of foreign amplification of um of one candidate or another and\nIn those races generally how would you say these operations are right now compared to what we saw in the twenty sixteen us presidential election both in terms of the end goal and uh the strategy how it's actually done\nWhat we're seeing an evolution of tactics so this is definitely an arms race the social media platforms have improved their ability to detect\nCertain types of tactics that we know are associated with foreign influence but of course new tactics are evolving a new proxies are being developed or new human assets are being cultivated so that foreign actors can operate through real Americans and obviously if their activity\nUm and in terms of strategy I'd say that's been largely consistent from one election to the next\nAs much as there's been a huge focus on whether or not the Russian operation was focused on supporting the Trump campaign over the Clinton campaign ultimately I think what we've seen\nOver the long term is that they're real strategy was focusing on things that were very divisive and of course presidential elections very divisive and the more divisive they can make that conversation the better and the Kavanaugh nomination and the me too movement of the allegations of sexual assault I think of course\nThat's been a a very sort of an open wound for the country right now so it's really no surprise that these accounts were tried to", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "year": "2018", "city":
