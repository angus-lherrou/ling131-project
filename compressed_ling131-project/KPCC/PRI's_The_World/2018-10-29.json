others made his first court appearance today even as federal prosecutors are vowing to seek the death penalty in the case forty six year old Robert Bowers appeared in a wheelchair and accepted the court appointed defender\nWith the rhetoric from the president and the reception as some of his tweets are getting with people like the alleged attacker in Pittsburgh as well as the alleged bomb maker last week where do you sit in the middle of all this rhetoric and how do you deal with it\nSo I think the only way that we the only thing is to stand up to it I think that we learned a time and time again and particularly this weekend\nIs that heat speech can lead to hate action and violence and we can't give it a pass anymore that's really are only weapon we need to stand up and fight against hate and make sure we don't do any of it a pass anymore because the consequences can be so tragic\nMelanie does or the senior vice president for public affairs of highest thank you very much for your time today really appreciate it thank you very much\nWill Carl is covers extremism for reveal from the center for investigative reporting he's based in Brazil where there is another big story today the election of far right candidate ... as president more on that later\nFor science will how the Pittsburgh synagogue attack fits in with his reporting on extremism in America\nObviously is a particularly violent episode I mean we do see anti Semitism really ramping up over the last couple of years really you know following the election of president Donald from\nUC ... of anti Semitism on social media or on on right wing social media but also a mainstream social media like Facebook and Twitter\nAnd so you know it's not particularly surprising I mean this isn't the first guy to walk into a cynical or a Jewish center as a shooting people and sadly I Do think that he'll be the last but the scale of this attack was worse than anything we've seen at least in recent years\n[noise] I I Know it can be difficult to connect violence to political rhetoric but looking at events like the mail bombs last week in the synagogue shooting to what extent can you make that link because we've got to remember Dylann Roof went into a Charleston South Carolina church and killed people there before the election of Trump\nYeah I you know I don't find it difficult to make that link at all I mean you've got president Donald Trump re tweeting and spreading\nCompletely full anti Semitic theories about George Soros the Hungarian Jewish multi billionaire saying he's you know funding everything from the caravan of migrants who's making their way to the southern border to protesters and you know that trickles down that trickles down we see\nFor example the Pittsburgh so you took on his gab social media accounts in the days leading up to the shooting was posting about George Soros of Trump mega fun send to pipe bomb allegedly to George Soros is home so I think there are plenty a can\n... and I think the media just needs to stop don't sing around this subject and just lay it out very clearly the president is spreading malicious rumors and that is trickling down to his fan base and people are going out and killing people it's as simple as that\n[noise] so you mentioned the social media site gab and we've heard a lot about it since the shooting in Pittsburgh tell us more about ... what do you know\nThat basically an old right twist to I mean that's the way to think about them now that shtick is that they're all about free speech and the reality is that it's a collection of neo\nNazis racist anti Semite people who like to get on and spread most the fake known since about Jews about people of color and I mean I think most people would be absolutely a poll by most of the content on there\nI mean they've been shut down but one the people who go to gab want they just go somewhere else to find a like minded community\n[noise] [noise] yeah this is a tricky debate has been going on for some time now you know to what extent is it\nIs a case is too deep platform these guys just shut down that places of congregation\nBut I mean I kind of think that that misses the point I mean ultimately the people who hosts gab their private company run by individuals like you and me but if they don't want to hurt people who are spreading hateful stuff then that's their prerogative\nThese guys are not being sent said it's not as if a government body or entity is coming in and saying hey you guys can't spread your message they'll find someone else to hurt them I think we just have to acknowledge that every time a Republican congressman\nYou know re tweets a conspiracy theory they make these people feel as if they're legitimate as if what they're saying is true and that's something that five years ago didn't really exist you know these people lived on the fringes and were treated as out cause and today that being legitimize by mainstream politicians\nAnd in some cases by the president himself\n[noise] well let's turn to Brazil now I mean you've got an interesting perspective on extremism covering hate us and living in Brazil especially now that there's been this election yesterday but lead to a victory for populous right wing candidate drier\nBoston arrow what parallels do you see between ... and Donald Trump I actually\nThink that the parallels have been over to learn because I think Dr Laura makes Donald Trump looked like Mr Rogers he says openly homophobic things he once said that he would rather his son with dead than gay\nI mean he's told a female congresswoman on the floor of the national Congress that he didn't think she was with raping because she was basically not attractive enough for him\nI mean this is a guy who is very open about his hateful speech and he was also we've seen added fuel to the far of racism and ... and and especially anti journalism violence in Brazil over the last few months\nA Brazilian investigative journalism organization has tracked at least fifty hate few crimes committed by ... and our support is across the country there's such in the political violence connected to ... and our\n[noise] so what is the mood like in Brazil or this day after the election they're\nHonestly the mood is pretty jubilant I mean especially in the neighborhood that I live in Brazil like America is very divided right now you've got the north west and to some extent the north east of Brazil the sort of more rural areas\nThat really didn't support ... came out in favor of the people's party and then you've got the southeast Web most Brazilians live and megacities like Rio and so Powell\nAnd they heavily supported ... the crowd outside ... house last night had I Would say equal numbers of African presidents

lawsuit filed last week against Exxon Mobil alleges they defrauded shareholders by downplaying the climate change threat to its bottom line\nJeff Colgan is a professor at Brown university who specializes in energy and environmental policy what exactly is Exxon Mobil being accused of Jeff\nWell they're specifically being accused of deceiving the investors in the fed to which climate change might hurt the profitability of ... but of course that's related to a larger story about how\nExxon Mobil public relations campaign have defeats the public about climate change\nA ExxonMobil was instrumental in some of the campaign led by the American Petroleum Institute which is the kind of industry lobby group in the Nineteen Ninety that set out specific goals to try to\nUm get the public to recognize uncertainty to the climate change at a certain issue where there wasn't clarity around\nThe side of it and that was very much inconsistent with what Exxon Mobil own scientists were saying where they are saying look the science is settled and we understand the climate changes coming at it caused by humans\nWhat what is the Exxon Mobil been saying in his defense\nWell a ExxonMobil has changed it to the overtime or when the c._e._o. with Lee Raymond in two thousand\nHe was very much opposed to the idea of global warming he in fact even fed publicly that he feared a coming ice age more than he feared catastrophic for me\nSo he had a really tough lied on climate change since then things have changed so when Rex Tillerson who later became secretary of state when Tillerson became the c._e._o. that ExxonMobil changed its too and they started to withdraw funding from the groups\nThat had been deny the science of climate change that Exxon had been funding in the Nineteen nineties in early teeth out\nPresumably this lawsuit focuses on those earlier days is there a smoking gun like a memo where higher ups of the company said at one point look this is this is our plan\nWell that's interesting because the New York attorney general\nHas been requesting internal documents and we don't know what all of those documents say but the deputy attorney general has said exactly those words that you just said smoking gun plural\nSo we don't know what the text about it but it sounds like the prosecutors are confident that ExxonMobil did deceive it's shareholders\nSo Exxon Mobil is all over the globe is this the New York attorney general's office acting alone or have they been hearing from interested parties all over the globe\nThe New York state attorney general is of course very powerful because the New York stock exchange is governed by New York state law and so other parties have been weighing including other states and presumably other countries are going to be watching this case closely\nJeff Colgan professor at Brown University Thanks very much for your time thank you despite what ... might have suggested the big picture science of climate change that's been clear for years carbon dioxide and other kinds of pollution from human activity helped trap more heat in the atmosphere that warms up the planet\nThere is uncertainty though about some of the details things like how all that warming is affecting the natural systems of the earth permit for us for example the freezer of the planet\nAnd you know what it's like when you leave your freezer door open for a while the Arctic is a freezer we're looking at\nThe world is focusing on the Arctic and climate change in a bunch of stories produced with the podcast threshold and its host Amy Martin

this project he's working on his PHD at the same school\nWe're looking at the methane gas bubbling from the leg sediment into the atmosphere\nUsually when we talk about climate warming emissions we're thinking of the stuff coming out of our cars are smokestacks all around the earth day in beautiful places like this powerful greenhouse gases are starting to escape into the atmosphere and they're coming from inside\nThe amount of carbon that's stored in years is so it's twice the amount that we have in the atmosphere and so if that will be released into the atmosphere that was accused climate change for sure\nWhen you say the amount of carbon we have stored here is twice with an answer you mean the amount of carbon we have in the Arctic\nJust in the opposite from ... from a friend for ... yeah wow\nThis is a statistic worth remembering so let me put it in another way take all the carbon currently floating around in the atmosphere and put it in one basket in schools like all of the
