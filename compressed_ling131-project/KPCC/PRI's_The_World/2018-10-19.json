be Mexican Marines and with the Margaret's began applying for asylum in Mexico\nMexican law says that anybody who rise to the border has the right to request asylum and refugee convention but what's interesting with Mexico is that Mexico has also signed the convention on torture so anybody who's at the border who expresses that they're you know they have some kind of a threat\nOf violence if they go back to their country of origin\nThen they can be accepted in and they can apply for asylum but also in Mexico have something called complimentary protection so actually the Mexican legislation and favorable finally humanitarian chew immigrants in general the problem here is that the Mexican government is under so much pressure\nSo most of the migrants want across the U.S Mexico border and get into the U.S will Mexico let these migrants travel north through Mexico or will they try and stop them\nWell it depends if you've applied for asylum in Mexico you have a pending claim of you have a humanitarian V. fat then you can have some sort of mobility with documentation to those people are going to have to make a decision on whether they stay and wait for the asylum\nClaim or whether they travel within the country there is you know very severe\nSystem of checks throughout the whole entire country and so people who are undocumented who are traveling on the train or\nA highway system will he stopped and chat many times throughout their ... and so if they're traveling without documents they will probably be detained and deported\nI mean you've seen thousands of migrants in Mexico not just now but but over the years realistically do they make it through to the u._s. or did they end up kind of in limbo in a way in Mexico\nWell it's interesting because you know the cat and has than organizing for over ten years\nAnd as long as there was not so much attention but on the cat and people can usually cross the border without any problem and travel in a regular undocumented find within Mexico and reach the United states at that but yet this is\nDifferent now the cat I spent so much media attention to this cat than in a chicken\nAnd now suddenly attention that Donald Trump has been getting cast fan and so I think that there's more pressure on the Mexican government to take action at the border\nBut generally people think that what am I on Mexican border and get in without any problem with their documented or not and the ... detention and deportation parents within Mexico\nRhetoric tuner heads the Institute for women in migration an NGO base in Mexico city thank you
