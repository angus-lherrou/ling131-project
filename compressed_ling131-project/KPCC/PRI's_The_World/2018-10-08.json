... is a senior strategist and started to work as far as he chasing this he feeling today\nI wouldn't say that the president work has parts is one of the biggest losers of this election but we lost\nIt's going to be ... impossible though isn't it for you just in the pure max to overcome this gap\nTo get to fifty percent\nWell the second round in Brazil it's the kind of new election so all the both candidates will face the Brazilian people Jay both so narrow has not debated a I feel that we feel that people don't know why he stand for you but the reason for that is because he was stabbed\nWell there are other ways to talk and if you read his program for example he talks about like a very small states and if you talk to people on the streets for example do you know what that does that mean\nLess health less lake education less investment in infrastructure less jobs in our opinion\nIf you talk to people on the street they will also say that they really hold the workers' party in contempt for the amount of crime you mentioned corruption for the sake of the economy I haven't heard anything from people close to what this puppy suggesting that they understand that level of anger I think\nThe president work aspire to have to have a different style now in the second round to talk to people more thoroughly\nJust purely campaigning terms that do you accept that was recently the backside horribly to have this campaign saying that you will candidates dodgy he's ...\nA man who is in prison I Know you and a lot of people think that he shouldn't be in prison but he

twenty percent\nOf people supporting it and we have to regain trust from people who lost trust on us and we have to do them the less next two weeks and have to work hard to discuss dropped an idea that it's based on fake news Cindy ... information is information\nAs represented by a type of scenario\nBut in order to attract the huge number of people the remaining voters to get to that fifty percent mark you want to have to distance yourself from former president leader on\nWe have now to talk as well about how we\nGain support from other ... who can join us and to try to defeat

very sophisticated the Web comes to ... you know ... very advanced subject persecute yours forty to force a very strong free media so old does he see patients we work as a kind of deep to\nAs a kind of you know end up stop was full and dramatic change that would be too much for the meeting preference of this will say\nThey work at the moment but one of the criticisms that is liberal to one of the concerns is that what about ... this is not a man who necessarily would adhere to democratic norms and you know just a few years ago Brazil much room in a tree dictatorship is not something I think to Brazil could return to that stuff\nYeah these are ... ... lots of conflicts but I Do believe that these situations that we have you release nowadays are strong enough to resist\nAnd the show limits to

today Interpol it's an organization that gets easily associated with crime and intrigue solving crime mysteries is their job after a while but now the chief of Interpol is smack dab in the middle of a mystery himself\n... way is his name and his wife live in ... in France that's where Interpol headquarters are located and last week ... wife grace reporter to French police but among had just disappeared vantage while traveling in China\nThe latest is this ... who's also a Chinese security officials seems to be the target of an anti corruption crackdown\nThe Chinese Communist party said yesterday that it had detained him on suspicion of violating the law\nEdward ... who's been covering this the New York times I asked him if the charges are legitimate or more of a political move by Chinese President Xi Jinping\nIt's unclear there's since she took power in twenty twelve to anti corruption campaign touched on\nAll aspects of the party and some of the people that have been taken down or political rivals who has and some are people who are genuinely guilty of corruption but so many officials within the party system um so it's unclear right now why they've targeted Mr among\nSo you you wrote in the New York times that quote the detention of Mr mom is an audacious step by the party even by the standards of the increasingly authoritarian system under the leadership of president Xi Jinping those are pretty strong words can you just put this move this detention by the Chinese government in context for us and in the frame of this anti corruption a\nSure I'm there had been very senior officials who've been taking down and have been detained or and then eventually in prison for life under this campaign and bill and others\nPolitical purge that she has been carrying out but there hasn't been another special that has helped such a high position with the international organization\nWho has been taken down China's been trying to gain legitimacy in the world stage for years now and it seeks to hold high positions in world organizations whether it's in our poll or the world Trade Organization or the IMF\nFor them to do this to pull this person put them in detention not be clear about the reasons why did this this is in my view it's a huge blow to sort of like the costs for legitimacy on the world stage are China is undertaking\nYes so what does this situation I mean for any recognition that China's gotten through monks position that in trouble\nI think I'll be a setback I think that organizations will question what might happen if they decide to put a senior Chinese official\nIn these positions are in power um there's no telling what the party might do and there's no transparency about their process or any sort of legal process or ... or a process that they undertake so I think people will have second thoughts about this\nInterestingly a few hours after the Chinese Communist party announced that had Dr among in custody Interpol than announced that he had resigned as their chief what do you make of that\nI think that the Communist Party and its anti corruption agency specifically must have put pressure on Mr among to issue resignation letter to Interpol\nAnd Dr among was also vice minister and the Chinese ministry of public security does he still hold that role\nWhat usually happens ease investigations is that this anti corruption agency announced the Chinese and in that ad out so don't say that they've stripped him of his party membership of official title and of its political rights\nAnd what what are you hearing among experts and trying to watch or do they believe Dr among isn't any danger\nIt depends on how you defined danger ah he probably is at risk of imprisonment once you start this type of investigation it usually becomes very serious especially if they made an announcement of very explicit announcement about him possibly violating the law so\nAh we're looking at some sort of prison time for him because once they move to the criminal process in a court will almost certainly find him guilty and send them to present it could be prison for life depending on the circumstances\nI'm I'm sure is that what what can you tell us about what Chinese think about Xi Jinping's crack down I mean is done simply as anti corruption but do many Chinese see it that way\nYou know Chinese can be fairly skeptical about people in power so that can play both ways wonder skeptical about local officials and they\nReally believe local fishes across so they think that any crackdown done by Beijing is a good thing but also they can be very skeptical about the motivations behind such crack down so I think that Chinese can see both ways but in general because they see a local officials as being corrupt in many places around China than the welcome to crack down like this\nEdward Long diplomatic corresponded with a New York times thank you very much that's\nWaiting to see now whether among faces trial in China in Spain a verdict today in a case that's grab people's attention there for a long time the defendant an eighty five year old gynecologist\nHe's charged with stealing babies from New mothers during the dictatorship of general Francisco Franco this one case though is part of a much wider scandal involves thousands of babies stolen from left wing opponents of Franco's regime and given to conservative couples for adoption\nThe BBC's Lucy Williamson is in Madrid where the verdict was announced\nWell this is a story that began in Nineteen sixty nine when a woman called in is not to the guys were taken from her mother straits off to the spy a gynecologist scooped up to the vet he faked ... it'll to give a as a gift to another couple\nAt ten years ago and it's up to mother told the truth and she has been investigating and campaigning to try and get dumped ... brought to trial that that's what happened today we had a verdict in the trial of ...\nAnd he was found guilty of all the crimes he was charged with a related to in is but in a twist he was also able to walk free because the court ruled that the statute of limitations didn't allow them to put him in jail\nThe woman at the heart of the lawsuit in Madrid go says she will appeal but ... also says she feel some measure of justice already even if the doctor who stole her from her parents was allowed to walk free today\nI mean I mean what can I say this I don't mind that he's not going to jail that's not the most important thing it'll be very difficult for him to leave the house because everyone move recognizing everyone will know what he did so for me thinking dead and anyway any longer than I Am\nDr ... is the first person to go to trial for illegal adoptions under Franco dictatorship reaction was mixed today from people whose families were affected again here's my BBC colleague Lucy Williams and\nThere were lots of mothers outside the court today who they themselves believe that uh that

reaction that was that was happiness that this had\nHappened to tool that somebody had been found guilty of a crime like this because it's been a very long journey to try and get any official
