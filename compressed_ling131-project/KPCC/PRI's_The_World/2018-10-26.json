{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Global migration is arguably one of the most hotly debated issues some would say problems of the twenty first century in July a hundred and Ninety two un countries in fact all of them\nApart from the United states and hungry signed up to a new global compact full safe boldly on regular migration it's headed by Louise Arbour the former Canadian Supreme Court judge an international prosecutor\nThe global contact is they that text that was negotiated between member states of the un\nIt's a non legally binding document essentially it recognizes that migration policies are a matter of state sovereignty states can determine who comes on their territory under what terms and conditions subject to some\nThere right now Schmidt of an issue isn't it because they know binding and he's basically saying each country can do all they want\nExactly but it also recognizes that the best way frankly to have your national policies and force is through the cooperation of your neighbors because without that you can have any policy you want if it's ... or ignored\nBy your region or by the rest of the world you're not going to get very far so it's it really is an effort to better manage human abilities\nNow the elephant in the room is the United states under President Donald Trump one of only two countries not signed up to this I think the other one is hungry I mean how disappointing and damaging was that\nIt was it's always disappointing I think in ... in the spirit of multi lateral is him to have everybody at the table this was a set of negotiations ... member states negotiated that the United states pulled out activity right on the eve of the beginning of the negotiation\nSo in that sense I think it is a disappointment particularly a country that has so much experience with migration and\nOn the other hand the text is what it is it it has a lot of aspects I think that would be of interest to the Americans if not today further down the road so\nI really very much hope that at some point we'll have a form of re engagement by the U.S\nLast year I think you talked about some of the language around migration as being deliberately in videos on poisoning public debate I mean who you're talking about the\nWell I think there's just as there are lots of expressions that uh people except sometimes without realizing that he carries an undertone of prejudice for instance\nYou often hear the expression illegal migrants well you know when people don't pay their income tax we don't call them in legal taxpayers but the connotation is that\n[noise] they're criminals in some ways the reality is that most people anywhere in the world who are in a country irregular need that is innate knocked property documented fashion most of them I've actually come in through legal channels like with the visa but then have overstayed the terms of their student visa or their tourist visa\nSo this it's an example of where terminology tends to insulate the prejudicial negative aspect of migration\nAmazon of language is stronger than that isn't it I'm just looking President Trump has talked about an onslaught of immigrants coming up from South America at the moment are traveling through Mexico\nYeah and you hear expressions like hordes in swarms in waves on all of which has the effect of exaggerating that threat or danger that a migration poses don't\nYou feel your swimming against the tide some ... you don't hear the representatives of too many government expressing the concerns you all around the world\nThe reality of migration is a much better story than what a lot of perception carries people tend in every country they tend to\nOverestimate the number of migrants in the country they grossly over estimate the negative aspects how much crime is committed by migrants uh what is the unemployment rate the perception tends to be overly negative they're reality\nIs not perfect I mean I don't want to suggest that for a minute but the contributions that migrants may get to the economy the fact that most\nWestern countries now have deficits in their workforce that if well managed could be filled by migrants on a cyclical basis it doesn't all have to be towards citizenship\nThe amounts of migration has increased dramatically over the last century can you imagine a time when the would maybe no borders\nWhile the world is currently organized politically by state\nAre you going to be able to laugh set in the future whack it imagined that being noble as well actually well just adjusted\nYeah actually it's quite interesting if you look at environments in which they are no borders take a country like the United states or Canada you know the U.S a huge country with three hundred million people who could go anywhere they want in the country\nIt'd be interesting there to see what why are not all the people of Iowa moving to California well it's a centrifuge\nStay home unless the unless it's unless they can't make a living any more people move in search for work\nOr they'll move if there's a natural disaster so we have to worry about what's coming the increase in a migration worldwide has moved from two point seven percent of the world's population in the year two thousand two or three points for today\nI think we should expect more in the future if not the in relative terms the world's population is growing so there'll be even if we stay up three point four percent that's more people like need to move and the effect of climate change for instance\nCould cause elements of force involuntary displacement that could even increased these numbers\nOf at the same time then you might expect that will be a rise in anti immigrant\nSentiment you could but at the same time I think there will be a ... I think in many developed countries in the entire western world ... that if we're going to maintain our standards of living and if we're going to have someone to pay for pensions for instance well\nWe're gonna have to have these people come from somewhere because the demographic projections\nAre of a very serious decline in virtually every western country I think having a realistic positive attitude and working to maximize the benefits of migration and meet its challenges that's I think what's really serious the on the table for world leaders\nPresident Trump is taught in recent weeks about shutting the southern border bringing in the army to do that I mean what do you think is that\nNobody has ever questioned the rights of countries in fact their responsibility to control their borders I mean that's beyond question\nThe real issue is how again is the best managed for a country to control its borders and I think in opening legal pathways for people to come and work in the formal economy as opposed to having national policies that\nIn fact encourage illegal entry and then working in the informal black market economy in my view is that nobody's interest\nAnd that was

to prominent critics of President Trump could face up to forty eight years in prison NPR's Quil Lawrence reports the investigation remains ongoing\nI Am of the view that this was a big deal because I Do think it combined a lot of really bad atmosphere it in our country right now the idea\nOf how we talk and vilify enemies and targeting certain individuals\nMatter security analyst Juliet Kyle thanks so much thank you\nFor months now a debate has been simmering in Silicon valley should private companies be entering into lucrative contracts with the federal government that help the Trump Administration build tools for using areas like immigration and defense\nThat debate is alive and well at Amazon this week the Daily Beast reported that the company is trying to woo ice immigration and Customs Enforcement into using Amazon's controversial facial recognition technology\nAndrew Peterson is with the nonprofit project on government oversight and co reported the story she told us emails she obtained show Amazon and I started discussing this over the summer\nThough it's not clear if and when this facial recognition software would be deployed by the agency I asked Peterson what we know about how that would work so basically\nFacial recognition technology is when you have an algorithm set up that can match pictures with other pictures in a really automated super fast speeds up much faster than like if you or I were looking at a picture and we're like oh yeah that matches that one that much is that one these are the same person\nAnd what's concerning to civil liberties advocates and even some former ice officials is that Amazon is\nPromoting a technology that's capable of doing that but using it in real time so real time facial recognition which means they could set up like a video camera across the crowd and scan it as people go past and say oh it's just one of the people that were looking\nFor [noise] so so do we know that ice has used facial recognition technology in that manner we don't know that\nAt this point and we are actively investigating to try and find out more about how the agency is interested in using this kind of technology but at this point they've been very tight lipped\nNow you mentioned immigrant rights and privacy advocates are worried about ice using this technology ah why\nRights groups and civil liberties advocates are worried about ice using this technology for a number of reasons and I do want to say it's not just limited to those groups in fact for our story we spoke to a number of former ice officials\nIncluding Alonzo Kenya a former deputy director at the agency who expressed real concern that what the agency would end up doing with this\nIn the technology if they acquired it was setting up cameras as sensitive locations like churches or hospitals or schools and then using those two almost randomly search people trying to access those vital services\nI understand there's also a concern about this technology giving false positives what's that about so false\nPositive is when a recognition system looks at two images and says yeah these are the same people but they're not actually the same people\nAnd facial recognition technology to date has had a lot of problems particularly when they're trying to match for people of color which has and potentially you pretty scary consequences if you consider this kind of technology being rolled out and for instance an immigration or law enforcement and a situation\n[noise] have Amazon employees raised issues about you know their company being part of something like this\nYes and that's one of the really interesting things about who to Amazon's continued interest in working with ice is that Amazon employees actually publicly came out with a letter saying hey we are very uncomfortable with recognition being sold to local police departments\nWe know from the emails we received that over a month later ice continue their discussion with recognition\nIs there anywhere in the U.S is using Amazon's a recognition there which is the name of their facial recognition software\nSo yes the ACLU earlier this year reported that a number of local police agencies had been using recognition onto the trial basis so this is technology that's already starting to be ruled out in the field and unfortunately this point we don't have as much information as we would like about how it's being used\nOr what the implications of it are going to be for fairness of enforcement\nAndrew Peterson is with the nonprofit project on government oversight thanks Andrea thanks so much for having me\nVoters and the republic of Ireland went to the polls today they were there to select a president a largely ceremonial post in Ireland and they
