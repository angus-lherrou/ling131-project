speaking there and a sickly produced video that was posted on his official Twitter feed its the Islam like Republican response of sorts to me to\nCome and he says that in the west women one after another have been subjected to abuse harassment or violence the ends by saying that in Islam there isn't this kind of problem because women where the jobs\nAnd that this is Joe\n\n... joins me from Toronto ... you're Iranian Canadian or what did you make of this video\nI Know it's gonna be sound weird but I was really jazzed by it because I'm the Islamic republic of Iran will often do this they'll take 'em moments that are happening specifically in America\nThey'll use it to their own advantage to sort of play games of\nWe and they and you know polemic le show how they're much better how their society functions better and how the U.S has praised in deprived the language that's even used in this video by Ali harmony is something that's really to be focused on because he says\nBy introducing had job Islam shut the door on a path\nThat pulls women towards\nThat deviation so the word that he uses his\nIntroducing had jumped I mean head job was not introduce it was violently put on women's heads in Iran and it still to this day is violently put on women's heads anyone it's compulsory it's not a choice this video for me it was very much also a response\nTo the mass movement that's happening in the country against compulsory baling of women and harmony is trying to touch on all of these nerves in saying to him and if you don't learn this you'll be sexually assaulted but then at the same time this is a choice for you when it's not\nSounds very multi layered and somewhat complex as you said you were ...\nThat is by this video where you just buy the video as a journalist or because it's fascinating I Can't imagine you\nKnow as a woman yeah no it's a woman I was not as a woman I thought it was hypocritical I thought it was vile but as a journalist ah I've always been very enthralled by it piqued my\nInterest when I look at the propaganda used by the Islamic republic even the video itself the music the images our own Canadian Parliament is\nImplicated in this video images of our parliament there's images of the European Union so I always find the the propaganda of the Islamic republic very interesting and for anybody who's ever been to the country it's so pervasive in in your face\nIt kinda feels like the message here in this video that Iran doesn't need the me too movement 'cause these me two problems don't exist in Iran I suspect you don't agree with that\nI mean I I don't at all it's absurd to say uh that had job protects you from harassment of the only thing had job might protect you from his son um\nAs a woman who's who's walk the streets of Tehran many times and been harassed a it's absurd to make that notion I mean harassment of women violence of living happens all over the world it doesn't matter what you're wearing you know\nAnd women in Iran has been using the meat to hashtags this is a conversation that came up\nRight when that the Harvey Weinstein story broke women in Iran where using that hashtags to talk about their own instances of harassment and violence and sexual assault and actually it wasn't just women in Iran it was also men\nWho we are talking about being abused and using that hashtags in the country so I'd be harmony it is really trying to push against this but the people in the country are using that hashed tank\nAnd you see this kind of stepping back to the movement in Iran to get rid of the job\nOh absolutely the use of the head job\nBy the stage it's not just a piece of cloth I mean there are women in Iran who wear it by choice and they are religious women but there are women who are forced to put this on and all over the country there are billboards you know five six ten feet tall telling women that\nQuote you are in oil Easter you're like an oyster in a shell and the head job is the shell\nOne of a woman who are prone to embrace our Muslim faith and proud to where the job or have you had conversations with some of those women about sexual assault in the mid to camp and\nThose are women who have also put out hashtags and saying me too so that's where the hypocrisy lines right I mean women don't necessarily who are Muslim don't necessarily where the heck job to protect themselves from men\n[laughter] you know what I mean at the end of the day when you when you talk about job in the way that harmony talks about it in the way that the state in Iran talks about it who are we needing protection from so why not target men in their behavior rather than targeting women\nRunning a Canadian journalist ... speaking with us from Toronto thank you for your time today
