used to describe the thousands of people making that trip north from Central America over the weekend the Associated Press published a tweet that called the group an army\nThe AP was called up for using that word critics argued at mischaracterized migrants and played into the hands of people who use certain words to stoke fears about immigrants the AP apologized saying the word was poorly chosen and has been removed from its coverage of the caravan\nWhich leads me to that other word used to describe this extraordinary ... north by as many as seven thousand people President Trump among many others has repeatedly used caravan this past weekend with other marches north\nOver the years though the word caravan has taken on a tinge of the exotic\nMaybe because of its use in popular culture throughout the twentieth century [noise]\nYou know when you can [noise]\nTake gypsy woman by the impressions or Duke Ellington student caravans son here by other Fitzgerald\nBig\nBucks\nHow appropriate is using the word caravan to describe migrants hoping to reach the U.S we turn to one dictionary which informs us a caravan comes from fifteenth century Persia and the principal definition according to Merriam Webster's is a company of travelers journey in together through desert or hostile regions\nWhich does come pretty close to describing with a group of thousands of people from Central America is trying to do right now\nThat's where the midterms coming up in a couple of weeks the Republicans control fifty won seats in the Senate there are several close races or that could kill power to Democrats question how much of President Trump's terrorists swing voters this year we as the world's Jason Margo\nTo see how this is playing out\nIn Tennessee's Senate race\nTennessee voters heaven sent a Democrat to the Senate since they reelected Al Gore back in Nineteen Ninety [noise]\nIn two thousand and sixteen Donald Trump carried the state by twenty six percentage points but this fall the Tennessee Senate race is very tight Republican Senator Bob Corker is stepping down the Democrat looking to grab his seat is the popular former governor Phil Bredesen\nIn this campaign spot Bredesen is speaking from inside of Tennessee whiskey distilleries\nIf President Trump has been good for Tennessee will be with them that's why I'm fine with his outrage North Korea trying but if he proposes something that are just kind of see how posing these new tariffs will hurt us seem they hurt our auto industry are\nFarmers in Tennessee ... like Jack Daniels in Mexico China\nCanada and the European Union all imposed tariffs on us whiskey exports in retaliation for President Trump steel and aluminum tariffs\nThat's got to be painful for whiskey distillers but when I reached out to the whiskey folks they said they didn't want to speak about tariffs several small businesses that filed complaints with the U.S government about President Trump's tariffs also politely declined interview requests\nFrankly I was a bit surprised Steven Livingston wasn't he's the associate director of the business and economic Research Center at middle Tennessee State University\nWell I I'm actually encounter the same thing when I first started um I Would call these companies up and uh I got the same response so you did and as far as I can tell it's just they're worried about the competition learning something about them\nOr maybe tariffs just aren't that important to Tennessee voters for consumers the impacts from tariffs haven't really been ... yet the latest round of tit for tat tariffs with China just took effect in late September\nI just think it's too early and I'm a lot smarter retailers bought like crazy in anticipation of it so I don't think the average person um has felt much yet because a lot of businesses haven't really had to raise prices yet and so right now I think it's mostly a symbolic thing for a lot of voters\nBut not for everyone tendency farms that export to China and businesses that rely on steel and aluminum imports are being squeezed right now\nLeah s going on with the Washington newsletter inside elections has looked into the impact of tariffs on voters she says a lot of farmers and small businesses in rural red states are concerned but they're eating the president's advice for opening up markets\nJust be a little patience from what we're hearing that kind of trust that on the negotiations penny tax will end up\nHelping the people who supported Trump so I think that adds a level of trust in a president from his supporters some of these kind of helping them get over some of their skepticism about these cats\nAnd ... adds that terrorists are just one of many issues voters are considering and frankly not the big one she says Democrats across the country are running on protecting healthcare and Republicans\nRepublicans think at at the idea that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer could be leaders and Republicans keep pushing and that at the owners could end that electing a liberal agenda\nAt a recent debate in Tennessee that's pretty much what the Republican Senate candidate Marsha Blackburn said over and over about her opponent\nChuck Schumer has bought and paid for his campaign he would have does tax cuts away money or the\nCurrent congresswoman from Tennessee unofficial your face on Fox News the two candidates Blackburn and British inspired and pretty much everything during the debate except this point\nThe tariffs we have right now are hurting Tennessee badly very job killing Jackson, Tennessee and I hope we\nGet these parents over and done with the ... they are not good for tendency\nSo if you were a soybean or hog farmer watching the debate there is not going to be a big difference on what farmers think in terms of both of their responses on the same so\nThat leaves ... with the Tennessee Farm Bureau federation he says make no mistake restoring open trade is vital for tendency farmers but he doesn't see things changing if the state sent a Democrat or Republican to the center\nSo I think the message or especially on trade is uh to the administration on both sides of the ... let's get something done you know are farmers still\nEven if one senator from Tennessee can't and the trade war a vote for a Democrat in deep red Tennessee would be a strong symbolic rejection of President

is tiny and kids here are pretty free to roam tonight they seem to have spontaneously gathered in a wide spot between some houses to chase each other around in the sand [noise]\nWhat's your favorite thing about living at you know\nIt's fun why that fun\nThere's a lot of their kids and you know yeah\nFor Walters point of view ... as a kind of paradise but the paradox of this place is that it might be one of the safest and one of the most dangerous places to live in America today because this small community is ground zero for climate change in the Arctic [noise]\nJust north of just north of the bearing straight and it's the only town on Sarah chef island and everywhere you go you can see the waves\nAnd hear the constant roar of the ocean island is only about a quarter mile live and it's getting smaller it's changed a lot this is Kate Koch young she grew up in ... and now teaches kindergarten here she says in decades past\nThe C I served as a kind of buffer for the island and protecting it from the wind and waves when winter storms blue and\nIt was always frozen like the end of October it no longer is\nThese days the ISIS forming later and later in ways that used to break far away from shore now slam directly in an island not the same time the permafrost is dying weakening the foundation beneath a town the combined effect is it quickly receding coastline\nWe did lose a lot of land like where the seawall is now that's where we used to have our playground so all of that has gone Kate have lots of memories of places that are now under water well if you go down like that way that's where like ten to Fifteen houses were\nAnd like the last house it's there now there was a house next to it a road and then another house if you actually like visualize that you can see how much land was lost their\n... lost a lot of land in a storm in Nineteen Ninety seven and then again in two thousand five people gathered in the windy darkness to get the residents out and save as many of their belongings as possible after\nThat two thousand five stormed the U.S Army Corps of engineers built a new stronger seawall\nYeah and if it wasn't for the seawall probably more would have been taken away and had they not moved the houses they probably would just fallen and\nBut the seawall it's just a small in temporary fix without the barrier of the ice eventually the ocean is going to wash this island a way\nThat people have ... no they're not safe here and two years ago they voted to move the village to the mainland in fact the community has actually voted to relocate three times in twenty sixteen in two thousand two and way back in Nineteen Seventy three people in ... we're worried about erosion even then\nBut at that time no one knew how much climate change would accelerate the erosion process\nAccording to one study between two thousand three and two thousand fourteen Sarah chef island lost an average of seven and a half feet of land to erosion each year\nAnd one major storms blow in the residents have nowhere to run ... is not connected to any roads and in a raging storm planes or boats would have a very hard time getting here as the island shrinks and

storm season is expanding I'm at the top level thing I worry about\nClimate was one of the people leading the federal government's effort to help shed some arrests and other coastal Alaskan communities under the Obama administration when he was hired and twenty ten the federal government has already issued to report describing the threat to these villages in no uncertain terms\nAnd uh that said you know these thirty plus villages are in trouble and that are going to need some of the judge and\nThese reports said the communities were in quote imminent danger and ... was one of the places on the top of the list now at this point you might be asking yourself why ... in such a precarious spot to begin with\nI heard something to the effect of these dumb Eskimos why did they why did they build their community on a barrier argument and this is Kelly ending walk the factors matters because the church and the bureau of Indian affairs school\nIs built ... heads the ... circuit polar council and Alaska based in Anchorage she grew up in ... and she says until a hundred years or so ago there was no permanent village on Sarah chef island her ancestors lived all along this part of the coast and they use the island frequently but they didn't live here year round\nAnd that's the thing that they were kind of semi nomadic um we didn't have permanent settlements and that sort of thing\nThat all of that changed in the early Nineteen hundreds when the U.S government and the Lutheran Church came to coastal Alaska and build churches and schools it was an extension of the colonization process that had already swept through the lower forty eight states\nAlaska Native people were told they had to send their kids to the new schools or risk having them taken away\nOver time the population of this part of the coast concentrated on Sarah Jeff island so this thing called the ...\nThat meant committed these people to a spot which turns out to be directly in harm's
