jurisdiction no legitimacy and no authority\nWe will also can still be is local warming payments to the United nations money that we don't even know what they do with it we will no longer surrender this country or it's people to the false song of globalism\nThe United states and the only response of of course we withdrew from the human rights council and we will not return on jail real reform is an acting\nPresident Trump speaking at the un last month but almost two years into his presidency how much of that rhetoric aimed at reforming or abolishing global institutions has been turned into concrete policy\nThat's a question I've been discussing with former Obama administration official Harold Koh he's studying professor of international law at Yale Law school and has a new book out called the Trump Administration and international law\nHe's essentially adopted a policy of anti globalism\nAnd this was tempted to withdraw from or destroy most of the institutions that have been created in the post war period he's descended from the Paris climate agreement the Iran nuclear deal he's broken trade rules and in the recent book by Bob Woodward\nThey indicated that on his desk were his papers to withdraw from three trade to reduce the world Trade Organization to [noise]\nA NAFTA North American free trade agreement on the Korean us free trade agreement only because but then national economic councilor took these things off his desk or did he decide to not disengage from them\nBut you argue and I think you use a boxing analogy referring to the famous rumbling the jungle between Mohammed Ali and George Foreman that he's not winning\nThat's correct those or recall about fight no the foreman was heavily favored\nIn fact so heavily favored many people fear that we would be killed and the fight\nIn round seven the penultimate round if you were to ask you observers who's winning uh most of them would have said foreman by a mile but in fact the next round Ali came off the ropes and knocked him out and I think that that's a moment very close to where we are now\nA Trump has expanded massive amounts of energy and political capital on a whole stream of initiatives but in fact they've had very little effect\nReally has said he's going to go out in the Paris climate accord is you say he has some really might\nHe hasn't done it on my point is that the laws much bigger than Donald Trump\nWas asked can you stay the uses of your book and three words and I said yes\nHe's not winning in the flurry of activity as with George Foreman it looks like a lot of happening but when you're actually measure the long term impact he hasn't prevail so all they've done to make an announcement or so this leads to an interesting phenomenon\nThe United states across the board has resigned but not left for many of these organizations were still in the Iran deal\nUntil the end of twenty team but in these arrangements which the United states helped to create we now have little or no informs because who wants to listen to a lame duck\nWhat if it gets to Tim's\nWell I mean that's the question a lot of what he has been able to do is because you had majorities in both houses but uh if you're asking what does it look like when I'll eat comes off the ropes you could see the following scenario the Trump loses one or both houses of Congress\nAnd then suddenly it might be that the traditional Republicans decide that Trump is not their candidate for twenty twenty\nFor the first time in a very long time we have a coalition government between\nTrump bites and traditional Republicans and they have a few areas of overlap of interests\nBut if I'd group decides that Trump is not the candidate who's going to get them back into the White House and twenty twenty or they have others available um for example Nikki Haley UN ambassador just resigned housing and again\nDid you think ... resignation was in terms of international isn't within the Trump Administration\nWell you know in the length of a blind the one I does is queen she was better than the others but her basic philosophy ... little sense there are rumors that she was the person who wrote the famous anonymous out bad and that this was a face saving way for leave I don't know if that's true\nOr maybe she just decided which I think it's fair that she had gotten this much mileage out of this issue's going to get you know being associated with Donald Trump isn't good for your long term reputation\nDoesn't matter if he's trying to undermine it\nThe national low given that international lawyers all very well

find to be a certain without a rough confirmation\nDo you think he got a real deal you knew him pretty well presumably\nA I think that um are you supposed to do three researchers tell the truth uh act like a Supreme Court justice and show that he's knowledgeable and trustworthy I don't think he'd done any of those things in\nYour book is also a cool to watch and I suppose isn't to walk kind\nWell a

that were challenging the lower court ruling that found them liable for promoting and selling lead based paint for decades when they knew it was dangerous Here's NPR's Nina Totenberg\nBowl\nAnd or\nA big election yesterday and the German state of Bavaria things did not go well for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her already strained coalition miracles part of the Christian Democrats as the sister party in Bavaria the Christian social union and that party lost its long held absolute majority in a very yesterday\nAnother ally the Social Democrats also fared badly the big winners the center left Green Party and the far right AFDC the alternative for Germany party\nMelissa Eddie is the Berlin Correspondent for the New York times\nI think what we're seeing here is that migration itself remains a really hot button issue on the one hand you have the far right that has pushed back against the migration issue but at the same time that has galvanized I wouldn't say the far last but the central laughed\nA lot of voters who feel they want their country to be open they want their borders to be open they want a dynamic pluralistic society and they are starting to push back against the far right\nSophie ... a little on that push back because I'm a support for Merkel drained away to the greens are in a very but also some votes went to the FDA but they're also previously undecided voters or people in twenty Thirteen who didn't vote who wound up supporting both the AFC immigrants so\nToday do the greens on the left have more support than the AFC on the road\nThe greens are are are making a stronger come back and the interesting thing is is the greens were originally themselves a fringe party that grew out of the environmental movements of the late seventies and eighties and\nOnly came into power at the federal level in Berlin and in the Nineteen nineties so it's been very interesting to see them\nSort of move into this vacuum if you will in the center that as being left by the collapse of support for the main centrist parties which is Merkel's party and then the Social Democrats\n[noise] so what is the Green Party doing right because they walked away with more than doubled their results in Bavaria than in the last election\n[noise] well the Green Party tends to be very strong in urban centers or you know climate change is a really big concern for a lot of Germans here it has been for many many years and so the Green Party that has been there a key issue a since their existence and I think that\nHas helped them out [noise] the greens have also always banned for the idea of a very multicultural pluralistic society and\nYou know the the history of what the Nazis\nIn this country what the right is capable of has always been very strongly in the minds of many Germans and the greens have just been able to capitalize on that idea of we do not ever want to go back to a dominance of the far right we have seen in the past century where that will lead us\nSo it just does a little bit more about the Green Party like how big are they in how president are they in German politics right now and should we expect to be hearing more about them in the future\nRight now they've been polling as the second strongest party interestingly enough at the national level and that certainly wasn't the case last year and the election they really struggle to get in so I think they benefited very much in the past year from the entrance of the AFC into opposition\nUh by sort of insisting they don't want to lead the opposition over to the far right and people have rallied around that idea\nMelissa ... what does this mean for ankle America because after the federal elections last year a winter coalition fail to get a strong majority in parliament a lot of people said this is the end of the road for Merkel at least the beginning of the end of the road so after this regional upset and Bavaria how much further does this take us down toward the end of the road for Merkel\nWell that's really the central question to come out of this election we're going to be looking to the state election in ... which is coming up in two weeks' time where her party holds the governorship\nAnd if they are to lose that it could really uh make things difficult for her in December when her party goes to vote for a new leader\nMost Eddie the New York times

GBH here in Boston long before he became president Donald Trump wrote in a tweet in which he called climate change a hoax now in an interview with sixty minutes he's reversed himself\nPresident Trump told the CBS program yesterday that he does not believe climate change is a hoax\nBut he also said he's not sure if climate change is manmade\nLook I think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um\nI don't want to give trillions and trillions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put at a disadvantage\nSo the president told sixty minutes we're going to fact check some of what he said for that I'm joined by the world's environment reporter Carolyn Beeler Hi Carolyn markup [noise] so let's start with this moment\nLook I think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again\nHeroine will the climate change back again\nSo Trump there seems to be talking about the natural cycle of earth warming and cooling um this has happened in the past that's why we've had ice ages and glacial retreat\nBut humans in the past century or so have pumped so much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere that we are now literally off the charts when we look at the natural variation and we're not going to go back to the way it was anytime that's relevant on a human timescale\nOr here's another Trump statement\nI don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade\nOr we know there is a strong scientific consensus that climate change is in fact Mamet wrote\nThere is even among Trump's own scientific and see if this is what a NASA website has to say I'm quoting here the current warming trend is a particular significance because most of it is extremely likely to be the result of human activity since the twentieth century\nRight greater than Ninety five percent likelihood of by the way and finally this argument from Trump about acting on climate change causing us lots of money\nI Will say this um I don't want to give trillions in trillions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put at a disadvantage\nRight and that's a common argument from politicians that given away from fossil fuels would cost a lot drew a false\nWell there are a couple of different ways that people poke some big holes in this argument\nThe first is looking at the cost of changing our economy versus the cost of inaction and many studies have shown that there will be a significant drop in global GDP if we don't do anything to combat climate change because of the loss of productivity increased storm damage et cetera\nAnd that is true specifically for the U.S as well as globally another thing to look at is jobs\nIt's true that with any structural shipped in the economy there will be winners and losers think about folks who lost their jobs in factory that automation has ribbon but there's also the argument to be made that there are a lot of job opportunities that come with shifting toward a green economy and\nRight now there are about two and a half times the number of people working in the solar industry here in the U.
