Ninety One festival with a husband Brendan when the gunman opened fire she told me what happened\nWell written I knew when the concert itself is pretty special to me and my friends and family in two thousand Seventeen last year we were staying at Mandalay Bay\nFor some reason on um Sunday night everyone was like a little antsy about separating so we all decided we were just going to stay together I mentioned go not up closer and everyone said why don't we just stay back here tonight that was just a little bit now looking back\nA strange coincidence and probably what might have saved our lives to its team was one of the people were really looking forward to seeing hearing hearing can sing um he was on one of mine and my husband's favorite songs sell off we made sure we were standing right next to each other when he was seen any old our store\nYou know at the end of the song my husband or the police started to say\nAre those and an expert out his mouth is going to be done shots but he didn't really advocate those without his mouth because at that point\nWe saw kind of a wave of people coming towards us so he got me and we started running and then I started running an automatic sounding gunfire started where it was just um he he couldn't denied that it was shot Seymour\nThankfully we were really close to an exit and were able to run and tell where it was coming from no not at all it was a it was so loud it just didn't seem like I couldn't even out of nowhere ended up coming from that was really fun that because it was just you know so it seems so in your face I mean we could hear at the actual with the noise of the bullets going by us\nBy our ears their heads as we're running\nThere was a parking lot right across the street from where we got out and we just ended up diving behind them so car we'll some tires and trying to just stay there it just seemed like it got louder and closer and it never stopped we could get a break and go okay it's fine it's okay you know everything's okay I'm going to start up again and I remember at one point I just\nLooked to my husband and said is this ever going to end and it didn't seem like it was going to end\nDid you find that you see people get hits\nI didn't focus on any of that I was ... I um I didn't personally see anyone um\nDown like from the gunshot right there we stop people injured along the way and bloodied but thankfully I was having to see that a few of our friends are standing next to people that just dropped the gown and they were thinking gosh that person's really drunk and then\nEnded up looking like they're flashlight and they're starting to have some of our fence I some really horrific details yeah um\nAre you a behind a call ...\n... at that point we thought we should go try to head towards the Mandalay Bay 'cause that's where a stain little we know that was a horrific idea because that's where the gunshots coming from and at one point I remember one of the ... we ... I wanted to stop and hide and he looked up and notice that we're standing right in front of two jet fuel tanks\nAnd he said at that moment um we have to get away from the because if these get shot it's just over ... it's going to blow up and then the ironic thing of all that was the shooter didn't deep she does um the steel tanks and thankfully they didn't ignite and that's another thing that I just think like what if what if that would have happened 'cause that would have been all\nHow you could have been standing at the front you could have stayed behind these gas tanks which were it but you're telling the story now and you're sounding incredibly calm but you must have had plenty of time to reflect on the fight lock\nGoing on right now I'm struggling a year later with more than other emotions as um you know even to the point with the like hearing the bullet whizzing by like if we would have taken a step to the right straight not bullets with him by her head or to the left or I'm been standing you know two feet close or\nWhat would have happened and why were we spared and other people weren't because\nIt was just too many weird coincidences it may may be saved our lives but it didn't say those people live so that's a little bit of a struggle a year later that I'm having more than I was initially right afterwards because I just feel like we had a lot of chance things happens that went against\nAh the normal odd that we you know that normal things that that weekend and\nHow long have you tried to coax since it happened\nOf the main things that really helped me was our city got an a hockey team this past year or the first year and our hockey team\nAmazing they made it all the way to the Stanley Cup and they really feel the city and in a way which is that they know very strange but they just really made our city be able to focus on something positive and am faced the situation and they always that up for\nUm for the city and for what we went through and always honored are survivors and that people that were the victims of the the shootings that that was also strangely healing for me\nAnd of course one of the reasons that so many people died was because the ... the shoe to\nUsed bump stocks these devices which essentially to a semi automatic rifle into into a machine gun into a fully automatic rifle I just want to play you something today because President Trump was asked about the ... the plan to to ban bump stocks at a at a news conference ... someone listen to what do you have to say\nSo in order to eliminate terminated bumps us we have to go through a procedure or we are now at the final stages of that proceed in fact the lawyers were just telling me and over the next couple of weeks I'll be able to read that but you can't just write it up because\nRules and regulations in this country a really tough even for something like that so we're knocking out bump stocks I've told the n._r._a. I've told bump stocks are gone but it's a process that takes stature to earlier takes about a year to do with\nPresident Trump saying it takes a long time when you hear and what do you think\n[laughter] um yes I get that's how things work but\nUm it seems like when lives are lost it there there's ... maybe more action that at like I mean even executive action that can be taken against things like that\nThe bumps on things like I mean I'm Glad that I think it's ridiculous that um that was even something that's legal or that wasn't not allowed before so I guess to me I ... I should be a little bit more like happy about that\nUm to me it's a little bit of a band aid I'm a person that has a zero place for guns in my life you know I I'd be happy if I Lived in a place like Australia where guns are not allowed but I understand I made that choice to live in America I Love America and I understand that we have a constitution I\nDon't understand how something like this where it's become quite the epidemic and we were living children how\nThings can't be looked at more logically how we can at least research that because literally the only country in the world that

jak spear President Trump is announcing the completion of a new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico more from NPR's Mara Liasson\nSo can you tell us how your system is different from the system but failed to work\nThe main difference between our system and those systems is the lack of a bully that's on the surface things that can get vandalized things that can be damaged in heavy seas and additionally our system communicates remotely to the shore the acoustic signals\nYou mentioned vandalism I mean that was a problem with the system failed to work weren't a lot of the ... just stolen\nI don't know the specifics but in the early days of discussing making these new prototype systems that was one of the concerns is that the systems had been vandalized\nYeah so you're prototype is on the sea floor but it's more than a thousand miles from where the silhouettes they nominees struck a and that the epicenter of the quake how helpful wouldn't have been on friday\nWell that particular system may not have been helpful but in the larger picture of the program\nRather than they are just being one censoring on the ocean bottom there would be multiple sensors on the ocean bottom a and they could be in very strategic locations around the area and then each one of those if they made a measurement or multiples if they made a measurement could send that information back to shore acoustic like\nSo there'd been at least ten nominees to hit Indonesia the century so far I mean the death toll is up in the thousands what would it take to get your system up and running to be able to alert people throughout the region\n[noise] it's just a matter of time and having the local governments installed the appropriate infrastructure at the moment we're waiting for the next phase of testing to take place over in Indonesia I think in the spring to which the Indonesian government is installing this cable infrastructure\nKeenan ball with the woods Hole Oceanographic institution and thanks very much for your time today yeah no problem\nAnd that to a different subject of scientific research the health of the Amazon rain forest in South America the fate of the forest is intertwined with out of the indigenous people who live there and the animal species in the forest is no exaggeration to say that the Amazon is also tied to the future of the world's climate\nThis week on the world we're going to explain why the Amazon is even more consequential than ever recorded Sam eat and traveled there recently for us and our partners that the nation magazine and PBS NewsHour Sam joins us now here in our boss in Studio so Sam what does the future of the Amazon have to do with the future of the climate yeah Michael often\nHear of the Amazon for it's incredible biodiversity less often and more so actually you're hearing about the role of the Amazon in the climate a lot of times we'll call their lungs of the planet but actually the\nDiverse it's absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nThe trees grow as they as photosynthesis happens it absorbs CEO too so it's this immense carbon store of the planet providing this incredible service for us the idea for this series of stories that we're going to be running this week on the world\nCame up about a year ago when science magazine published probably the most important and least noticed climate paper in years scientists from Woods Hole Research Center in Boston University found that tropical forests in the Amazon\nAnd around the world have been so degraded by logging and a burning of the forest and agriculture that they're actually releasing more carbon into the atmosphere then they're storing this flipping of these carbon sinks to carbon sources has huge implications for the planet\nCarlos ... is one of the researchers studying this carbon cycle down in the Amazon this is what he had to say\nIf there was that which is the biggest ... stops doing these missiles surface of sequestering carbon from the ...\nThe idea is that you were ... and it was an issue too will show a great city increments they has ...\n... what the ... I mean when he said greater increment\nBasically he's he says that we're going to see higher C. O. two concentrations in the atmosphere or the Amazon used to be taking something like all of the emissions from all the cars on the planet and absorbing it into the forest that's not happening anymore\nSo tell us where you went in the very large forest in South American who did you talk to you know we're talking about a a forest that's the size of the lower forty a United States so a massive area and the idea was\nTo go to the what's called the arc of deforestation this is where the agricultural frontier is basically chewing away at the edges of the Amazon and we wanted to talk to as many of the players so you have basically a logging on the front and then you have cattle ranching and then you have these agriculture kind of coming out on the tail end these massive soy farms\nAnd the idea was to talk to as many of these players as possible and piece together all these complex elements that are behind the rising deforestation rates in the Amazon right now\nSo if the metaphor is as you said earlier the lungs of the world are no longer inhaling what they use or they're not coughing what is your take from this whole set of stories that we're going to hear\nI mean I think the biggest takeaway from this is is that there is no clear villain or it's not just\nThat you know the illegal loggers going and we need to stop the bulldozers it's all of us essentially so if you're eating beef if your eating other meat that is that's the way that comes from the Brazilian Amazon if you're building a deck that has ... which is one of the highest value hardwood coming from the rain forest\nYou know this is affecting the future of the Amazon Forest and this is something that affects all of us because if we are going to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement\nIs not going to happen without these forests we actually need to be growing more trees not cutting them down\nYeah and that list you just went down from burgers too hard with like ... from the Amazon will give a lot of Americans pause so a not very encouraging picture and was serious consequences or what hope is there any glimmers\nYeah this was a big focus of our reporting a there's a lot of energy happening down there I'm Around indigenous entrepreneur is small farmers people that are trying to create a standing forests economy how do you value the forest economically more so than cutting it down as a way to kind of get away this duality of\nConservation on one side and extraction on the other which is a very much you know a losing game assets as it's been\nAnother glimmer of hope or the indigenous groups that are protecting their forests and this is\nOne of the best protections they've found scientists documented this hum that indigenous groups who have\nClear land rights entitled to their land this is one of the best protections against the forest station\nSo I spent a lot of time with these indigenous groups that have basically taken you know protecting their forced into their own hands they've organized these vigilante militias that patrol their lands to keep the constant pressure of illegal logging out of their lands\nThey've also taking the fight to Brasilia to protest what's happening politically which is rolling back a lot of these indigenous rights so that you can open up their lands to mining an agriculture and I'm One of the organizers of an event that I was there where it was like three thousand indigenous people from a hundred different groups showed up in Brasilia\nAnd protested they marched I'm Sonja ... is one of the main organizers that she's also a vice presidential candidate in the upcoming election and this is what she had to say\nAbout living here in as a heads up with daisy\nShe so she's saying the indigenous people have basically been fighting these forces for millennia and she's saying that the fight is for forest that benefit not just the indigenous people but all of humanity so this is not just their cause it's everyone's\nThe lungs of the planet the Amazon reporter Sam eating looking forward to your stories this week and that starts tomorrow you're in the world thanks very much for coming and thanks Marco

World Service P. R. I. N. W. GBH here in Boston the United states Canada and Mexico have come to a last minute agreement to update the north American free trade agreement just don't call it NAFTA two point oh calls\nUs embassy a sort of just work and [noise] President Trump at the White House today\nUs MCA is short for the United states Mexico Canada agreement\nKind of flows off the tone joining me now in the studios of the world's Jason Margolis a could've been a riff on ... you know your abbreviated that to happen it could have been taught possibly a missed opportunity Jason you've been writing about NAFTA for a long time now how how are people reacting to this new NAFTA the U.S MCA\nRight well there's the politics and then there's the economic side of it and the quick political reaction is from President Trump we had the worst deal in the history of the world and now it's the greatest deal in the history of the world\nThis landmark agreement was in cash in jobs pouring into the United states and into North America good for Canada good from Mexico instead of jobs leaving for overseas they will be returning back home and we've already had it\nAnd the truth is what was agreed to yesterday it's not a radically different trade agreement from NAFTA it's an updated deal so it's a bit like saying I have a a a baseball team I got rid of a couple of players who was the worst team ever knows the best team ever so when you look at the economics it's not it's not a radical overhaul it updates things\nJason when you come right down to a what's really different about us MCI from NAFTA\nSo there are some changes to some key industries for example autos\nAre now requires that Seventy five percent of a car must be made in North America Canada the U.S Mexico\nIn order to qualify for no tariffs under the new deal the what is it in the U.S MCI doesn't quite flew off my town yet I'm One of the things got a lot of attention is us dairy farmers will have more access to the Canadian markets\nCanadian dairy farmers are not happy about that or they feel they've been used as a political upon this is David ... she's the vice president of the dairy farmers of Canada and that's what he had to say\nThe message sent to are passionate crowd and quality cautious people is clear they're nothing more than a bargaining chip to satisfy President Trump\nYes so Canadian dairy farmers not happy I'm can President Trump counts as accurately as a big political when\nI think so it does bring NAFTA into the twenty first century it addresses intellectual property the age of ... I mean this was passed in the early nineties so it does update things\nBut also keep in mind that I spoke with Jason for men who served as President Obama's chief of the council of economic advisors\nHe said yeah this is great that we have some certainty and things are moving forward but all these things were negotiated under an updated Trans Pacific partnership not all these things most of these things were updated the sweat from and told me this morning a\nLot of this is getting things back that Canada had already agreed to in another agreement two years ago\nWhat happens now when does this deal become real\nSo the easy part is done getting the three leaders of these countries to reach an agreement in their trade representatives now comes the hard part and here's President Trump speaking today the White House\nWhen I play a decidedly agreement by the end of November by then we'll submitted for approval to Congress where in theory there should be no trouble but anything you submit the Congress has trouble\nOr no matter what the single greatest agreement ever say they'll say well you know drop likes it therefore we're not going to approve it because that would be good for the Republican so therefore we get the port of it\nDoes strike me though that the Republicans will still be in control of Congress at the end of November\nThey will but this will probably lead into next year\nAnd remember a lot of Democrats were with President Trump on this issue they wanted NAFTA to be updated they felt it was very unfair to labor or they want an environmental provisions and I have not read through this entire revision nor have my sources this is thirty six chapters and he's chapters\nTen to twenty pages so it's going to take many weeks to digest this and little parts of going to be coming out like\nHow did the Florida tomato growers fair how did the avocado growers fair how did this industry fair how did that industry we don't really know the nitty gritty and remember with all trade deals there are winners and losers and there's going to be people in Canada the U.S and Mexico who say yes I really\nCame out well in this I came out ahead and other people saying you did what you did what to my industry so\nThat is going to be coming out in the next few weeks\nYeah we'll have to see the details of the world's Jason Margolis telling about the new NAFTA known as the United states Mexico Canada agreement thanks very much to us and Mexico\n\n\nThe Trump administration's treatment of undocumented migrant children is in the news again over the weekend the New York times published a report about a tent city in West Texas where many of these children are now being held this tent city in the town of tornado Texas has been massively\nExpanded and hundreds of immigrant minors have reportedly been very there from shelters elsewhere in the country in the middle of the night\nOne important no these are not the same kids who were separated from their parents at the border early in the summer some of them are still being held in process by the government\nThis is a different population these miners in the west Texas camp are mainly teenagers who were detained after trying to enter the country by themselves Leah ... is an attorney with the women's refugee commission\nJust can't is you know pretty remote it very far from El Paso which I think the closest city there's not a lot of vegetation is just you know kind of think that picture's really speak for themselves there's rows and rows of tents that aren't that\nChildren living quarters or they have a couple other facilities on site dining facilities and the like but\nBut it you know it is remote and it and\nIt feels like you're kind of in the middle of the time\nI Know that you are at the women's refugee commission have concerns that this large scale camp makes kids more vulnerable can you elaborate on that how how does it do the\nYou know let's say that a child was moves from Philly where they were maybe thirty bad a capacity for each other and so much more of a home the environment they have access to education so they'll receive some kind of classroom instruction and basic\nYou know basic subjects learn some English also have regular attention they'll have regular access\nTo medical care you um you know mental health support psychologist a lot of these children are suffering you know I may have experienced trauma either you know in home country is the reason for leaving and or possibly route and so\nAnd so it's very important that these children have you know the attention that they need and the access that they need to you and so I think in a big facility will return to these big facilities like twenty or emergency just already we see that um you know there isn't the same provision for education um\nBecause you know we were told the kids get work books but\nThat's not a education you know a far cry from classroom education and um in terms of any kinds of melt mental health care you know emotional support anything along those lines it's really ad hoc it's really the onus is on the child to to ask for it\nBut you know they've just been transition there from a different facility and they don't know anyone there just oriented you know the possibly upset about it and so I think it's really difficult in those situations coupled with being with thousands of kids you know hundreds of other kids um it's just evil I think\nYou're a member of mine kind of boggles when you think about the Thirteen to Seventeen year olds and what they're thinking legally I mean they have any legal help if they can access\n[noise] um well that's a great question so um you know it doesn't happen in every facility but you know by and large children at the permanent\nShelters are provided with an you know no you're right ... and um they receive screening and so in some cases some of the children are able to get legal support through that was on the news um", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "year": "2018", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "01"}
