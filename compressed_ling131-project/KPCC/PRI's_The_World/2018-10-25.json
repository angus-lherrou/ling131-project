New York city officials are hailing a security guard who alerted police the discovery of yet another suspicious device that actor Robert De Niro his office in Manhattan\nAnd to me a that's fought analytical because Trump is given as a unique\nWindow that we've never had before into the real time thinking of a president he blows everything out and more importantly words have consequences and that example where the president in the midst of the controversy over the disappearance and apparent murder and dismembered men of Saudi journalist ...\nThe president is cheering on violence against a journalist\nWas the sort of horror find context of that comment of course it matters in my view the fact that uh subsequently we've had this wave of pipe bomb sent to Democrats enter media figures around the country at a time when the president seems to be laughing and celebrating violence\nToward journalist you know it seems to me not only wildly on presidential but clearly there is a connection between the atmosphere in which a leader is a enabling or empowering those who might be encouraged to undertake violent acts\nUsually connection to those laws as ms ... and and he called the personality you might have seen at these rallies\nAbsolutely I go back to the comment during the twenty sixteen campaign you know that I could shoot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue and they would still follow me and those who have studied this kind of rhetoric from other divisive populace figures have also observed\nThat outside of the United states the context in which a charismatic authoritarian meaning leader wants people to embrace his narrative of the world even and perhaps especially so when he's promoting not facts\nBut an alternative version of reality because that makes them more tied to him and to his view of the world\nSo finally Susan how are you seeing this with Trump being rhetoric reverberating around the globe right now\nThere's no question you know you have populations in places like Poland and Hungary cheering Trump on and actually endorsing leaders who are quite similar in many ways who came before Trump and so I think this is a phenomenon of political\nPresentation of confrontation with them divisiveness that new politics of fear that is with us in many different place it how much do they inspire each other how much did they learn from each other I think there's some compelling evidence that a fair amount\nSusan Glasser with a New Yorker thanks very much thank you Susan mentioned in the murder Saudi journalist ... who was killed inside the Saudi conflict and assemble there were no real questions about the role crown prince Mohammed bin ... played in all this evidence\nThe journalist specializing in the middle east he says the ... the episode of terrific but it does present an opportunity for the United states to reset its relationship with the Saudi monarchy\nWe have a regime that has stepped over the line of international norms in a really big way in a way that is broken through to the American public and so if we are ever going to reconsider this relationship that we have in the middle east since two thousand Thirteen which is a relationship with new authoritarians it should be now\nAs far as the crown prince and Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin saw him on what do you see is the the us role in kind of creating this persona I mean he was handed power by the father right\nRight so king some on elevated Mohammed than some under crown prince over Mohammed ... who was sidelined by monitoring so much very few people who are privy to the internal machinations of Saudi court but\nI think what the United States it is except this now it's not that we determined the line of succession Saudi Arabia nor should we but when the new factor leader of the country have been some I'm begins doing things that are destabilizing to regional security and that are also\nVery detrimental to human rights\nAbroad and at home that's when the United states plays a role and what we've done very clearly is enable the worst tendencies of this new defective leader moment in salon whether that's the war in Yemen in which the United states provides very important refueling and intelligence support\nAnd other aspects of it we probably don't know that aren't public but in\nNot really creating any penalties for increased repression at home or what's much more closely tied to the ... case is the essentially the kidnapping and rendition\nOf dissidents abroad those dissidents and members of the royal family this has been going on now for a few years and you can draw more or less a direct lived from all of these\nAuthoritarian behaviors and bomb and been so long to\nThe apparent attempt to kidnap oh Shorty and his murder\nSo if you have Donald Trump's ear right now what would you tell them what would be the way forward\nWell I Would probably tell him that this is the Saudi regime that has essentially violated its various sort of agreements with America and how to do business has made the Senate and the administration looked very bad\nWhich I think matters especially to the president it's not a good deal in fact the American Saudi relationship I've argued for a fundamental rethinking if not breaking off of the whole thing you've got a president who's very transactional who has\nTalked about hundreds of thousands or a million jobs being created by arms Saturday when in fact arms sales to Saudi Arabia the hundred and ... and roughly a hundred billion dollars that were from is I Believe in two thousand Seventeen very small percentage of that has actually been signed or obligated in any way and will create may be some\nThousands of jobs many of those jobs are going to be in Saudi Arabia so I think that even from a transactional or realist prospective leaving aside\nThe human rights perspective it's not a good deal for the United states\nWhat would you like to hear specifically out of the White House right now what would you think would be a good thing to hear\nWhat we need to hear from the White House is that they are first they're going to take the letter from Congress initiating an investigation under the global Magnitsky Act seriously and that they're going to truly investigate this wherever it leads\nAnd then they'll listen to their information being provided by the intelligence community so that the thing is not going to be swept under the rug and that they will follow it wherever it leads and if that means that\nThe killing of Janelle Herschel gee implicates the highest levels of the Saudi port including crown prince Mohammed bin some on that there will be serious consequences for Mohammed bin ... Mont\nAnd additionally I think that Indian support for the war in Yemen and ending the arms sales regime with Saudi Arabia but which fuels they're sort of disasters adventures in the region or both steps you drop in ministry shouldn't should take that would not be harmful to the to the average Seventy cents\nEvan hills a journalist with an eye on the middle east is article the new Arab Winter isn't slate Evan thanks very time for having\nSaudi Arabian ties with American universities yesterday we featured an interview about that we've got a follow up we heard yesterday how some academics see those Saudi ties is morally problematic especially in the wake of the murder of democracy ... we heard from ...

World Service P. R. I. N. W. GBH here in Boston\nThe Trump Administration said this week it's considering scrapping unimportant Cold War treaty the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty also known as I N F\nIt was under President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Nineteen eighty seven they agreed not to develop missiles with ranges between three hundred and three thousand miles the goal prevent a surprise nuclear attack using those medium range missiles\nAre still seems like a good thing so why scrap it now\nAs we reported earlier this week the U.S accuses Russia of violating the treaty but there's a good argument to be made but the move to scrap it may have more to do with China\nChina has never been a signatory of the treaty\nThat's Laura Seligman she's Pentagon correspondent for foreign policy\nAnd so as such it has been able to build up over the past Twenty years Thirty years a vast arsenal of conventional weapons in that intermediate range that now threatening freedom of navigation in the region and they can threaten us ship particularly our aircraft\nCarriers that are very vulnerable and the fact that the U.S is a party to this treaty and China is not has really hamstrung that United States military in the region from protecting ourselves but not just protecting ourselves but also protecting our allies\nSo since Nineteen eighty seven when the treaty was signed China has been arming up as China ever been invited to sign onto the IMF treaty\nCertainly not publicly not that that I Know\nSome people I spoke to said this pulling out of the treaty without even sort of extending an invitation to China to join even symbolically that came as a little bit of a surprise it probably would have looked a little better for the United states at least try ...\nTried to get China into the treaty but those officials also said that there was no way that the Chinese military was going to be willing to give up that missiles that it has developed over the past twenty Thirty years\nYou're just because these are conventional missiles that the Chinese have not nuclear ones yeah that's true and why and twenty a team of China's missile arsenal frighten us warplanes\nBecause of the ... the U.S has been handcuffed to\nDeploying these kind of intermediate range missiles by ship or by planes and as you know in the Pacific there the vast\nVast distances that means it's very very expensive to fly bombers or have ships going around the the out there so we're we're losing a lot of money were not able to strike as promptly and if we can\nPut conventional\nConventional like I had not nuclear weapons in the south China Sea or station then with our allies in Japan being non\nThen that would give us a much more prompt more flexible options\nYou're so ... what you're saying is that China with what has got right now could potentially force the U.S navy to retreat hundreds of miles with these kind of deterrent missiles\nAbsolutely in fact they already are that's been happening for\nLast five or ten years the U.S navy has been warning that that increasing sophistication of that Chinese missiles and anti missile systems anti aircraft that had been for saying that aircraft carrier in particular that carrier strike group\nFurther and further from the shore making us less and less effective at enforcing freedom of navigation and the interest of our allies in the Pacific region\nRight so the danger to our allies like Japan or Taiwan or the Philippines if the U.S Navy's forced to retreat from those Chinese missiles that would expose those hours right\nYes absolutely\nSo ascribing the treaty as some would say makes sense on one level but could trigger an arms race with China\nI think that that is certainly something that people are are a little bit concerned about and not just the China obviously with Russia as well\nSo what happens next was Congress need to vote before the treaty is scrapped\nKnow that President can pull out of the treaty unilaterally that what happens is that administration notification to say that it's playing out of the treaty and then I Believe there is a six month period before it actually takes effect\nSo Congress can object and make it difficult but the president can unilaterally collapse and I will I Will just just say that there had been records John Bolton and knock out right now\nJust recently said we're not going very quickly on lists I Know we've announced that we're going to talk to our allies first but it does make this seem pretty inevitable that we're going to get out of this treaty\nLower Seligman Pentagon correspondent for foreign policy thanks for being with us thank you\nThe Chinese government is also asserting its power domestically exhibit a a crackdown against the weaker ethnic group in western China the leaders are a Muslim minority in ... province on the world we've talked about the Chinese government's mass surveillance and detentions of thousands of leaders in huge prison camps\nThe government calls it cultural re education\nWas talked about the Chinese leaders enlisting more than a million Chinese civilians members of the Han ethnic majority to help with the re education Darren ... an anthropology professor at the University of Washington he's been following this closely\nThird asking people to go into a week or villages into their homes and teach them how to be hard to simulate and they're also at the same time taking large numbers of leaders could be up to a million ... out of their homes out of their villages and into a re education camps system where there is more intensive training happening\nI'm so there's multiple approaches some people are still in their homes and villages and being told to assimilate there and others are being sent into these prison camps\nAnd what are they actually doing they're like what does a normal day of re education at a weaker home look\nLike most of the pond civilians that are coming into the homes are only saying for a period of a week two a month in some cases\nWhat typically looks like is a lot of political events there's often flag raising ceremony you go out and you swear allegiance to the Communist Party there's a red songs singing patriotic songs singing activities\nThere's films that people watch where they get patriotic education there's also cultural events that people participate in their drinking events basically testing to see if there's any reticence to doing this sort of thing because for ... Saddam is not comic activity all of these things are tests of the loyalty of the we are subject to the Chinese state\nThey're trying to see how patriotic these people are willing to participate in Hong cultural activities one of the things that the manuals that the haunted billions use one of the things that they advocate is that you asked the children because you'll get honest\nIt's from the children concerning the leaders of the parents\nDo the harm civilians who are in these homes that they report on their host to like some higher authority [noise] yeah that's one of the primary\nGoals of what they're doing a suspect finding mission so they have these manuals that they're using their spots in these manuals that they fill out whatever activities that have been involved in if they've seen anything religious on the walls at the home that sort of thing\nThey're making recommendations as to whether or not the rigors that they're spending time with our safe or unsafe whether or not they should be sent to the re education camps to get formal education were not\nHow are the weaker is reacting to this\nWell many many years that I've spoken to have had ... on civilian staying in their homes have told me that the experiences as the pretty extreme form of eternal wisdom a kind of in ...\nThey feel like it's a violation of their personal space in of their family life there particularly concerned with the way that the ... civilians are treating their children their training their children to speak Chinese weaker language is now something that's forbidden in schools they might see their parents as backward which is what they're basically being taught by the state", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "year": "2018", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "25"}
