name it because of the passport your whole well we can invest in a country but the higher ranking passports and get a new\nSo at least half of the reason why people are doing citizenship by

industry had recently collapsed\nThe country was are they gonna you know sink into poverty all they created this program which then brought a lot of investments into the country and creates jobs\nAlso after Hurricane Maria an amateur hit the tabby and last year some countries began sending their citizenship and a discounted price today's emergency fun but that's not the whole story\nIt's not all

I asked them what the consequences are for Germany today of that policy shift in Nineteen Ninety nine\nWell these regulations have created some problems which would not have been asked me if you're if they are if we had not had this huge influx of immigrants back in time to Fifteen some thing like a news seriousness in discussing these issues same ... ... all it takes a and a\n... I feel that are in the coming months and years or we will have some not overly ideological but practically minded debate on how we should handle our she isn't ship issues\nYes or what I'm hearing is that there have been a lot of ups and downs with citizenship in Germany that tracks migration to the country today twenty Eighteen what have Germans decided that citizenship is\nThere is no comes if there is no agreement as there is a sharp come from\n... ... both but he didn't go to camp and indeed Germany never had had a clear immigration and integration policy and still today Gemini had no good policy on that\nDoes this remind you of the U. S.\nIn one way it reminds me of the U. S. above the difference is that ever since its beginnings us have been on immigration society this has never been the case in Germany and this I feel if the basic difference in the culture of background of all these problems\nOf course that could all change under Donald Trump\nThe ethical change on the Trump and this is why we as Europeans look with so much interest in so much ... of what's going on in the United states and really hope that the United states or will not\nGo down that way that NPR a Gemini winds down being overconfident are over age ... pass a test and uh being\nElla enthusiastic about its wrote in the village\nVernon pots out political scientist at the Technical University of resin thank you very much\nWas a pleasure talking to your\nYour tuned to the world [noise]\nMy neck roaming the headline story in the final days before an election swing voters or do they don't want them and do what they always planned to do is coming up on all things considered weekday afternoon starting at for an eighty nine point three taping\nThe scene we promised you that keep you see these phone number Dr wouldn't start until after the midterm elections we're keeping that promise we're also confronting I drive to justify face that's the usual time\nYou depend on keeping the seat for news and information that mattered whew so we aren't interrupting programming right now but we still need to raise all the money it takes to keep providing the coverage you need donate the for the member giants begin by giving now like Katie the the dot org thanks [noise]\nKey PCC supported include acuity group most vision plans expire at the end of the year for patients who haven't been in an eye exam just simple way to keep their eyes healthy living more acutely group dot com acuity group avocation your fishing\nI market warming misses the world thinks the drop of fact there's a lot of interest around the globe in our mid term elections next week enough to send an Australian political strategist halfway across the planet\nBruce hawk or is his name for the past month he's been traveling around the U.S speaking with voters and filming a documentary about it what struck him so far here's what he said in mind you this was before the Pittsburgh synagogue attack division was struck\nDozens of lawsuits claim Edison equipment spark the Thomas Fire but this is the first time the company has acknowledged get an investigation however is underway to determine the official cost\nBloomberg Philanthropies says donating a million dollars to LA to help residents build backyard housing for the homeless the grant will help cover a homeowner cost for construction\nAnd licensing fees to build a D you this also known as granny flats and only mayor Garcetti says the city will help here landlords with homeless Angelina ...\nYou're probably going to find them to be great candidates are going to match them well with you and it's not quote unquote homeless housing at your age do you make money but you're also helping solve homelessness which so many as they do exactly what they can do crystal\nSaid he says homeowners will not be obligated to rent space to the homeless but if they do the lease will be for at least three years then you program is expected to launch next spring there's a stalled car blocking left lane right now under seven ten north at Firestone\nTraffic has backed up to imperial highway I had ... seniors that time now two thirty in the\nWorld is supported by babble a European made language learning program babble teaches practical conversation in Spanish French German and other languages available in the app store or online ad B a B B.

GBH here in Boston\nUs troops are taking part in too big military operations right now one is faithful patriot involving five thousand plus American troops being deployed to the U.S Mexico border\nI spoke with retired General Stanley McChrystal today who told me what he thinks that operation says about America's leadership these days that's just ahead first way far larger operation now underway in northern Europe it's called Tritan juncture [noise]\nDryden juncture involves some fifty thousand personnel from twenty nine countries it's the biggest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War the main part of the exercise is in Norway reporter Charles Maynes is there in ... so you've been out with the troops as we Charles ... what have you seen in who've you talked to\nYesterday they had a big media Day Adventist was kind of a big ... amphibious assault they brought in air power um all simulating this attack\nAgainst a NATO ally in this case Norway or which triggered article five according to this is the collective defense and this was designed to show the article five still matters today the stage with Norway here as a sacrificial lamb\nWhat was the mood among the troops who spoke with\nWell everyone seemed to be pretty much enjoying themselves a lot of these guys certainly from the United states or they were coming from used mostly the southeastern United States and North Carolina Florida and for them I think of course one of the big ... a kind of stunning aspects of this whole thing is being up\nIn a normal wave course at northern climate in fact I got a chance to talk to a lieutenant Louis and a shaky is that the United States Marine corps or he was one of the rare ones in fact he actually had some experience with this\nBeforehand having taken a cold weather course with Norwegians but he had this bit of advice for his fellow Marines\nI spent a month here ah in the end of the year learning from them and uh I think that someone who isn't as prepared for the cold can learn a few things from the new we changed or typical countries that work in a seven environment Charles for you how cold is it\nWill actually today was a little bit warm but very wet it's hovering around zero depending on the wind chill and things like that and give it a little bit more brutal but you know these guys you talk to you today and we're out with Marines walking around a bit um they all said that the weather's just kind of shifted back and forth are unpredictable weather in Norway as usual for this time of year\nSo let's talk about what this whole NATO exercise try to juncture actually means who's taking part in this\nWell this is a members of old twenty nine NATO allies all twenty nine NATO countries plus partners in Finland and Sweden I'm as you noted in your intro it's it's a massive exercise with fifty thousand personnel are about sixty five ships taking part a hundred that the aircraft or ten thousand vehicles are just massive exercise\nBut in terms of who they are actually directed at well NATO seems to stress that this is all the tissues enemy and of course so does the U.S had a chance to talk with Admiral James logo he's commander of the joint force commanded Naples, Italy was leading the U.S team up here in Norway\nDon't pick any particular individual names using the exercise you're fictitious are we're not interested and I'm picking anybody else territory wires that defensive\nShould protect during a sovereignty and the borders of ... member nations that twenty nine Charles I mean given Donald Trump's criticism of NATO um it is perhaps this exercise a reminder to the president or the United states about article five and his responsibilities\n[noise] yeah I think that's one of the stories you're behind the scenes as a concern over just the U.S has commitment and this in some ways where the reassurance you heard again and again for people from the NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg\nTo the U.S ambassador to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchison saying that you know the NATO alliance as strong as ever um\nIt was interesting to hear also Mr Stoltenberg talked about how again these exercises were not targeted against anyone uh but at the same breath you say you know we're facing the most challenging security environment in a generation and and this brings us back to you know the reality of today and I went out that this is a message to Russia\nFrom states that border Russia such as Norway and the Baltic states you know what really increasing worried about what they see as aggressive behavior particularly after the annexation of Crimea and Russia as a proxy war in Ukraine and this is really a sense that said that you know article five matters and I think that it matters to the Trump Administration\nReporter Charles Maynes in ... in Norway thank you thank you Mark I'm retired General Stanley McChrystal knows a thing or two about war he spent most of his career in special operations and he was also commander of U.S forces in Afghanistan\nNow McChrystal's reconsidering the notion of leadership in a new book it profiles Thirteen leaders from wildly different backgrounds\nBut they had in common was this white hot burning conviction in their cause\nOne of the leaders McChrystal profiles is someone he calls a zealots Musab al Zarqawi the former head of ... in Iraq\nAt one point he had a razor blade smuggled into the prison to Nick cuts off attached to that he put it on in his youth because it is a violation of Islam and the other inmates are able to see that and here's a guy who proves\nThat he's willing to walk the walk all the time and then later as he leads al Qaeda in Iraq it's the same thing it's not the brilliance of his ideas are strategy it just absolute conviction that makes us attracted us his followers people attracted to someone who's so jealous\nSo charisma and passion key for leadership are zealots the good leaders and where does charisma impassioned start to turn it into a tree\nWell it's interesting charisma impassioned are usually good and we as followers are attracted to them but just like zealots they can take us to the wrong place and what we found with ... like a flame that burns so hot that it burns the oxygen in a room\nIn the case of Zarqawi we killed him but he was necessarily going to die because he was burning too hot for the environment which he was in even the Iraqis who followed him didn't share the same level of commitment he did so\nBy the time we killed him I'd like to believe I was at the point where I understood that he believed in his cause just as much as I believed in mind maybe more and who's to say he's not right\nI mean in reality had I been raised in his background and exposed to the things who's to say that I wouldn't have been exactly on the side of the line and and I think that's what's important for all of us to remember just because you disagree with something doesn't make you write\nSo can we talk about your own role was later because you lead these highly classified missions in Iraq that led to massage all Zarqawi in two thousand six being killed you are also the top us commander in Afghanistan a war that's now entering its Eighteenth year as soldiers are signing up as you know who were not even born when the war began\nIs that a colossal failure of leadership\nWell I don't know if it's a failure of leadership because there's been some good leaders are certainly a failure of policy or its lack of success a policy of her talk in Afghanistan and particularly\nWell you had troubles with the Obama administration your bosses and your tenure in Afghanistan was terminated where did the leadership there fail\nWell I mean part of it on my end\nThe reality is although President Obama had a different policy view than I did not hugely different I was you know very supportive of\nWhat he asked me to do but at a point a new story came out or a media story in Rolling Stone magazine\nThat I didn't think was fair but at the same time I'm a commander in Afghanistan and it's not it's my job not to let hot stories land on the desk of the commander in chief so that was my failure whether I disagreed with it or not\nGeneral McChrystal let's talk about current leadership you're retired now and we're seeing us troops play new rules this week we learned that the Pentagon and sending more than five thousand troops to the Mexican border uh five thousand more than double the number of troops in Syria what does that decision tell us about our current leadership\nThe decision to send U.S forces to somewhere like the border is a symbol and in the minds of some Americans have probably says ... how we have an invasion coming or we have an emergency we have to protect the homeland\nAnd while that's not the case it creates that mental image and sending regular military forces down their sins and the idea that we're going to be decisive flipper really defending what we ought to do is put in drones out to get targeting and do airstrikes on the migrant convoy and just stop it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "city": "Pasadena",
