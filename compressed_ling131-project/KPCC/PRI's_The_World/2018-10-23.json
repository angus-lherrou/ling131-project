and I think a given Russian violations of the treaty as well are you ... you have to rely on the ah the facts on the grounds of the\nBest of both inside relations were in a new era and the highlights of Russian interference in us elections is harming them with regards to the U.S has unilateral decision to pull out to the Tracy Mr Bolton has struck a sanguine tone downplaying the risk of or a new nuclear arms race\nBut how could that be the case with President Trump having already talked about upping America's nuclear arsenal a Moscow correspondent is Sarah range but\nWhat I think it's inevitable if you listen to what set by science or a saying at least in public and certainly President Putin has made it clear in the past that if the U.S wants to withdraw from this treaty\nAnd John Bolton said that is going to happen it's simply a question of of when uh the u._s. submit sit formal a notice of that uh if if that happens when that happens then Russia will respond in mirror attempts to whatever the United states does\nI think there's a question about how far Russia in particular can go economically on this you know how much you can afford to keep pouring into\nA developing and then on building producing more missiles but at the moment the intention is absolutely clear that Russia will never any move for the United states\nDoes it help the states that the relationship with Europe is this little ... than it was because it's Europe is going to bear the consequences of this probably isn't it\nWell I think absolutely Europe is going to buy the consequences and in fact that's what people have a point to a they say that Europe is becoming a hostage of an American move and you know I think there's a slight sense here in Russia that\nUh the politicians think perhaps that there is a still time to to persuade the United states to to shift position I sent me the language and the Kremlin although Woodstock warnings that language has been quite calm the tone is being quite calm saying this is a risky step don't take it\nUp and not to alarm is if you like it sounds almost like they expect the United states to step back and they've been sort of suggesting that this is about domestic politics in the United states that\nDonald Trump is simply a saying what's his audience needs to head so I don't know if that's the ultimately going to be true but set me up and get the sense that Russia is really all that worried about what's going on\nAnd to what extent does the suits the domestic political agenda in Russia\nWell it certainly allows president who tend to grandstand beds or if we bear in mind that President Putin has talked about the collapse of the USSR as a as a tragedy and he said he wants to see Russia as a superpower again then I think this allows him to to sort of\nA play that role it puts Russia back a nose to nose with the United states talking about nuclear weapons\nAnd nuclear capability so I think you know it pays very much to domestic audience\nThe BBC's Sarah range but in Moscow let's hear now from Franklin's see Miller in Washington he's principal of the Scowcroft advisory group and so for twenty two years in the U.S department of defense and four years as a senior director for defense policy an arms control on the national Security Council staff\nI asked him if the U.S had made a good decision to pull out to this Cold War arms treaty\nYes because what you heard from your correspondent last good no doubt is what they're telling her but it's the truth on a chip so I think it's important to understand what the facts or this treaty was signed in Nineteen eighty seven that prohibited the U.S and the Soviet Union that Russia\nFor building missiles of anything anything between five hundred and five thousand five hundred and fifty kilometers range\nIn about twenty twelve the Russians began a covert program cheating program to develop such a missile by twenty fourteen twenty fifty and they were testing it which is prohibited by the treaty and about twenty sixteen they were pulling it and they are deployed battalions of these weapons today which threatened Western Europe\nThe United states has abided by the treaty and its entirety so the treaty is that the Kremlin killed this treaty was a very cynical decision to proceed with a prohibited weapons system of course Mr Putin's calm because he's currently deployed weapons while the United states is constrained by the treaty knock to deploy weapons\nSo it's what Mr Trump often says they'd be making fools of us those foreigners\nI wouldn't go that far I Would say that the Russians have cheated on this treaty justice they treated on the chemical weapons convention and used used numbered shock in Salzburg when they're not supposed to have those kinds of weapons anymore\nHow can what the us is proposing which is a thing as nuclear weapons can't possibly make the world is safer place\nGo back to Nineteen eighty seven why did the Soviet Union sign the treaty the Soviet Union signed the IMF treaty because it did not like NATO's captured deployments of ground launch crews and purging to to counter the van Russian ss twenty threat recognizing that there was a NATO counter\nMr Gorbachev signed a treaty mister\nWho is currently free to deploy this treaty violating system without any western counter and American counter to this system which doesn't have to be deployed in Europe can ... it could be the basis of stumps or will say to the Russians there are consequences to violating a treaty and perhaps maybe one or we think this whole thing\nThese weapons that they were talking about Thirty years ago world trained on Europe one day and presumably they will be again not does that concern you a tool\nIt's not a will be it's they are these weapons have been fueled by the Russians and yes it does concern me because it was a member of yours is full\nOf people saying this makes it more dangerous\nBut the ... the Russian weapons are out there right now that's the whole point the Russians are threatening\nWestern Europe with these weapons right now having violated the treaty to deploy them and what we would like is for those weapons to be discarded inscribed\nWe've negotiated with the Russians for four years to ask them to do that they're only response has been to put more weapons in the field so if the west deploys a counter perhaps we returned to the to the days when the IMF treaty was originally negotiated and the Russians back off and we destroyed those new weapons as well\nIf President Trump is passing on short term proliferation delivering on loan to an arms control it's quite a gamble isn't it\nKnow what's the alternative to do nothing and let the Russians continued to deploy additional numbers of violating systems\nWould Russia perhaps ... a a universal treaty bringing the likes of China\nThat's an open question but the way to do that would be the beginning some diplomacy in that regard not to violate the existing treaty input battalions of these weapons in the field to threaten Western Europe and China isn't it\nAnd when John Bolton said that his talks with good humor and and pleasant enough in Moscow do you believe in\nI couldn't possibly comment that wasn't there\nBut it doesn't sound from what you're saying like there's anything good humid all pleasant going on behind the scenes\nLook a treaty is our son and the expectation that both parties will abide by one party has a record of six years of cheating on that treaty it doesn't sound very good for for international diplomacy in fact it undercuts the whole notion of signing treaties and the first place\nFranklin see Miller from the Scowcroft advisory group in Washington DC\nThat was news out thank you for
