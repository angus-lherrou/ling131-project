given how much Saudi money is invested here in the U.S\nThe question that we're interested in it was going to happen going forward for a lot of tech sector a lot of start ups under which has been sort of expecting a\nLot more Saudi money and then there's Saudi oil which surprisingly may not be that big a deal while Saudi Arabia is significant for global oil prices which affect the United states and it's not the case in the United states is vulnerable to Saudi oil news how much damage could they ripped with Saudi due to the U.S economy\nThat's coming up today on the world\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm ...\nAfter turkey claims it has evidence that missing Saudi journalist ... ... was killed inside the Saudi counseling is didn't bowl U.S officials say they want a thorough investigation into what happened something of a secretary of state Mike Pompeo made clear reporters during the refueling stop in Brussels today\nWell Saudi Arabia's previously been a pretty good place for people to invest certainly in the petrochemical industry there have obviously been moments where people have been concerned about the stability of the region\nI think the issue that American corporations need to worry about now is that after this episode with democracy hooked you wouldn't have to wonder about the leadership of the country\nThe narrative that Mohammed bin Salman is arrogant impetuous impervious to good advice seems to have been borne out by their situation\nSo that's I think the I think that's the risk I think the Saudis would say look we have passed laws that make it more welcoming for businesses to come in invest in Saudi Arabia we are committed to pulling Saudi Arabia into the twenty first century like you know so far that hasn't\nReally resulted in tremendous rush into the country\nFrom what you've seen Stephen I mean do the current and potential you as investors see their choice with Saudi Arabia as coming down basically to profits versus principles\nWill certainly principle must be playing some heart the cancellation of major American CEOs when it comes to the devil is in the desert but\nOf course if you look at the history of of business it does seem that in many cases the investment opportunity and the potential to grow their own businesses by investing in a place like Saudi Arabia seems to be irresistible\nWhat's making me scratching my head is the ... I mean what you've been describing is a very deliberate charm offensive but mom had been so I'm On to get us investment into Saudi Arabia so wouldn't be very surprising if the Saudi Government sponsored a hit on the ... of of all the signs appointed to that\nYou're not the only one scratching your head I had been walking around for days\nWondering why they would do something as stupid as this but it seems that this is in fact what has happened and it it goes back to what people have said about Mohammed bin Salman style that he is\nArrogant that he sees Saudi Arabia as a top your country and looking around the world he sees the Russian government bumping up people who they don't like that\nYou didn't jailer of journalists in the world the Chinese had disappeared the head of Interpol and can find a million ... says are Muslim Chinese in concentration camps none of those governments have paid a price\nSo one can imagine the Saudis thinking that they wouldn't pay the price for killing journalist I think it was a a a terrible miscalculation on their part but one can imagine that is the way in which they perceive the world around them and their place in it\nSteven Cook of the council on Foreign Relations his latest book is false dawn protest democracy and violence in the new Middle East thanks very much Steven ...\nAs I mentioned earlier there's also a lot of Saudi money invested here in the U S Eliot brown of the wall Street Journal has been looking into that and what's at stake so first of all what do we mean by Saudi money are we talking about the country's own money or money invested by private sector businesses and people\nYes the former so it's actually out of this fund that they have called the public investment fund which is Saudi sovereign money it's called a sovereign wealth on the spends the country's money in its country and around the world\nSo how much money are we talking about in the sovereign will fund invested in the U.S in us markets in businesses\nSo it's a little hard to track precisely what do you know it's in the order of low tens of billions of dollars a week calculated this is just relating to start ups which is sort of the the biggest chunk of investment they happen to us that we can find is in the order more\nThan eleven billion so far spread around are pretty wide variety of companies\nYeah where do they put their money like how does the Saudi sovereign investment fund different from say a like a pension fund\nSo it's a they actually work relatively similar where they'll give a large chunk of money to individual companies and it just takes takes them and then often not have too much saying how\nThe company works so some companies people will sort of a day on a steak and Tesla they own a large steak around ten percent and over and\nThen there's a very large chunk that has gone to a different fund run by the Japanese company softbank\nAnd they've given them forty five billion dollars to spend on\nStart ups in tech companies around the world so that's where a large portion of of their us investment has has found its way is through the soft drinks on\nYour end as you've looked at to where this money goes what sectors of the U.S economy are the Saudis invested in most heavily\nSo most heavily its tack and start ups at bat because a couple of years ago the the crown prince and Saudi Arabia decided to really sort of take some of their money that is derived from oil and their wealth and try to invest in the future economy sort of out of the realization that\n... in the future oil will run out people will shift to electric cars or people just stopped buying oil and they will need and waited for by their own economy\nSo we've long known about the the kind of money for human rights trade off with Saudi Arabia prior to this episode with ... ... ... how stoked would an American started be to get Saudi money would they be happy about it\nSo I think it ... and they certainly aren't very eager to talk about it right now those that have taken it we reached out to twenty two of them and the only one that got back was over a\nMy sense is that generally they had been sort of believing hoping that the crown prince was a reformer and\nSaturdays darker days were behind it um but they also probably just didn't think about it much because they were offering a lot of money and a lot of it was coming through a different party that being that the softbank fund them and\nSo Elliott relations between the U.S in Saudi Arabia become strained how could these massive investments be impacted\n[noise] so the ones that are already invested such as they over investor I'd rather have a board see it on the company I I think it's sort of what's done has done it it's not like a campaign contribution where it's easy to return it\nThe question that we're interested in is what's gonna happen going forward for a lot of the tech sector a lot of a start up sector which has been sort of expecting a lot more Saudi money to be the rain\nDown on it through the softbank fund which has been really powering valuations and a frenzy out here in Silicon valley and so if if there's a lot more strained relations if it becomes toxic to accept Saudi money\nThat could sort of slow things down out here in Silicon valley\nJust slow them down I mean could U.S companies forced the Saudis to divest if they suddenly saw the real liability\nIt possibly if it's a pretty difficult mechanism that would have to happen for that especially with private companies you know it's sort of hard to see how that would even a happened but I'm a lawyer but yeah I Do think it's more of a sort of going forward type thing\nAnd if the relations between the U.S in Saudi Arabia became really strained would it make any sense for Saudi Arabia to like divest itself in order to maybe hurt the U.S economy ... you could see\nThat I mean in in the trade war with China that we've seen sort of pulling investment as a lever a negotiation\nCertainly just in the past few days it seemed like the Saudis have tried to sort of hurt some of the companies that have pulled out of their conference or at least send a message to them but yet it is a bit of a guessing game here\nElia brown with Wall Street journal really appreciate your time thank you thank you [noise]\nSo can the U.S economy run without Saudi

GBH here in\nBoston we've been talking a lot about the suspected murder of Saudi journalist ... and how concerns over the role Saudi Arabia's rulers may have played in that murder is straining relations with the U.S both politically and financially\nAnd that was talking about the first thing many people think of when Saudi Arabia is mentioned oil and yes oil has been a key part of the U.S Saudi relationship for decades\nOver the weekend in an op ed in Saudi owned news channel it said if the U.S imposed sanctions on Saudi Arabia it would quote stabbed its own economy to death so what's the reality when it comes to the U. S. and Saudi oil for that we turn to Jeff Colgan at Brown university starting point the price of oil right now\nWell it's a trading roughly Seventy two dollars a barrel or these days it could rise it's going to depend on some things that are like fundamentals you know how much oil is being applied to the market or not but the claim in the op ed is is wrong I actually the United states is not vulnerable it's causing me it's not seriously vulnerable to\nSaudi oil news the United states produces more than half\nOf the oil it consumes these days\nAnd of the oil that it imports only ten percent of that\nComes from Saudi Arabia directly wow ten percent\nJust ten percent so so Canada is our number one supplier and it's a far more important player and while Saudi Arabia and significant for global oil prices which affect the United states economy\nIt's not the case that the United states is vulnerable to it and so these kinds of threats from Saudi Arabia or not terribly credible and can largely be disregarded\nI'm just curious where does Saudi rank globally in terms of oil exports he says\nThe threat that the Saudis are making is that they can cause havoc in global oil prices are raising the price of oil overall which would in turn affect the price of us oil and that which you know increase gasoline prices at the pump et cetera\nAnd so that's the threat they're making but it's just not terribly credible because to do that they need to cut their own production and that's going to hurt them financially so to raise the price up they have to cut their own uh and so they might be able to kind of ... uh\nUh in the short term uh without losing too much money but they're going to lose politically and they're going to lose a reputation as a reliable supplier of oil\nSo let me just pursue two scenarios with the U.S living without Saudi oil proposals\nThat ten percent with the U.S would go where to kind of short that up in Canada the U.S imports from\nA huge number of countries and so it could import more from Canada it could import from Mexico or for Norway or from other Middle Eastern countries ... the global oil market is actually very fungible I think of it it's sort of a bath tub with lots of\nOil pouring in from different ways and it all becomes kind of one big pool and then buyers go to stock markets to select their oil off of that and so losing Saudi Arabia oil for the United states would really not be such a big problem because there's always another buyer available\nAnd of us were to say we can live without Saudi oil and Washington cuts way back its ties with Riyadh um what would that due to security in the region because Washington depends on Saturday for some measure of regional stability right\nYes and and here's where I think that you ... the United states needs to walk a fine line because we don't want to go too far with this I think the U.S Saudi relationship has been one historically that has\nTamped down a interstate conflict in the region it's a very volatile regions of course it doesn't look so good but there's nonetheless an effort by us and Saudi Arabia to reduce conflict\nBut lately and this is under the new crown prince new as a couple of years ago I in Saudi Arabia\nThe Saudis have been much more belligerent causing all kinds of trouble in the region including this sort of humanitarian disaster in Yemen but also hostility with neighboring cutter and\nRamping up hostilities with those neighboring countries and so traditionally United States administrations have talked to Saudi Arabia and said listen\nWe don't want that kind of instability stopped doing that\nBut the Trump Administration has given them much freer rain\nAnd that's caused some real problems\nDo you think that the war in Yemen is in some ways maintaining the relationship between us and Saudi Arabia and that there are arms deals in there that Washington likes\n[noise] well I think look defense contractors like selling to Saudi Arabia there are a big purchaser of weapons there's no question about that but I wouldn't want to draw to clear a line about that the relationship between\nThe U.S in Saudi Arabia has always principally been about oil and us as looked for cooperation from the Saudis on oil markets and what's changing now is that the U.S has a lot more\nAbility to say listen Saudi Arabia you need to respect what we're saying to you and and to to work towards peace and stability in the region or we will cut you lose and we can do that because\nYou're actually not able to leverage against us and the oil market nearly as much as you might have been in the past\nJeff Colgan is the author of Petro aggression when oil causes war he's also a professor at Brown thanks very much for being with us Jeff thanks Mica [noise]\nIt's

more than a dozen senior women journalists colleagues he'd worked with as editor several Indian publications Akbar denies the charges and does even filed a defamation lawsuit against one of the journalists Priya Romani she says she looks forward to seeing him in court\nThis one case as part of something bigger though over the past week the me too movement in India has really ignited as more
