I I just think that there's a there's a an inconsistency between the sort of ethical language at the university is using and how they're doing business\nSo that the opinion piece you were talking about that you wrote that was in the guardian correct what kind of reaction did you get\nWe did not get their response we would've liked from Harvard MIT a despite our efforts to get this in front of\nOf leadership um you know there wasn't any public response I Believe president rice didn't make a a response to the MIT students or editorial letter\nBut that was sort of along the lines of well we have relationships with everyone and some Saudi PHD students got to come and isn't that great and of course it's great that Saturday pitched it students can come to MIT but to me that's sort of Mississippi the bigger issue\nSo you are also part of a group of people who urged the Cambridge city council to pass a resolution expressing a its opposition to the policies of the crown prince a you even testified why was it important to go to the community around MIT and Harvard\nIt's important to recognize that when our city is is really being used in a particular way and that's what this relationship with my ... been salon felt like I felt like the ... the city of Cambridge the institutions in Cambridge we're all being used a basically as one giant photo up to\nContinue to legitimize the you know the power that might have been someone was gaining that help legitimize and turn things like the war in Yemen um I felt like as a citizen I had a duty to participate in a very proud of one of my um city council members Clinton's on Durbin for putting forward a very bold\nA policy order which which basically went on record not only against ah the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and they're and they're a record in in Yemen and that sort of\nVery spotty progressive or liberal allies in quote unquote that Mohammed than someone has has undergone but also trying to get to the universities Harvard and MIT and and basically saying\nYou know we are not a playground for you to be having these very opaque a backdoor relationship\nWhat do you think this MIT review shouldn't tell like what would satisfy you\nAt the very least I Would like to see some public acknowledgement that they were voices who were speaking out against this before the ... before the show get fascination and that's not to\nTo necessarily validate you know a Clinton thunder oven or I'm Down in myself but to recognize that\nThe signs were there before this this this assassination and an MIT chose not to look at them and that in terms of the legitimate station that's happening I was ... months these are just very different avenues that he can use to pursue the same the same goals and I think some sort of recognition that\nAh you know when you're dealing with a country like Saudi Arabia\nAnd all the relationships ultimately go back to the same place I think that needs to be recognized and understood because I think when you could do that it's been a little harder to sort of justify each little relationship is being innocent well\nWe've reached out to MIT and Harvard for their responses to their partnerships with Saudi Arabia but have yet to hear back ...
