as\nWe expect on the president's executive order as he seemed to have proposed and\nJose Antonio Vargas isn't surprised by Trump focus on immigration ahead of the midterms the writer has been called the best known undocumented immigrants in America\nBut he's still hopeful but at a time like this I have to believe in love I have to believe in the generosity of people\nI have to believe that we don't struggle of oh that's all head today on the world [noise]\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm jak sphere\nPresident Trump says he is considering in order to end the automatic constitutional right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S to parents who are not us citizens as NPR's Joel Rose explains ... tried to make us immigration crackdown the focus of next week's mid term elections\nUnderneath what it is that we hope citizenship accomplishes for us in order to have this conversation I think partly we have to think about what are the values what is the value of family today that same fourteenth amendment\nThat gave former slaves integrity with respect to their families is being used as a weapon or size\nSeparating families in our country in my view that is not a values that are consonant with the role that citizenship should be playing\nMartha Jones professor at Johns Hopkins and the author of birthright citizenship history of race and writes thank you very much for being with us thanks for having me\nBy the way today Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan reportedly said it's not possible to end birthright citizenship via executive order meanwhile President Trump's visit to Pittsburgh is also in the news on the day of the first funerals were held there for victims of Saturday's attack on the tree of life synagogue\nI've been thinking a lot in the past forty eight hours about all those people who happened to be Jewish in my life who may know there were no hesitation about welcoming me into their family\nThat's Jose Antonio Vargas author of a new book dear America notes of an undocumented citizens burgers was born in the Philippines and has lived in the U.S without papers since he was twelve Vargas was part of a team of journalists who won a Pulitzer Prize at the Washington Post and two thousand date\nWhen he spoke with my colleague Ruben ... he began by describing the role Jewish Americans have played in his life story\nI got to this country and in the early nineties I I didn't really know anything about Jewish people and especially when it got to high school there was as as a family the Greenstein weighed family\nIt was the first time I'd ever had a Jewish friend but I didn't know what that meant either a infant was not only her name's Natalie weighed my classmate then I ended up meeting her mom Gail and ... leader in reader's husband he lie\nAnd then they adopted me into their family and then when I got to the Washington Post I was assigned a professional mentor\nAnd his name was Peter Pearl and he taught me to a meeting of the word ... which I didn't know that was\nAnd he was the first and only adult at the Washington Post that I told that I was really early and he made a very crucial decision the base\nSaved my career to accept you coming out as undocumented yeah and I told them everything fake papers you know everything I had to do to live my way into a job at the Washington Post and I expected him to report me to HR department\nInstead Peter said this is now or a shared problem don't tell anybody else just keep going [noise]\nYeah you describe in the book how you almost have to families why apart from your actual family\nAnd the family of partially Jewish and other people they kind of helped you survive while being undocumented but then at home your family was frustrated with you for coming out is undocumented\nAnd you were getting these conflicting messages how did you navigate that\nWell I mean it was I think a lot of people who grew up in immigrant backgrounds can can relate to this because there's the there's the dynamic at home in a immigrant households\nThat were told that we should watch to much like\nYou should put her head down don't make too much noise we're here to just work we're not here to be visible to be seen and yet I had this other family that was mostly for my high school ... high school and then Peter ... at the Washington Post who just\nWanted me to succeed in all the way I could succeed you know it's like if I didn't have all those people in my life\nWho told me to keep going right that these immigration laws didn't make any sense at all I'm not sure I Would have allowed myself\nTo be courage and to kind of pursue what I wanted to do\nWell is that an important point to make that American citizens helped you survive and thrive in this country\nBecause when we talk about undocumented people like me in this country it's almost as if we exist like islands onto ourselves when the reality is people like me in this country cannot be in this country\nWorking living surviving thriving without all those us citizens who help us out at every juncture at school\nAt work at the church and yet when we talk about immigration special illegal immigration the role of us citizens are are actually not much part of the conversation\nWe're looking at this quote unquote caravan coming up from yeah Central America\nAnd the president saying we're not going to let them in and things like that one thing you did in your book is explain the history up and to the point of your own name and how you ended up being part of the family that wanted to come to the states and how it was influenced by the west can you tell that story\nI think that when we explain why people move to America or white migrants are moving to Europe I think we have a very simplistic way of doing it in America which is what I Know people assumed that migrants know about the statue of liberty or the American dream\nI didn't know anything about that only knew was when I was a kid America was coke was Nike was spam it was the first she's kisses it was all the stuff that my grandparents in America who are natural as citizens you know set to the Philippines to my mother and I\nSo American Capitalism was there was was very presence since I was a kid McDonald's was their right\nAnd I think we don't kind of interrogate what American foreign policy and American economic policy in addition to the wars that we fight that we fought what those reasons have to do with why people move\nYou know I was I was in North Carolina a few years ago when I was doing this Tea Party that and I ended up saying that there are four million Filipinos in America where the third largest immigrant group Mexicans Chinese and Filipinos\nAnd this man got up elderly white man and he said why\nThere's so many of you here and I said well you know sir we are here because you were there the Spanish American war my name is a product of Spanish colonialism will say I'm throwing your Vargas but hosts it doesn't have an accent and they eat because when the Americans to go over after the Spanish American war\nThere typewriters didn't ... so my name is a marriage of Spanish colonialism in American imperialism\n[noise] I'm just a circle back to the beginning we started out talking about the people who helped you become on line and go places where people wouldn't think you'd be able to go like the Washington Post newsroom and now we have\nThis a synagogue that was attacked people who did help refugees I mean do you think people are still helping young people like you and there can citizens are still playing that role and do you think that's going to change\nAbsolutely they're helping I notice [laughter] I Know this is they follow me on Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and they sent me messages I Know this because\nIf it weren't for the generosity\nOf all these people including choose who know a lot about homeland and the search for home if it wasn't for that generosity I don't really know why the sky hasn't\nFallen you know at a time like this I have to believe in love I have to believe in the generosity of people\nI have to believe that we don't struggle alone I Would argue that after this horrific horrific\nTragedy I bet you that more people are going to be more willing to help\nWith Antonio Banderas his new book is called dear America notes of an

GBH here in Boston\nOperation faithful patriot that is the name of the Pentagon has chosen for the deployment this week of more than five thousand troops to the U.S Mexico border a deployment ordered by President Trump just days ahead of the midterm elections\nThe president says the troops are needed to protect the country from an invasion of migrants he's referring to the group of thousands of migrants from Central America currently making its way north through Mexico the motors by the way are still more than a thousand miles away from the U.S border and they're not expected to arrive there for weeks\nThe president's critics were dismissing the deployment as a political stunt ahead of the midterm so what practically can those troops do ... is a reporter with the defense new site military dot com are due to the defense department likes clear mission so what does the mission of these troops\nWhile the request actually it came down from the department of homeland security and it sounds like we're going to be happening with these active duty force says that they're going to be assisting border patrol agents on the ground\nSo they're going to have the military police unit from combat engineers aviation to court and medical personnel who kind of said at the border patrol agents I got to try to address this caravan is it makes its way toward the U.S border\nThe defense department has made clear these troops will be carrying live ammunition what's a justification for the\nWell apparently a secretary of defense Jim Mattis made that call and as long as the troops normally carry weapons they're authorized to do so on that particular mission now it it doesn't sound likely that they're actually going to be coming face to face with any of these people it sounds more like they're going to be\nAt the thing that border patrol agents and their mission and they'll actually be the ones on the front line so that's a little unclear\nSo the president as a commander in chief there is nothing legally to prevent them from doing this but once the troops get to the border what legal authority governs what there'll be able to actually do\nThey do you face some legal restrictions as part of the ... act and that dates back to the Eighteen hundreds but basically limits troops from carrying out domestic\nPolicies inside the you at now there are some there is some wiggle room in that a U.S northern command which department of homeland security is called you send these trips down to the border\nHad some authority to partner with agencies like that when it comes to defending a U.S security interests from inside the U.S\nThey're already several hundred National Guard troops on the border so why did the president ask for more guards rather than going straight to regular forces\nThat wasn't really clearly addressed during yesterday's press conference and it's a good question uh there are as you mentioned about twenty two hundred I Believe National Guard troops along the border and they've been in place since early this spring\nAnd those troops are mostly unarmed and there are there also is just being you know the customs and border patrol agents on on the border\nA President Trump in an interview with Fox News last night made an interesting comment that previous presidents have called up the national guard but he's actually called up the military and it's really one in the same you know there are a part of the military so it's a little unclear why I'm\nPresident Trump wants active duty forces and play for National Guards men it it could be for um maybe a political view of it\n... the other thing is that critics have been saying is that the deployment is going to negatively impact training and readiness ... what have you heard from your sources about uh\nWell I think that is a definitely a concern you know when troops are in their home bases they are typically training and they're they're gearing up for a whatever deployment they're going to be carrying out next taking them away from that mission and putting them on the border\nThat take them away from you know not only training in the field but also some of the military education that they need to carry out to further their careers and some of their other requirements so it is a fair point\nDo you know has any one of the Pentagon discuss how they selected the name of this operation faithful patriot because it doesn't sound totally random [laughter]\nI have not heard anything about how the name uh came came about\nJuno harkens with military dot com thanks very much thank you for having me\nThe midterms and immigration remain top of mind for President Trump less than a week from election day today though he made room on a schedule to travel to Pittsburgh\nIn the wake of the attack on a synagogue there on Saturday to visit with controversial even before he landed the rabbi the tree of life synagogue welcome the president there were also protests from some members of Pittsburgh Jewish community who said Trump was not welcome\nWe also noticed that the reaction in Israel after the attack exposed them devise between Jewish communities there and here in the U.S we ask Dina craft about this she's a reporter for the newspaper Haaretz and based in Tel Aviv\nReaction on the official level was very much you know condolences and shock but there was also a lot of sense of ... ear going on I mean starting with the chief rabbi Israeli ... chief rabbi who ah\nRefused to refer to the tree of life synagogue conservative synagogue in Pittsburgh to the tax as a synagogue he said it had some sort of essence of Jewish character but he would not hold a synagogue\nAnd ... why not call it a synagogue\nPretty ultra orthodox establishment which he represents in Israel conservative and reform Jews or or or reconstruction issues or any Jews or not worked an ox Jews are not really considered fold using their eyes [noise]\nSo what do you attribute some of these ten year reactions as he put it to what happened in Pittsburgh\nI think it's cynical politics and you have somebody like Naftali Bennett who's the diaspora administer a officially he's also former aide of nuts and Yahoo and now turned rival and uh he tries to always play to a base it's even more right wing and Yahoo\nAnd he should I Would argue better but yet he's still found a way to compare the hand that shot down eleven Jews praying on a Saturday morning to the same forces that fire rockets from Gaza into Israel I Am ah which I think also shows like a disconnect and a complete myth understanding of history\nYeah I mean not totally Bennett also got on a plane to Pittsburgh um there was another reaction to from the Israeli ambassador to the U.S a Ron ... um he was on MSNBC blaming anti Semitism on both the left and the right he's blaming both sides\nWanted the big forces in college campuses today is anti Semitism and those and to be anti Semite so usually not neo Nazis on college campuses they're promising the radical left so we have to stand against anti Semitism whether it's on single life whether it's functional less yeah\nI think here again Israeli Jews are not following the intricacies of right versus Latin America I think a lot of Israeli Jews as we know from whole support Donald Trump\nThey don't really care so much better domestic policies they don't really know very much medicine I think the important Israeli Jews as at Trump's support Israel in the trunk or the strong Israel so and Ron drummers comments I think perplexed American Jews more than they do Israeli jets\nThey didn't tell me a bit of a reaction among some of Israel's left wing politicians to what happened in Pittsburgh\nI'm over all although there has been expressions of condolence to the expressions of shocking to hire\nThe new kind of quickly moved on here I think a lot of Israeli Jews don't fully understand the impact\nThat has had on the American Jewish community they don't fully understand the plays the synagogue life for American Jews they don't understand that for American Jews synagogue is a second home it's a place where kids grow up in Hebrew school where they hide as I did like you know hiding out from from Hebrew school in the bathroom with my friend\nAnd a place where you would playing kind of come of age and that you you know this is a place where people feel at home I Want to\nShare a story I did a lot of reporting about the residents of Pittsburgh and the people from where all hell and I'm\nOne of the stories that move me most was the story of Jerry Ruben ... sixty six years old he was one of the eleven people who were murdered he rushed to the sound of the noise we don't know if you knew it was gunfire at that point to go help and that when he was shot\nAnd and after the memorial in Pittsburgh people spoke about how he had this interesting custom dream order Scottish which is a Jewish prayer memorializing the dead and it's set in every single
