Israel that interfaith marriages are simply impossible their families were both there this is not a wedding that faced opposition from the intimate of either the members of the couple\nSo all of that

World Service P. R. I. N. W. GBH in Boston\nA Chinese national is in an American jail today he's being prosecuted on economic espionage charges this is a big deal is the first time I suspected Chinese government spy has been brought to the U.S to face charges\nJim shoe is accused of trying to steal technology from G. E. aviation through one of their employees he was caught in a sting operation in Belgium and extradited to the U.S on Tuesday according to Justice Department officials kitty better is covering the story for the New York times\nKatie this is pretty amazing how did this thing actually go down\n... it's unclear whether or not the employee at G. aviation was working with the government but it is clear that GE Aviation itself subsidiary was working with the government and was tracking communications between one of its own employees and the Chinese by Mr shoe\nAnd eventually Mr she began to ask the employee for more and more information and much of which was proprietary which the employee himself up\nHim or herself recognized a but still their communications continued and they eventually agreed to meet while the employer was supposed to be on a business trip in Europe that allowed the authorities to arrest Mr shoe while he was not in China in a country that had an extradition treaty with the United states\n[noise] so do we assume the employee was about to go to Belgium and then the authorities came in and said no we're actually doing the sting operation do we know kind of at the point that the employer was let on that there was going to be a sting operation\nWell it's clear whether or not the employee actually went to Belgium him or herself we don't know that and again we don't know the extent to which the employee was\nTaking part in a sting operation or it's just being closely monitored by his or her company but we do know though from our reporters on the ground in Belgium is that Mr she was arrested while he was out ah just shopping indulge him and he claimed that in fact\nHe wasn't there to me anybody was just not vacation he remained very quiet he fought the extradition which is one of the reasons it took so long to get him from Belgium to the United states he was rushed starch April first April Fool's day and uh he was extradited and arrive in the United states on Tuesday\nNo this is accused of spying ... to ... who is the and what's he's supposed to have done\nSo you want your shoe works for a China's\nLeads by agency or their equivalent of the CIA and he he was supposed to be\nCollecting intelligence for the Chinese government and one of the ways in which he would do that and she would pose as a representative a science and technology each\nInstitute a think tank that were court the employees of\nAh of defense contractors to come to China to give talks to give academic talks and reports and do you do some sort of intellectual exchange and then once the employees were\nBrought to China they'd be wind and dined whereas we all know people can a maybe a little bit too forthcoming with information on their devices could also be compromised\nAnd at the end of the day he was also looking for employees like they're simply edgy aviation who at least seemed amenable to giving him information that they shouldn't\nAnd is he a big fish or a little fish in terms of Chinese intelligence\n[noise] well I think that it's\nEven though he was a regional director it is a huge deal to the United states has charged and arrested this man because he's not going to be tried in open court so what that means is the government is going to have to bring forth all sorts of very compelling evidence that they've gathered that we don't yet know from the indictment would prove that this man with not only is by\nBut was trying to steal business secrets that could be horribly embarrassing to the Chinese government and it can reveal sort of the extent of of a larger ring or a larger scheme\n[noise] now you mentioned that we don't really know much about the GE Aviation employee or do we know is there any details about this person know wow\nNow in reading the story I noticed that there's someone described as an uninvited co conspirator is that the GE Aviation employee or another Chinese ...\nThat his Naka G aviation play if another Chinese figures are one of the questions is whether or not ... figure is a cooperating witness and the government's case\nWhat's gonna happen to you on June shoe now the alleged Chinese by\nYellow await trial and you must court and he's in a U.S court of he's entitled to representation and I would assume that he would find a very good attorney\nAnd what's been China's reaction to this so far muted but that could change [noise] now the extradition of ... shoe it's believed to be a first but Chinese industrial espionage is nothing new oh why hasn't this kind of arrest an extradition happened before well we don't have an extradition\nTreaty with China and technically we can't take their people out of the country so you know in this case the U.S government was very lucky to have set up a situation where a Chinese by was willing to travel to a country with an extradition treaty with the United states\nOnce we indict a Chinese military officials are Chinese government officials generally it makes public their role in the\nCase but what it doesn't do as it doesn't allow us to necessarily bring them to open court it restricts their travel however and something some cases that restricts their financial or their ability to to move money around\n... with the New York times thanks so much thank you so how common is the theft of trade secrets by the Chinese\nIn some respects I think it's overstated and yet it is prevalent at does happen\nWilliam Zarit is chairman of the American chamber of commerce in China it's a nonprofit that represents U.S companies and individuals doing business there previously he was a minister for commercial affairs at the U.S embassy in Beijing\nWhen I worked in the U.S embassy we had cases of\nTrade secrets soft and they were not done actually however by folks in the ministry of security but rather by business people for commercial gain so it was a little bit different\n[noise] you know this this case involves somebody who's seems rather senior um what the perpetrators usually after\nIn some cases it's technology that is patented\nIn some cases it is a no how a which is not patentable but which is so important for actually producing a product when I was in the embassy or we had a case of a major with a major us commercial glass a company\nAnd employees at actually taken these trade secrets and had use them to build a factory in a third country and we're producing products\nAre you able to tell us the name of that company [noise] I don't think [laughter]\nYou know cases though where American companies who've had a things stolen from them in ... you know technology and than secret and have they ever been able to litigate the cases\nA matter of fact I have and uh the situation is really improving in China you go back Twenty years and the Chinese didn't have much in terms of a legislation for protecting intellectual property but over this period the largest\nYou shouldn't has improved quite markedly now enforcement has remained a challenge but even enforcement is improving as the big exception is in trade secrets for our companies that remains probably the biggest area\nOf intellectual property that is difficult to protect why\nBecause there isn't a proper legislation on this and uh I Know that the Chinese are working on it and the U.S over the years have worked with the Chinese in capacity building\nIn other areas of pie and this one seems to be like the last frontier but uh but we're all working on it still\nIs threats that comes with trade secrets theft is it a security threat an economic one or both\nWell I Would say uh in\nIn the case that we are reading about this alleged ministry of security person it's it's both um in most of the cases in which I was involved it was really most economic your technology", "year": "2018", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "11"}
