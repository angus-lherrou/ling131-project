what does this research due to our actual understanding of Mayan civilization well it's interesting\nIt was just sort of like a a baseline study that lets us know that we need to be reconsidering a lot of things about the ancient Maya the real results of this are going to be now and five or ten years as we now go onto the ground because what you're looking at is over two thousand years of my of

World Service P. R. I. N. W. GBH here in Boston what a difference a few days can make and U.S Canada relations last week President Trump was talking about why he didn't want to have a one on one meeting with Canadian Prime minister Justin Trudeau to discuss trade\nTariffs are too high and he doesn't seem to want to move and I've told them forget about it and frankly with thinking about just taxing cars coming in from Canada that's the mother lode that's the big ones were very unhappy with the negotiations and dean negotiating style of Canada\nYesterday with the new U.S Canada Mexico trade deal in hand that icy tone had melted\nI have to certainly give my highest regards to prime minister of Canada adjusted to do\nA lot of stories came out about that adjusted in I having difficulty together do we did over the trade deal but I'll tell you it's turned out to be a very very good deal for both and a very very good deal for all three it puts us in a position that we've never been in before\nSo how did Trudeau in Canada when such praise from the White House according to one report the answer is Canada's donut strategy and its trade talks with the U. S. former Trudeau advisor role in Paris says the donut analogy as close but not quite there\nThe report that described it as another donut strategy suggested that the effort was to go around the White House and to build\nA relationship with people in Congress with state governors with mayor where you know people at all levels of the political system and with American industry the reason the metaphors wrong is that it's more like I'm a Danish that do not because the whole ... as well gotcha\nBecause part of the strategy was to build strong links with the administration the White House itself and that that did take place\nRight so maybe a ... yeah there you go whatever it's called ... you said at all levels of the U.S political system that included public and private who was enlisted in this project on the Canadian side\nWhile it was quite extraordinary on the Canadian side and there was a degree of unity and the Canadian effort that we haven't seen before that reflected the sense of threat to our economic interests but on the Canadian side most obviously you\nHad provincial premier mayors of steady you had a group of advisors pulled together from different political parties and a kind of extraordinary display of solidarity among uh parties that are normally sniffing at each other\nSo this project even enlisted a former conservative prime minister Brian ... yeah\nWell a miserable Romney of course was prime minister when the first candidate us free trade agreement was negotiated in the late Nineteen eighties so he had a particular interest in this issue\nBut he also happens to live to have a place in ah Florida very near Wilbur Ross and he has a relationship with Donald Trump and so he was one of the people that the current Canadian government reached out to and ah as I said he represented a different party than the than Mr Trudeau is party\nYou had you know any specific details about the actual kind of access that uh Brian will run it got because he has this social circuit in Florida with the Wilbur Ross and Donald Trump\nHe was at mar a Lago won the evening and was brought up and actually sang a song as these been known to do in the past I'm a chatted with Donald Trump who was present but it you know other conversations are of course private\nSo a former prime minister from candidate whose conservative going to bat for current prime minister who's liberal how rare is that sort of bipartisanship and Canada it's pretty unusual\nNow bear in mind that Mr Maloney had a particular interest in trying to\nSalvage asked us and she was a part of negotiating the first place but it's hard to overstate the extent to which Donald Trump attitude towards NAFTA and towards Canada in general has galvanized Canadians\nYou know this is a core economic interests for Canada Seventy five percent of our exports go to the United states it's about a fifth of our entire GDP this is the one truly existential interest in our foreign policy and I've seen a level of unity and the political class\nWhich has frayed a little bit in the last few months but certainly across the country and support for the prime minister's effort that I haven't seen before\n[noise] Canada didn't do this when Obama or Bush were president ... why do they feel and had to do this now with Trump not just play the face to face with the Trump to him but also triangulate around him to get this new NAFTA sorted\nWell the reason for this was quite simple that our\nCore economic interests were at stake that even just the auto sector alone there are a hundred thousand jobs and in many many many more jobs that are dependent on that and the idea of twenty five percent tariff on a Canadian autos go in the United states that sharpens the mind but I Do want to emphasize\nOne thing which is we're talking is though that this thing is over\nFrom the Canadian perspective this is an ongoing challenge we're dealing with the U.S president whose mercurial and unpredictable there are remaining issues to be resolved including these steel and aluminum tariffs that are still in place\nIsn't it guard if if Trump tries to withdraw from the deal no\nDeal seems to be the deal at this point and it's a matter of passing through our respective ratification process but the steel and aluminum tariffs remain in place and we're not listed as a result of the deal in our part of the deal and those were made important to Canada and\nAlthough one would hope that this will set up past for a more positive relationship between Canada the United states and Mexico\nWe can't afford not to take precautions\nAnd anything can happen as we've seen with this president and part of taking precautions and saying this campaign is going to continue indefinitely\nRoland Paris is a former foreign policy advisor to Canadian Prime minister Justin Trudeau thanks very much for your time thanks Marco the new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada brings more certainty to the U.S economy that's a good thing\nBut here's something else to worry about new estimates from the congressional budget office show that our government's borrowing is off the charts by historical peacetime standards\nAccording to the c._e._o. and just a few years we'll be spending more money to pay the interest on our national debt and we will spend on our defense or Medicare to put it another way the U.S has become one of the most indebted nations on earth\nWe asked the world's Jason Margolis to help tell us what that actually means\nA few years ago when the Republican Party didn't control all the reins of government deficit hawks like Congressman Paul Ryan work constantly banging the drum about the perils of a rising us debt here's Ryan speaking to CNN in two thousand and twelve\nWhen a crisis right in front of us and what brings down ... empires past and future in debt and they're doing nothing to prevent it\nAnd here's Donald Trump speaking to CBS when he was running for president\nI Will tell you we are sitting on a time bomb and Hillary Clinton doesn't have a clue and President Obama has pretty much double the dead since he's been in office and somebody's going to pay a big price we have to start shopping that debt down\nBut once Obama was out and Trump was in\nRepublicans were singing a different tune under Trump and Speaker Ryan spending has gone up and the Republican tax cuts have blown a bigger hole in the budget\nToday the U.S debt sits at Twenty one trillion dollars a huge scary figure but also kind of meaningless by itself\nWherever the threshold is too high we don't know but rising forever is definitely an unsustainable on big problem and we're the only advanced economy on an unsustainable course\nEconomists like Jason firmin at Harvard's Kennedy School of government study what's called the debt to GDP ratio how much a country owes versus how much it generates\nAll the other advanced economies it's falling\nGermany France Mexico Argentina Mongolia they're all carrying a smaller debt to GDP ratio than the U.S if you look at a list of how we rank internationally the U.S is sandwiched between boot ton and Jamaica were carrying are heavy debt load since World War two\nEconomists say when you're in a time of recession it's time to spend to get the economy going again when the economy is roaring along as it is now it's a good time to save says
