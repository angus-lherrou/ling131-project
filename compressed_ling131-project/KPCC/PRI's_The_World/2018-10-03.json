the U.S to ensure that sanctions against Iran didn't defect humanitarian aid\nTo pump ... said the U.S would terminate to Nineteen fifty five treaty between the two countries which you run used as the basis for each case the Iranian foreign minister said the decision vindicated the Islamic republic Republic of Iran and consume the illegitimacy and depressive illness of us sanctions\nBrian Hook is the U.S special representative for Iran at the state department in Washington I asked him why the Trump Administration pulled out of a nuclear agreement that all the other signatories including the European Union said was working\nWell just correct you on one thing I Know one signed the Iran nuclear deal there aren't any signatures to the deal as foreign ministers are re set in a meeting that I attended a year ago it's not an agreement it's simply a plan of action\nAnd so the Iranian regime made a twenty year plan with a president who had two years left in office it is not a legally binding agreement\nIt is not a treaty it is a personal agreement with the president who is no longer in office we certainly made every effort we could to address the deficiencies\nOf the deal in our diplomacy or with the ... with the Brits the French and the Germans we weren't able to do that so we have left the deal\n[noise] couldn't do use the existing deal as a confidence building measure to put pressure on Iran on other issues\nUnfortunately the Iran deal\nAre allowed to run to essentially comply with the deal and it gave them a free hand to expand a their activities and every other category of threats to peace and security this includes ballistic missile proliferation terrorism cyber activity maritime aggression\nOr the violations of human rights\nThey've been able to do this because the Iran nuclear deal created a climate\nThat really people the false sense of impression this the false impression that by complying with the deal they we're complying with all of their other international obligations as un member states and so now that we're out of the deal it gives us a lot of freedom to actually go after the range of threats that Iran presents to peace and security\nWe've seen this opinion of the temperature and the route between Washington and Tehran today that President Trump has repeatedly said he's willing to meet the Iranian President\nWhom he recently referred to as a lovely man in the past he said he would meet the Iranians anytime without any condition whatever the you making to make sure that happens\nWe have a made clear to the Iranian regime and to the Iranian people that we seek an entirely different agreement then the Iran nuclear deal\nOr we would like to put in place a an agreement that that really addresses the range of of of Iran's threats and then there's a lot that we can offer\nWe would restore diplomatic relations commercial relations welcome Iran back into the international community integrate them into the global economy but they first have to stop destabilizing so many nations around the middle east and beyond this is a revolutionary regime\nWhich exports this I ideology and that generates sectarian violence in the middle east so we would like to get into a new place with them the Ayatollah Khamenei has said publicly that we require hostility with the United states\nThe United states has said we are very glad to sit down and started talking about a new agreement but that has not been met or in any reciprocal way by the Iranian regime\nAnd briefly what makes you think the more pressure will bring the Iranians back to the negotiating table at an end to see with the U.S in ... from the Iranian population seems to strengthen the result in ... doesn't it\nNo that's not the case uh the only reason that the prior administration was able to get a nuclear deal with Iran is because the pressure that was built multi laterally and largely by us unilateral sanctions between two thousand and six and two thousand and Thirteen\nAny nation that has negotiated with the Iranian regime over the last thirty nine years knows that they do not come to the table without pressure\nBrian Hook the U.S special

S.\nAt the time there was no process to heat treat donated blood to kill any viruses end result thousands of people with the most ... and other bleeding disorders were infected with HIV and hepatitis nearly three thousand three thousand of them later died but it was only last week that the British Government\nHeld a public hearing on the scandal\nJason Evans was there his father died in Nineteen Ninety three after contracting hepatitis C and D HIV from contaminated treatments\nJason Evans is now an advocate for victims of this scandal Evans has long push for a government inquiry he says blood donations used for those clotting treatments in the seventies and eighties was not properly screened\nThese donations coming from prisons from plasma collection centers in Skid Row locations where you would have\nAll the drug use in the sun is a higher risk donors I'm being paid full that donations so when you take that higher risk Darnah and you multiply that by ten thousand people in place it\nInto a also the risk of infection to the recipient of those products was actually one hundred percent for hepatitis C and also a very hard for hate choice V. when it began to break out in the early eighties as well\nYou were personally affected by this uh with the death of your father does how you became a campaigner\nMolly journey into campaigning in research really began in twenty Fifteen when a there was an inquiry in Scotland when the Enquirer reported it basically said that that was literally could or should have been done differently and\nPersonally when I got involved I become a journey with one goal in mind and that was\nTo take the slowing of little could or should have been done differently that came out Scotland 'em to turn into an official wreck quote that said though was a lot that could and should have been ...\nAnd that they uh vent was actually completely avoid ... had the pharmaceutical companies focused on making products safe\nBefore they focused on making cash ... is what we will put on the record out of this inquiry and that's what people want they want the truth first and foremost\nJason Evans or an advocate for victims of contaminated blood scandal in Britain that dates back to the Nineteen seventies and eighties a much larger scandal also involving contaminated blood unfolded in the Nineteen nineties in China\nFor American journalist Kathleen McLaughlin that crisis was personal she documents at all for the guardian in her story my career as an international blood smuggler\nKathleen McLaughlin joins us now you went to China as a journalist in two thousand four but you've got a nerve disease that requires periodic infusions um I Hope I'm portraying that accurately what did you see what your options to take care of yourself\n[noise] well to be honest you weren't can't accurately and to be honest I didn't really think about it in the beginning um I knew that China had\nA blood borne AIDS crisis I knew that it had something to do with class Matt um but I was also I think a tiny bit in denial on and I thought well I'll never get sick right when I'm there\nAnd I did almost immediately\nSo in the beginning it kind of started out as well I Can't get it in the U.S because I have health insurance there that will cover it my insurance and China might not cover it and then I started\nDigging into more the story of what had happened\nIn China's plasma banks and then I knew right away that there was no chance that I could ever use Chinese made plasma products\nIf it was so dangerous in China in terms of blood why did you go\n[noise] [laughter]\nWell it's a really good question and I don't know I mean I was extremely interested in China a journalist [noise] um I also think there was a part of me that wanted to explore this story because it was a story that was part of my life um but it was also so I I Believe\nThat time it was so completely different in my own experience in a U.S until I found it\nIntriguing and I found it interesting that China at that time was a place where I could kind of create my own medical bubble where I can bring this up then I can bring it in a hospital and they would infuse it for me\nBut I mean I Would say starting right away I started reporting different elements of the story about the AIDS crisis and health care in China\nAnd painted drugs and counter drugs and it's all tied together\nAnd so sensitive story or to the Chinese government any way that you're only telling it fully know so\nGive us a little bit of background on China's blood scandal um it it's got some similarities with a blood scandal in the u._k. we just reported on so it's the early nineties China's opening up pretty fast and capitalism and blood especially for poor country people in China became a way to make money in this new economy take the story from where you would\nStart so in in the beginning of\nChina's capitalism each local place each local government kind of looked around for what was the most abundant natural resource and hung on that just happens to be people it with less populated province in China and also one of the poorest\nSo someone and we still don't really know who got this idea that they could create what they called a plasma economy where they were paying farmers who never got paid for anything farmers out a nominal income and with mostly subsistence living for farmers where they could pay them a small amount for their\nBlood and blood plasma and that everyone would get rich and the process now a lot of farmers did get rich but pretty quickly into the system I'm HIV entered the plasma pool and because the system was so ramped up and moving so quickly\nThey were being thing to being ... needles they were often times in plasma donation you\nRe inject the donor where the red blood cells and in some cases they were actually injecting healthy people with tainted\nBlood cells and how it was almost a perfect storm away to spread a blood borne virus through a donor pool\nUm according to once you paying the doctor who actually discovered HOV in the plasma her that she warned provincial officials she won central government officials in Beijing that HIV was in the system and people were getting infected\nAnd in spite of all that it took three months to officially shut down the system so there was this\nPeriod I mean you can kind of argue about what the government knew when but there is a period of three months before the government closed down all of the officially sanctioned plasma stations in ... where\nThey absolutely knew what was happening and let it continue so\nIt's a yeah it's similar to what happened in the u._k. and we had our own problems in the U.S I mean there have you with a term yeah there have been tainted\nBlood scandal all around the world um and it's a it's kind of revealing look at how governments respond when these things do happen in China's response has been to shut it down and cover it up quickly as they could switch in public health crisis is the last thing we want to do\nJournalist Kathleen McLaughlin wrote my career as an international blood smuggler for the guardian

World Service P. R. I. N. W. GBH here in Boston\nWe've been hearing a lot lately about tensions between China and the U.S there is a trade war going on right now after all\nBut earlier this week things got more serious navy ships from China and the U.S had a near collisions in the south China Sea and American destroyer was cruising past the disputed spradley islands when a Chinese warship forced to ship to change course and it was not an isolated event\nThe U.S military routinely patrols in the south China Sea and China routinely accuses the U. S. of violating its territorial sovereignty the world's Matthew belt looks at what's behind all of that\nChina says most of the south China Sea something like Ninety percent of it belongs to China but the U.S doesn't recognize those claims and neither do China's neighbors\nBrunei Malaysia the Philippines Taiwan and Vietnam all have their own claims over parts of these resource rich waters that is what you need to know to make sense of incidents like this\nAround on\nThat is warning from the Chinese military to an American navy plane earlier this year telling us crew to leave immediately here's the response\n[noise] naval aircraft military activity on the national air and it went right by international law operating with regard to the right [noise]\nUh BBC News team was on that flight and the pilot told them this sort of stand off in the air happens all the time it happens on the water to on Sunday it was the USS Decatur a navy destroyer and the Chinese warship according to the American military the two ships came close to colliding\nThe U.S navy was conducting what's called a freedom of navigation operation that's a mission to underscore that the south China Sea is an international waterway not Chinese sovereign territory\nWhat the United States is holding the principal and it's a global principle international principle of freedom of navigation\nElizabeth Economy is the author of the third revolutions Xi Jinping and the new Chinese state she says the Trump Administration is doing the right thing by ramping up these operations in the south China Sea and it's not acting alone\nThis is not simply an issue between the United states in China it is an issue of international law the u._k. and France Japan are all undertaking similar feeding the navigation operations in the south China Sea\nAnd again these are disputed areas and territory that the international court has ruled that China's sovereignty I did not extend hear\nThe dispute is about resources fishing rights offshore oil drilling rights but this is also one of the busiest international shipping lanes in the world and the U.S navy has been sailing through the south China Sea for decades\nWhat has changed in recent years is that China has built artificial islands there and put military outposts on them a Chinese foreign ministry statement this week warned the U.S against taking further provocative actions to avoid undermining China us relations and regional peace and stability\nStill Josh you dawn of the China Institute for International Studies says there are many areas where the U.S and China can and should be working together\nThey now China in Haitian you know the challenge you face or ... even you know it's a challenge to the existing international order wagging assembled which showed a role in the same direction that is what's your ... we had to\nLie all gold steam could not agree more he's at the U.S Naval War college and the author of meeting China half way\nI Do think we're in danger here of missing the forest for the trees in U.S China relations are so many other issues that really need careful attention I mean let me just mention North Korea quickly but I think U.S China cooperation very badly needed on North Korea and I'm\nQuite concerned that all this focus on the south China Sea tends to take away from serious kind of cooperation negotiations that needed on other issues like North Korea\nGoldstein points to an immediate crisis where the U.S and China could be working together and that's the aftermath of the recent sue nominee in Indonesia\nI Would like to see the Chinese Navy in the U.S navy and the kind of crisis response mode where both navies are quickly moving forces into the area where they can render aid hopefully side by side and in cooperation that's the kind of\nSecurity architecture that I Would like to see in the western Pacific that could really a deal with real problems not haggling about Roxanne reefs\nAnd you know various legal lifted definitions of different zones but really helping people who are in need\nToday for its part the Trump Administration appears prepared to stick with a confrontational approach to China especially on trade a White House official speaking at the Chinese embassy in Washington last month said for us competition is not a four letter word for the world I'm Matthew bell\nSo we all remember our civics classes in junior high school right\nIf it hasn't been hammered into a slightly let me remind you Supreme Court appointments or for life supposedly to prevent political interference if you're a justice and you're not worried about being fired or getting reelected you're free to rule on the legal merits even if it's unpopular\nAll good points of course but as we've seen with the cabinet nominations the appointment process can still become a political mess\nSo what happens everywhere else in the world young ... Smith is a senior research fellow at ... that's the British Institute of international and comparative law so you're in London young let's start there and of course America's judicial system evolved out of the English system briefly tell us about the origins of lifetime tenure for judges over there\n[noise] yeah well this is a country which had its backers are appointment of judges and that mostly happened a long time ago so the English civil war of the seventeenth century\nWas the midpoint of a century of struggles and at that point the judges served at the pleasure of the king so that can could dismiss them at any time so when parliament became more powerful it's pasta framework and Seventeen hundred and in that act of settlement it provided that that can could no longer dismiss them\nInteresting the lead to simulate change in the U.S at the time of independence\nLet me just clarify their of so basically the judicial system and in England evolved for the same reason we kind of say here to prevent the demonic bullying judges\nYes that's a great way of putting it on there was some brave judges in the seventeenth century but if we look at the standout cases that were more judges for example denying bail\nOr just arbitrarily imprisoning opponents of the king when that hadn't committed a crime that type of behavior which was driven by their fear of dismissal one could say looking at the big picture\nAnd today in England or those lifetime appointment still the situation\nFrom near enough that not a lifetime appointment was the main it's good for nearly\nThe Hundred Years' but in the Nineteen eighties it was realized that\nAs more judges were reaching advanced age the um ... cheese curds deteriorates and that's one of the most famous English stretches load bending\nThe leading judge of the ... century started expressing some very or socially conservative views and books he was writing and the feeling was that if judges were going to do this and that ... edge\nThey could bring the reputation of the courts into district ... so a retirement age was introduced it's currently Seventy\nI mean they're more than fifty countries in the commonwealth which are influenced by the English model from India to your own native South Africa have they all evolved in the same direction of ending lifetime tenure\nAt yes they have so there are exceptions but there are three small Pacific Island states where judges are typically brought in on a contract basis or for this discussion when we're talking about logic countries we can leave them to win sites or it's um striking that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "03"}
