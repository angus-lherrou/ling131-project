calling in from west bend Wisconsin Jim ... view a localized there ...\n... ... that was actually be clearing my throat but are you do have a lobster particular point\nThis is a a problem right now uh think the first of all it's being assumed that uh\nYou know using a personal sexual harassment is something that people do you randomly or wants to ...\nUh I think actually people need to look at those are the statistics on this that are in fact accusations of rape and other forms of sexual assault I'm frankly when they do when they actually are recorded which is not nearly as often as they should be\nA you know frankly there were very very very low rates of false accusations in those cases we err on the side of caution and we believe women who choose people of sexual assault\nThat is the simple fact that his borne out by the districts so when I think we lose the caller says the people rush to judgment to believe this woman a ... to ... this man was under attack\nThis first of all he was not winning race he was\nAnd we needed for promotion essentially and she\nYou know whether or not he's a good guy drives the car pool or you know volunteers at church or what have you does not exist to them for the possibility that he committed a sexual assault\nIn this was a reality frankly that are like a lot of the women who are so angry is local these days are trying to draw attention to it does not matter how good of a guy he is it does not matter what position he may hold how much money he has it matters that we believe women that come forward\nYou alleging a social so because frankly there is no advantage to them when they do so and yeah and you know and and and yet\nSomeone like Linda who I thought her call was going to go a completely different way that um it ended up landing we we've been talking about women's rage and I've been coming at it from the perspective that women are ... are angry that a woman came forward\nUm to share her story and share her pain and wasn't believe that here's a woman calling in who says that she's tired of the media speaking for her\nAnd she's saying she's saying she's taking the ... the president's line that you know young men that are are the victims here\nGriffin is this ... is this a real a real\nThing out there um that we should actually pay more attention to take and take seriously as a a a a line of thought that has a lot more a has a lot more adherence to it then we're willing to admit among women\nSure it wasn't just this weekend I was actually looking at as one as you do looking back through all the research studies and and one from a earlier this year I tried to understand people's attitudes on\nAn accusations of sexual assault sexual harassment and they asked people how big of a problem do you think you know a variety of things are in in society today and they said how big of a problem do you think it is that women are not believe\nAn eighty percent of Americans said they think it's a problem that women are not believed um\nThere was a gender gap on how intense of of a feeling that was for women that was it was more this is a major problem versus a minor problem but he presented as a problem that women are are are dismissed too often however at the same time Seventy six percent said they think it's a problem\nThat some women may make false claims that the idea that you one hundred percent believe all women may go too far that that you instead you should take all the women seriously and that that may be a safer standard\nOn that takes women's claims very seriously that makes sure make sure they're heard but doesn't completely dismiss even the small possibility of false claims are missed remembered claims that sort of where the the polling data\nComes down on on where voters sit and one other number they think it's valuable to point out to Quinnipiac University polling around the have in our case specifically has tended to show you know more opposition then support for Kavanaugh more said they believed Dr Ford than than judge Kavanaugh and their accounts of of what happened\nBut nonetheless about half of the respondents in the polls still said that they felt judge Kavanaugh was treated unfairly in the process and and so you know I think that is that is something that is fairly widespread even if you think on balance\nA Dr Ford you know something horrible happened to her she should have been believe maybe you didn't want to have him out to be confirmed this idea that the process we just witnessed\nA was not one that was well structured to get at the truth and was unfair to everyone involved easy it's fairly somewhat widespread belief\nSo the question for listeners was I'm back to the original question what do you want in a in a candidate someone who fights hard and take the prisoners with someone who inspires and tries to unite us in the less than five minutes that we have left I Want to go to Donna in Everett, Washington ... thank you for calling into America on the line [noise]\nDonna\nOkay well I worked\nI worked for Bernie Sanders' campaign I was a delegate for Bernie Sanders and I think he was an excellent example of someone who fight hard and attacked his other enemy but has a uplifting message mhm he certainly was sacked oriented\nDid not want to get into dirty politics\nAre right ... thank you very much for calling in from Everett, Washington we're going to come clear across the country back to the east coast and Alex calling in from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Alex thank you for calling into America on the line [noise]\n\nHi how you want to fight or do you want and you know I wanted to comment about your anger about women and our\nAnger but after hearing your we now call or whatnot and I mean it for me it really didn't there you know in there that when didn't see that man for young men\nAs being the the mind in the middle of all that's I mean I I don't even know what to think that any more than one year old\nSon I mean I just I don't understand that I don't even know how to have dialogue with people like that I don't [noise]\nI like I cannot see how anyone can be out have a mentality that cabinet nominees victimizing during any\nPart of that ... that's when all he did was they eat and eat it every every question was asked about his behavior so I cannot understand I'm woman seeing him as a mechanism for his family and said no I mean the point in our\nCulture where we can't even talk about I don't know\nI don't even have to worry about any morning gathering minutes\nAlex I went to I Want to thank you very much for calling in from from Philadelphia and we've got about a less than two minutes left Karen Finney um can you address the despair that Alex that Alex fields and all this\n[noise] sure like I think part of the challenges this is a nuanced conversation that we're trying to have 'em and I think if I just go to pure politics uh you know the Republicans played it quite wow so that\nYou know and I do feel bad for a Mr Kavanaugh as family I mean it it did have the the whole process wasn't handled very well and I think that's initially what upset a lot of people have that in Nineteen Ninety One all over again feeling a literally looking at some of the same faces sitting up there\nA ... and feeling like we haven't changed we haven't learned and yet as women we felt like we've come so far so I think there again as I mentioned before where\nThis is you know there's so many different tensions here and we're trying to have sort of a nuanced conversation in politics which is a hard thing to do\nUm and I I Hope that uh I Hope that she will get out and vote and I hope she only Carter Center vote\n...
