{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "In that process that goes beyond the righteous anger against false accusation if it is false accusation a and revealed a bias that he hadn't revealed before\nJoining me now is historian Barbara Perry director of presidential studies at the Miller center at the University of Virginia she's been a Supreme Court fellow and was a researcher for chief justice William Rehnquist and has written extensively about the court professor Perry thank you for being on America on the line\nTo be with you guys [noise] okay so are you heard the two clips that I played you've heard the discussion that I've been having with the panel I Would love to get 'em your thoughts here is there a new normal for the Supreme Court now or have we have we ever seen the Supreme Court so politicized before\nOh my goodness yes a so everything old is a new again or vice versa um are the more things change the more they stay the same I guess would be the thing that quote I and we only have to go back to I think we're not very far to two thousand to Bush Gore\nAnd all the way to go home and find said that the court or was it was a quiet about the court any walk into the\nBuilding as a very quiet almost church like atmosphere [noise] uh but he said it's a quiet of the storm center so often or the court in our history and then right at the center of the storm and\nI have the storm and Bush Gore is is the most recent example and then back from that you go to the girl Warren era I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky I can remember the child driving around the city and seen\nA big billboard that said impeach Earl Warren back to the Nineteen thirties and FDR fighting it out with the court over over the new deal and it actually goes all the way back to the founding and the federalist send the Jeffersonian duking it out\nOver judge ships at all levels of of the federal courts but certainly at the Supreme Court level so um we think of the court is being above the ... daily politics and typically they are but there are these times where they get thrown into the males stream or they enter\nThe male strum and then we particularly notice that uh during these more contentious Supreme Court hearings over nominees\n... very during during his testimony last Thursday judge Kavanaugh said the Democratic opposition to his nomination was quote revenge on behalf of the Clinton who what do you think um the nomination of judge Kavanaugh will do to that perception that the Supreme Court justices are impartial or some are supposed to be impartial\nWell I think you raise a good point Jonathan others on the panel have tonight and and I think this is the new normal part not that oh my goodness there's a controversy all nomination\nThat's happened throughout Supreme Court history on oh the court has stepped into a political thicket\nAnd it's controversial that's happened often on throughout its history but this new normal is the nominee himself\nMaking this kind of political statement even all the way back to Justice Thomas and people have gone back of course of the need a hill hearings because those are the closest that we have to what happened on Thursday of this past week um but but even Judge Thomas at the time while he was angry and\nBetter and you could hear the emotion in his voice he didn't burst into tears\nAnd he he didn't make the kinds of of just overt political and partisan statements\nAh the judge Kavanaugh did on Thursday so much the way I'm describing it as a judge Kavanaugh went down the Trump being road I he added the kinds of emotions that Trump brings to the the political stains and he added the partisanship and the kinds of divisions that Trump has\nMade the new normal in American politics and now in Supreme Court nomination politic universe\nFor and I'm Glad you brought that up because as I was listening to judge Kavanaugh's forty five minute I'm opening statement there last Thursday I kept thinking that this was not for the American people this was not for the community this was for it and the\nThis was an audience of one speech an audience of one opening statements ... ... ... what impact do you think that will have going forward whether he is confirmed or not\nOn judicial Supreme Court nominees would also on the court\nI think it was as you say an audience of one for certainly the president to try to maintain his support for himself judge Kavanaugh that is but also the audience of Trump supporters the concert referrals\nOf beer and and liking beer I seem to be going for that Trump being base so to your point what happens\nIf judge Kavanaugh is confirmed by the Senate and put on the Supreme Court\nI think it's going to be hard for people to see him in that neutral arbiter role that I thought that now chief justice John Roberts described so eloquently people can disagree if they wish about the analogy of a Supreme Court justice being the umpire and calling the balls and strikes\nBut that is the uh the height of that sort of the platonic guardian view that we have a Supreme Court justices they're supposed to be again above\nThe fray and they're only\nHuman but I once interviewed a Justice O'Connor and I asked her about being a woman and how that had an impact on certainly her appointment and maybe after and she said you know we're all the sum total of our experiences\nBut when I Walk through the door of this court every day I Try to leave that behind and I think she really did try to do that and I think most of the justices have done that and that's why the court has these very high approval rating certainly compared to the other two branches over the last fifty years\nFor her I I'm just wondering can people given the the overtly person statement statements made by judge Kavanaugh\nIf he is confirmed to to the Supreme Court um see if he becomes the ninth justice and you know litigants go before the court and he's there can people demand that he recused himself from there and demand it but it's\nUp to the judges and justices themselves to to recuse so it wouldn't it wouldn't help for someone to make that argument they can make it but if he doesn't choose to do so he doesn't choose to do so you might recall some of the controversy about\nA Justice Scalia in his friendship with vice president Cheney right and whether or not he should recused so it's up it's left up to the judges and justices that the federal level to do that\nBut I think that's where it will be hard for people to give Kavanaugh fair shake in the sense of looking back at what happened on Thursday and saying can he really step back now and be that objective arbiter calling the balls and strikes without any partisanship or\nFavor in a little bit of time we have left I Want to ask you a process question here because we weren't longest time you needed a Supreme Court nominee needed to have a super majority of the Senate\nSixty votes to be confirmed and now all the attention is now focused on depending on the day senators Collins Murkowski mentioned in West Virginia now you only need a simple majority of the Senate to confirm Supreme Court justice how did that happen\nRight well you might recall that that's been a tussle between the Democrats and the Republicans in the Senate and the filibuster went away I'm under the Democrats for the lower federal courts the district courts in the courts of appeals and\nThe Republicans got The Revenge by saying okay we're staying at a four Supreme Court nominees I'm sure now the Democrats are rude the day um that they went down this road but recall that back in Nineteen sixty eight sixty nine and justice\nFortas was nominated and promoted up to chief or attempted to do so by Lyndon Johnson he was filibustered to death he did not get through and get that promotion to chief because he was filibustered by conservative Democrats in the south and and conservative Republican so back in the day filibusters could prevent someone from going on the court\nA real quickly you I'm recently quoted you recording peace in the uh about Trump's reelection strategy but might hinge on the Democrats taking either the house and Senate or both if Democrats do have their blue wave how would that set up a Trump presidency in twenty twenty\nRight so my point there was presuming there is not in a successful at ... impeachment if if the Democrats would take back both houses present mean there is not an impeachment and a successful conviction in the Senate right\nThat would be awfully hard because it's hard to say that the Democrats would get the super majority still needed by the way for the impeachment to to come to a conviction um my my point was actually to go back to Harry Truman looking at history and and say you know give them hell Donny Truman lost\nIn the mid term he lost the Senate too and the house Republicans buddy gave him hell and he came back and had that improbable when a Nineteen forty eight so if history is any kind of predict or could be the case for Trump should he run in\nAnd twenty twenty research professor Barbara Perry director for the presidential studies at the Miller center at the University of Virginia thank you very much for being on America on the line\nOn my honor job than\nWhen we come back the other political news of the day was we're going to be taking your calls when you're still going to be talking about Kavanaugh's but what is your prescription for the toxic political atmosphere that divides
