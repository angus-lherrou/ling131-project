been in the ... question would have been like whoa loser well she was really Mexican I was an American journalist Twenty years ago mhm so even if I had a green card I was an American journalist\nKevin than the other side of the transactional nature of all this that I didn't explicitly state is that while the United states has always had some sort of transactional relationship with the Saudis we don't know what Trump himself\nHas to to lose or to a game because we haven't seen his tax returns because we don't know the state of his finances he has alternately in the past ah bragged about his all the money he's getting from the Saudis and Emirates public record of some of that and sometimes he says he has no financial relationship with the Saudis but we don't know what he himself\nUm what what motivations he personally has a as a result of his financial entanglements with the Saudis are frankly any other\nAny other foreign nation that maybe does not share our values I eat Russia that he has also treated with kid gloves which brings me back to you know every relevant yeah definitely\nAnd you know we need to see his tax returns you can't say that enough uh but uh that if you're asking about what motivation might be it may not only be whatever arms deal or whatever job standard we stand to gain or lose from this arms deal but also his own\nFinancial we behind a national day of journey ... of of morning actually a journalist absolutely shouldn't we be holding shouldn't shouldn't there had been a a blank spot a black something that that that acknowledges as American journalist we will not stand for this\nUh this is the murder and horrible dismembered ... of somebody who lived\nYou know an hours away by plane from where we are right now this is this is completely unacceptable and again it's the kind of normalizing it's like oh and by the way this horrible sense that the litmus test in our country now is\nWhere they born here or weren't they born here\nKind of horrors that there was a reporter earlier in in the New York times that suggested that the jerk Cushing who obviously is is is very central to the relationship with ah with with the crown prince\nUm which is urging you know people saying this will blow over that that look I'm there they've got other things in the past a middle they bombed\nA busload of children in in in Yemen and that blew over so this is going to blow over as as well we talked about this little bit last night I mean it's it is deeply cynical but as he wrong motor\n[noise] well this one's a little different I think um we have a great capacity most nations do 'em to ignore the suffering people far away a but this is a lot more personal it's particularly personal for journalists who are keeping this front and center\nUm it was an attack on a person who was a at least a under our jurisdiction\nAnd writing for one of our major newspapers um so you know of course the [laughter]\nThe news cycle being what it is these days you know namely Fifteen minutes long I suppose it's it's possible that in a week it won't seem so urgent but um but I don't think that it will blow over quite so is quite so readily as the bus bombing in Yemen\nOkay Mitch McConnell said yesterday that Republicans had the votes the oldest son\nThey'd go after Obamacare again and they're also saying the social safety net programs are going to have to be cut to help pay for this budget deficit which was partly caused by the tax cuts and I want to ask you about this Katherine ... book store from my point is an extraordinary story you have a Seventeen percent increase\nIn the federal deficit at a time of incredible prosperity and I guess the question is anyone in Washington actually care about deficit spending anymore\nOnly one Democrat as in the office and then the White House I should say\nUm no they they don't they pretend to but they don't\nAnd look if you look at the long term trends are basically since the post war peace in the entire post war period when unemployment has gone down deficits have gone down with the exception of the last few years and during times of war in Vietnam warmer example\nUm we are seeing that in major decoupling of the business cycle\nFrom the deficit and that is because of the Trump tax cuts largely I mean there are other things going on too but the reason why the deficit went up Seventeen percent year over year is not because of our long term entitlement problems even though those do exist that's not what caused the deficits go up last year\nIt's because of these Trump tax cuts as well as spending increases and if Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan and all of these other people\nWho have been crying were client crying bloody murder when Obama was in office about the fact that the deficit was going up\nBecause of the great recession if they actually had principals on this matter they would not have passed on these pieces of legislation that that wide and the deficit and increased\nOur low pay ... ... you and I are probably talk and written about this many times over the last Twenty years\nSay how important it is to bring the deficit down how terrible the national debt would be what a debt crisis would be like\nAnd and have talked to a conservatives who went over and over and over again the tax cuts pay for themselves that the way to get out of this is to grow the economy to a point where it pays for itself and now we're looking at these numbers which call into doubt a lot of that\nAnd so I guess the question how do you get someone like Paul Ryan whose entire career was warning about the deficit and the debt presiding over there's really rather dramatic spike in the deficit\n[noise] you know only um high school sophomore is believe this a fairy tale about tax cuts paying for themselves\nA that everybody who serious understands that that's ridiculous um and um I Would have to say that among um you know I I agree in part and dissent in part from what Katherine said I mean I I Do agree that the uh\nThe combination of a tax cuts and spending increases under Trump certainly is responsible for the boost in the deficit that we saw this past year but um\nBut over time I think there's no question that the the um entitlement state is the cause of our um is the cause of our long term I'm debt and deficit and what are ... so what happened so yeah what happened to our side no no no what what happens\nGoing forward because the prospect that Republicans will actually ever get around you are cutting these entitlement forever to around ...\nPerhaps will never do it Republicans will only cabins right about this will only complain about a deficit when when there's a Democrat in the White House\nAnd that means that uh we are on course to have a debt crisis or something along those lines some time in the not too distant future um we're headed off a cliff as far as our our fiscal I'm really help us agree with that\nI I just would like to put us of data out there because one of the things that we have seen an increase has been the spending in terms of ice immigration detention deportation\nJust so we get a sense where people are deciding in terms of if they're backing these immigration policies to build a wall kinds of policies\nMore money is spent on immigration detention and deportation force meant than all federal law enforcement agencies combined\nAnd some more than the FBI ATF a judge the Justice Department police\nThe kind of money that is being spent now in this ice industrial complex I think might be a place where we think okay well how about cuts here I mean that's pie in the sky but I'm just saying if people buy into these policies this is at great cost to the American economy\n... we don't have the wall but I'm but I'm not sure that that's going to solve the problem and you know Kevin you had a piece of today where he basically showed\nThe fact that you know you if the economy growing in the deficit growing at the same time which is a nightmare scenario and I don't know where we're going here in the form fortunately we have to take a break here and we're gonna be back with his panel and we ... we promise we'll take more of your calls in just a moment you're listening to America on the line [noise]\nStop [noise]\n\nWe midterms are about a lot of things but mostly there about the president\nMarcia is really a
