{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "A it's a nice idea fanciful idea um that that's going to cost a over a hundred billion dollars probably if it's ever if it ever gets anywhere um why why is it that we're spending ... why is it that we we have this significant increase in revenue why is it that we have a pipe dreams like the high speed rail project\nOn the agenda and and yet we need to have a brand new source of funding for transportation infrastructure that doesn't seem right to me that seems like a a money grab to help to to help sustain an unsustainable a physical journal and ... year\nI've I've heard some people argue that it is a regressive tax because people up and you know can't afford housing closer to work drive long distances have yes less fuel efficient cars they pay more\nYeah absolutely um one of the major issues I have with this initiative is not actually the repeal\nBut then it hangs cos the legislature and California government\nFor any future use of fuel taxes and just the same thing that has happened with proposition Thirteen which has handcuffed California to be proactive\nIn a variety of different issues this for ... for generations to come in dealing with our road repairs so it's not just the repeal if further says that you can't do anything without two thirds vote\nIt is ... ... again horrendous public policy uh problems um I agree with\nGo and with Katie that it is a Republican ploy and just in Democrats have done this historical years well using the initiative process\nUh fortunately in the last couple of elections it's kinda died down this ... this is ... basically the only initiative that's really being done by a political party like that where we used to have like four or five every every year um but you know\nCalifornians we vote and and love our taxes may I just in the last election we voted archives except don't tax our homes and don't tax our cars that that's the issue no\nRight or let's continue that was proposition six the repeal of the vehicle fee increases and the gas tax proposition seven authorizes the California legislature to provide for permanent daylight saving time\nBut it would only happen if the federal government were to allow that so this is a dependence proposition so to speak a Katie one started on this one\nWell as the relatively new mom I feel like an issue an expert on yeah that's your time changes the better\n[laughter] but I think you really laid it out this is something that I feel like California has sort of\nHad a fascination with we thought there were a bill in the legislature this year and that allows for this vote 'em and but you really laid it out what does this proposition do not much I mean it lets the legislature vote on it if the legislature prove that the governor could than it let Congress work on it and I believe the president has to weigh in as well\nSo I mean it's just it is the start of a step\nA of a process but um it really\nIsn't anything that you'll you'll see happen anytime soon anybody else with anything quickly at my I just wanted to say I think that this was a we're already a couple of steps in as I recall the history of the ... I Believe that there have been a sort of the legislature's been interested in in the past and and we're now at a point where they were waiting\nTo see if other states we're going to be interested in moving away from the ... and so I think the legislature's kind of hopeful that by getting the California voters to weigh in on this one and then they will act\nThat maybe that will lead to a allergic groups are going to suffer and part of the challenges are California Constitution which has hundreds of pages long we continue to put a lot of things in there and this was decades ago that we did this and so now we actually have to have you vote on it to allow the legislature in Congress to take action\nIf it happens so we're just asking you not to just give them permission in case there is a national trend to change that by the way the European Union and throughout the world there's major discussion and in Europe they will change of next year that we're getting rid of this and it's good consistent throughout the world and we just want to continue with\nIt there are concert historically I should say there have been concerns or in the agricultural community about this I'm a young ... because of the darkness when kids would be going to school things like that um but Katie are you aware of any sort of organized opposition to fulltime daylight saving time\nWell I mean I think that's one of the things that would be interesting to see if it gets out of California and goes to the federal government\nWhere would everyone come down on and I honestly don't know I I Do I Do know I Will say I used to live in Indiana which had three times and was incredibly confusing so we're not we wouldn't be as bad as some places but um I I really I don't know how the federal government\nWould would take to that of course our neighbor Arizona a doesn't go on daylight saving time so they have a permanent\nFerment in time but it's not daylight savings time it's it's a standard time that they keep year round so once again that is proposition seven which is passed by voters then wouldn't allow the legislature and the governor to take this up is\nThe federal government were to make a move towards a standardizing a fulltime daylight saving time\nProposition age uh would require dialysis clinic kidney dialysis clinics to issue refunds to private insurance companies a for a revenue that they take in that's more than Fifteen Percent a profit\nFrom the service that they provide this is a very complicated a measure I just led recently a full on debate on this and I'm Still trying to get my head around the complexities of this but part of the history is the effort of service Employees International union\nTo organize the employees at the two biggest dialysis companies the chains that are here in California\nI'm Michael you want to start us off on on on\nThis or give me the that's going to say actually you know this this one I don't use the longest I think that's why\nYou know in my mind valuation of this is exactly what a what you just said which is this one's incredibly complicated I've I've gone waded through this a number of times and it it it reads as if it's if it's an attempt to to begin lord of the cost for make make a dialysis treatment more affordable\nUm but I Do understand that there's a little bit of politics by which are I Wonder if some of my colleagues might want to talk about 'cause I'm not quite as as aware of the politics\nNow where did you you have some in for when this to share yeah I mean this is one of the lesser known initiatives no doubt you've heard the radio ads because a hundred and twenty million dollars is being spent on a lot of ads on mostly by the dialysis clinic um who have poured a lot of money and you know you do have the backdrop of union\nUm unionizing and uh you have the backdrop of you know whether or not a health care costs should be able to\nSort of like they have been and so there's a lot of in the background going on to this one\nOn top of the fact that it's just a very complicated measure\nSo the proponents their argument is that there would be a greater investment by these dialysis\nCenters in patient care because they're not going to want to pay these rebates the private insurers for going about fifty percent and sense what they would pay their employees in providing services would count as expenses that therefore they would more likely to invest in\nOpponents say this might well lead to dialysis clinic closures will continue on this proposition on our friendship [noise]\nWe live we're local where believe NPR leader eighty nine point three K PCC thanks for joining us with a K PCC voter cram session with Larry mantle and ... it's all part of our voter game plan and we have more for you on our website LA it's dot com L.
