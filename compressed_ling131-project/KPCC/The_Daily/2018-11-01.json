{"month": "11", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Out there in Arizona these young hyper aware young people who are not even a voting age but\nAre out there speaking their minds or at least being active [noise]\nYeah I mean these people are definitely out there you've seen more and more of an effort\nOr this year to organize and get young people out to vote then you have in any year really probably since the two thousand eight hundred thousand or by natural watching uh\nSo really you're seeing a lot of evidence that young people are really fired up about this election um they're not going to vote you know these are people much older than alive um they're not going to vote at the same rate as the sixty five an overcrowded they never are\nAre are they going to vote in a much higher rate than they did and twenty fourteen or two dozen ten\nYeah I think there's a lot of evidence for that I'm Tom style or who is one of the biggest democratic donors has put about thirty million dollars just into turning out people between the ages of Eighteen and thirty five\nAnd that could make a really big difference particularly in some of these states life in a place like Arizona with a really bifurcated electric ... older voters are much more Republican than the younger\nOr in a state like Georgia where the factory is calling us into the show calling into America on the line uh lives I was twelve from Manhattan George George Zachary from Georgia is eight teen ... thank you for calling into America on the line are you voting\nYeah definitely voting\nAnd you've around here is that our hopes\nAre absolutely fearful ... obsolete fearful that the Democratic wave just will not materialized really afraid that all this dark energy is on the west coast in on the east coast as you're not going to be shared and places like here in Georgia or in Texas I really don't\nMatter of fact we do you not I mean from from where I'm sitting obviously in in New York City but reading and watching and\nTalking to the sources in Georgia it seems like there there's a lot of energy in Georgia energy on the ground I'm ... about the the governor's race are you are you not feeling\nWell like I went to like a Stacey Abrams rally definitely a lot of energy there like she's ... reaching out but he just dry like thirty minutes five as last time I just feel like energy there like she she can ... a lot here in Atlanta\nActually like to see like my college campus here but I just don't think I I just don't feel like an energy is really kind of ... just last fall\nMhm All right ... thank you very much for calling into America on the line and in\n... in in six days we will we will find out whether that energy that blue wave that Zachary is really hoping for um materialize is in Georgia and or elsewhere but my concern\nIs like let's say it doesn't materialize 'em let let's say it doesn't happen on at that point for someone like Zachary um you know there's a decision to be made which is so do we just basically fold our hands and say well\nThat's that or does it change the way that you relate to the politics and you basically you know doubled down in terms of the ... the discussion around democracy and participation and with with his fellow college students maybe many of which may be or not fearful could care less so\nI just think you know we don't know what's going to happen and I have a lot of questions I have a lot of questions about the polling than the data I have a lot of questions but it's more like so if it doesn't if this thing doesn't happen then what\nIt'll be more incumbent upon young people like ... who are disappointed too they they are too young to to throw up their hands Kevin um before I go to another caller I Do want to jump into this fourteenth amendment\nOr issue the president brought it up yesterday and the birthright citizenship\nUm ... tons of people from the speaker of the house on down and said that's not going to happen that can't happen and yet the president is still today on Twitter today and we just saying no no no I can do this I'm going to do this\nAs with the Fifteen thousand troops I'm to the southern border is this talk about the fourteenth amendment also a political ploy is this all about politics in this nightmare scenario that we're talking about well that just disappear the day after the election\nI mean isn't going to let up on this um this is something he will probably try to use to fire up his base I had a twenty twenty or even if it doesn't work in twenty teens are in the case of the fourteenth amendment issue you know clearly the vast overwhelming majority of legal scholars\nSay he cannot do this this is not within his power um it's not even clear if there's something Congress could do so it's not clear you know if the president can do it by executive order 'em and house Speaker Paul Ryan disagrees ah one thing I Would note also on\nThis issue and sort of how it turns out Republicans one big problem Republicans had\nSort of during twenty seven senior particular which Trump was constantly getting into ... like this with either Mitch McConnell or Paul Ryan and whatnot it has that kind of in facts\nAll the other congressional Republicans when Trump is fighting with opera it makes Trump's base which really in this one is the same as the rest of the Republican Party not want to vote for congressional Republicans having a fight between um anytime between house speaker\nAnd the president a week before the election is\nYou know in any other circumstances Brock Obama had been fighting with Nancy Pelosi a week or forgery doesn't then it's all we want to talk about for you right off\nSo I think that is something where this could actually backfire\nA little bit on Republicans by sort of pointing out that the house Republicans don't really always agree with Trump who are raised the person most of the Republican base like\nUh I went to squeeze in one more call before we have to go to a break John calling from Cleveland Ohio thanks for calling into America on the line\nFor Apple a\nAre you voting your ... ... voting your hopes are your fears\n... somewhere down the middle I'm even with the economy I I have to say I'm voting my pocketbook\nUh-huh and so is your pocket when something is that I I Love your vote in your pocket book is that a vote based on fear or ... on on hopes given where the economy the optimistic\nI'm going to be optimistic I Would say it's a vote on hopes okay I work as a public library of them and you know having been a young adult librarian some of the previous callers filled me with some macho mhm um\nBought our budget is largely decided hey from our state budget here in Ohio and feed from local issues but\nGo onto the ballot now my library doesn't have an issue on the ballot this year bought our state is up for play with the state house with the governorship and I'm voting in\nHopes that after the budget cuts that we took in two thousand nine the state house realizes the work that libraries have done and putting people you know getting people back in the job market and that same might a state said to give up some of that money\nBack so does that mean you're going to vote for Cordray or you're going to vote for the wind was you know why am\nMost likely to vote for Cordray ... I Will say as far as governorships state of Ohio a on let's be clear when our budget got fat and they did happen under a Democrat a governor\nSo I'm I'm In favor of who is more likely to restore public funding for public which\nAre right right now personally I think that might be right All right\nJohn calling in from Cleveland Ohio thank you very much for calling into America on the line\nKevin I think you might be you might be hanging around 'em so I'm not going to say goodbye just yet but when we return one of the toughest robbers campaigns in the country is in Florida\nThat smart a governor's race will get an update in a moment and more of your calls again we're asking you if you're voting your hopes or your fears this election Democrats Republicans independents give us a call eight four four Seventy four or five eight to five five this is America on the line [noise]\n\nHalloween Night we've got ghost stories it's a feeling [noise]\nPut someone's watch [noise] it's the voice [noise] coming from [noise] he's here to check on the snap judgment I don't special [noise]\nFour hours of spook starting at eight on Halloween Night here on eighty nine point three K.
