evolution of the animal kingdom is being transformed by two very different ways of studying the deep history of life from this\nThese new methods to lead to discoveries that challenge some of our oldest ideas about how animals evolved hundreds of millions of years ago and then also shed light on mysterious organisms that existed before the animals that now dominates the planet\nNew fossil techniques have been able to turn lies the distribution of large numbers of specimens reading similarities with living animal communities and in an extraordinary recent development we can now study a dead animals molecules left in the rock along with the ...\nThe other great change in our understanding this comes from comparing the gene ends the DNA of creatures alive today flushing out the similarities and the differences between them repeating the patent of evolution\nBut at the starting point for oil on knowledge about that the past of life is the fossil record of our long extinct ancestors this is Nick Butterfield as Cambridge University telling us to animals will lay the arrivals in life history\nLife of all very very early on on this earth and we can see it from at least three and a half billion years ago and we we can track and in the in the fossil record for the next three billion years and it's almost invisible for the next three billion years as far as the fossil
