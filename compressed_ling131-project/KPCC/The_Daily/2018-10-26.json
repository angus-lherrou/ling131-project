{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Um the horrible news that we're we're all reading and and some of the things that are being done to keep people from exercising\nTheir right to vote that towns do rally at the partisanship and the and the division that seems to have gripped us at the national level um is not necessarily the case at the local level James I want to thank you very much\nFor coming on to America on the line\nIt's my pleasure thanks so much for having me and thanks for what you're doing\nThank you so at the beginning of this the beginning of the segment I put the question out there what are you personally optimistic optimistic about why can't they say that word today optimistic and I'm naturally optimistic person\nOr the number is eight four four seven four or five eight to five five James vows just told a story that is really an optimistic one about America and Jeremy from ... Minnesota is on the line thank you for calling in to America on the line\nWhat are you optimistic about\nWhat I think I'm optimistic I'm asked two years I feel like the national presidential election results so to cause some people off guard I feel like the young people in America\nYou know utilizing social media and the Internet and all the different ways to accumulate disseminate information they decided that it's important now to learn about local checks national politics\nEven even global chicken and I think in the past the only events that have sparked a you know similar interests are you know we're we're wars or really you know\nBad economic situation that the depression or or something of that nature and I I think nowadays there's so many distractions but I'm extremely confident and I guess you'd say can conditional you optimistic [laughter] I think that things can get better and I think they will get better because the young\nPeople um you know all all the way from just reading age right now we'll\nDiscuss and learn and are curious about it because they want to know what why are all the while the grown ups all bent out of shape about everything what's going on so I I'm I'm confident I'm optimistic about the young people rate learning politics\nAnd Jeremy thank you very much for calling into America on the line in Germany I went to Carlton in Northfield, Minnesota so that I knew how to say I know\n[laughter]\nAll right let's go to Scott in Salt Lake City Utah Scott thank you for calling into\nAmerica on the line Oh thank you for having me so what makes you optimistic I\nWell I consider myself to be an optimistic libertarian I'm kind of an independent I Love and donate to my local NPR stations I a book by remain vigilant keep an eye on what's going on and on July to just see all across America a lot of independence that are running\nThere are independents in so many states unless there's difficulty getting on the ballot for third parties and I'm Talking greens libertarians independents who are putting their name on the ballot who are running and you know I'm really optimistic about the fact that even though\nTwo thirds of America's independents that a lot of them are starting to find party that they can identify with\nWell this is terrific Scott thank you very much for calling into America on the line factor out\nLet me bring in our our panel for ... for the the five minutes that we have left in this in this segment and then we're going to come back and have a a voter discussion from WNYC radio Brian Lehrer host of the of the primary show and back with us from Missoula, Montana and Helen Peterson of buzzfeed a\nJames Fallows is always is always good to listen to a he's sort of like that lamp posts in the middle of a of a hurricane steady ensure a lamp posts made of cement by the way not just the would\nI Would love to get your reactions to do what do you have to say and what ever thought you had have from what we've been talking about tonight rental start with you\nAs well as somebody who works in public radio um I think he was right about sensationalism and commercialization of the media\nSince the advent of cable television um they found that the formula to profit in news was to have shows like cross fire and now hold channels that are one side or the other side and that does so polarized the country that's not\nTo say that Trump is right about the media echoing what James Fallows set about that um but uh I think it's a port in point to make about media for profit versus media republics of\n... and how long [noise] yeah you know I've read and ... and I I really\nLove the fact that it was lucky that all of these towns a lot of and smaller mid sized towns and thinking about I like what are people actually talking about and thinking about an optimistic about\nAnd I think that most reporters will tell you that when they're actually on the ground talking to people not at political rallies that's how you send in similar that there is a lot that's going on in their communities that they are really excited about and things that they feel like they can change meanwhile what's going on at the federal level feels so\nDistant and gridlock to an impossible and like there's these two realities that bumped up against one another on a daily basis\nI yeah I Do they bumped up against each other or they like magnets the opposite sides of magnets where they repel each other I'm always I'm fascinated by this ... seeming disconnect between the activity inaction on the ground locally and then the\nOther um halt of any kind of ... of action at the federal level\nOh yeah absolutely I think you're right and that's that they repel each other and that's part of that sensation of whiplash is that you're coming from one of those activities like you know the other day I was shot away and some people who were going door to door getting out the vote for the Medicaid expansion initiative in Idaho\nAnd like you know no matter what your political inclination no one was rude like they had real conversations\nAnd then you come home and you are you look at your phone and you see\nWhat's happening rhetorically and in all other forms on the national level\nAnd it does feel like that that does national conversations make the smaller conversations to more meaningful one's more difficult\nBrian you're on the you're on the air every day five days a week and you had been you've been doing your show\nFor a long a long time so of the three of us on a on the show right now you're the one who's got the most experience with just the the mood of the country in the mood of people um even in what people\nConsider the bubble that is that is New York city do you get a sense that the the drama that is the Trump Administration and Washington that it's not even ... even hear it doesn't have any kind of real impact because people are ignoring it\nNo people aren't ignoring A People's lives are affected by it um I don't want to make this out to seem like you know\nThere's just a nation of spectators who were choosing upsides and rooting for the Dodgers are the red Sox in the world series people's lives are affected black people's lives are affected immigrants lives are affected women's lives are affected um intensely indirectly\nBy the ways that Trump is too much without going into all those ways that everybody knows people feel personally threatened\nUm so I I hear my call is being more inflamed and\nFrankly more afraid I'm Ben and all my years of hosting my show at least you know significant portions of the audience and I think that's very real and can't be ignored\nRyan layer and Helen Petersen we're coming back for ... a a longer discussion about a bunch of other
