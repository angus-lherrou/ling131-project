{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Is that satisfactory enough for you know obviously not I mean let let me make a different point Jonathan which is the way that we think about this we view the only way\nThat this president will be impeached and removed from office is if Americans insist on it and if they insist on it on a nonpartisan patriotic basis\nSo that it is impossible as I Know you can do the math\nAnd I'm sure everybody listening those two this can't happen just from Democrats\nThis has to be a question where Republicans decide that for the sake of the country it's important to get rid of this man\nTo preserve the constitution and to preserve the safety and health Americans and the only way that is going to happen is if the American people regardless of partisanship\nRegardless of which party their education insisted their representatives have happened otherwise we know it's not gonna happen which is why we're doing a petition drive why redo town halls were a grassroots organization were not walking the halls of Congress were going around the country\nMaking the case of speaking of the American people we have Chris in Newcastle Delaware calling into America on the line Chris thank you very much for calling in\nAre you doing good so if I can say nothing I read through the years ago and I really felt\nThe time the Republican ballot for free think country how I Am and a lot of effort on something they knew they could not achieve\nThe situation you're single man it's funny that for the fact that they were accused of being the most corrupt one respect for it I don't know which one of four which one that's true now\nPoint is there's no way Democrats in our school to get enough senators on their side if they bring the articles for or go\nTo the fullest true fact when I was in the age they were going to get that majority such kicked down the managing situation didn't feel good for the country that we don't need to go through this again cricket when you entered the matter what the right\nChris thank you very much for calling in from Newcastle Delaware I mean Chris is that like why bother to do it they're not going to get rid of them so why why waste their time and enrolled that is the\nPoint I was trying to make the time that this really worked\nWas with Richard Nixon and when it was a similar situation but what happened was we were in a similar situation to right now and then there was a smoking gun and the smoking gun was the tapes were turned out the president had been lying the whole time\nAnd then the country as a whole including Republicans\nTurned on that President and decided it was absolutely unacceptable to have him stay in office and as a result not because they had a change of heart themselves but because the American people had a change of heart Republican senators\nShows to throw him out of office and there was a famous story that two Republican senators Barry Goldwater and Howard Baker went to the White House and Richard Nixon said to them how many votes do I have in the Senate\nAnd Barry Goldwater said you have twenty which obviously isn't nearly enough and I'm not one of them and and the Nixon resigned because he could see the handwriting on to all the handwriting was from the American people\nAnd so when we look forward there are going to continue Jonathan to beat events that are going to show that this president is not just lawless and breaks the law every single day and breaks the constitution every single day but did he is really dangerous for the American ...\nLet's go to New England and John who's calling from Portsmouth New Hampshire John thank you for calling into America on the line\nAt a [noise] I Want to say that I I like the president I don't believe it should be impeached at all as far as the commenter saying that\nHe or she is that while you know the last president he he did a lot of unconstitutional thanks for the things he was trying to do in an area by talking about how the Democrat Party is becoming a moral party that wants to pass laws\n... we saw the last like gay people\nOkay John John had plenty to say I'm ... and ...\nQuite frankly time there are a lot of people who agree with a lot of if not all of what John from\nNew Hampshire had to say and in fact that made me remember that\nThe latest NBC News Wall Street journal poll shows the president's approval rating has picked up five points to forty seven percent how do you get the American people to rally around the cause of impeaching to president when the president right now is seeing a boost in his approval\n... we've always felt day that we have a lay down hand on the facts and B that events would Barris out and let me give you an example Jonathan that apparently a is not convincing you but to me is an overwhelmingly important point I'd say two weeks ago\nThe United nations came out and said that unless we get our climate crisis under control within twelve years which is twenty thirty that we will be subject to on imaginable suffering\nAnd the president we are the only country in the world that is not part of the Paris accords on climate because President Trump has tried to get us to withdraw it hasn't been completed but he stated officially that we are withdrawing from that were the only country in the world\nAnd when being and when this report was described as the president he said I have a pretty good feel for science I have no idea what that means in far as I'm concerned means absolutely nothing\nAnd he's continued not just not to take steps to move to clean energy not to take steps to reduce pollution but actually has tried as hard as he could to increase pollution\nAnd to therefore not just risk but to go towards on imaginable suffering for the American people so when you say to me\nYou know we can just wait we have two years actually\nWhat all the scientific body of the world told us as we have twelve years to solve the problem not just start solving the problem not to give it the good old college try but to solve the problem so when someone says to me let's wait two years I Know that we have twelve years\nTo solve a problem or based on a magical suffering and when the commander in chief says I Want the American people to suffer unimaginably my point would be\nLet's get rid of them as fast as we possibly can here we've got less than\nTwo minutes left and I want to go to Donald in Honolulu, Hawaii Donald thank you for calling into America on the line\nThat they get so much for having me go ahead or\nA well I mean I I Would say no way I mean I think the the Democrats are really the kind of stopping narrative of of uh we're going to impeach Trump about\nOne because uh the problem really isn't Trump I mean the problem is the culture and our country that deeply divided about\nSort of what's acceptable in terms of values and beliefs and I think in teaching trumped really isn't going to solve that kind of division and two I think it feeds Trump's narrative the Democratic mob and the things that the Democrats are trying to do and not only helps to empower\nThe Republican base and let them energized and so and then three probably works against democratic kind of already\nDifficult a messaging and the fact that they're messaging is already problematic in the sense that they don't have a clear and cohesive message center by throwing that out there so extreme that have just serves that kind of model everything out\nAll right thank you very much for calling in from from Honolulu and the lesson the minute that we have left Tom\nI'm ... that's an interesting point the problem isn't Trump it's the culture or is it both [noise]\n[noise] well obviously Mr Trump is supported by the Republican Party pretty much without exception\nSo to say the problem isn't Trump that it's true that he represents the entire Republican Party not all of whom agreed with them to begin with they have now fallen into lock steps behind him so it's actually unfair to say that somehow they're separate because they're one in the same\nAll right Tom ... thank you so much time flew thank you very much for being on America on the line when we come back the panels gonna come back we're going to talk about this and other stuff\n[noise] health care is a problem that people in the district face every single day in New Jersey with fewer than three weeks until the midterms repealing Obamacare is a major issue in a hotly contested congressional race and the issue of leaving many voters on the fence
