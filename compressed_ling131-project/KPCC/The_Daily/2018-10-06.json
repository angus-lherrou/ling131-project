{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Well I think there's a difference between political rhetoric and the policies in legislation that you support\nAnd it has been a bit bizarre your rights the president does use some language I think that that is sort of similar to that of of his attorney general Jeff Sessions\nBut he's also you know been open to hearing how the current sentencing guidelines have resulted in egregious miscarriages of justice I mean you know by commuting to sentence of Alice Johnston and raising the profile of that particular case I mean that that was a big deal\nAnd I really don't care that it was Kim Garton Ash and that convinced him to do it you know when the president and moved on clemency for Alice Johnston it really was an admission that these unduly harsh mandatory minimum sentences aren't working\nBut it's an impacting the ability for you to reach out to Democrats if they hear you're a Republican or we want to work with Republican legislator they say\nTo you now that the president has taken office or since Jeff Sessions has taken on his attorney general do they say you know I just can't do it you know like I I I Can't work with this administration I Can't handle the rhetoric I Can't handle the chaos or is that really not a factor for many\nThese are mono and ... it's a factor\nUm you know certainly I think I'm at and rightfully so there is a lack of trust with a lot of democratic members of Congress and also Republicans who are supportive of reform who are concerned that the department of justice will not implement\nYou know some of these reforms even if they do pass they won't implement these reforms in a way that will will actually have the impact that Congress intense\nAnd um that's fair [laughter]\nEspecially given some of the actions that our attorney general has taken we still have bipartisan cooperation in this space but I Am getting concerned that people are retreating to their corners and ... they're not talking as much as they used to\nAnd when you stop talking I'm you know that's when it becomes quite difficult you know even in areas of agreement and to be able to pass legislation especially groundbreaking legislation like like president sentencing reforms\nSo I'm hopeful that we'll still be able to check our politics at the door on other issues and come together and pass this bill in fact I I Do believe that will happen but you know look with you know everything that's happening with the Supreme Court nomination with Russia gate Stormy Daniels I mean you name it\nYou know a lot of these issues take up all the oxygen in the room I'm not saying that they're not important but\nYou know we've we've got big problems in this country that we can solve\nAnd we do have the votes for president sentencing reform in the Senate right now that bill went to the war right now we'd have more than enough votes to pass it but I Am concerned that the environment is going to impact our ability moving forward\nHolly Harris is executive director of justice action network which works on bipartisan for a little justice reform [noise]\nNews of snap judgment law comes the ace hotel Saturday November seventeenth presented like Cape you see in person tickets available right now at ... dot org slash in person\nJust because the federal legislation is currently stalled doesn't mean that criminal justice reform stuck with it a lot of reform is happening it's happening at the local level in fact this November a thousand prosecutors are running for office\nYou can be tough on crime without being tough on people\nThat's a talented to bury a former criminal defense attorney who's running unopposed this November for district attorney in Durham county\nShe won the Democratic nomination in may beating the sitting district attorney and full disclosure ... is a good friend of our family our relationship goes back long before she was involved with or even interested in running for office\nAre given a tremendous amount of discretion when it crime is committed they decide whether to pursue charges and if so how harsh those charges should be\nAnd for that reason many people consider them to be on the front lines of criminal justice reform\nSome community groups came to me and said that they had been working on criminal justice reform in Durham for about a decade that they'd had some influence with judges they'd had some influence with law enforcement agencies but they'd always been stopped at the district attorney's door so they asked me to run\nAnd what was your first instinct\nMy first instinct was at my life is good and know that\nInitially I just didn't want to be involved in a campaign okay and then what happened so that was kind of asked they went away and came back in a couple of months and this time they came back\nWith this guy named Daryl Atkinson and Daryl has a really compelling story he's an attorney here he runs a nonprofit here in during called for justice is looking to\nDo criminal justice reform throughout the southeast and to do it from the perspective of people who've been forming incarcerated\nAnd so he just kinda sent me down at the table and started talking to me about really what was his stake\nIn our community you talk to me about how they're only twenty two hundred elected district attorneys in the United states something like Ninety five percent of them are men Ninety percent of them are white men and I'm less than two percent or women of color\nAnd Jeff kind of what my broad range of experiences as an attorney my view on system change how that could really make a change here in Durham for the better\nAnd getting into this did you think All right well I'm getting in and I'm going to win this or were you thinking I'm going to try this I think it's important I don't have any expectations about the outcome\nAnd we got into when I think we knew we would change the conversation of a campaign and and very quickly that happened\nThere's incumbent and then there was another challenger in the race and at the beginning of the race they were kind of in the same tough on crime things that you hear in almost every district attorneys race or sheriff's race\nAnd by the end of the campaign they were talking about having more resources in our community to handle um\nPeople who were not suitable for the criminal justice system and diverting those people from the criminal justice system and focusing more on violent offenders we really did change the conversation and but we really did want to win\nAnd I'm Wondering how difficult you think it's going to be once you're in office to actually change the process\nWell criminal justice system is huge and it is the way it is for a reason right um if you walk into during county courthouse you will see almost everybody in the courthouses black or brown so\nNot just the descendants but the victims the witnesses the judges the ADA the defense attorneys the face lifts\nAnd each of those people individually when you take them out of court house will tell you and the system is messed up but when they put back on those robes who those uniforms with their suits and go back and they become part of the system and so our goal really is to start breaking up\nThe way that the system acts at least from the district attorney's office\nWe want to be data driven we want to understand who we charge why we charge him when we charge we want to um pay attention to implicit bias in the system how we hire in the office\nHow we make decisions how power works inside our own office and so that is what the leadership me and the leadership team have been very focused on is just really changing the system at every opportunity that we have\nComing up here for Sean King one of the leaders of this grassroots movement to recruit district attorneys for run this November and the kind of change he thinks it could bring to the system they
