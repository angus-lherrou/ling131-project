{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "I mean I think you know what you're seeing right now in the Democratic party is this incredible anger on the streets of Washington you know you're you're hearing from Joan about what Donald Trump is down what's happening nationally and and I think when you see candidates who are running for office and the victims you are not going to hear them angry you're going to hear them\nFocused on local issues you're going to hear them trying to be optimistic and hopeful in an angry moment because really you know affect the political leaders appeal to both and try and won't want to appeal both people are angry and the people who are confused and pure people who are looking for more anger and division I think that I think\nYou know candidates who in leaders who can find a path to to channel both of those are the ones who are going to win\nOr had been Smith Joan Walsh thanks for being on on America on the line\nWe're going to turn now to the heartland literally and figuratively heartland a memoir of working hard and being broke in the richest country on earth is the intimate family story of journalist and author Sarah's marsh who grew up in Kansas in and among the working poor\nIt's a multigenerational story that is that's political as it is personal and I want to welcome Sarah to America on the line thank you very much for being\nHere thanks for having me Jonathan so twenty sixteen so much has been written about this so called Trump voters of the Midwest and the south with\nSay journalists and other observers got wrong\nWell I Would begin by just you know challenging\nThe idea that we can paint an entire swath of our country as a political monolith so that's kind of reductive framework where we color states red and blue I Would suggest that every one where I'm from a was a Trump voter and and what that does is it rendered invisible\nUh well about forty percent of voters which to my mind ain't nothing it amounts to millions and millions of Americans on the ground in these places that are hotly referred to 'em and media narratives as Trump country a of folks who often are doing some of those to my mind the most important\nResistance work in this country and and sometimes inhospitable political climates\nOn the ground working for progress in places where a state administrations are often are very conservative\nAnd um you know I I just take issue with the idea that that we can um that we can stereotype or even caricature I'm such an immense piece of this country politically culturally and racially for that matter it\nIt all off and amounts to a whitewashing when they're talking about the um the working class that I'm a native of in this part of the country so are the problems exist on many levels I think\nAnd and that's what I I I Love about your book I are\nGoing to admit I didn't read the entire thing but I read big chunks of it and what I came out what I most appreciated was it sort of lift the veil off of a narrative an American narrative that being being poor and\nThe situations that the quote unquote poor get themselves into our situations that are the the sole province of\nPeople of color and African Americans in particular and what you do in your book is make it clear that no no no no these are the situations that um the poor ... large\nAre buying them so ... are are living in and um I don't know I guess as someone who writes about politics and writes about race a off and that I actually found myself very appreciative than your story is one that takes into account um\nThat what you were living in and living through and what people of color are living through our one in the same it's just your prospect you're coming at it from your perspective as a as white and as a white woman\n... yeah I mean you know I don't think that I cast as went so far to say one in the same because the ... the um the particular thing about my experience of\nPoverty at a white woman is that um you can as I say in the book simultaneously have racial privilege and economic disadvantage I Would not put my ... and I don't think this is what you're suggesting but I wanted to be clear that I I Would not put my um experience up you know next to a woman of color who was raised in poverty and\nSay we had the same experience however there certainly are more commonalities and and\nThen one would leave for a mom and dad\nYes sure um you know political discourse there's often very artfully leverage to divide people along color lines I'm a among the poor uh is is incredibly destructive for for our country and\nUm you know it's been very heartening for me the last few weeks on book tour all over the country and having people of all backgrounds and colors and even political persuasion come through signing lines and say\nUm our story is different and yet it's the same the subtitle of my book is I'm a member of working hard and being broke in the richest country on earth and and while there are different strata of disadvantage and privilege with within that experience it is a shame fully a common one in this\nCountry and you know that could sue something this is what I was thinking of when I'm I've struggled to find the word commonalities with you you grew up in Kansas and the Nineteen eighties in the Nineteen nineties when President Reagan\nWas in office and convincing America that government was the problem not the solution and he used terms like welfare queen that have an impact\nOn how your family and other working for Kansas you'd government social programs\nYou know I think it did that a language of course had had and was code in some ways for a a really um a racist take on the role that\nGovernment programs uh serve in this country and in fact most people in this country on public assistance are white just Enron numbers um but a lot of that discourse in my during my childhood was ah was really targeted specifically at African American women I didn't have the political savvy to understand that\nIn my largely white rural place and all I understood was as a bunch of single poor moms in my family and I and I understood that we were people who would qualify for such programs and and I also understood therefore that there must be some shame inherent to seeking such assistance and and that was absorb deeply\nBy by the the women specifically in my family I think\nOf one of the narratives that comes out of the twenty sixteen election is this notion that from capitalized on the fear of the other\n... which may be just another word for bigotry and you write a lot about um the other or euros vividly about what it's like to be white and also other can you in the less than two minutes that we have exchange expand on that\nSure where when I was I'm not a not just the first from my family to go to college but the first from my farmhouse to to finish high school so when I arrived on at a State University even um I was I sense that I was at the\nUh on a lower rung of some economic pecking order and and I was really um\nDifferent for being having a rural background and coming from a place where people broke their backs with manual labor and and didn't get a chance at such things like a college degree so um so that's really when I came into kind of a class awareness um when I was a kid I\nI never would have used the the word poor about my experience 'cause I I had enough to eat and I had a roof over my head but it turns out that what that is what I was and um and so it is a particular kind of other that can be physically invisible but uh that's a experienced by um by millions of Americans right at this moment\nMhm and real quickly the less than a minute that we have left or do you give a quick uh an update on how Kris Kobach who's doing in his gubernatorial campaign against the Democrat Mark Kelly\nMm well I haven't seen any recent polling uh but I Do know that um his
