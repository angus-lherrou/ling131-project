on Peter let me get your reaction to what John just said\nYou know look at this moment I Would lend more the playing on the Republican Party though from somebody in a life long a Republican and a\nAnd a conservative I I'd say I'd want to re litigate the last Thirty years I think it's somewhat more mixed than that um [noise] than than John presented a good look we can call you certainly have a role in was a I got I maybe I Would I Would like to focus on his party was was often would you\nNot to blame but how do we get out a little side um because whenever the ... we all were where we are and she said something\nAbout this idea of the narrative one and listening to listening well ah to want to bother 'em\nAnd that I think it's a ... a conflict in the abstract easy and it's very difficult and with the chicken or um [noise] that is it's very very easy to look to the people that you disagree with when he ... to see how they are for sale and reasonable they all say they have to\nTo me that much more difficult ... give up the autobiographical is is for me to do that so again very specific I was I think probably as early as Lenny body a little public and Carney highly critical of Tom ... stay\nBut I've got this phone call in fact the last\nTwo days being in Congress Asian with poll calm people people are profoundly disagree with time here where the problem um because if you don't give that little keep outside and so with actual people in your life it's very easy to demonize the other folks doesn't mean they're white\nUm and it doesn't mean that that that all arguments are equally valid\nBut it does mean a method to quote eagle to to to tear within also one other thing about about this political tribalism which is I think one of the key things to getting out of it as as you have to find people\nWithin ones on political community one's own political tried to speak to their own mother works is to have a liberal lecture conservative or conservative lecture a liberal and say you got to do that as more of this last fall that only to not only doesn't work\nIt actually makes one was the worst because people dig in their their heels are so he just has to come from political leadership but finally in fundamentally were self governing country and we we can come out of this but that requires individual people individualize\nTo say we want to live lives about high politics hire a home and better deals to the better angels rather than the darker\nImpulse is a lot of Americans\nAnd current I Would love your reaction to everything that you just heard but jumping off what Peter just said in terms of the solution can this can that happen can this change in tone in an atmosphere that we're in can that happen\nWith out leadership from the president of the United states\nYes but it can happen without leadership and I just want to come back to something you asked which I think as it is very important question which is are we at a tipping point we are\nWe're at a tipping point we don't know which way it's going to tip and we're getting closer and closer and closer to that ledge and you feel it\nEvery single day whether it's the action to to show gee whether it's their reactions to having a we have a a I don't want to blame the Democrats that I Want to call on the Democrats that you basically just say there is a leadership gap from either party\nThe political or the Democrat to somebody to come out and be able to articulate for the nation how to cars I'm a non tribal way forward\nAnd and that's where we stand and and so we are at a tipping point not necessarily a tipping point to that I'd like to say that it could be a tipping point for the better if this kind of leadership and doesn't have the one person it can be a group of people but it but we need it and we're going to get it\nI'm Glad you said that camera and it's not it doesn't have to be one person it can be a group of people and I think a lot of times people are always constantly looking for the one to leave them out when quite frankly they and a bunch of people around them could be the collective one to\nDo it I Want to go to Brian here in Manhattan uh Brian thank

calculated device to cash for Christian on people on the\nOn the ... and when I Am going to ...
