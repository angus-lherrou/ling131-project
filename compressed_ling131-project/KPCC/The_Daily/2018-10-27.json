{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "How unusual is it that you have this many challenger candidate out raising their incumbent opponent\nThere's no historical precedent for this we had never seen this before\nOr you're exactly right normally incumbents have an edge they have a built in fundraising network they're sitting on committees where\nUm packs or companies are people who want to um um be familiar with that Congress men are often given to them\nAnd it's not as if Republicans are not raising money they are raising money in fact some battleground incumbents raised even record highs but it's just simply that the surge of money on the Democratic side is so big is so pervasive that is so broad and so deep\nThat that's what these Republican incumbents are up against\nYou had any idea how much money's being spent and how it actually being used to try and turn out voters\nA lot of that is going towards the ground game at the D triple the U.S is investing thirty million dollars in focusing on getting out low propensity voters Latino voters young voters that is a huge chunk of money that they're focusing on through digital on\nStaffers on the ground and then the same way campaigns like knowledge look\nYou know normally when you're doing budgeting for a campaign you have to make cuts you can't do everything because it's just so expensive this time around for democratic campaigns have been able to get it all they've been able to spend huge amounts on television they've been able to run a robust digital campaign and they've also been able to bring in\nA lot of staffers to focus on a ground game so I think they sort of taken all above strategy because they're able to this time around they have the money to do it\nOr they shown you any proof that this on the ground strategy is actually resulting either in more voters that are engaged that wouldn't have been in twenty sixteen\nWell I think that's a very district by district specific specific question\nI think that some are also more comfortable and sort of sharing and giving us all looking for what's going on than others I think there's also sort of this fear about sort of showing too much of the playbook particularly in the final stretch here\nBut yeah I think that there is absolutely a focus and and sort of being able to cheer on what they've been able to do in terms of\nIncreasing turnout Democrats will point to the Virginia off year elections back in two thousand and Seventeen when we just saw a huge surges across the board in terms of turnout\nAnd an individual districts California's thirty ninth district Gil Cisneros he was able to to eke out a victory there and very competitive Democratic primary with tons of money getting spent\nAnd in part because he was able to double Latino turnout\nOver there are two thousand and fourteen primary turnout results but that takes a lot of money and a lot of resources\nAnd we're not expecting to see twenty sixteen level turnout this year it's still a midterm year it's still your that people who you know don't pay attention to politics are probably not going to vote and it's on a sort of pervasive as you know people who were said glued to cable news those are the people who are already going to vote and are definitely going to be there\nBut it's still a lot of work for these campaigns to get people who are not watching cable news\nAnd who were just trying to get through their day those are the people that they need to get and we're still not seeing that we're going to suddenly see presidential level turnout this year\nUp next a look at Republican spending with Elena Schneider stay with us\nThey take away is supported by timeshare exit team\nFounded on the belief that valid contracts must have a reasonable term exit options that timeshare exit team dot com [noise]\nDuring the mid term election it's always harder to generate enthusiasm for the president's party is not to say Republicans are raising a lot of money\nThey're just not raising as much a Democrat\nAnd according to Alina Schneider there isn't over reliance on outside groups who normally spend money running ads\nBut this year at least one of those groups is focused on a strong ground game\nCongressional leadership fund as sort of the flagship Republican outside group and they're the ones who pledged to spend a hundred and fifty million dollars this year they've made it a huge effort to actually start opening field offices\nAnd they've got field offices and I think more than two dozen districts across the country and this is not a traditional role for outside groups are super PACs\nUm because superPACs cannot communicate with the candidate they're legally prevented from doing that and so there's usually they sort of exist in and just sort of as you say flooding the airwaves with negative attack ads on Democrats that sort of their traditional role but see left decided this year that they were going to make a huge push for a field organizing\nOne thing that a lot of folks were surprised by and twenty sixteen\nWas that there were a whole bunch of voters on the Republican side that seem to kind of come out of no where are we hearing about a similar dynamic taking place this year or is this just a different election in a different kind of dynamic that we are going to see\nWell I think President Trump is certainly demonstrating that he hopes that he's able to do the same thing he's spending time in the final weeks of the campaign he um he had a rally in Montana and Arizona and Nevada\nThose are all places where he feels like he's going to be able to rally that base rally those rural voters who came out in huge numbers for him and he's trying to make that connection for for voters and saying look even though I'm not on the ballot pretend like I'm On the ballot\nI remember President Obama saying similar things to his supporters right you got to come out\nGot to vote for me because even though I'm not on the ballot my policies are really it's very very important but it was also true that the campaigns themselves were targeting those Obama voters who tend to sit out midterm elections\nAre you hearing that Republicans are doing the same thing with those Trump voters this year which is Trump is rallying them at his rallies but they're spending money making sure that they're targeting those voters who turned out for Trump may not normally turnout mid term elections\nYes there absolutely trying and focusing on those chunks of voters who who are Trump's base voters to make sure that they show up again in two thousand in Eighteen that's certainly a focus that I hear I mean even with spending some time or just earlier this week down in Minnesota\nWith Jim Hackett orange campaign and he certainly has has made the pitch to those voters this is a rural Minnesota district that he's trying to flip sort of an incest really democratic but has really trend towards Trump and the last two years\nHe's trying to make that pitch to Kennedy is basically saying this is a miniature national election and I think that his campaign without a doubt is trying to make that connection to those voters and spending money to do so again I have to keep sort of putting it off on November sex but we're not going to see whether or not those efforts have paid off\nOr whether or not they have success with that or if we see again sort of a a drop off like we did in ten and fourteen and the Trump coalition whether or not they're going to decide to stay home has\nThere ever been a connection made between how much money candidates spend and how many voters actually turn out\nWell I think we're going to get an enormous set of data come November sex [laughter]\nYou know I've done reporting on a couple of years ago taking a look at how funders so those are the kinds of candidates who have sort of a unlimited bank account where they can spend on their own race\nAnd that didn't always translate into success and I think that you know when we looked at self ... those were often people who didn't necessarily have sort of built up base of voters they hadn't ever held elected office before and look where we're looking at that again we've got two thirds of these candidates have never run for office before\nUm so whether or not that actually the enormous amount of spending actually translates into voters I don't think it's any guarantee and I think that or work down in Texas\nIs trying to take out Ted Cruz might be the latest example of that because even though he's got more money than he could probably even spend in these final weeks he's still running up against a math problem\nThat isn't isn't his budget but it's just simply who lives in Texas and there are a lot of Republicans who live in Texas\nAnd Lena Schneider's campaigns reporter for Politico [noise]\nHunters on for whoever sent pipe bombs to some of the president's critics CNN Russell's with reporting the
