{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "Twenty eight year legal career\nGiven a Charlie rematch Christina given what we saw last week how ... and honestly how can anyone feel comfortable are confident that his declaration of being\nIndependent um um is something that they can trust\nI'd like to address that I'd I both a bandwidth issue ... affair\nAnd I both rovers similar articles about this when and were generally sympathetic to judge have been sympathetic judge Kevin uh but we were both absolutely stunned by about a ...\nBy the the the violation of the of the normal ... forms of judicial temperament of of trying to restrain those kinds of partisan attacks\nAnd it was a genuinely remarkable moment look I understand being angry and we would all be angry but there is appropriate and inappropriate expressions of anger and he crossed a line by making some of the comments that did you did you have mentioned here and this is what this does is it does cast a shadow\nI'm over ... over judge Kavanaugh on the court but also the court as an institution you know as a non political nonpartisan non vindictive um arbiter of of the law\nAnd you don't ... absolutely right when he points out how important the court is to conservatives and that that really cannot be overstated but but the puzzle here as the Republicans still can have another conservative on the court that does not have that kind of a cloud\nOver conservative jurisprudence and over the legitimacy of the U.S Supreme Court and I'm Sorry that that is what he did and when he says I was there was a father and son actually was there as a nominee to the Supreme Court in most judges know that you are not supposed to behave in those you in that particular way\n... you're you're going to disagree with Charlie argue\n[noise] I Do disagree I I think that it's a little odd to refer to a norm for a judicial nominee who is being\nAttacked as an attempted rapist and a participant in gang rape um I mean that's his neither uncharted waters here I think it would have been odd for somebody not to respond with force and emotion in such a circumstance and I think if you had\nYou would have served himself worse that a lot of people would be asking you know why if he why would an innocent man I'm be so sort of calm\nAnd uh uh and sober about\nThese unbelievable uh charges and uh and the way a lot of people they're treating him\nChristina so I don't trust it you know the frame or set up the Supreme Court such that they would essentially be immune to the whims of part is in\nShifts and changes and what Kavanaugh's exhibited last week was that he was hyper partisan and again trafficking conspiracy theories you know I've talked to a lot of\nUh individuals who study a abusers\nAnd he is a classic case of someone who is it it's all of the various symptoms of someone who is abuse it and not stable it steady you know it's it's beyond just emotional when he says I'm an even keel open minded independent dedicated to the constitution he displayed none of those traits when he was talking to\nYeah senators right not even senatorial courtesy so that was problematic and we can talk about the process yes no one wants to be accused of anything but you know it's very fascinating that he and the president or trafficking in\nThis very specific language targeted to the fifty three percent of white women\nWho voted for Donald Trump's because they're saying listen this could be your brother or your husband or your son this is how they're keeping the Republican base with that right and ignoring what are some really very clear allegations that need time so if you are so adamant that you have not done this\nThan actually if you're going to be on the bench for life somewhat spent a month or two\nDiscredited in every single person who said that you were inappropriate right why are we trying to rush that if you indeed are innocent then said let the process be the process and take as much time as he wants because I Know the truth and honesty or on my side so I you know I\nI'm ... I Do and frustrated because I just think about\nAs a black woman if I had gone to a job interview\nAnd yelled at the people who were asking me questions and almost started crying and talked about how much I Love beer I Would be scored it out of the T. C. B. Y. or the Starbucks or wherever I was applying you know and as a black man you may have been ... by security so I mean this is a real problem because we're looking at our institutions\nAs Charlie ... said but the the lack of respect that this president has towards our institutions is trickling down now to our congressional representative Republican senators and now our Supreme Court justice nominees\nI watched the ... of Clarence Thomas is a opening statement from when the hearings with Anita Hill happen and the contrast between what uh now Justice Thomas said in his tone and demeanor\nVersus judge Kavanaugh's is literally a study in night versus day I'm In the little time do we have left I Want to go to a Caitlin in Newton New Jersey Caitlin thanks for calling into America on the line\n[laughter] Hi how are you good we only have a Ninety seconds left you're angry sat out straight as\nI Am angry I angry and frustrated but I'm not surprised in the least that I'm I'm twenty five years old I'm a social worker and a woman I'm I'm from the people and unfortunately that came up some sexual misconduct\nAnd I'm not surprised at all I'm not even the least bit surprised and um I feel like I haven't been surprised to see president became president so that's pretty much all I have to\nSay our our right Kaitlin just giving it breathing through the\nEnd to the point of ... or China or imagined that the ... minute that we that we have left once we get through this Kavanaugh this Kavanaugh vote and uh once we get through the management can we put this back together\nYou know I think it's going to be very hard I think it's a the the damage is going to be long lasting and I think we're going to be paying the price for this for a long time and and just to clarify ... remembers wants to ... when\nI'm not saying that he should not have been angry and and I think your point Jonathan the contracts go back and watch Clarence Thomas sweating anger yet he did not cross those lines I did not suggest that he ought to have been Michael Dukakis when he had that\nYou know deadpan response from New Delhi your your your wife was murdered 'em but again this is where you know prudent\nRestrained anger can be more powerful than the sort of\nThe you know again the evening stream partisanship so it's it's not a case of anger versus not anger it's how did he expressed that anger and I do think the contracts with Clarence Thomas is a really good contrast rematch let me ... ... was\nA Justice Thomas accused Democrats of trying to Lynch in and he was criticized widely at the time on similar grounds that\nJudge Kavanaugh's being criticized now you know the job interview parallel that was raised earlier just strikes me as absurd how many job interviews you go to where you are being accused of all\nKinds of wild thing on the basis of zero evidence\nYou know I just think people are using an unrealistic standard here and are also I also have a somewhat unrealistic view of what the public view of the court is going to be if you have a conservative court the people who are upset about cabinet would be just upset about a conservative porch\nAnd Christina laughing Ninety eight\nPercent of cases yeah I think people will be upset about a conservative court but they also wouldn't be upset about someone who's an accused rape is where we haven't had time to actually investigate that right let's give it the time that a desert so no one should be falsely accused and also know\nApplying for a job at Starbucks is not the same as applying for a job it's important because the Supreme Court is a job for life and there are nine individuals who are tasked with upholding the constitution of the United states and\nWe're going to have to leave it there on that point thank you Charlie Christina ... when we come back a record number of teachers across America are running for office this year we're going to talk to some of them to find out why they're listening to America on the line [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nPolitics is tribal NBC Cornell says it's her fruit at another time when the economy with strong five of balanced budget and the government will shut down\nThat's what you need to do Mr President do not think what the nineties me now that's next time I Want to tonight at age one eighty nine point three T.
