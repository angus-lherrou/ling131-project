I mean it's defiance is anger of the three that we've heard that one to me anyway sounds like it has she has her finger on the poles maybe\nNot just of her her congressional district but of the country when it comes to health care no\nYeah again um these are very popular protections amongst both Democrats and Republicans the Kaiser Family foundation has pulled on this multiple times\nAnd to my knowledge every time they have found that a large majority of Republicans believe that these protections for people with preexisting conditions should stay on the books and I think not only because of a sense of fairness but also because\nI'm most people are either themselves have some sort of condition that could on ... in in the immediate term or longer term uh affect the cost of their care it some day people are going to get old\nAnd and going to have health problems even if they are young and healthy and uh you know seemingly invincible today and or they have family members who do so this is a very personal issue for a lot of people\nI think it's excessive face in the marketplace\nThe libertarian philosophy that the market is going to take care of all the country's problems I don't think there's a country in the world where the market really takes place of health care\nBecause health care economics are such that if you really need serious health care it's unbelievably expensive and it's going to bankrupt individuals uh but you know\nIf all of us are only temporarily able bodied and stuff's going to happen to all of us if the Republicans believe in savings up front\nThan they believe in more devastation when you're sick\nI Want to go to that paradise in the Pacific Hawaii and an calling in from Honolulu thank you for calling into America on the line\nThank you I'm Glad to be here in\nNineteen Seventy four at the state of Hawaii he\nPassed a law that made it mandatory that no insurance companies could charge anyone more if they had a pre existing conditions they also made it so any person who were work twenty hours a week or more was covered by their employer\nWith health insurance the amount of money that was allowed to be deducted from their paycheck would know more than ten percent of their ...\nMost people in Hawaii you have to work two jobs so that meant you had the opportunity to have double coverage what that meant was there was an incredible pool of people\nIn the insurance we had a number of different choices you could have a PPO you could have an HMO there were usually two or three insurance as you can choose from with your company based on the size of your company\nThat meant you had really low health insurance costs everybody was covered\nAnd we have one of the healthy as states in the nation Obamacare change some of that not necessarily for the better but I Would like everybody to be able to have with the state of Hawaii made real in Nineteen Seventy four\nAnd I want to thank you very much for for calling in from from Honolulu calling into America on the line I mean is that is that the solution just the Hawaii model\nYou know to be honest I don't know much about the Hawaii model but one um point that I Would just make is that\nIf you require insurance companies to charge everybody the same price at for insurance and ... to cover all sorts of conditions I'm as Obamacare did at the very least you know these essential health benefits\nUm and not turn people away\nFor having a healthcare problems that that can enough itself not necessarily solve the problem because if you don't require people to buy insurance only the people who need insurance by it that healthy people don't buy it and then the prices just spiral out of control so I I think you need those protections for people but you also need requirements that people buying insurance\nIs Catherine Rampell Brian Lehrer thanks so much for being here tonight I'm we're gonna play that Ted Cruz at one of these days the really funny one that people have talked about we have to take a short break and when we return foreign policy is a political issue too isn't it you're listening to America on the line\n[noise]\n\nHi I'm Jill ... why is it so hard to solve homelessness in Southern California a homeless housing proposal in Fullerton have included [noise]\nSummer sport of housing literally ends homelessness from people I'm convinced that but you need to convince everyone else and we just want to feel safe and they want to take that away from us and\nEverybody getting all these things are afraid you're taking care of these people one way or another but over the map with that there are places to\nListen for my special series all week long here on eighty nine point three K.
