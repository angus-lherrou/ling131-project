about a cop and they were right about sunny day and they were right about doing your homework and you would do well in school and then then then\nAnd now they're telling you something that is absolutely counter to your experience so the pool is there because they are the original define there's yet in your own sense of reality right now in terms of you know what you're exposed to it's running counter to that very very tough\nI I've had people um have difficulty going home and visiting their families I\nI've had somebody who was engaged to a a wonderful young man um but his family were Trump supporters and she's seriously considered breaking the engagement [noise] um because who are these people um and I went this you know that\nMe ask you one fall question 'cause at other scenario that I laid out about a and it's really from our desks ... about how Republicans feel\nConservatives feel psychologically and when they see\nThe rage and the outrage from I guess people like you that they also feel wounded and misunderstood and even silenced 'em by the ridge so your direction toward their points of view is not just different from them but unacceptable are you getting that from your family to\nAh [noise] I think so I'm the first to get a college degree I um I I Try to pay attention to that date I work in analytics\nAnd I think what ends up happening when I Try to when I Try to engage in conversations from hard data points and what I Do that it just gets brushed off as\nWell that doesn't mean anything anyway or you can just make up numbers whenever you are and and you can actually sources and just the belief isn't there which I also find interesting because it's all about go to school go to school go to school and now that I have this education that I tried to bring it home none of that Israel\nYeah you're the superior to me and we're not going to let you do it fall thank you so much for calling in as we continue a with Philadelphia clinical psychologist Dr Cindy down Baker on how the news is making me crazy can you expand a little bit on that\nRepublicans scenario um that I mentioned before that I think we didn't really get to it\nAnd you heard from Paul about his relatives but this this reaction to the rage that liberals are Democrats have as somehow not just being different but being an attempt to silence them\n[noise] yeah well I think it's very tough I'm going to shift a little bit and and feel for the people who are Republicans right now who have lost friends those you know they really believe 'em\nWhat they believe and um the rage that I think there's reach really on both sides and whenever we were feeling rage we stop listening you know it's sort of this I'm nip it in a position of of rage\nBecause for a lot of Democrats and progress as it's not just this tax rate versus a tax rate or something like that it's if you think that if you're ... you're on the margin is things on\nYeah it well it it's shaming it's labeling I I I think of I'm a physician or that I Know who um is a Russian descent and she\nAnd her entire family who voted for the president and believe very strongly and the president um and believe that Democrats are really naive as all get out\nAnd in that case um you know there's a sense of you guys are nuts that the Democrats are going to get us you know the belief was the Democrats were going to get us into World War three\nUm and I believe that this kind of authoritarian rule um is what works so it becomes a cultural thing and this is a very good in being she's a caring physician a bug very much a Trump supporter\nLet's take another call here is Marcy and nags head North Carolina Hi Marcy\nHi thanks for having me on tell us your story um I\nCompletely relate to what the last caller said about his family I'm kind of on a different level I live in an area that\nI'm by liberal ideas are considered the minority um the way that I voted consider the minority and that's very difficult to um my dad created a monster and me as far as the\nPolitical junkie and he passed away seven years ago he was a moderate Republican who and his older years\nI'm kind of adopted a lot more liberal views\nAnd we had great conversations he would listen to me rant and rave um he would give me his opinion he would agree with me on something so he was kind of like my Republican sounding board to let me know that\nSaid I wasn't crazy about some of these things and now that I'm missing that I feel like I have no one really around my husband agrees with me on we both the same way but he is an end to it as much as I Am I so I feel very isolated I kind of\nTake things in I watch the news I get angry and I don't have an outlet and he has accused me of being angry especially during the Kavanaugh hearings and it wasn't even just because of the me too it was more because you know he blatantly lied and they still confirmed him and it was just outrageous the whole charade\nAnd I felt like I had no one to discuss it with\nA little bit with my husband but\nI was angry I was angered at my phone call semi senators and all that and you know and calling constantly did nothing and that's kind of what I feel I'm so waiting for November sex because that kind of on holding out hope for that ...\nTo ...\nI have a I have a number of things to say here are more the and and you know obviously many of us are similarly to you [noise]\nUm I I think what's made things a little bit different now to them when you and your dad used to have like a tennis game of politics\nIs that we there was a void in how we identify ourselves these days you know they used to be people identified by where they lived in what religion they were there were a variety of things and now we're in a very mobile society people aren't all that involved in organized religion\nSo that void of how we identify ourselves has been taken over by our political identifications\nAnd I think one something has to do with an identification it's very vulnerable to Shane and so we're shaming each other and that feels really quite awful [noise]\nI I I get concerned about the blue wave in November I I Do um you know I think there might be one um but if not I get concerned\nFor the people who are pinning their hopes on it um\nBecause it is a perfect example of this and I hope this addresses it a little bit um I I went to get lunch today I was in the elevator and I wear this button that says moms demand action for gun control\nAnd this stranger in the elevator said to me you know the trouble with today is that we're in so much trouble and there's nothing we can do\nAnd that's exactly what you just said to me I feel this sense of learned helplessness like what can I Do and boy oh boy November better come around and and I feel like I can at least have a voice again I'm\nA social media maybe plays a part for you in that you can find communities I'm that way it's not you know in the real time self defense and and it was saying how immunity of people how social\nMedia can be both isolating and community forum and we have to take a break we'll continue with this in a minute on America Online [noise]\n\nSay there I'm Joshua Johnson the news is often confusing but not always women are better leaders were not afraid of nuance but we are happy to hear from just to just tell it like it is from an economic standpoint if you don't\nHave gender balanced view far stupid won a always available in plain English we can I said eight one eighty nine point three say PCC [noise]\nKey PCC supporters include
