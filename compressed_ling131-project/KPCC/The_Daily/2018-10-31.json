it's like you I feel like I've I've heard that so many times like where it's like oh you know you can't take democracy for granted a you know this is a thing you have to really fight for and\nAnd when you yeah like so often that just sounds like a like like lip service and then all of a sudden you see what's going on around the world right now and even these kinds of numbers and you think oh wow that's this is this is for real this is not a ... yeah this is not a joke or this is this is this happening right now\nRight and there's a chart there a couple of charts in the in the survey that I that I looked at and it's like looking at a rollercoaster downhill slide in terms of the the number of Americans and also folks around the world for whom\nA democracy is not seen as a um the Bible is not the right word worthwhile is a little too strong but their face in it\nOr is way on the decline wobbly yeah that's that's the ...\nThe word wildly let's go to Terry who is calling in from Brewster town Tennessee Terry thank you for calling into America on the line\nWhere he could go for the call we're program um for those people there or a strong military government or a strong man in charge for\nNo democracy there's over a hundred countries in the world they can buy one way ticket\nAnd that leads to root for the people that would really like to be here\nAre right Terry thank you thank you very much for calling into America on the line I'd\nBe curious just in case there's anybody out there or anywhere in in the country who actually would like to see a strong man\nWould like to see an authoritarian form of government or even a military leadership give us a call eight four four seven four or five eight to five five because I Would really like to know I'm ... ... why you think that let's\nGo to Jay in touch in New Jersey Sanjay thank you very much for calling into America on the line\nI think it's so much for having me um shall I go straight into my\nGo right on in an\nOdd I I think we we find stuff that's most of the nation and on the face of the U.S\nAnd I'm grateful for having them they just they may not be the thing is I think Lee leaving the EU general ... al ... and what I mean by that he's\nOn that lets you can find a good school system you know so some of them that sets them\nIncluding media the only come back and they get it's far from there to fight you know there is no place for an independent unless you are about anything that\nAren't son Jay thank you very much for calling into America on the line and he raises that\nWas actually I I'm an interesting point in that he's in San Jay said that we are living under the illusion of democracy or we have this two party system but we have this two party system that is that the exclusion of\nThird of third parties is that a lot of is is that what could be driving down sort of support for democracy that democracy seems to be democracy not really for everybody\nI mean certainly that's a huge part of it that feeling that you're sort of street hockey they didn't do this two party system and you when you do ... you know drag yourself out to the polls you have to kind of plug your nose while you while you stop your your ballot in the box\nUm and I think that for us like a a you know that that feeling in general that people feel like they're not being heard or represented that they're being forced to uh yeah that the system kind of has a\nHas has narrowed their options and that uh it yet isn't isn't actually representing them um that's that's certainly a part of it and that was yeah one of the things that that we got so fascinated in this up for this episode\nWe're working on a lot of one of the one of the I guess proposed solutions 'em to all of this to sort of break the I'm sort of jaundiced view of democracy is something called rank choice voting\nAnd I want you to talk about that in in if you could because as I was reading about it I kept thinking for those of us of a certain age you might remember Lani Guinier\nWho was President Clinton's nominee for the civil rights division at the Justice Department and her nomination cuts got all the because she had written in favor of something called the cumulative voting rights are they are they the same or they they're they're a little\nBit different they're a little bit different but I Do not rank choice yeah but but they're they're somewhat similar but but let me tell you about running choice oh so rain choices actually uh it it sounds complicated but it's not so complicated it's pretty similar to what we already out so you're going to the voting booth you get your ballot has a slate of candidates on it\nYou you pick you know your candidate to vote for as your top choice so so far so normal but and then here's where the rain choice part comes and you can also say if you want you know oh by the way this other person is my second choice and and then yet another person is my third choice and here's my fourth and fifth and you can kind of lift as many candidates as you wish or is there are\nUm so basically you're just you're you're drinking a as many of the candidates as you want you're saying this is the you know gold silver and bronze medal of my boat\nUm [noise] so that's kind of from the voters protected from the from the counting side the way that works is that in order to win a candidate you know maybe obviously needs a majority of the vote so so so you start with all the first choices getting tallied up if one candidate has\nFifty percent plus one a first choice votes here she wins no problem but it's not the bottom vote getter is eliminated and then that person's votes instead of sort of dying with the candidate that person's votes are sort of born again as their second choice so those go into the column of whoever's the number two on that\nParticular ballot and and when you do that or you take a look okay does now does anyone have majority of the vote and basically you just keep you know lather in rinsing and repeating until you have someone who\nWho is the winner is this is this actually in operation anywhere here in the country yeah this is happening\nOn a city level in a whole bunch of places like Minneapolis San Francisco Oakland a bunch of places but the really exciting thing is it's about to happen\nIn a in Maine for the first time not on a city level but for um for you know national level candidates for the one Senate seat and the two house seats that are going to be decided next week in Maine\nWas this something that was it implemented by the state legislature and signed into law by the governor or was this a ballot initiative\nSo actually it was kind of a it was kind of despite the legislature and governor that the people voted it in a they they'd been fighting the miners had been fighting for for a while and then they approved it in a referendum the state legislature sort of balls and tried to postpone it\nAnd push it off by five years and then the voters they had this thing called the the people's veto they just voted for it again and so now they're going for it to now they're doing it and it's a it's a really exciting because it's the first time that this\nSystem is being used for for a national level race\nOr so it's kind of a kind of a great experiment and we'll see what happens next week\nWell rain in exactly seven days a lot of Nasser thanks so much for being on America on the line thanks so much revenue and time for a break when we come back we'll turn our attention to the balance of
