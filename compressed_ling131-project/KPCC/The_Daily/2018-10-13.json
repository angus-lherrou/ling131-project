{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "It's better than it was and I do think that he gets some credit for that\n[noise] okay let's tackled number two twenty five million jobs as a candidate President Trump said that he would create twenty five million jobs over the course of ten years are we on track to see that kind of job growth\nSo ... I Believe we're right around for a million jobs from the start of his presidency and I will say first off that is just like a straight line continuation of the job creation pace that we were on for the average of the last several years before his presidency that said\nIt is very difficult to imagine that you will continue to see that kind of expansion absent more workers coming online I mean they're just or would it be enough workers to fill those jobs were three point\nSeven percent unemployment there are probably some workers who haven't been looking for work who come in off the sidelines but not enough to keep this kind of peace up for six more years most economists think\nThis discussion about more jobs in the manufacturing sector and in sectors like coal mining what have we seen there\nAgain here here's a mixed picture with some real successes the president can claim manufacturing had a pretty terrible not just recession but a pretty ...\nCoverage from the recession and that has been up we have seen more manufacturing jobs added at a real celebration of that over the last year so the president is claiming a lot of credit for that on mining if you're looking at oil and gas\nDrilling we've seen a bounce back which is almost certainly correlated with the a spike in oil prices again coalmining which is a thing that he really did focus on a lot has not come back\nWe also heard a lot about this president is a populist so how do you rank him on the scale of populist or economic nationalist his rhetoric versus what's actually happening or be a his administration and policy\nHe's done a lot of the things he said he would do but he has led with a lot of the things that\nAlmost any other Republican running against him and twenty sixteen for the nomination would have also done\nYou know Jeb Bush would have sons of tax cut bill that Donald Trump side and it might not have worked all that different I guess you can see the the most pro trouble you can put it is\nHe is pursuit a bunch of policies that are pro growth and that of help the economy grow faster and the most skeptical Trump you could say is that he inherited a the start of a parade and there's a very good job throwing himself in front of it and\nYou know tossing some\nFuel back to the to the floats in the form of fiscal stimulus I Do want to mention one other thing though which is that he also promised that Americans will be seeing huge increases in their paychecks\nAnd we don't see that yet because inflation has\nHas also written over the last year and so there has been for the typical American worker really no wage gained over the last twelve bucks for a president who made a populist pitch to workers if not all that reassuring to say to them corporate profits are at an all time high and we promised your wages will get there so\nI'm going to appoint justices of the United States Supreme court\nHer Second Amendment [noise] we are going to have your Second Amendment volley\nWho you want us to be the court overturn roe anyone we put another two or perhaps three justices oh that's really what's going to be ... will happen and that'll happen automatically in my opinion because I Am putting pro life justices on the court\nRoom he weighed in the second amendment were two of the criteria that then candidate Trump said he'd use and picking new Supreme Court justices he's already had the chance to follow through on those promises twice now and with me to break down how Trump has done so far with the Supreme Court as well as the lower courts is anyhow co founder of scotusblog\nYou promise to appoint people who are going to be really good legal scholars and he certainly has done that I don't think anybody questions the academic professional qualifications of justice Gorsuch our justice Kavanaugh\nAs far as his promise to appoint somebody who was going to overturn roe versus Wade\nWho is going to be strong and the second amendment the jury is still out because one important thing to remember is the Supreme Court doesn't get to just wake up one morning and decided hey we're going to overturn roe versus Wade the case has to come to them\nAnd they have to then you know have have briefs hear oral arguments in an issue a decision one of the president's other promises was to appoint justices who are going to be like justice\nAntonin Scalia and justice Gorsuch replaced and and I think that that has actually born out he's conservative but he's a little bit iconoclastic he shares some of the same views as\nJustice Scalia in terms of you know perhaps reading the text of the statue of the text of the constitution frequently that will veering a conservative direction but sometimes it'll veer in a a a ways that that many people might not have expected and an example\nIs a case that the Supreme Court decided at the end of this past term a justice Gorsuch actually joined the court's four more liberal justices in a ruling\nFor immigrants the question was whether or not this statute governing deportation was so vague that it was unconstitutional and justice Gorsuch said yes and that is exactly the kind of ruling that we would've expected perhaps some Justice Antonin Scalia\nUm you know I think that on the issues that a lot of conservatives are really going to care about like abortion or gun rights or affirmative action that we don't know for sure that the justice Gorsuch injustice Kavanaugh\nAre likely to to have fairly similar views but they're not identical we wouldn't expect them necessarily to march in lockstep and one thing that you can point to is that justice Kavanaugh has said that his one of his judicial heroes with chief justice William Rehnquist\nWho is more sort of a a traditional conservative perhaps more like chief justice John Roberts who clerked for justice Rehnquist\nLet's move to the lower court from it because that is one place in which I didn't hear the president talk a lot about this on the campaign trail but he certainly has had a tremendous impact\nIt's an incredible imprint I mean he's really off to such a fast start for for a variety of reasons I think on the one hand the Republican and the federalist society machine\nTo put judges to nominate judges and put them on a Supreme Court is an incredibly well oiled won this was something that really jumped out at me actually when I was reading that Brett Kavanaugh's emails was the process within the White House counsel's office to identify possible vacancies and and think about who's going to do that that I just don't think democratic administrations\nDo in the same way so it's a well oiled machine there weren't vacancies when he took office in no small part because the Republican Senate had slowed down the process of confirming President Obama's nominees and so I don't have that exact up to date statistics but as of September\nHe had already put twenty six judges on the federal courts of appeals President Obama to give you a point of comparison put fifty five on the court of appeals in his eight years\nIs going to change the makeup of the federal courts swing them significantly to the right in in a way that's going to have a lasting impact for for decades\nAmy thank you for joining us thanks for having me anyhow is the co founder of scotusblog [noise]\nSupport for the takeaway comes from

Obamacare [noise]\nSince the campaign President Trump has promised to repeal the Affordable CARE Act otherwise known as Obamacare Julie Rovner is chief Washington correspondent for Kaiser Health news and host of the what the health podcast she tells us how well he's done so far\nThe administration has done quite a bit actually so did Congress the big thing that Congress did was in the tax bill after they were unable to pass\nTheir repeal and replace legislation they eliminated the penalty for not having health insurance the individual mandate penalty the president also cut off federal funding also for a controversial or at least a contested part of the law that gave special discounts to lower income people people with incomes below two and a half\nTimes poverty although in the end the insurance industry was able to find a workaround for that ended up giving not only those people discount but some other people discounts to\nThe other big thing the administration has done is it allowed different kinds of insurance plans with basically lesser benefits than are required under Obamacare um they're called short term plant and some are called association health plans", "year":
