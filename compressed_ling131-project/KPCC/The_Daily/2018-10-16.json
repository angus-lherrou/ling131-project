Emory director of campaigns for progress now and the initiate or of the abolish slavery ballot measure in Colorado thank you so much for some time tonight welcome to America\nOn the line thank you for having me what do you mean slavery is illegal form of punishment in Colorado how is that even a thing on paper and twenty Eighteen\nWell um it's also a legal form of slavery in the nation in the United States Constitution of the thirteenth amendment reads almost exactly the same way that article to section twenty six\nOf the Colorado State constitution reads and that is there should never be in this state either slavery nor involuntary servitude except as punishment for crime wherever the party should have been duty convicted\nThere was a ballot question and of course there's there's a bit of the constitution that a lot of people don't know unless the person has been duly convicted um there was a valid question to appeal it in Colorado two years ago I see\nAnd it failed what happened\nI'm In twenty sixteen similarly to ah this year and twenty Eighteen we had the Colorado State legislature both the house\nAnd the ... and ... of voted unanimously to put this before voters um what happened is in the process the wording was\nReal confusing there's odd sort of double negative way and people who want it to actually abolished slavery um we're voting to keep it and uh and vice versa folks were freaks weren't sure they were voted for twenty sixteen\nAnd so we've made a huge effort to clear up the language of this year um to make it clear that a yes on amendment a is a yes to abolish slavery\nIs this photo about something that's purely symbolic at this point\nWhen we talk about the constitution um whether that's the national constitution or the state constitution um nothing about that it's about\nThe constitution isn't a symbolic document it loses the it's the foundation um forum for both our moral in our in our in our legal standing in this country so when you when you start changing the constitution it's\nUh you can't talk about it as being a symbolic move\nI'm Emily bass line as a scholar of the Supreme Court you're by extension a scholar of the constitution do you think most Americans would be shocked to learn that slavery is a legitimate form of punishment to this day at least on paper in the United States Constitution\nYeah I mean it's just amazing that things that I mean on the books that we kind of never got around to our racing and I think that says a I'm\nA crazy example that we obviously don't enforce the law but I understand the motivation to um to officially eliminate it because it just is not how we think about punishment today and certainly not how we should think about it\nUm are there other states a junkie in addition to Colorado where this is still on the books at the state level\nOr there are several um in fact there are it's kind of half and half cross country there are several that still have this wording in their state constitutions and there's several that do not um and yet we all find ways to incarcerate [laughter] I'm just about the same\nRight and and beyond that I gather the kind\nOf work assignments that prisoners can be given while not technically slavery and the traditional sense is an issue by implication and that's an issue in a lot of places right\nSo that's a question we've gotten a lot is that if we take the language of the constitution but we still have the ability to enforce um community service or work programs things that have proven to reduce recidivism and the answer is is if we take the same without it will have no effect on those programs\nUm in many ways was programs are voluntary or folks are compensated for those and they're also cut a five minute statue\nUm and again there are many states in this country or that did not have this language of their constitution at all and still have the ability to enforce um work programs and volunteer and volunteer community service\nSo it sounds like you want to reassure people that prison labor programs can continue\nExactly um and yet Emily there have been protests that prisons around the country over this issue I don't know if you followed this story at all but raising the question of when is prison labor a form of slavery as opposed to a legitimate form of a forest or as much as voluntary\nIn many cases contribution back to society by someone who has who has wrong ditch are you aware of that issue\nAnd and I thought it was really interesting that that contributed to the strike I think if I understand it right what's at issue here it's compensation and it's not that I'm a lot of people I'm president don't wanna work it's that they feel like they're effectively working on us for free and that they're doing it in a way that\nThey don't see the money is going back to the general public they see it as sort of going to feed the president ... complex I think that's their complaints here\nUm one clarification from the earlier issue on the Florida sounds are calling from Pennsylvania\nWho got a felony conviction and couldn't vote\n'em we think it's not a lifetime ban right in that Pennsylvania so we didn't want to leave that implication especially for listeners in Pennsylvania who may be in that\nA position of having served time for something and leaving this impression that you can't vote for the rest of your life that's not the case as we just heard Emily confirmed in the Keystone State democracy is repeal of legal slavery gonna win this time we have twenty seconds\nI absolutely I certainly hope so\nYou're supposed to take twenty seconds [laughter] thank you very much we'll be watching on election day another thing listeners for you to follow\nA
