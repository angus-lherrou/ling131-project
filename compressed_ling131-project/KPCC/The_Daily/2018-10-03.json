understand you know because we have a happy electorate the electorate has for lack of a better description the luxury\nTo be soon to be super\nUpset about the president's handling of certain situations and that's why they're running away from him in droves even I think\nThat's exactly right I got there is no question that this election in many ways is all about Trump and that's why I say\nWhen you wake up the day after the elections will tell us about where we are going to go to the next couple of years and let me is almost certainly the Democrats ago when the miracle control the house or whether or not they get ... guys to make it operational controls ... faith or lack of race operational controls where you have enough to take care of the guys are going to lose on boats right\nLet me bring you in [noise] sure I was just thinking that the way that the president has these conversations is actually just given the small sample size in this conversation the two men who called and\nI'm In the ... the president I think it's having a conversation in a far more stupid and inflammatory way than actual people who are open to a much more um intelligent a new one\nDidn't get to hear the rest from Corey Rob but he was going to a very interesting place really are both offering and in an insight into how the president had mishandled the situation while reflecting on his own experience\nAnd even Brett calling about his son's made me think about how some of the language we use targeting a could probably be replaced with things like awareness that there is the ... increased pressure in conversation certain that men are confronting white men in particular that they haven't had to confront before and that feels like targeting when in fact when it may\nActually be is a greater equalizing in the conversation that they haven't confronted which doesn't have to put someone in a defensive crouch and I didn't hear actually defensiveness from Brett which was interesting I that's right\nThat's why I was asking him to when he said that they were falsely accused of targeting what were they being falsely accused of are targeted for was it sexual assault or was\nIt something way down the list they get into what you were saying he said that his answer\nWas kind of he said kind of ... which is was interesting uh it made\nIt it made me very curious to hear more about that because he actually called in very willing to have the conversation in a way that we're not having that conversation nationally and when I referred to the fact that there needs to be sort of spaces and constructive places in which to discuss the stuff we don't have that at an adult and sent to the public discourse right now\nOn a in Beverly New Jersey has called in on a thank you for calling into America on the line kind hide so where are you in this whole conversation\n[laughter] well I'm the mother of a twenty year old son who is currently away\nAt college um and I'm so happy that America has has come around to having the conversation but I've had with him since you know he hit puberty\nAnd that is you're responsible for your actions and it's about time that young men no matter what happens with the Kavanaugh situation and everything else that young men in our society start thinking the way young women have been thinking for hundreds of years\nAnd I would I Do right now can be can affect you\nOn a thank you very much for calling into America on the line I mean that right there guy you you were reacting capsule is\nThat um that's that's exactly right you know I mean the the point is that we as a society are we've reached a place a where\nWomen and people of color in larger and larger numbers are no longer willing to accept that we're the only people who are going to carry the burden of America's problems that we're not it\nWhether they be cultural economic political that we're not going to be the only people to carry the problems and so we have called the question on a whole lot of stuff you know and prior to this\n... that dream the dream movement is calling the question on the way we do with immigration black lives matter started calling the question the way we do with black bodies and in the last years really since Donald Trump's election but certainly in the last year women of all races are calling the question on on on men and their entitlement to women's bodies\nAnd so yeah that is going to cause some conflict um but but hopefully that conflict in will get us on it than to a different place\nOnly real quickly to bill in bridge in New Jersey who's called into America on the line bill\nAre we doing good so do we go ahead\nOh no just pretty much the government does is it is kind of funny weird how we're even having this conversation from Kevin all the ... have in this or do you um\nThere was no way for which there was no wealthier which were wealthier white men getting ahead so for a wide receiver and industry\n... they didn't have the same issue with Bill Cosby there no issue was a media thing in the the whole nine yards\nThere was no political aspect when it comes to a white man for for some reason all of a sudden it's a big deal to where they just have to push through there's no evidence they don't need to worry about anything and it's just it's mind boggling that they're even allow him to stick to\nOh I Am so wait so ... so you have a problem with ... you are questioning the allegations that are within the accusations against judge Kavanaugh and their timing or and the ... over them\nAs compared to ... be because of his privilege because he is white compared to\nWhat happened with Bill Cosby and others is that what you're saying\nExactly oh I Know obviously the Supreme Court justice to mean to you and his two different levels obviously but it happens so much look at the book Turner keeps her part of this could get that much time\nAnd obviously the Republicans have bringing out stuff because how many years ago you know in the news at all just kind of places to see what's going on a ... meter down but O'Connor earlier that oh we have to prove ourselves in a sense it was all\nRight bill I ... I went to it because we only have like a Ninety seconds left in an election says is jumping at the bit to get in here I Want to thank you very much for calling in\nSure and I I just had a quick fact check you mentioned ... Turner who of course only got three months for rape so just to be clear there is a\nIf just as a fact check we need to understand that brought Turner white Stanford\nSwimmer I got the incredibly short sentence for a rape and the judge who in fact issue that sentence was recalled by California's in a historic vote for actually a what they viewed as a deep miscarriage of justice [noise]\nUm and I do think the question about whether or not\nI guess I'm a little confused um if it happened I was privileged essentially is protecting him here even now since he has the president backing him up and\nRide but I'm not the way that's not the way Bill Bill is looking at a Cairo quickly and then I go to San before we go\nI'll say one thing that has been quite a satisfying in the lab in recent days he's around Bill Cosby that there was a real conversation in the black community around you know what he needs to be held accountable to uh\nAnd so um I I Will agree with at least that much from bill that regardless of who you are you should be held accountable for this\nAnd say I'm a I'm In the thirty seconds that we have left if he would do using senators flake and Collins and Murkowski will vote in favor of Kavanaugh if the process um doesn't smell right\nNo I don't I I think this is a this is very difficult to pass it causes tests or all of a thorough investigation being does a few days even with the resources if I could throw up against that the problem\nI think it's a very I think is very much of a wide why should I say that this is like the his integrity to see through the ...\nAnd high rise Alexis Grinnell thank you very much for being here when we return we'll hear from a Pulitzer Prize winning reporter about how when and why the Russians\nBegan to interfere in the twenty sixteen elections stay to [noise]\n\nStay there I'm Joshua Johnson the news is often confusing but not always\nWomen far better leaders\nWere not afraid of nuance but we are happy to hear from gas to just tell it like it is from an economic standpoint\nIf you don't have gender balance you bar\nStupid won a always available in plain English week nights at eight one eighty nine points three have PCC [noise]\nEasy supporters include National Geographic resenting free silver a film that follows climate Alex ... as he prepares to achieve lifelong dream of climbing ... some of the national park broke free some of them now saying the arc light\nGood evening hope you're enjoying America on the line here on eighty nine point three K PCC I'm John Rey B it's part of the Cape BCC voter game plan and for much more information about the elections go to LA is dot com or website and click on the Cape PCC voter game plan page tonight at eight o'clock\nIt's one eight with Joshua Johnson the me too movement promises to bring about a level of change not seen since the fight", "show_name": "The Daily", "year": "2018", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "03"}
