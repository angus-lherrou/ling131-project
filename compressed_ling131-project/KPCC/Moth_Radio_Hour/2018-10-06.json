One\nI really did submit my sixteen millimeter black and white\nEleven minutes film that I shot in my grandmother's house in Cherry Hill New Jersey is called fugitive love and I made it as a second year graduate student at NYU film school and I submitted it and it meant so much to me that they accepted it and it was my entree into professionalism yeah anyway\nAnd then I came back the next year Sean Cooper who's the director festival said that they even created a short film award where there wasn't one because they wanted to recognize something that you had done\nYeah it was my second short it was it's called family remains it too is sixteen millimeter black and white film but\nIt's twenty seven minutes or something um which was an ethic to go from eleven to twenty three perhaps um and

taking time to read something\nAnd to see what that does to you is an act of resistance right now because the world is incredibly loud and fast pace in a way that the velocity of things is
