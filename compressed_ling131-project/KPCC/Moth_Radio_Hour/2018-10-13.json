to a lot of listeners of the pod when you're doing a live show is it even possible to have that kind of personal connection\nThe truth is you asking this question is the first time I ever thought about that distinction between the intimacy of the studio and what happens on stage in terms of connecting with people because I think\nOne of the reasons that the live shows have been successful the reason I think people come to them is because\nThey feel like listeners and they want to be part of this community of people that are all listening I mean yeah when we do it in front of a a an audience there's applause and there's laughter and you can hear that um but I think one of the goals of the live shows kind of have the same honest conversation\nIn front of people as we do when there's nobody there and in terms of what that clip was I mean one of the things about this ...\nWhether it's a live show or not as it's a chance to really talk about how you're feeling right then and

us and now we'll get back to my conversation with pod save America co host Jon Lovett and John ... say along with fellow co host Tom ... or or the founders of crooked media\nWe visited their offices in LA I asked them how they tried to get out of their white male bubble to include more diverse voices in the crooked media universe here's Jon Lovett\nWe started the pod cast as a hobby right and it's success I think um\nRaise those kinds of questions that are totally legitimate questions and I think there's a few different ways one we immediately wanted to make sure that\nThat what cricket media put out there isn't just us and now it's not it's it's ten different shows we also launch with I Dream of catching a show on right Cox uh now there's ... keep it with our Madison and Louis for talent and Karen ... brown there's been a bunch of different shows so that's also making sure that there is a\nRange of voices and perspectives that are the face of this network on top of that\nOne thing we've also I think we take a lot of pride and as we built an incredibly diverse team here\nAnd I think even though we knew it was the right thing to do and even though we knew it would lead to positive things for the company I have to say one of the most amazing things about working here is how that diversity built on itself and exposes you to different ideas and different people like I I host the show love it or leave it\nAnd I've learned so much from the panel we have every week because we have these incredible producers that are really tapped into this diverse audience ah and and\nAs diverse group of talented people and I think that's made the whole network stronger and it's made our discussions richer\nWe also try very hard to um talk to guests from all kinds of different backgrounds receive thought diversity of background\nUm and so it is something that we think about all the time look them in the pockets are parts of America started because\nThe four of us were friends who got an opportunity to do about politics on the microphone someone gave us that opportunity um and so that's how it started if we were starting from scratch [laughter] you know we've probably it probably would have been a more diverse group from the gecko but it started with the four of us and then we\nDecided to make a conscious decision that because we are for white kids doing positive America every decision we make past that passed that initial decision to have the four of us on the show um we're going to try to make sure we reach out to his many people as possible for as many backgrounds possible\nSo you're doing an HBO live show what does that mean for your listeners for your audience I Know game of Thrones is maybe going away for a little bit is this going to boost

starts with the writing and glamorous are is a show runner\nAnd together with Shonda Rhimes and maybe five or six other folks there is a a committee at the Writers Guild that is going to the studios that is talking to other show runners and saying hey when you create stories when you pop you laid your writer's room\nYou must populated you should populate\nWith people that are different than yourself not because it is the kind thing to do but is the best thing to do because\nWe bring in stories that are particular to our human experience\nWhen I see it happening in in the last few years to some of the studios are are opening their doors more and more to this conversation for example NBC Universal is\nSponsoring us uh for the ... film festival as well as CBS a diversity inclusion so this is a this is sort of a great\nTransformation that I feel what's happening right now ah and I'm excited by the idea that this continues and that that we don't just keep creating initiatives of
