prison\nOn the corner just outside the camp fence we stopped to speak to a family what are you guys doing it [noise]\nSome officials tried to stop this film buffs enough to intervene\nThem speak she says I off ... visiting\nMy dad he replies that as soon as I Do have a little while they're like oh\nThat's the BBC's John ... worth recording from ... getting China to BBC also reported discovering an enormous prison like site\nNear the city of Dublin Chang an hour from its provincial capital Ravi I Wonder if you could chime in on this particularly what we know now about how the people detained indies a voluntary re education schools are being treated\nWell I mean there's a whole bunch of reporting that is dribbling out of the last few months and I think the b._b._c. did an excellent job\nI'm In part because of the access or that they got to some of the people who that but also because they had these satellite images that that showed that for enough to pictures of how much these detention camps of actually expanded over the last few years which really shows that this is a growing project\nOr in in in a you know for the week or people and and what we now know is that uh you know former prisoners from there have\nHave been able to tell the world that they've been suffering physical and psychological torture in those camps entire families have\nHave disappeared from from that region and\nAnd a lot of this is part of the Chinese states quote re education programs as they're calling it but it turns out that it is something far more insidious far more worrying because of the conditions that they're keeping a lot of these people and I do actually wiring story that we can't get enough reporting on\nThis story out of China that caught our attention that may sound funny on first blush but it's really quite serious according to the White House there are some good reasons for America to be worried about China here as vice president Pence speaking at the Hudson Institute in Washington this month\nChina has initiated an unprecedented effort to influence American public opinion the two thousand Eighteen elections and the environment leading into the twenty twenty presidential elections to put it bluntly President Trump's leadership is working in China wants a different American president\nSo in light of that you might be interested in reports that China and Russia have been listening to President Trump's calls the once he makes on and on the secured phone that stores his contacts\nPresident Trump dismissed the report in the New York times he tweeted the story is quote show incorrect I Do not have time here to correct it I only use government phones and have only one seldom used government cell phones story is so wrong unquote\nNow the New York times also reported that security officials were only moderately concerned because according to the times\nThe president was not spilling secrets because he rarely digs into the details of intelligence that he's shown and it's not well versed on the operational specifics of covert or military activities car and this is one of those stories and I know we're we got to move on briefly but\nThis is one of those that sounds light hearted but it's really quite serious\nI Know there's just so many points that are kind of depressing you hope that the president would take more close attention to the finer points in details of the intelligence he receives because it affects the decisions that he makes affecting how the United states deals with everybody in the world\nAnd then you know they have to have the president lash out at the New York times shooting so wrong instead of maybe taking it seriously that perhaps there is a you know the threat here coming from the foreign nations that are adversaries that want to look and let me do being the primary issue not that you know you're not using telephone correctly as being the primary insult\nIs very typical of the way the president has regarded stories in the media that paint him unfavorably whether that's deservedly er and deservedly in his opinion\nAnd so this is all just kind of very familiar tropes and yet you're talking about very serious stuff if you have the two biggest adversary nations of the United states in the entire globe both listening in on what the president's privy to his privy to a lot he basically has more security clearance than anybody else that could be very dangerous thing down the line if this continues\nOne more story that caught our attention before we go the Titanic may set

Justin's Aaron surprise again to get sick cabs out UCLA dot edu\nWelcome back to the frame I'm John horn thanks for joining us let's get back to my conversation with documentary filmmaker Nathaniel Khan about his new film the price of everything among the questions the film raises are these who really owns art and why has the market for art gone through the roof\nThe answers often can be found at art auctions here's art critic Jerry ... in the film talking about them more\nHogs and make me sick [noise] only because\nWhat I'm doing and those ... rooms is saying goodbye to the rest of my life to every work of art I'm saying because all of it is now too expensive for any\nInstitution to buy some maybe the Getty and they can only buy one thing the year I kind of wish that collectors would give back but I don't know that I Would give back roads so it's going to hang some apartment\nLondon or Shanghai or [noise]\nAnd I won't see it again for my natural life\nI think the idea the idea that there are private collectors my I I Can't judge that other uh because because you know great museums ultimately most of them are filled with works that were once part of private\nCollect correct correct and that's a huge part of the equation that a Russian oligarch has probably able to pay a lot more for a painting than the LA County Museum of art well that even though the County Museum of art may at some point get a gift for high end\nYeah that's a societal problem though which is way too much money is in the hands of way too few\nAnd they are now able to manipulate art\nThe prices of art and use art as an investment instrument and that's what's happened so now that artist become an investment instruments yes they have priced museums out of the market that's a problem but that is also a problem that is you know art is now showing us a ... a an absolute runaway flaw in our\nEntire conception of the capitalist system if if it's possible to concentrate so much wealth in the hands of so few that they can actually take\nArt away from us and it completely and use it in their own realm only we're screwed\nWell as far as what's happened art becomes a commodity an intimate highest bidder it goes correct\nBut I'm OK ultimately ultimately you can't take it with you in the end we're all going to the same place and you can't take your paintings ... sorry so ultimate ultimately you know what what happens\nAnd I think this is an important threat in the film the collector stuff on it lists and Gail nice and who have an incredible collection that we see and\nAnd they give it to the art and say well they don't give it they give forty somewhat worse the art into art Institute of Chicago huge gift and they do have the right reasons\nYes they do they do want anything they want us to be seen but there's a self serving aspect of that too which is they want to be remembered absolutely so ultimately do we\nSo many victim after you and be creative supervisor and some director for the show so tell us a little\nBit about sound design and music and how that plays into the experience what are you looking for and what are your basic principles for this story\nShirt so everything in terms of stunt wiser action wise is choose through sounds a design so a lot of cues are for actors to move over to afford to play or do\nYou have to keep the blame moving as this automated by sound designed that we've picked up beforehand with John oh\nThat's how the show 'cause life it's visual rights so everything that's done brushing design team and and uh everyone else and then it's also auditory so the music and it sounds like\nWhat is the sound design equivalent of a jump scare where in films like a cat comes flying through the frame and everybody is kind of jumped up to try to do that with your son is on or do you want to be a little more subtle than that [noise]\nI think that's a lot of junk scares in life interactive shows are usually done in haunted houses\nAnd delusion tries to um stand out from haunted houses and said it's moving play right which is very different\nNow jumped scares they happened back in delusion sometimes I think but it's I don't think that week

I think it's really relevant to what we're going to be talking about today\nThey're bringing drugs [noise] they're bringing crime\nRape is can you just describe what's happening here\nSo in this ad we see a sort of just embodied hand presumably belonging to President Trump flapping their faces a several Latino voters\nWe have to do something about it and we have to start building a wall a big beautiful\nWhile for the most part they're just letting him hit them and in the closing scene of this ad you hear a woman stay in Spanish or an English depending on the version you're watching\nHow

paid for by an organization called ... they are\nA nonprofit there a national organization but they're not really in the business uh you know cutting ads\nLike that what is unique about this situation and when I talk to them to reason that they felt they needed to make this intervention is they and others truly feel like the Hispanic electorate is not being targeted by campaigns as not being you know contacted and so it's really eye grabbing ad\nThat they've put out is an attempt to mobilize Latino when nobody else has been trying to get them to turn out\nThat surprising because it seems like Latino but would be hugely important for the Democrats is that generally true\nAbsolutely I mean if you do them out today there are nearly sixty million Hispanics in the United states and twenty nine million of those are eligible to vote this year\nThey are particularly important in terms of a voting bloc for Democrats and so what is so shocking is just the statistics like from a tracking poll that Latino decisions released showing that sixty percent of Hispanics nationally have not been contacted by any campaign\n... so why then if this is such a significant voting bloc would the Democratic party itself not put out ads like this why is this outside group feeling like it has to take matters into its own hands put them in terms\nThis is a debate that has been waged within the Democratic party for years\nTo an one stage forty seven days to go you have to go back to the twenty twelve election\n[noise]\nThis was an election where President Obama was running for reelection and his opponent Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts was you know trying to figure out a way to come up against an incumbent who was hugely popular among young voters among minority voters\nYou know what we've come to think of as the Obama coalition\nYour father was born in Mexico so the question is are you Mexican American could you be the first few funding president I I Would love to be able to convince people that particularly are not going to Florida primary [laughter]\nI think that might be disingenuous on my part because\nWhat the Republican Party during twenties fall was wrestling with was how\nTo mobilize some of its messaging around social conservative issues around faith around you know small business regulations\nRomney's youngest son crack spoke to a group of Hispanic small business owner\nOn some of these topics that Hispanic voters tend to have in common with conservative voters\n... short values\nPresident Obama used his healthcare plan to declare war on religion at the same\nExact time the president has been feverishly focused on winning Latino voters in Spanish language ads about Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor the Democrats\nAnd President Obama's ... campaign and they were reaching out to Latino voters in very targeted ways\nThe stories of Latino community are stories about the Americans were young people who believe that anything is possible and parents and grandparents working hard to give their children a chance to succeed\nAnd then in August uh twenty twelve effective immediately right before the election you have the introduction of DACA\nThe department of homeland security is taking steps to lift the shadow of deportation roam these young people\nWhich really was a huge moment of elation for Hispanic voters and for which you know is broadly who cared about immigration reform\nSo how did these dueling strategies Obama's Ann Romney's work out for each of the candidates when it came to the Latino vote\nWell I think to answer that question you really just have to look at the results President Obama won the Hispanic vote by something like Seventy one percent ... and Mitt Romney took just twenty seven percent one of the all time lows in presidential election history", "show_name": "Moth Radio Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "27"}
