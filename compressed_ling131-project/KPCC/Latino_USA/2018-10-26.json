{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "I Love you to respond to some comments that came including one from Arlene who posted on our website the one who dot org Arlene writes this is so classic out of the Cold War years it was obviously a message to other Russians who might be thinking about helping the west\nAnd swimming writes it was a warning to anyone thinking of reading on ... they clearly wanted everyone to know who did it I Wonder if you can react to that I\nHave to say it's a persuasive\nArguments but then I also think about that old expression handling razor never attribute to malice that which is more adequately explained by stupidity\nMaybe they just screwed up and it gives an opportunity for them to look like yeah we we we meant to do that yeah you you better not mess with Russia I mean what do you think is this is it legitimate to say\nThis was put in sending a message or is it possible that the guys who went to kill Sergei Skripal just screwed it up\n[noise] um well\nI mean you may see they did in the sense that they didn't succeed in killing him I mean you can see it as mission failure in that sense um I I didn't you know we've had a lot of people as as details have been revealed about these two suspects say oh my lord\n... incompetence but I I didn't really hold with that so I mean I think the idea that they would be photographed coming through airports in Maine on railroad stations and things like that must've been understood before they did the mission\nThey must have understood that there was a fairly high chance that they were all parties would be photographed a would be ... and that perhaps the passports wouldn't stand up to scrutiny\nSo that then comes back to uh the choice of poison as well was this little uh to quite a Dan Hoffman who's a former CIA a mosque a station chief he's quoted in the book\nUh about leaving a trail of bread crumbs that's the phrase he uses and and I think that's clearly in sympathy with the remote from from some of the listeners you you've you've ...\nAnd I I I personally I think that is the most compelling explanation that it was intended to send a decisive signal that you may think feel safe about it and it may take us years but we will get even if you betray our country you might also argue and I've had ... a political analysts say this\nOr that in stimulating a reaction from western countries it was a kind of win win in the sense that puts in running into an election could then uh say this was another manifestation of risk phobia\nIn the u._k. in in America in other countries and these are our enemies these people who accuse us of these things\nAnd you know a there was a an exception speechwriter who gave an interview to the b._b._c. uh\nBack in the summer and he said oh you know or the whole thing paid very well for teaching in the elections he um he he managed to distract people from the domestic concerns pocketbook issues and getting them all to receive phobia and west on it and I I I don't know whether the timing was designed to to work for him and actually that's just\nOne guy's view in Moscow but it's\nIt's a guy with a fairly inside trying view of over I was going on or you might argue with some other people I did that the timing was into the operational it was about the fact that that time of year it was a time then you you do visit to tell that they knew they could learn through ... devices and communications with him where to find him and all the rest of it out of them\nBut let me ask you one more quick question I Know we've got to let you go soon but President Trump weighed in earlier this year on who he considered responsible for the poisoning here's what you said\nIt looks like it I spoke with Simon is we are just casually certainly looks like the Russians are something that you never ever happen and\nWith taking it very seriously as I think our\nPresident Trump speaking earlier this year of course referring to Britain's prime minister Theresa May now the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein named twelve Russian intelligence officers members of the G R U\nAs being responsible for cyberattacks related to the election now they've been pinned down his culprits behind the poisoning of Sergei Skripal I Wonder before we have to let you go ... what you make of the world's response to all of this and and where this might be headed before we got to go\nWell this is the problem ah we're we're now in a bind don't we uh many people I think quite understandably still want to have normal business ... cultural it'd be political relationships with Russia why not\nUh I didn't think anyone in the west is advocating that we moved to some kind of war or posture\nOr on the other hand things are going to keep coming up so more details going to be learned about the mission or in the U.S there's a whole protest that was setting train at the end of August and he's going to report back at the state department in November So next month\nShould they be additional sanctions on Russia because of what happened in schools break you know they could even stop a Russian Airlines flying to the U.S that's one of the parents they could use so when we're not going to see this go away much has as many people diplomats and others who want to smooth over the relationship would like it will flare up from time to time as an irritant\nAnd frankly that's a consequence of when you choose to use this type of weapon in circumstances where you know it's highly likely you'll be identified\nMark urban

R. B. L. A. dot com [noise]\nWalking back to the frame I'm John horn and thanks for joining us gentrification on the east side of Los Angeles has been a hot topic of conversation for local residents artists writers and activists for some time now\nEspecially in recent years with neighborhoods like Boyle Heights and highland park experiencing an influx of high end coffee shops yoga studios and price the apartment complexes\nThe conversation suddenly made it onto an unlikely platform in the form of a video game called doughnut county it was recently released by ... interactive\nDon't be fooled by it's obvious cuteness even though it's fun to play donut county offers a deeper social commentary than the visuals might lead you to believe when we spoke with a game designer Ben ... he explained how it all works\nSee play as a hole in the ground and you start small and you get\nBigger that's the basic concept of it but beyond that I was trying to ask or answer the question of like why is it a whole and so ah the story kind of shaped around this\nVersion of LA called doughnut county where you're playing as a you know new tech gender fire who moved in there a bunch of raccoons who have this app that lets them open up whole to steal people's trash\nIf you're a little bit convoluted but uh the idea is that they're kind of displacing everyone and don't accounting stealing their trash and then putting new raccoon defied a tech versions of everything down\nSo how did Los Angeles and gentrification become part of the design and the look of donor counting\nIt started with just the whole and it took a while the kind of I took a couple of iterations to land on what I really want to talk about but I think um well I Love Los Angeles and uh I moved here in like twenty eleven wherever you from New York okay ... so the big big\nChange of pace and I really really enjoyed it and I love the kind of like\nI Love the fact that I was familiar with everything in LA but only through like what felt like\nA dream like just seeing movies in the media about it and I wanted to kind of dig into what places and what seems we're kind of central to LA and so the themes of ... and the themes like renewal\nAnd um you know the kind of like portrayal of the place defining the place is something that I thought it would be really cool to uh you know next with this concept of ever growing whole than like a natural disaster and stuff like that\nI think it's interesting that you live in highland park not far from where we're sitting right now and highland park in many ways\nIs the epitome of gentrification in Los Angeles need is an old neighborhood filled with a lot of old businesses but on every fifth corner now there's a cappuccino place there is like you know high and resell\nIt is a neighborhood that in real time\nIn Nineteen forty eight the LA fellow hired Henry Louis oh it's a double bass player he's the first African American musician appointed to a major symphony at that time and he was only sixteen years old\nSince then I think we can agree that the LA fell has done a pretty good job of representing historically underrepresented voices either as composers\nSometimes it's conductors as musicians where do you see that legacy going forward under its new leader how much can the LA Phil and other officers improve and how much work has already been accomplished by the LA fill in that realm\nI mean there's still weight behind everybody is way behind\nBut I think it takes time and there's no organization anywhere now that is developing young talent elsewhere I'm with a youth orchestra programs that they do know who's created there now for and parts of Los Angeles\nWhere you're you are now building a whole new group of very talented musicians and you know within the next decade or two orchestras are going to look at least this orchestra is gonna look radically different and I think the attitude\nFrom what I can get others certainly from the new head of the workers who Simon Woods is that you can't do this fast enough\nLast question kind of a sports question but not really LeBron James is now playing with the Lakers he's a free agent how many more years
