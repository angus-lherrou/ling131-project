H\nAnymore but it still does I think it really has to do with the fact that for you know a thousand years practically the reputation was that you ate age mountain and boils vegetables vegetables boil down to you know kind of grain pulp enough that was just\nReally really revolting and um and that that reputation because I think it was so graphic really stuck desserts however we're always amazing baked goods are always amazing scones and clouded cream and steamed put in the back wall charts and\nAnd that was I think where British food for so long was at its most delicious but when you went to the city as and went to restaurants the food really was terribly blonde and very stuffy it was either on the very kind of stuff they form a level or the very\nCasual curry house I'm quick Neal level so it was either you went to this is why are you went to a curry house exactly and there was very very little in between and so when did all this begin to change\nI feel that it really began to change in the eighties with a couple of very important key player it's parents Conrad who many of us think of a much more for his work and design\nOpen Benjamin Nineteen eighty seven which is a restaurant in Chelsea but it was famously known for a beautiful stained glass window of the ... um the ... and it had been up a factory originally\nAnd he really loved the very simple food of Elizabeth David\nFrench problem solve food Italian food and he wanted to take the simplicity of that food and bring it to London and also to break down\nThe I'm the kind of heavy decorations that were so common in fancy British Restaurant so he really kind of parents things down enormously said that they were\nYou know the rooms filled with natural light and the plates where whites and food was kind of simply prepared and simply played it and it wasn't fussy and therefore people were able to have a lot of fun\nAnd Elizabeth David she was at one of the most important food writers in England right Elizabeth David was an enormously\nImportant food writer she published Mediterranean cooking in Nineteen fifty\nSo in addition to con around who are the other two big influences you mentioned there were three yes\nAbsolutely uh one of them is actually to which some resent Rogers interests gray roads ... unfortunately died a couple of years ago it um but they started also in the late eighties a restaurant called the river cafe which is still absolutely thriving and delicious and\nThe river cafe is an Italian Restaurant it is on the river and it is a quite different from other restaurants in London and was very groundbreaking then\nAnd the space itself which was designed by a Ruth Rogers husband Richard Rodgers who was the designer of the computer center in Paris and Lloyd's of London is really an architectural masterpiece [noise]\nUm the other person is a Fergus Henderson who pioneered what we call knows detailed cooking he actually started as an architect and he opened St John food and wine\nAs a chef and really believed in eating all over the animal he believed it was it was actually only polite\n[laughter] we're going to kill an animal to eat all of it and so while he does serve lots of strange ingredients [laughter] uh he actually also serves really beautiful hearty British food but prepared in a way that is um I wouldn't say monitored but it is\nSo perfectly crafted it's as though he has taken the best of a French technique and combine that with a British tradition\nNow nice three are at the roots of what you call the London culinary trees can you talk about that yes [laughter]\nWhen I started researching I quickly noticed that many of the really good young chefs had trained at either St John food in line with us understand or the river cafe with Ruth Rogers\nOr had trained with Simon Hopkins and as the ... which was turns conference restaurant and so I I was seeing these incredible links between people and I was seeing an almost a Brotherhood and sisterhood among chefs which is very rare\nI think I'm an immense solidarity and appreciation for each other as well as a shared belief and seasonal ingredients I'm sustainability a craft all of these things\nAnd what I discovered was that Fergus understanding Ruth Rogers are both not a great chef but they're also really at heart teachers and that they had\nThey had shepherd at an entire generation of really good cooks and mentor it then so many of the really good chefs cooking today in London had trained at one of those two restaurants have not both\nNow if you're going to send someone to one restaurant they just have one night in London where would you send I notice is hard\nThat is really no I mean I Would\nProbably say the river cafe is a place that everybody should go to once um but I also would say that about St John food and wine and uh oh goodness I Know the and there's a wonderful Morris restaurant owned\nBy I'm Sam and Sam's or both named Sam husband and wife Clark uh which I
