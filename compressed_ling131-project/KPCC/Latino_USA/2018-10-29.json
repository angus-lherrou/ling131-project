twenty four hour diner in the East Village and got grilled cheese sandwiches and French fries and drank bad room temperature coffee and talked for hours\nUntil a stranger came over and asked if we can to officiate our wedding right there at the sticky table by the bathroom\nBy then it was light outside I'd known to man for nine hours and I was powered by an engine of pure enthusiasm\nI said sure why not yes\nI waitress rolled her eyes but agreed to be the witness as we neared an unofficial document with catch\nNot long after I learned that the man I diner married had worked for many years opening clams and oysters in bars and it had left him with a calm clear eyed appreciation what I mean is he didn't get worked up when he talked about a wasters not like some people I knew\nHe didn't insist that I Try one particular variety grown off one remote island with nothing but a square as Lehman because anything more would be disrespectful to the oyster\nI like to history is just fine but not that much when I eat them raw by the death and they were occasionally delicious\nFat and intact and salty slipping out of pristine shelves just as often they were nothing special like mouthful of land brackish jelly or the sweat off coins from deep pockets or the fermented milk some mythical sea creature they didn't seem worth the hassle\nBut there was something about the way he liked oysters keenly and quietly without fetish or hyperbole that made me reconsider we carried a hundred along with a jar of chopped Charlotte's and vinegar to my friend's apartment\nWe ate them smoked on crackers and hot and pen rest and when we visited friends in New Orleans roasted and garlic butter Frank old with polarized anchovies and cayenne pepper then we walked down the street with grease stains on our clothes toward means\nWhen my parents came to visit the apartment we shared I blitz butter and the food processor with hot sauce lemon zest and garlic he sat at the table outside and talked and open oysters with them while I let the charcoal for my tiny travel size grill\nIt took a few minutes for the butter to start bubbling to make a tank the fatty sauce with the oyster liquor and for the meat the heat through then we ate and rounds putting a dozen or so we'll have shells on the grill every time we ran out\nWhat my mother wanted to know after we'd empty the bottle of wine was if he and I ever talked about getting married not that she reminded us living together no it wasn't that not that mattered these days not at all [noise] she wasn't old fashioned she insisted that it would be so nice to know more about my long term plan\nI told her the truth that I didn't have any long term plan but that's always turns on the grill couldn't wait\nMoisture were like that\nFood or
