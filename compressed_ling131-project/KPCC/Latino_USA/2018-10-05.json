I'm John horn uh\nYou\nThat take the train and a lot of people associated with Duke Ellington but very few people know that it was actually written by someone else Billy stray Horne was Ellington longtime collaborator writing partner and a ranger\nYet he is largely forgotten in the history of jazz stray horn who died in Nineteen sixty seven was not only are gifted musician but also a gay African American man growing up at a time in the country when being gay and being black was incredibly difficult if not and potentially deadly\nNow it's re horns live and work is being celebrated in a new dance piece called half way to dawn is premiering at the red cat theater in downtown Los Angeles\nIts creator the choreographer David ... and the dancers are from his LA company name reality\nThe companies started actually in New York when I was living in the East Village way back in Nineteen eighty eight I started the company\nIt turned into when I moved to Los Angeles in Nineteen Ninety six more of a project to project company but because of projects take five four to five years a it ended up being an ongoing collection of dancers and I really love the technical physical and\nA racial ethnic diversity of the company it's kind of all colors sizes shapes genders choices persuasion\nYou're going to run the gamut\nSo very much like Los Angeles and like the world a lot of people have heard release re horns music get I don't know that they've heard it because it has been largely attributed to Duke Ellington exactly before we talk about your show let's talk about Billy and his music and his importance\nNot only to Duke Ellington but to music of the twentieth century [noise] yeah\nThat's true of a lot of people including myself I had never heard of a ... before someone\nI was working on another project that had barely stray heart of music um and I thought who's this guy believe strain on and then I realized I Know his music my entire life from a train to lush lived or something to live for un gee uh some of the best known jazz ballads and Adams and\nHe's also as far as he is now known as being a Duke Ellington primary writing collaborator and also a range or a and kind of like today where there's a fine line between for example sampling and composing there certainly was a fine line then between arranging and composing\nSo when people walk into a performance of halfway to dawn if they don't know anything about Billy stray horn\nOne of those ... one of those is lie like that so I think that's my favorite song called records just is like one of us are trying

Kentucky they wisely drink last me\nMy ... year what was the original understanding of the FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh and its scope back when Senator Jeff flake requested it at the end of last week\nRight to essentially what Senator Flake had requested was really a re opening of the background\nCheck I can only say that I Would be your only comfortable moving on the floor and tell the FBI has done more investigation than they have already judge\nKavanaugh had been of course the subject of an original background check when he was nominated to be the next justice on the Supreme Court but Senator Flake essentially was saying to the White House in to the FBI look go back take a look at these allegations interview people that you need to interview to see if there is corroborating evidence that would suggest that in fact\nJudge capital had committed sexual misconduct\nIt will be short and limited in scope to the current allegations that have been made\nEssentially what the senators asked for was a highly focused re examination of this singular question of had the judge been engaged in actions of sexual misconduct when he was young\nAnd what did the FBI actually do at the start of this new phase reopening of the background check the best skater\nSo the FBI procedures and the FBI actual involvement is not something that normally becomes public no it's a pretty opaque crossed us what we do know is that\nRepublican senators have conversations with the White House the White House provided to the FBI foreign names of people that they said should be part of this sort of reopening the investigation\nAnd we begin with breaking news and the FBI investigation into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh authorities are now contacting possible witnesses as they prove allegations of sexual assault and misconduct against him those were ... or ... classmate who was accused Kevin ... of exposure himself at a dorm party\nWe win Kaiser one of the friends of Dr bloody Ford\nNotably miss Kaiser does not refused Dr Ford's account and she's already told the press that she believes Dr Ford's account somebody named PJ\nPatrick's at Georgetown Prep classmates as I understand that I've been identified by Dr Christine Blasey Ford as a person should remember this PGA it's supposedly was present at the party she described in our state and it's for the Washington Post I'm actually in a statement today to make it clear to all involved that I have no knowledge of the allegations of improper conduct she has leveled against Brett Kavanaugh\nAlso in the FBI list high school friend mark judge allegedly the third person in the room during the alleged assault of Dr Christine Blasey Ford is\nOne of the judge Kaplan a best friend ... time in high school\nKavanaugh's friend mark judge has confirmed he will cooperate with an FBI and\nIn ... as long as it is confidential [laughter]\nAnd what's happening with the FBI investigation as these four interviews are being conducted what happens\nIs that as the FBI is sending their agents out to talk to these poor people\nIt's listed witnesses is only the beginning\nIt's not the end of what the FBI needs to do and anything short of a full fair investigation will be a sham\nThe White House comes under intense pressure to make it clear that this isn't such a constrained investigation that it would be essentially a share\nThey cannot say oh hey only interview the people in their neighborhood on one side of the street are only interviewed people from a certain period of their life you let the men and women in the FBI the professionals do their jobs\nAnd for people to some especially Democrats is starting to feel like a shame that pressure\nGets to be enough that the White House finally says that the president himself says the FBI can investigate this however the the ferry\nThe FBI should interview anybody that they want within reason\nAnd they essentially give the green light to the FBI to go beyond just those poor people\n[noise]\nI mean like in the times since the investigation began\nThe public's focus and to some degree the Senate's focus has turned to Kavanaugh's credibility and his honesty during that hearing and the question of did he misrepresented passed in a way that shouldn't be concerning for potential Supreme Court justice\nDo we know if the FBI investigation has focused at all on investigating his truth is our colleague Kelly and Robin Pogrebin told us that a lot of Kavanaugh's classmates\nHave come forward and tried to reach the U.S [noise] to describe this behavior that they see as at odds with his who drank beer and\n\nYou know so so did I say the vast majority of of people our age at the time but in any of that one drink beer and and uh so so whatever
