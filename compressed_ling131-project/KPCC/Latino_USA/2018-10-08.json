away with a time stamp that she's up in the middle of the night and that conversation that she and I have had um is disturbing her and she had to get up\nAnd write to me and she wanted to encourage me to pursue the story of African Americans and the food world and she closed with leaving no stone unturned\nAnd she wanted me to know\nThat there was value in what I was pursuing and she gave me that validation and that encourage them to go forward and to press on no matter how difficult the task might become and um she made me feel confident in the idea\nThat yes African American cooks needed to be elevated in the American food story and so I got over feeling inadequate and insecure um\nWhich maybe she picked up on and that's why she wrote me this letter which would make sense because that's the kind of writing she did in her books as if she were standing with you side by side\nWalking us through how to make a recipe and and telling you where the pitfalls might be and and so I\nThink that I hadn't really thought about it until just now but I think that that letter to me was the kind of encouragement that she wrote 'em in her cookbooks um and it was to say you can do this\nIs the incredible it makes me a little we'd be thinking about it [noise] [noise] understand totally I can only imagine what that must be ... thank you so much to her\nWell thanks for having me and given me a chance to speak about the woman who was important to me but also important to us all [noise]\nOnly Martin is the author of driver [noise] two centuries African American [noise]\n\nYou know as a cook you're pretty much guaranteed to learn something every time you pick up a book by a team of for the pros and architect of the salaries were sat down with chest ... moon to talk about one of ... inspired by her [noise]\nOh great to have you with us thanks for having me back so we have been talking about the singular Edna Lewis all our and I'm Wondering have you eaten many of her recipes\nCertainly uh my family may lots of and the Louis recipes and certainly some in the Lewis inspired recipes and one of my favorites is chicken and pastry\nSo explain what chicken and pastry is because I hear that and I think of like a pot pie\nChicken and pastry is really a soup it's a hearty suit with a thick broth a that contains these beautiful pastry bits that almost served as like a dumpling is amazing\nOkay so tell us your process\nUm so the first part of our process is making the do for the pastry component it's a very simple recipe flower baking powder a little salt and pepper ah we combine it with milk and melted butter we roll it out and we need it to make sure there are no streaks than it\nPut it in a bowl coverage classics set it aside so baking powder not baking soda that's right the baking powder helps to keep the dumplings intact so they don't disintegrate into the bras also it gives it from being chewy ... it makes it tender okay\nAnd at that point we start to work on our bras that's just a chicken broth credits or is there any such thing as just a chicken\nBroth [laughter] well you know we\nWe start with browning other chicken when you have a super profit has minimal ingredients you have to do the very special things that really draw the flavor and so brining the chicken is the very first step and then we take it out we add some water and we at onion and celery\nAnd we just let our stock goal for about twenty five minutes and while that's happening this is a good times are working on your pastry dough\nAnd so you roll it out and the little ... pick up from the Lewis is that we are also going to cut our do into diamond\nI Love that that is again yes beautiful intentional move\nCertainly is um and that was a home cook to begin with and I think like most good home cooks she was very concerned about a static like it was important to her for that to be beautiful also when she was at cafe Nicholson in the fifties and Manhattan you know she wanted something that would make her dishes stand out amongst the rest and I think little steps like for\nNothing you know pastries by claiming diamond shapes was like a perfect way to show who she was and how she cooked exactly so at this point or brother has been going on for about twenty five minutes with the chicken and you can take\nPot off removed the chicken and let it cool and we're going to straighten it said that salary and onions out but we've already started all the flavor from it we need\n'em and then added ... to the boss and you know just let it cook until it pops up a little bit\nAnd the pastry really kind of starts to give that starchy you know gift to the Bronx yeah and it begins at a little bit and it just makes it so smooth and delicious you know what I mean that nice body that it adds to the ...\nI have never had this I'm dying to taste it it sounds like such home food to me it's just\nAs great as it doesn't make you excited about that and knowing you

half of life from here\nI'm resuming my journey across the country chairing the good stories of our fellow Americans\nThis week I was on a road trip traveling down along the northeastern Portland Maine to Long Island sound\nFall is slowly emerging but the leaves starting to turn in the last two summers warmth lingering in the air but the locals know what's coming and could be seen pulling out their snow shovels and practicing they're unhappy winter faces\nThe first person I ran into was John working at a hotel shining shoes he's eighty six years old and decided to spend his retirement by working at yet another job what else am I going to do is walk around the mall and count my steps that sounds like the way they torture you in a Turkish prison\nI had it down to the war looking for a lobster role and took a seat in an outdoor cafe overlooking the water I met a middle aged couples who are enjoying a drink in the sun from the playful way they interacted I thought they were on their first date but it turned out they'd been married for eleven years and funny enough still like each other\nCarrion Brian met in Portland while attending a mini kiss concert many kisses a kiss tribute band made up of all little people\n[noise] Kerry said I walked in and saw Brian across the room because we were taller than everyone else [noise] I figured I Am wearing\nFace make up he's wearing face makeup we should make out he squeezed your hand while she told their story we don't go out much anymore but we still love kids she showed me a picture on her phone Brian with a giant beer belly dressed up in his very own kiss costume\nKerry said I like this picture because Brian looks like gene Simmons if he ate one of the guys from many kids [noise]\n\nIt was time for me to take it over to get my rental car for the journey down the coast I was picked up by Sean he's twenty five and it's been driving for the past three years ever since he lost his\nJob at the moving company he loves Maine but he's not looking forward to the cold he says it's winter was so bad last year when spring finally came he throughout all his long pants and protest now he's in trouble\nHe said I saw the survivor show and discovery where a guy never wore shoes are pans he trained as mitochondria with his mind to not feel the coal showing figures he's watched enough of the show to give it a shot even though he's not sure how to do it or what might it might have a country it is\nI picked up my midsize rental and headed down the coast along route Ninety five it was a beautiful ride that ended up the orient points ferry across the Long Island sound to the far eastern points of Long Island\nAs we pulled out into the sea I was reminded of how beautiful the east coast truly is and the boats make me sea sick\nI hate books I get claustrophobic I don't like being trapped we're nowhere to go\nThat's why I don't go on cruises it's like paying someone to put me in a hostage situation [noise] have you ever close your eyes and held onto a railing for dear life and when you came to realize you were hugging a man from Bridgeport, Connecticut I\nWhen we finally got to land I found a hotel in Riverhead New York and slept off the nausea later that night I went to a seafood restaurant and sat next to three white guys in their seventies who looked like retired fishermen they wore faded jeans and washed out T shirts two of them at messy gray hair under tattered baseball caps and\nThe other was his bald as a clam suddenly in the corner of the bar a woman started singing karaoke it seemed weird in a place like this but a crowd quickly gathered around as she belted out me and Bobby McGee\nThe fisherman just scale as she ended the strong applause one of the crusty old fisherman marched up to the microphone as if he was going to\nPull the plug on the whole affair but then he grabbed him I closed his eyes pointed at the D. J. and David Bowie is China Girl kicked in\nI was in shock without even looking at the monitor this Ganguly old guy was killing it he had a bar filled with people half his age holding up their cell phones and dancing along I looked over to his friends but they kept right on eating buffalo wings as if he does this all the time\nHe handed you a standing ovation and shuffled off and before I knew what his bald friend was up there without taking his hands out of his\nSweat shirt pockets he bounces around head from side to side stopped\nAnd Bon Jovi living on a prayer began the entire bar lost their minds [noise] everyone was screaming the lyrics with beers held high as this old dude rocked out with less emotion than a plate of oysters\nI never saw anything like it a very attractive waitress was hugging the tall fisherman and showing her phone case with a picture of David Bowie on and the bald guy was shaking hands with strangers as women squeezed them and kisses had\nHave you ever thought that you're eating in a seafood restaurant in Long Island but it actually discovered the fountain of youth and ended up singing I've got you babe in the eyes of a salty old fisherman [noise]\nI have\nAnd I'll definitely be back until next time this has been Tom Papa out in America [noise]\nSome [noise] for John Will\nBe performing here here from Livermore\nArts Center October twenty fifth ladies and gentlemen\nTo join me in a welcoming for the first time as musical director the secret to wizard himself Mr Mike that was\nSome to my for his contribution already and we're really lucky to have him with us\nAll season long and hey we're excited to announce a brand\nSegment this season one that runs contrary to my nature is a control freak we're calling it three minutes of improv three minutes of improv [noise] we have no idea what's going to happen\nBut I Know that it's one of the great pleasures of my life to play music with Mike Elizondo surfer this first installation of three minutes of improv we're going to say a timer for three minutes start playing and see what happens wish us luck this is a beautiful place right\nLike how does it sounds in your heart and had a bigger right now being in this but\nThis is this your first showed music director alright move your your\nI think you got to take this from Chris or do you think you got to take this one that was it was all you\nAlright alright tough tough but fair\nI'm okay\n\n[laughter]\n\n\n", "show_name": "Latino USA", "year": "2018", "city": "Pasadena", "day": "08"}
