{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KPCC", "content": "I can at this point look at photos of her\nFrom way back in you know when she was in Paris or looking that kitchen and I at this point no the brand of each product and I just keep gathering so much information about what she chose to have around her what she bought over the years which you really used and to me that's just I just ...\nThe idea of you being able to look at this old photograph and going to\nBuy the knife I'm seen hanging there right so let me give me some specifics\nAbout her relationship to equipment and what you think was so brilliant\nWell you know Julie really\nWas as I call her Julia like she was my friend I'd never met her [laughter]\nBut everyone feels they know her I'm sure the edge of personality but she came to cooking late as everybody knows the story I mean she discovered food pretty late in life and\nYou know fell in love with cuisine and and really the tradition in France and learn from the cold on blue and everything but then her impulse was to teach other people you know to bring them up to this level where they can see what she saw and to bring it down to a point not dumbing it down but making it familiar making it comfortable to cook\nBeautiful delicious food at home ... I mean she took professional equipment that she saw French chefs using\nAnd she went to a restaurant supply stores way back when way before that was cool right and she translated that for home cooks and she would really try to show people you can do this too and I'm just so inspired by that\nBut I also you know I look around and I'll start researching a story on like you know carbon steel pans chefs use them people really weren't using them at home\nI'm and I'm looking at pictures of her kitchen and look there's a bunch of them I can recognize them she had them\nAnd even though she leader embraced non stick pans she never gave up on those carbon steel pans she kept them and all that copper that she offer a beautiful a copper pans in every size what wouldn't I give to have her kitchen and all that stuff to play with\nAnd I think everybody feels that way when they see that it that kitchen if you ever see it totally packed wall to wall every inch is full everything's at hand I mean she had that pay board on the wall that Paul child her husband always designed for her from the earliest kitchen in Paris I'm that peg board that he'd put up on the walls painted\nSticker pans draw big black outlandish champion and each thing you know fish molds and things and put the put a hookup and hanged those pan so that you could grab 'em and use it wasn't about displaying them it was about being able to grab 'em use them put them back and I just love that [laughter]\nIt was a workshop and I often think of kitchen tools\nThat way you know yes and I'm speaking of tools I Want to get to her and knives because she was a massive nice lover and she has introduced us all to those magnetic strips\nYes yes if you go to see her kitchen um there there's between the windows in the kitchen of over the sinker countertop\nThere's a magnetic nice strip a couple of them and she knows an unusual thing that I've never really seen anyone else too which is that she put them vertically up and down between the windows and spent sticks knives across ours honestly you know and she hasn't kind of range from big just small and\nUm you know that's kind of brilliant it uses them dead space that no one ever really uses people always think that you're supposed to hang those things horizontally and put the knives up rights you know why not do this kind of quirky that was really all the way you know something\nThat's a classical but use it in her own twist to you know like she'll find it makes them more functional\nShe would have loved you sing in her own twisted way\nI'm quite guys that are they say that\nI didn't really mean it\nThat way so and what about the Cuisinart what do you know about Julian quiz not because for me it seems like she was the original poster child right\nShe really was she got her hands on a robot coup which is the French company whose design was brought to America by Cuisinart and sold as you know the first food processors in the early Nineteen seventies she got her hands on one\nAnd really said this is it this is the greatest thing I mean she was into tradition but also into you know making it modern making it more doable for um cooks and you know one of the things she kept talking about was\nFisher lose that you take fish and you pounded the mortar and Passover hours and you put it through the ... and you know to get the silky texture consistency and she said you can do it in a few seconds and the food processors\nAnd now everyone remaking fish moose suddenly Mm she's never run out of everything [laughter] no but you know the rest\nOf it was true it certainly sped up a lot of cooking for people people fell in love with it because she talked about it all the time and she used it\nAnd she had issues with the Cuisinart\n[laughter] I tested food processors um one of the things that always annoyed me about the Cuisinart is it has this\nLittle safety feature on the food pusher the thing that pushes up and down the shoot\nSo they're angered don't go down the shoot I just went right out of metal bar that goes from this pushing a device and has to engage with the base in order for the machine to go and that's of course smart but it means you have to cut food down to sit in the shoot she famously whatever\nProducers Jeff Drummond who also used to produce our show way back in the day told me the story about her and he said in front of Cuisinart executives who are watching a demonstration she was using a Cuisinart and she said oh this silly thing I just stick a knife in how to make it go so I can leave it open\nAnd not care that they are standing there\nFive safety concerns that brave but boy I sure they'll do it I was like wow that thing is annoying but you know the safety I guess I get it\n[laughter] I Love it she wouldn't her own way she did go her own way and do you keep up with the equipment testing\nI think you'd be wasting the man is is America's Test kitchen gadgets expert end and Julie is on her check out the
