care about the country that they'll vote is also the bad message at like there's a\nGeneration of young people who like won't be shamed interpreters debating I bought in my entire life I got arrested tier grass tear gas dragged on our police department by my ankles like boating wasn't the ... it wasn't the end all be all that changed everything\nWe think about voting is one of the important tools and the tool kit and it's one of the tools and I think that that's how we started talking about it the second is that we could get people to vote for if you're in Florida you should vote for ah getting\nTheir voting rights back for ex felons if you're in Louisiana use your vote for changing the jury loss of the all twelve jurors have to vote to convict somebody\nOf a felony right like that should be our language like you are voting for in America we think about who's going to be trumping twenty twenty it won't be somebody who's running against Trump it'll be somebody who's running for vision of American it's bigger than him that if you just run against him you're only as big as he is and we we need somebody bigger than that\n[noise] speaking of tactics for the future maybe we should talk about that as we wrap up our conversation the next to last chapter in the book the penultimate chapter is called on organizing\nIn it you argue that the tactics and strategy used that serve activists in the past don't necessarily help now quote the tactics that were effective in bringing about change in the sixties seventies and eighties are well known to all especially those who oppose them unquote\nGive me an example of one of the newer tactics that serve activists today that you think has some real viability that people should be paying attention to\nIs I think that like this is a macro comment one is that like we just have access to the Internet and uh until she meet in a way that we didn't before so they are the style of activism that says that the only way to be a part of a\nOf any being Rio I'd like to be a member to join a collective today that Michael was so beautiful about the protests about the movement certainly about St Louis that you didn't need any of that ad like\nYou just needed to come into work and that there's like a whole organizing tradition that just invalidate that that like says that if you don't participate in like an established group and honored member like\nThat that's the only way collective action can happen and like that I think that's actually just a really dangerous way to think about organizing the second is that not that the tactics that failed but that like the other side actually just like understand them better\nSo there was a there was a time or like being in a union union organizing was like the best possible organizing was the most organized you can go get singing\nOr unions are still remain really important their political salient is just different now not because they are weaker but because people are found other ways to organize\nSo we should like support unions and you're in organizing we should also validate those moms would just like set up a organizing banging their their community like all of these are real and like they're still people who say like if you don't do it if you're not trained in this tradition like you're not a real him like that sort of weird I remember being in the street in St Louis I'm like\nThere was a narrative literally that like people came down and I'm like started a movement and founded things and like\nOrganize all that sort of Savage protests and that was that's still the narrative is and like what actually happened it was like you were just like we don't know we're doing we know we're right though and we'll figure it out and a lot of people like just had to do a lot to figure it out even I read it in the book about the guy who um\n[noise] the first person ever use the hash tag black lives matter like he's been just erased from the narrative and he did it you know a year before other people even say they started saying and race or like\nHow do we just talk about the whole space uh and like let it grow like let other people that come in and say what's going on the last thing I think very quickly that there are a lot of organizers\nWho sort of do that if you don't do it with me are like me you're not a real organizer and that's also really dangerous and we have to like ... and I said this is somebody who's been a lot of places I think I've done go work I also know that like I've gotten messages from like sixteen year olds\nWho have had no political training who've had incredible ideas and I'm not arrogant enough to believe that the way I Do it is the only way to do it or like if people didn't do it with me then like it is invalid and that actually if you think about a lot of big organizations really are just asking for your money in your email address that building your capacity they're like not asking you to do anything that's not with them\nYeah and the first person to use the hash tag was a UCLA professor named mark is Anthony how do I think that's where you refer to a newer super short on time all want to get to one more quick question from a listener in the west to lift us in our inbox\nHi my name is Molly in Boulder, Colorado which is an extremely white town and I had a white male say to me the other day that black people should get over slavery\nI was dumbfounded and shocked by this comment and honestly didn't know how to respond effectively I told him that it wasn't his place as a privileged white male to say if black people should or should not get over slavery\nUh but I Would be curious what Mr ... recommend as a more thoughtful effective response to a comment such as this thank you\nThank you Molly for asking the question dre were super long time but I Wonder what you would say to Mali\nGive two things one is that we talk about truth and reconciliation and a lot of people who want to do the reconciliation without the truth right but the truth has to come before the reconciliation so but I may instances like again how do we put the work back on him is that like\nYou know like how do you get over not being paid for centuries of labor like what's what's the get over part like hide out well how do you reconcile like not being taught to read and write for generations like what do
