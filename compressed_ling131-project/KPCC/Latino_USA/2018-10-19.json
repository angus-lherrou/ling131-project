Elizabeth who lives in East Lansing Michigan Elizabeth emailed most of my family lives in St Clair and marine city and watching the county and small cities rebound gives me so much hope for the area and makes me so happy to see I Love this come home initiative\nRandy what's the long term goal for the award is there a specific number of people you want to attract or a certain amount of debt that you want to cancel what are your big metric for success\nYeah that's an interesting a long discussion Joshua because truly what we tell people although the come home program has received national attention we're very proud of it that's really just phase one of a rethinking talent and something that I have to do because that's what's driving us economic development is not attracting plant\nEconomic development is every voice in your region contributing to making a place where people want to live for rushed Josh the long term goal is for foundations across America to realize we have assets and resources to bring to bear on economic growth\nWe can develop tell 'em to come up for me was a talent attraction program we're pretty far more money and time into growing the local talent that's already here\nUm they'll provide a much greater benefits for our region so for us to come home to stage one I think if we can do about a hundred thousand a year Joshua in that program I think we're good our other program that is going to a local town is about three hundred five hundred thousand a year to give you an idea of scale\n[noise] let me get to a few more of your comments in our remaining minutes together with regards to hiring older workers Scott emailed I work for a large telecommunications company that experienced explosive growth I took a chance on an older gentleman that was in his seventies because he at least had a lot of experience\nNot only was he able to immediately contribute but two years later he is a machine that works circles around everyone in the group I strongly encourage hiring managers to consider hiring older workers\nSteve emailed I have a dental lab in Indiana we've always had trouble finding qualified workers we invested in a training program when we opened our lab Eighteen years ago it was a big investment but it has paid off\nAnd leave emailed this is a multifaceted problem with many causes I see one remedy pay us more\nThen we could afford our student loans care for our children or elders or being willing to move to where the job is Ryan what about leaves comment is that is that really where the rubber hits the road is just not being paid enough\nI I think there's a lot of truth to that I think that we would expect\nThese tight labor markets are to result in some combination of higher wages uh of firms looking at a larger pool of job applicants and more employer investments in training as has been discussed and we're just not we're not seeing that to the extent that we expected\nYou know David tweeted I'm a blue collar worker and it's tough the cost of living is outrageous for example my rent increased forty dollars just this year I still make Fifteen fifty an hour and I've been at my current employer for five years if you want a strong nation you must pay a strong wage period\nRoss I'd love you to respond to this voice mail from one of the listeners Kate from New Hampshire left this note in our inbox\nI Am one of those young people that is debating leaving New Hampshire\nFor another job and I actually feel really great about the labor market on and really great about the labor market in cities that might have a lot more art and culture and entertainment and things that people do and uh generally younger crowd so\nA New Hampshire as an older state and since I'm not from the state of New Hampshire\nAnd it's harder to to keep someone like ... year whenever they don't have the\nActivities for people that are younger that might have moved to the state for a job has now I tend to keep you there once you've really mastered that job and they're looking for the next step in your professional development\nKate thanks very much for sharing your thoughts with us before we go rush what would you say to take I Would say Kate take a closer look uh I I mean the state does have a lot to offer we do have sort of the urban cultural things were close to Boston you get into Boston from here in Concord this commuter buses into Boston every day so I think that\nUh there there's an element of truth particularly in the rural parts of the state but if you look to the more urban parts of the state that are closer to Massachusetts there are there is a wealth of of a cultural activities maybe not on the scale of Boston but you're also not paying for a thousand dollars a month in rent very ... very very true every bit of a trade off their Kate very true\n... the president of applied economic research here in New Hampshire Russ thanks very much for talking to us thank you for having me

that this whole operas just musically very tricky to think you know with the orchestra and it's challenging you have to listen\nVery intently but at the same time kind of\nTo it so it's kind of a

agree with at all actually me neither um\nAnd it yes with but within that repetition there's constant change\nYeah I mean and that's the brilliance of it in my opinion it sounds so simplistic but it's actually quite difficult the repetition you have to be so\nAware of where you are at all times otherwise you really\nCan get lost and so you know it might not seem difficult to the listeners is
