on and and even just looking at him there\nA sign such as rose Aisha or reading of the central areas of his face um this does not mean that we can diagnose alcohol use disorder but\nAh but they certainly point to the possibility also drinking that\nTo be done at an early age and heavy drinking in one's youth makes one a vulnerable to alcoholism later\nA later in life so it would be important to assess uh whether he suffers from it and whether it's it would affect his functioning\nA doctor ...

country\nAnd why don't you go now to cast Shankar at Jabbar hilly now in Washington DC that I'm Talking about what happened cheer child on when he was four years old in Dayton, Ohio ...\nAmy thank you for having me on a yes I began organizing organically a as a parent pushing back ah when my son was actually three\nUm ah what is now known as a pre school to prison pipeline or as you mentioned and one of the things that I I did as a parent I'm you know not thinking initially that it was a ... a race issue or a class issue that I had this question\nUm their their policies and practices or question what was the actual normal behavior or for three year old or to be exhibiting in a classroom or some of the things that they you know would complain about was you know oh he has problems you know transitioning or you know he's having temper tantrums and so what I what I saw was happening\nAnd began to realize that there was a a pathology sizing up normal childhood behavior of my son\nI then began to take a deeper look and I'm not noticed that he was the only black boy a out of only two black students in a class I'm Nineteen [noise]\nUm and then just the overall a teacher representation or as well at the school was overwhelmingly white the administration was ...\nI I'm beginning to put those factors together or as I began to ask other black women or black parents asked the at the school if they were having similar experiences\nUm and so once I did that I you know went to my co founder of racial justice now professor for nearly a Randall 'em and talk to her about what I was experiencing and that was basically\nHow race will just as now was founded in her living room a saying that we needed to really have a response to this to organize and began to shift and change policies and practices\nOf how I'm young people particularly black students and our families um were being treated or in the school at that time and so that has led to a deeper analysis and until just recently because of the work of working class a poor and working class black parents in the city of Dayton\nOhio just recently passed the law House bill three Eighteen\nOr to ban um most of out of school pre K through third grade suspicions across the entire state and so that's a huge victory\nFor a small organization or community based organization like racial justice now or in a very conservative state like Ohio but it took years of organizing um and being supported by national organizations like dignity and schools campaign\nAnd even or any for justice allies being supported\nA on the ground to be able to give that gets at work done and be able to get something so big accomplish in a very conservative state\nI Want to go to our ... going to do that after break to talk about
