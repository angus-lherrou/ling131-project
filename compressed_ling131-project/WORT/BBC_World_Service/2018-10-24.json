American woman governor in the country in the recording taken at a campaign event last week and published by Rolling Stone camp expressed concern over Georgians exercising their right to vote particularly in early and absentee voting\nWorry we were going to vote was\nLiterally millions and millions of dollars they voted ever by law though that was\nAnd the state of Georgia they've been purged they've been suppressed and they've been scared\nThis is a man who had someone arrested for helping her blind father cast a ballot she raided the offices of organizations to stop them from registering voters that type of voter suppression feeds the narrative because voter suppression isn't only about blocking the vote is also about creating an atmosphere of fear making people worry that their votes won't count\nAs the next governor of Georgia I Will work with the secretary of state to ensure that there is no question that the right to vote in Georgia is not a privilege it is indeed a right to belongs to those who are Georgia citizens and I will work hard to make it so\nThat's George in a democratic governor candidate Stacey Abrams debating the Republican secretary of state I Believe in a trial candidate Brian Kemp to talk more about what's at stake in the race we're joined by Leah Wright rigor\nProfessor at the Harvard Kennedy School of government author of the loneliness

suppression the accusation that Brian Kemp is holding on to fifty three thousand voter registration forms and also that leaked audio recording questioning Georgians right to vote\n\nUh Stacey Abrams versus Brian camp\nHas become a touchdown for the entire country and for for issues of voter rights\nAnd thinking about what the voting mean who has the right to vote\nA voter suppression a questions of you know alleged questions of voter\nFraud and we saw that play out on the debate on the debate stage last night where you know you had Brian Kemp saying voters the idea of voters depression is a farce versus they stay the rooms where clearly and explicitly said no actually voting is a voting as a right into the constitutional right is a protected right\nAnd this election is all about ensuring the rights of people to ensure a that democracy is actually a a a exists as opposed to just imagine so really that's what you know ... that was at the heart of the debate last night um and really\nPlayed out I'm as these as these two contenders to very polarizing and very opposite opinions on a very contentious issue\nOh professor earlier right route regard like trash you about the the Rolling Stone release all would be all you'll all book Kemp talking to some donors about who's concerned about too many people voting\n[noise] absolutely I mean this is not actually a new concern or the Republicans for a very long time um have had very open conversations and other cases a very private conversations about they're concerned about turnout\nAnd why is that because the higher the turnout particularly amongst groups of color a particularly amongst young people tends to favor democratic candidates\nIn this case Stacey Abrams has really taken you know what what should be a novel ...\nIs a novel approach by going out and pounding the pavement and going after a non likely unlikely voters voters who haven't voted before young people people of color getting them to try and turn out I'm at high numbers and so if you're Brian Kemp that is something that you absolutely don't want\nAnd so in his you know in his private remarks or this is essentially what he said which is we don't want these people coming out and voting we we you know we have to think about what are the alternatives are and how can we not get them to come out even though that's their legal and constitutional rights\nWearing it we're going to go to a break and then come back this discussion will also bring in Greg palace Jewish suing the secretary of state camp\nI'm Leah Wright rigor is

suppression in Georgia a new investigation has found that Georgia secretary of state and Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp\nAs overseeing the removal of more than three hundred and forty thousand current Georgia residents from voting rolls in a moment we will be joined by a journalist Greg palace but first I Want to turn to part of a new video he produced about them all the Persian Georgia\nHow did chemical wipe out the registrations of five hundred and fifty thousand voters he used the postcard drink Kemp sent out millions of these cards requiring voters to confirm\nTheir addresses problem they look like junk mail eight out of ten voters and get them throw them away [noise] throw away the card and cabinet can throw you off the rolls the trick not everyone gets a postcard mostly they go to neighborhoods like this\nThis is my neighborhood and this is where I almost got birds\nStacey Hopkins is a community organizer and\nTo give me her that this has also\nIn this rapidly changing impacts us as a voting community with all these empty houses are voters being lost our political\nPower is being lost when camp sent her a postcard she picked the wrong targets\nI look at these malice other telling me and two of my children that if we did not fill out the forms and returned them we were going to be moved to the inactive list but we're just voted\nBy decided to try and hold a list of camp accountable for that because I wanted to know why and and what made a low we filed suit against secretary of state county\nAnd she won big time\nA hundred and fifty nine thousand or restore to the voting rolls and that was that was a good feeling\nBut what feels bad is that more than half a million voters remain on the purge list we as a threatened camp with a federal lawsuit but he finally gave up the names of every voter he perched then we need all the names public I was flooded with Nineteen hundred emails from George and stunned they lost their right to vote\nInvestigative journalist Greg palace attempted to question Georgia secretary of state the Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp about the purge\nRemoving from the voter rolls electric wires you like one year to get them to different really moved\nMe right now is there any other reporter being thrown out is or the Pacific\nSo That's Greg palace questioning the Republican candidate for governor Brian can push the secretary of state grant Palestine journalist has been investigating camp and voter suppression in Georgia and director of the ... sixteen documentary titled the best democracy money can buy a\nYou are suing Brian Kemp as well Greg palace to explain what you found and why are showing him\nWell you're the one answer my question so he's going to have to answer them in a federal court there's a follow up to my Rolling Stone to thousands sixteen investigation uh we're suing him and I say we including a civil rights organization to find\nAnd out why he is removed three hundred and forty thousand one hundred and thirty four and Georgians on suppose it evidence that they've left the state or left their county and they are in there are still in their home registration address is they haven't left she talked to a third of a million people\nIf these people show up to vote a on a November six they're going to find that they cancel there'll be ended a provisional ballot but it won't be counted this is huge and the these lists are violently\nRacially prejudiced so we're going into court to get all the answers why you did this we know what's wrong\nAnd for my other investigations I was able to get inside his uh his operation and get the some of the purge list before\nIt's quite an ugly operation I've never seen a purge operation this why this big and this one thing that Stacey Abrams is mentioned during the debate it's not just the fifty three thousand names pending it's the three hundred and forty thousand people\nHeard that is their registration have been canceled that's why we're in court with the voting rights groups and to get the information on exactly why these people were wrong me removed\nCan measure the division was never heard of the theories about several but I'm somebody to absorb energy\nI'm somebody that loves our country professor layer rite rug or can you respond to what President Trump has said this week NATO labeling himself a proud nationalist\nIt's an interesting choice awards given that he could've used patriot ah\nAs for somebody who\nLoves their country but instead doubled down on this idea of nationalism um it's not the first time that he's done it during the twenty sixteen campaign he labeled himself a national uh theme banning uh was behind this\nUh but also was very much an embrace of Steve Bannon's idea of nationalism regardless of you know he may say if this is not ethnic nationalism this is not white nationalism\nIs sending a very distinct\nMessage in drawing on a very distinct message at a point in time where nationalism is on the ride is in the country but\nSo is you know violence around nationalism ethnic nationalism white nationalism so in a way this is drawing back on that twenty sixteen uh twenty sixteen strategy which was quite effective for him which is a rallying cry to all of these people around the country this base that put him in office\nThat elected him at a time when in the midterms are in the midterms where he is really pushing a a culture war strategy in reviving a culture war strategy because there's not much else to go on so it's worked for him in the past\nHe is a it's a calling card and curious reviving it or the other interesting point is that he's reviving it at a moment where Steve Bannon is no longer officially a associated with his uh with the White House with the Trump Administration\nSo it does tell you that that you know those ties are still there but so is that idea\nWell gee that's pulling through um it's a message again to the base that I'm here for you I stand for you I support your agenda it's also a warning for those outside in a way of alienating other people as outsiders and uh it's Donald Trump's way of saying I'm president of these people but not those people\nAnd it's all kinds of says said the Florida gubernatorial candidate the Democrat Andrew Gillum was targeted by a racist robocall paid for by a white supremacist group Galen aiming to beat Florida is first black governor this is a clip of the ... a real warning it it's extremely racist\nTraining them [noise]\nAnd this is the gubernatorial candidate Tallahassee\nMayor Andrew Gillum responding to these racist robocalls on CNN\nI Want to make sure that we don't racialized\nAnd frankly weaponize race as a part of this process which is why I called my opponents to really work to rise above some of these things I'm a people are taking their cues from him from his campaign in from Donald Trump and we and we saw in Charlottesville did that could lead to real frankly dangerous outcome\nLayer right regarding your final comments on the climate right now\nWell these are races that are indicative of a much broader and uh I Am in some\nWays much more dangerous climate um that really ties back to a\nReally ties back to the Trump Administration and the emergence of you know a really the emergence of a much broader identity that is tied to nationalism racialized nationalism but the other thing that's going on here is that we have a set of candidates\nThat um are running against people that have wholly tied themselves to Donald Trump probably tied themselves to Donald Trump and Donald Trump's agenda\nSo really what we're gearing up for it is a showdown\nBetween you know does the Trump effect still stand this one way of approaching politics uh this exclusionary way of ... a ex approaching a national politics and local and state politics or is there another\nIs there is there a way that is built on alliances and coalitions that is inclusive and is about expanding the boundaries of democracy so that all American citizens count\nWe want to thank you for being with us a layer right we're gr professor at the Kennedy School of
