we've held ... to to ah to this day the deem was reminding me before before the talk which is what happens at Georgetown Prep stays indoors I spend a good thing for all of us are\nWell for more we're joined by bill ... he was a freshman at the all male Georgetown Prep high school when Brett Kavanaugh was a senior\nAfter Kavanaugh's testimony Thursday bar bow coauthored the petition calling on fellow graduates to come forward if they had any information about any sexual assaults possibly committed by the Supreme Court nominee ... joining us by phone from the Washington DC area\nBill welcome to democracy now can you talk about why you started this petition and how many people have signed on so far\nUh yeah I was um we were first moved to to do this um because we felt that it was stunning to me that we as a community I Believe no so much about what was going on during the eighties and the ... party culture\nUm and that there are many graduates of the class of eighty three who were close to Brett\nBut who have not shown their faces they've not they've not spoken out about what was going on either in his defense or and Dr forest defense um and so I I I was stunned by that silence and felt we have to try to do something to to shake my classmates in my school mates up\nAnd get them to think this is an opportunity for you to do the right thing and if it if if our little position and our drive to get them to speak um gets even one of them to say something then I I feel it's been a success\nAnd Bill Maher bowl or you were a freshman all when Brett Kavanaugh was a senior at their school or did you uh how well did you know him and when you were to solve the testimony how does that jibe with your recollections of what he was like\nWell I didn't know Brett personally and I think it's important to note that I I don't consider myself a witness in this case in any way shape or form again I was a freshman and he was a senior he was a very big personality on campus he was a I'm a\nFootball player and he was kept on the basketball team it was hard in a roughly four hundred person school not to know who the real social leaders were um even as a freshman um so I knew him and his crew more by reputation than personal observation um\nHowever it just struck me during his testimony that\nGiven what I Know about perhaps party culture in the eighties um\nAnd knowing that he\nBragged openly on his ... page about his participation in that party culture\nThat he would rule out categorically the possibility that something untoward or downright illegal could have happened when he was under the influence of alcohol and that just felt wrong to me\nAnd um I I Know that there are there must be people who are closer to him closer in age enclosure and in social commitment ... that have to know more about what was going on and I think we've been seeing now from his Gail classmates and I would like to see that from his prep class is\nYou have a close to Seventy named on this list\nThere was a new new issue what do you hope to do with with it and what are you a hope they are all the people who signed a petition are willing to go public with their names are\nWell it's it's closer to a hundred now actually didn't look at the number this morning I should have it's it's been growing since I'm we release it on Saturday which um is probably a tricky day to try to get people to pay attention to it but since we started to get some news coverage on it I'm a we've been getting more and more signatories\nUm and we've been very judicious with uh how we're going to proceed because\nThere are a number of folks who signed who for various reasons such as they are employed by the federal government\nCan't have their names released publicly um but did they did find it in that they wanted to indicates support so we're having to be very thoughtful and we're contacting everyone individually to make sure that they are aware that we intend to go public with their name make sure that they are who they say they are and that we didn't end up with some fall centuries [noise]\n[noise] um but the concern that I have right now is that I'm not all that sure how interested the FBI is in our list um they have their hands full and that's what is so urgent about the situation to me is a week is not very much time\nFor the FBI to conduct a very thorough investigation um they have to identify locate an interview a lot of people if they really want to get to the bottom of this um so they may have their hands full which leads me to believe that the press um maybe a more\nA effective way to get the word out and to get our letter to see the light of day and for then\nFellow prop alumni to take the action of saying you know what I Do have a story and I do think it's important to be heard\n[noise] well I Want to thank you for being with ... freshmen if they all now Georgetown Prep high school when Brett Kavanaugh is a senior\nAfter having not testify Thursday Abdel ... coauthored a petition now of over a hundred names calling I fellow graduates to come forward if they ... that any sexual assaults possibly committed by the Supreme Court nominee Mrs democracy now when we come back\nThe ACLU rarely takes a position on a Supreme Court nominee when Brett Kavanaugh was first nominated they wouldn't take a position we had them on and they
