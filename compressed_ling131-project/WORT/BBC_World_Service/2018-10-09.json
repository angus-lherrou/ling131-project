indeed the far right in Brazil like the fluoride everywhere it's anti ... anti black anti indigenous person and it is in favor of ending all over the sides and they struggle with is the ones who end any oversight of labor work situations\nAnd not allowing us to slavery\nThat continue to exist in Brazil's not so they're full of prejudice and intolerance use and they believe that they can resolve

ready for all of this Brazil you know father would ever take pride in your case on pride happiness celebrated his son turns okay\nNo way\nThat they are both in the front runner in Brazil also as you said set I'm told a congresswoman Chu was too ugly to rate\nThe exact and yeah so yeah we're what happens now is that is a lot of media manipulation accents thing pitchmen as president do my two years ago that is constant attacks song that the tea owned a worker spotty a\nIt was almost like all mainstream meeting for his he was like Fox News that is no alternative and that also now during the campaign I'm both an avid starts at ... or something of fake news special on what's sad that it's not controlled\nFor example Facebook has a closed several accounts that were spreading fake news and dance and on that died in against a candidate for vice president ... uh\nSo you know also Stephen Bannon is one of the advisors for both on that are so that is a lot of misinformation and manipulation\nAugust ... posted a photo on Twitter of him with former Trump strategist Steve\nAnd in and ... votes for NATO wrote quote it was a pleasure to meet Steve Bannon strategist in Donald Trump's presidential campaign we had a great conversation and we share the same worldview and we're certainly in touch to join forces especially against cultural Marxism and the significance of what Eduardo himself Joe your son\nYes exactly and uh well I think that they ... for them to understand that to the meeting birthday was portraying for them but that did the progressive candidates as far left but when he was the mayor of some follow\nActually what he did was uh he built a several daycares and more than thirty hospitals and uh he tried to make the traffic and to see the batter\nFor example have the infrastructure for bikes when he was a ministry of education under the ... he created more than a chain new federal universe which is more than three hound their new uh campuses university campuses\nAnd there was much more um incentives and it's a\nA fellow ships for ah education at all levels so you know he comes from an educational backgrounds\nAnd uh it's a little hint doesn't come from any type of uh extreme labs background and so what we have now is a very extreme fascist candidates\nRunning against a moderate candidates that are in our hope now is that to three all their candidates progressive candidates have said then that would support Fernandez dads and now in the runoff elections in a few weeks so hopefully the known between now and then uh\nThey think you're going to make up the difference and then the runoff\nI think so because those progressive kind it is to gather will probably get about twenty percent of the votes and or if they're able to convince people that that this is a dangerous fast and\nThe the challenge is how do we deal with me to manipulation not just mainstream me there but the ... the manipulation also show me too\nI wanted to go to Noam Chomsky who just recently went to Brazil um he met with ... in prison on and when he came out a ... condemned Brazil's right wing media\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\nOr in the Carolinas and now possibly hitting Florida and Alabama Alabama at the whole state has been called the state of emergency\n... there is almost no mention by meteorologists and I'm not talking even Fox I'm Talking MSNBC and see to see an end of the connection between these increasingly violent storms and climate change is there one and can you explain it\nWell it certainly is a connection\nI'm won't we won't we haven't done much more common dumped so them into the atmosphere is we made the atmosphere warmer in other words you put a lot more energy in the atmosphere\nThat energy move play out in terms of a whole suite of different more extreme weather conditions that whether this particular however can is um it's caused by climate change is impossible to cite ... is often the ties is that we are exhausted by increasing the the power in these ... in these extreme weather events\nOn the ... what we call the funds it was a tradition where we're trying to say is this have been a climate change if we are getting better with the understanding that uncertainty this quarter but most of evidence now\nShe has to some of them will recent severe weather conditions we're seeing are being seriously exacerbated by the additional warming we're putting the atmosphere from a burning of fossil fuels on the release of come dogs on the wall so I Can't comment on this particular topic and it's like this how we can was caused by climate change\nOr you know the severity of his how he can ... through some of the other events that we've seen in recent years certainly has been exacerbated by issues of climate change by a burning of fossil fuels\nOn the enemy joined this should be making the clear link when they make him into discussing these issues um during the during the weather forecast within the U.S ...\nYou talk about what's needed professor Anderson the report says there's no documented his star precedent for the scale of changes required\nUm you have a talked about a Marshall Plan what do you mean a new Marshall Plan\n... well the Marshall Plan was the was the to deliberate strategy after the second World War to trying to reconstruct Europe after being nosy very severely bones and destroyed\nAnd both institutionally but mostly physically during the war so I'm signed that batch is probably the newest metaphor analogy we have to the scale of challenge that we actually face\nThe compromise to shift away from a fossil fuel based energy system to zero carbon energy system and to do that within within the wealthy parts of the world really within about two decades I'm probably three or four and a half decades with a slightly poorer parts of the world\nSo we're not going to do that through a small price mechanisms through just tweaking the ... it is going to require\nTo change it intervention by governments to make the necessary rates of change now that sounds initially ... very I'm very challenging and certainly will be but I think there was also\nUm there was a positive narrative behind this and that this this transition this transformation to zero Kelvin and uses them will come with some job opportunities a loan to secure job opportunities\nNot just in building a low carbon power stations but in the massive electrification program that will be necessary\nIn retrofitting in other words making our existing building infrastructure which we'll we'll still be using for the next twenty thirty forty years to make that building infrastructure is suitable for the twenty first century so he require much less anything it was a cool it\nAnd it is safe environment to be in the climate continues to change which is undoubtedly will um ... even if we stop the missions today well we'll see some ongoing climate change\nYou have criticized the I. T. C. C. four constraining its policy advice to fit neatly within the current economic model can you explain I mean for some kind of a landmark report like this is simply critical because we live in a country in the United states where the president proudly\nDeny its climate change you know calls it a client at ...\nIt helps on and so had any kind of report like ... your credit report in some respects\nWell it certainly was I think is a really good report and trying to understand the impacts between one point five and two degrees centigrade a warming when it comes to what we have to do about it I think again ... runs skate a really being very honest and given how it is effectively a scientific report I think our role with a scientist and academics it to\nTell it like it is not to color it'll sweets into pill to make it more attractive to\nMy comments have all of it and it's not just for this report Ajmi repeatedly come out to the hype ACC\nLost weight coin direct and honest about the impact side when it comes to what we have to do about it we run SCAD we don't want to scare the politicians or the public we don't want to and\nAnd move away from this is all the energy systems that we have today so we always try to bully bullies massage the status quo incremental changes if you like and what I'm saying is that actually when you really look at the numbers behind the report look at the numbers the science comes out with then we're talking about\nA complete revolution and the energy system and that is going to bank very fundamental questions about how we run our economies\nAnd again you can tell him I said well that seems just as you know five to ... ... to remove the current economic system we have but we have to remember Seventy being when it's ten years now since the banking crisis and many parts of the world are still suffering the repercussions of that ...\nTo the current economic framework has struggled and within his own remiss if you're like well I think this has been a real opportunity which will not losing to reshape the economy there was an economy that suitable for society not sound like the suitable for the economy\nAnd I think the policy make the academics I'm just runs scared of this of being honest about ... on numbers tell us about the rates of change that we will we require and how we have to move the productive capacity of our society\nFrom building second homes for professors or private jet so private ... lodge four wheel drive cars moving from that to building public transport electrification improved homes for everyone so it's a it's a shifted that productive capacity to these officers on the ... from the\nIf you like the luxury for the twenty percent to be essential low carbon infrastructure for all of us\nDr Anderson the effect of Trump pulling the U.S out of the Paris Agreement we just had a segment on Brazil the front runner ... who are gas coal to open ... extremely far right wing candidate um has\nPromised that he will pull out of the Paris Agreement as well and would abolish Brazil's ministry of environment\nWhich environmentalist fairly late to deforestation in the Amazon your thoughts on both both NATO and Trump\nWell there are\nFrom a scientific perspective and I would always argue probably from mold perspective they all completely I'm Out in June with walked on now is is is saying\nOh it was so we have to be very careful when we see these extreme figures on both of these I think of a sudden the extremes because we have to remember that they are a little bit of noise on the system the the the the general trend line is more recognition to climate change is a serious issue even the poll data in the states shows they so I'm not seeing like different Brazil so I'm not sure\nBut ... so we are seeing climate change advancing people off thinking this is an important issue because some of 'em I'm not always the brightest people who are leading our country's I'm kind of understand that all the things that they have a political fights they have to appeal to who doesn't do not want to hear that message\nAnd I think the rest of us should no one's scared of them we just have to double redouble our efforts and indeed when I'm President Trump is either to put out the Paris Agreement which of course he can't do it anyway ... plans to the Chinese and the friends that forward and say well we will try and do some make some extra effort to come inside\nAnd we also see in the U.S many men saying she climate change is still an important issue\nTo the U.S has nothing to do is not tied to ship jump with their cannot tight ... population to the U.S and it's going to do it of course ... both an uneasy influential but so all the mayor's so it is incumbent on the rest of us there were more informed by the science and I would argue with a more reasoned mode and progressive or by groundswell analysis\nAnd is up to us to redouble our efforts and make sure that we move and the right direction and not to run the ...\nOf the Trump so this will not planes\nThen they will come and they will go but the overall issue of climate change the physics of climate change is here to stay regardless of the time frame who wins over the occasional presidents\nAnd in this last minute what does the future look like a how bad can and things get if we proceed on this course\n\nI think we'll probably still is a lot more tension within communities and and that means a lot more tension between two minutes or so\nI'm we'd say even if we look at Syria Syria claiming that he wasn't caused by climate change but the twelve years of drought in that region wasn't exacerbating factor and not just one you have a one degree of moving as we head towards\nFull degrees centigrade a woman
