FBI agent specializing in domestic counter terrorism here in orange County California we're joined by Pete Sandy professor of sociology at Chapman University studied extremist groups in violence for the past twenty here is co author of the book American swastika\nInside the white power movements hidden spaces of hate\nWe welcome you both to democracy now let's begin with Mike German in New York\nWe don't know who is done this the list of people and we hear added to the list of the Obamas the Clintons water is a former attorney general Eric Holder or George Soros on Maxine Waters may be today I'm a Joe Biden the former vice president\nUm well we don't know who has done this my German um it looks like a Trump hit list he did not mention the names last night and didn't uh did attack the media despite the fact that CNN got one of these packages here ... today\nI Do appreciate the call should do in attributing any blame at this point there's a lot of work for the FBI and other law enforcement partners do uh before we can do that um but obviously just look at the target list this is sort of the prominent people in the in the recent culture wars\nAre and you know I think what troubles me is is how our perception of ... a far right violence since I work these cases in the early Nineteen nineties seems to have changed in law enforcement\nUh been troubled over the course of the last couple of years in the way law enforcement seems to have not realized or the way that these groups were mobilize and we saw that through a number of violent protests for fairness\nI'm to Sacramento to Portland a poor Charlottesville and continuing right here in New York City um and and it just is troubling that law enforcement is just seeming now to get to understand that this is organized criminal violence\nUm can you talk about\nThe Trump Administration isn't particularly President Trump himself political rhetoric just think it's fair to say he in more than ... ... ... last night in Wisconsin He doesn't mention the targets are just to say that CNN which one of the targets but attacks the media again\nRight and I do think again you know it's important to have cautioned we're very fortunate in this country that the terrorism is very rare rare\nUm and you know the connection between rhetoric and violence is not really as strong as a lot of people suggest but it's very different when it is an authority figure who seems to be shut sanctioning the violence and whether that is a matter of\nThe police not responding to this kind of violence as aggressively as they do\nOther kinds of political violence or certainly when\nA position in the ... in an authority like\nPresident Trump is saying things that seemed to suggest to people that this is okay that the government's support cheer a violent activities when political parties are inviting\nThe far right fight club's to to speak at events into ... appeared events this is the kind of sanctioning that makes these groups much much more dangerous and my concern is now that we're starting to see\nA so some enforcement actions taken that these groups have have had two years to organize and recruit and I I think can be a much more dangerous problem in our society moving forward\nMike German what about these allegations that some of the far right conservatives talking about this being a false flag operation and if you could explain what that means\nSure a false flag operation is when somebody\nGod targets I ate a specific entity that will automatically cause people to take its their opponents that have\nEngaged in violence I I think it's entirely irresponsible to be suggesting that\nAnd again only ramps up these culture wars are and would only encourage more violence in retaliation I mean one of the big problems you have after an event like this is not just all the false alarms uh and how easy it is to to trigger a false alarm if somebody wants to cause trouble\nUm by copycats and it ... to the extent [noise] these groups are getting any kind of encouragement whether it's from the the figures of the culture war certainly whether it's from the government figures authority figures\nAre ... the chances of seeing an increase in this kind of activity I think goes up ...\nI Want to go to the conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh speaking yesterday\nWe have this series of bombs that were supposedly sent today explosively to Democrats\nAnd it just there's a smell chance that this stuff has to pass and\nSo far a lot of people's noses are in the air not quite certain what to make this or Republicans just don't do this kind of thing\nThat professor ... when he sang as a rational last comment we have this\nSame thanks for having me first of all um but uh it's incredibly irresponsible for folks to be\nThese kind of falls flat conspiracy theories especially at this point when so little is actually known about what happened in\nTo the suggested doesn't pass the smell test them we're not I mean we're not sure exactly what that means um [noise]\nBut what this does is it does further a much larger narrative that suggests that there's some kind of deep stake conspiracy and is trying to undermine a President Trump and is trying to ultimately are really just empower individual citizens that and it's a it's an idea that a stems from ideas about\nThe second amendment trained to be abolished sexually so that people can or even defend themselves and it really is you know that this is really part of this larger kind of right wing conspiracy theories that have\nIncluded things like pizza gate and ultimately a you know when you ...\nYeah the the false a contention that a pizzeria in Washington DC involved a child sex labor a ring that Hillary Clinton was involved with and ultimately lead one individual to to go there to investigate and open fire so\nYou know these kinds of wild accusations that involve is kind of conspiracy theories um you know they're they're they they do a you know have an influence on people are in a lot of different ways of fortunately not not necessarily um\nDirectly lead into violence uh most of the time but but on on some occasions there do see a new seem to be an influence awards matter\nUh and especially people in authority positions they have more influence in in so uh you know I think there's just a real lack of responsibility when folks are county and these kinds of a wild theories\nI Want to turn now to a very big story here in Southern California the leader of the California neo Nazi gang the rise above movement was arrested Tuesday in Los Angeles at the airport\nAnd he's been celebrated as a hero of extreme nationalist groups after leaving the event the Guinness was seen waving a ton of blade like the one used to kill us a new law might turn\nRight exactly and again when you have people that are Doherty promoting this kind of a political or\nA ... a ... I think that is more than just a week to these groups that is an actual sanctioning that allows them to think okay the the government is on my side and when you don't see\nIt a a rap in real time police response that than confirms that for him and the trouble is\nThis has been going on for for roughly two years now so these groups are are are have\nSpent plenty of time recruiting and now that there are forces measures being taken it's easier for them to go back underground and be very strong in their in their ability to organize much more serious violence\nI Want to thank you both for being with us of course we're going to continue to cover this so we're heading back to New York today my German is a fellow at the Brennan Center for justice in New York University law not named for John Brennan the former CIA director who ah who had a\nA a pipe bomb addressed to him that CNN causing sand in Studio ... name for justice Brennan from eighty eight to two thousand four\nUm my German served as an FBI agent specializing in domestic counter terrorism he's author of thinking like a terrorist and sites of a former FBI undercover agent ... see me with us here in orange county in Santa Ana he is a professor of sociology at Chapman University coauthor\nI'm with Roberts the trail of the book American swastika inside the white power movement\nHidden space says us hate\nThis democracy now democracy now dot org when we come back\nWell Southern California where we are now could determine the balance of Congress will talk about some of the mid term elections and look at a particular proposition that's on the ballot here around rent control stay with us [noise]\nJeffrey Brady at your vicious present far out both on Thursday October twenty seven thirty PM at the gates of heaven [noise]\nComposure Jeffrey ready and yet bishop present an evening before world music sources improvisational based competition to construct play tribute to protest considered the first important Jesse Kelly medicine locally grown ... ensemble yet vicious but bring a program of extended compositions\nBy Brady into improvisation by members with music for Egypt stands up are gonna end the America as far out both with Jeffrey bread and your dishes\nThursday October twenty seven thirty PM at the gates of heaven on James Madison park on the shores of lake\nMendota his is W O RTD nine point nine FM W.

we're broadcasting from Orange County California one of the key battlegrounds that could determine who controls Congress after the midterms\nThe Southern California county between Los Angeles and San Diego has remained staunchly Republican for eighty years Orange County produce president Richard Nixon who was born here in New York ... and retired to San Clemente\nIn orange county last voted for a democratic a precedent in Nineteen\nThirty six with a with FDR but dissatisfaction with Donald Trump and changing demographics in the region have challenged Republican dominance in and around Orange County now Democrats are hoping that the mid term elections will turn Orange County blue\nDemocrats need to win twenty three Republican seats in November to regain control of the house of representatives many of the tightest races\nUm that couldn't determine the house are in Southern California and California's forty eighth district longtime incumbent Republican congressmen Dana Rohrabacher\nIs battling to keep his seat after Thirty years in office roar backers and anti immigrant climate change skeptic who is known for his close ties to Russia\nHe's closely aligned with President Trump and his voted repeatedly to repeal Obamacare he said that people should be able to refuse to sell their homes to gay people and it's called California century law an invitation for criminals from all over the world to come here\nHe has also said a quote massive flow of illegal immigrants are quote changing our quality of life\nHe's running against Democrat Harley Rwanda\nA former Republican and the forty fifth district law professor Katie Porter who has been described as Senator Elizabeth Warren's protege is challenging to time Republican incumbent Mimi waters in another tight race in the thirty ninth congressional district Republican young camera South Korean immigrant is running against Democrat\nGil Cisneros well for more we're joined here in Santa Ana\nOr by Gustavo I are already on oh he is a columnist for the LA Times four\nOr editor of the weekly welcome to democracy now it's routes for having me so go through the left on a lot of focus more so than ever I mean this was definitely read country now is Orange County turning blue\nIt's a place where Reagan said all the good Republicans go to die and obviously anything wacky and horrible about\nRepublican politics in the United states came from Orange County you can even draw direct line between Orange County and Donald Trump and so of course there's going to be a lot of attention paid can Orange County actually deliver the white or Congress to the Democrats and\nI I still skeptical again born and raised here in orange county I've been covering Orange County my entire up a career and so to think that we're actually at the at the cost of revolution I'm Still a skeptic\nSo talk about Dana Rohrabacher versus Harley road\nSo we got to remember the district and the main district it split up between two cities Laguna Beach in Huntington Beach Luna beach\nBoth they're both on the coast both historical ah Laguna Beach is more hippie dip your whatever Huntington Beach though it's filled with a bunch of uh I don't know what if I could say it on the air but let's just say a bunch of racist and so\nThese are the people who have been electing Dana Rohrabacher for Thirty years and Dana Rohrabacher has been loving in his district all he has to do is just go on a surfboard once a year\nHe calls himself the surfing congressmen and that's it hardly route a brand new millionaire was a Republican not too long ago so that said a lot of people do not like the ... so this district really depends on how many people like him versus how many people hate him but that said\nI Do not discount the fact that the ... the people who like the inter Roebuck are are going to go out in droves just because they despise anything that even reeks of liberalism\n... can you talk about the political culture in orange county why answer Republican Strunk\nUsed to be all agriculture so used to be orange grove there's an orange to orange county's ... before the Nineteen fifties after the Nineteen fifties it becomes suburbia so you have to places where farming and development\nAh ... played a key role in the economy altogether defense industry so of course you're going to have a lot of suburban I racist coming in and they're the people who had the power structure forever and ever all of that has slowly been cheating is still big parts of Orange County\nRemain that way it's it's like the deep south except we don't have African Americans we have Mexicans and especially we're so close to the border so you just have a lot of races a lot of middle class racism just building upon itself again and again so the Republicans were able to build this political dynasty and that said the Democrats ruled Orange County as recently as the Nineteen seventies\nYou had Democrats in Congress he had Democrats on the board of supervisors the problem with those Democrats ... they were all corrupt and they all went to jail and so the Republicans came in they're smart enough to not put themselves in jail but\nThey're still dominating all the local races and until now the congressional\nRaces on and talk about the thirty ninth district where it is I hear you if two people of color who are running against each other Republican young can Democrat Gil Cisneros so that\nThere are enough congressional district is going to be north east Orange County so we're talking about Fullerton Yorba Linda also a little bit of San Bernardino riverside county is a that was some parts working class a lot of parts wealthy more importantly it's about a third Latino a third of white and a third agents them very much you want to talk about the future of Orange County everyone pays attention to the Dana Rohrabacher a\nRace but that's the one that really shows how Orange County is nowadays young came to longtime staffer for a long time congressman ed Royce who's retiring because he knew he wasn't gonna when former state assemblywoman then lost and became a state assemblywoman again\nAnd now she's running for Congress Gil Cisneros in another one of these are\nFirst time candidate once Republican now a Democrat became a multimillionaire because he actually won
