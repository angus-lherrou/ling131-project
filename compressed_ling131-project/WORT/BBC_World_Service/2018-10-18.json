central Gaza\nCould not find an equal or better minority for the job and that that is quoted in the report and so to me that pretty much solved the issue for University of Pennsylvania clearly she was not a minority higher if they the um uh if the the hiring committee they're always having to argue to hire her as a white woman and\nSo on that then takes you to Harvard after a few years at Penn and she goes she teaches at Harvard and Ninety three as a visiting professor at which is a sort of weird thing that law schools do um they have you come and when they're looking at hiring you and you have like this year long job interview\n'em so she taught for a year at Harvard and they loved her and they did an unusual thing which is offer her job you know while she was still there and it's still teaching and Ninety three\nAnd however an she initially turned that job down she wasn't really gunning for it um there are a number of reasons but she turned it down\nBut at Harvard you've really wanted to see is there a similar form you know is there a similar EEOC form that she had to that in a Harvard had to fill out\nAnd if there was one I just I couldn't find it so to look at Harvard and understand you know did they hire her because of her Native American heritage I instead had to look at this vast hiring committee and and the way it works at Harvard is ten year law professors get to vote on who can join their staff\nAnd who can join the club and they have these ... to they had this to meetings about Elizabeth Warren and sort of picking up her scholarship trying to figure out do we want this woman on our staff\nAnd so I tracked down every single living person who would have been in that meeting and tried to interview all of them to see if I could find anybody who said yeah we weren't we saw her she was Native American and we wanted a Native American on the staff\nAnd the ones I was able to talk to 'em ... most of them said they had no idea that she had this Native American heritage and there was only one person who said yeah this made it might have come up but it's not why we why we hired her ... we did not see her as an affirmative action higher\nSo the professors who hired her were fairly\nThey are on this the other thing was really interesting as I talked to some of the students because I have heard at the time was just really why I mean they are where I think four or five blocks professors and\nThat was essentially at in terms of Harvard law school staff and the students at the time were really um agitating for more diversity and faculty\nAnd so there were protests outside of the meeting where Warren was hired and students were were were very pleased at the end of the day when we're when word came out that they had hired Elizabeth Warren a woman but the students were interviewed at the time by the Hartford Clinton's hands and\nSaid they were they were upset that it was a white woman why not hire you know a black woman or an Asian woman or a Hispanic woman on this was a debate that was going on in the campus and the student activists who are most attuned to it\nYes they were pleased that um there was a little bit more gender diversity with Warren's higher but they were still angry that a woman of color hadn't been hired so I mean to me that also says you know she was pushing this as a reason to get hired she definitely wasn't doing a very good job\nBut I think you if if you could just say a again just to clarify the exact uh years and institutions in which Elizabeth Warren identified herself\nAs Native Americans because as you know her critics point out that ah if she didn't do it to advance herself professionally why did she do it at all\nAnd that you know even if her family were was speaking to her about her heritage what reason did she have in the moment that she decided to declare that on official documents\nYeah this is where it gets complicated for war and so if you sort of take at that that if you if you accept that she did not um got ahead because of this the ... the question though is when she was at the University of Pennsylvania from I Believe it was eighty seven to Ninety five um I might be a little on on that\nWhen she was there two years two years after being hired as a white woman at the University of Pennsylvania she does something very unusual\nWhat does she go she has her own ethnicity code changed in the University of Pennsylvania's HR system\nThat does something for me in the University of Pennsylvania it allows them to report that they have a more diverse faculty than they have and the University of Pennsylvania like all major institutions was under pressure to hire 'em diverse and have diverse faculty is so\nShe does that's for some reason um she does the same thing at Harvard so when she was later hired at Harvard you know of course your age are forms don't transfer from one university to the next she has to refill them all out\nAnd I'm about two years after she got the job offer at Harvard and a good three or four months after she started working at Harvard and Ninety five\nUm you also saw 'em I ought to talk of documentary evidence that her um ethnicity coat and changes to Native American and that sort of ... start reporting to the federal government is that they have a Native American law professor staff\nSo in both instances she didn't proactively make a change\nAnd that change was used by these two institutions to argue hey look we're we're not as bad as it may seem diversity wise because we do have this professor who is Native American um so\nYou know that certainly complicated for her you know I I'm I asked her about that and you don't have\nI don't have a satisfying answer from her about why she did it I mean she says to this day she doesn't it does not specifically remember making those changes and she says that she's thought back to that time in her life\nThat her on the matriarch of her family her her ... her mother and her mother sisters we're\nWe're getting older and they were starting to talk more about family heritage um and they were dying and I you know she's ... so what she's saying to me is that she kind of felt the sense that she is the sort of growing pride in her roots that at the same time if you think about her life\nIf you know she grew up in Oklahoma she went to law school she went to um I graduated from school and in Texas and now all of a sudden she sort of dressed for the first time the ivy league environment and her\nSort of character is to sort of double down on on her own who she is rather than kind of try to fit in 'em\nAt these institutions so I think that's part of it I mean I talk to people at the University of Pennsylvania\nWho would say that she liked to identify as an ... and would use that word a lot\nAnd so you know her explanation really is that this was sort of an expression of\n... the identity that she was trying to to put out in the world but you know I think it's a fair criticism when you look at how these universities or using that statistic and particularly Harvard which was so completely lily white at the time\n... was arguing that hey look we have a diverse stuff because we have as it turns out this woman Elizabeth Warren who is eight of Americans\nDon't let me go back to an old Harvard crimes and the university paper or to go to law school spokesman tells the Harvard crews and in Nineteen Ninety six of Seventy one current law school professors and assistant professors eleven or women five or black one is Native American and one is Hispanic\nUm that's where the list but foreign being that one Native American uh crimson editorial from Nineteen Ninety eight refers to warn law schools one tenured minority woman I'm political also reports that a Ninety seven Fordham Law review page described her as Harvard law school's first woman of color\nAny Lenski yeah I mean that's a problem you know that at that and that is a problem that um\nThat Harvard ... and and that they were willing to go out and how Elizabeth Warren as a woman of color and if you are the contacts at the time was is really interesting um\nIt's [laughter] I mean Harvard in Nineteen Ninety three when Elizabeth Warren was hired had not hired a single woman\nOf color to their ... their faculty they had not hired a single person there was an average two hundred year history no woman of color was hired and that didn't change 'em until I Believe\nNinety seven or Ninety eight um but I Will say when they did make their ...\nFinally an African they hired an African American woman\nHowever did make an enormous deal about it um but I you know I think that this is where the problem comes at Harvard was out there now was out there touting her as Native American I Will say the University of Pennsylvania I took a very different approach I took I talked to the dean there\nAnd about this and he was like no no no we were\nWe were not going to do that you know if Elizabeth Warren wanted to be Native American on our rules are statistics that's fine but there is no way we're we're going to walk out and ... and suggest that she was a Native American law professor so that to university it took a very different approach\nBut you know a\nLot of her critics of the critics of of her decision to come out as Native Americans\nUm you know I I don't think that she's very regretful about this I think that she's just kind of bold her way forward on this on this issue and you know yeah it's a sovereign right of tribal nations to determine who is a member it is in a relationship so can ship of community of you\nKnow a lived experience it's all kinds of different factors that sometimes can include blood quantum but Bill Clinton was something that was created by the colonial government not by tribal nations um and it's this kind of miss that's been perpetuated by the United states and buy a many many Americans who claimed to be quote unquote part Cherokee\nUm you know and continue these problematic ideas over who native people are and we're ...\nLet's turn to Republican Senator Lindsey Graham on Fox and friends Tuesday saying he plans to take a DNA test in response to Senator Warren\nI'm going to take a day and it just all of us I've been told him my grandmother works for Cherokee Indian it and they all be just calls\nBut you go to find out in a couple of weeks ago so I'm going to take this new are going to take it I'm taking it and the result is going to be revealed here\nThis is my ... this is reality you and I just I'm dying to know [laughter] you know I didn't really think much about it she lifts them one tenth of one percent I think I can beat or I think I can beat her fried and if you do ... us for a million dollars from the president you know I wanted to see no enemy but [laughter] I Want to see\nYou know in a million bucks Tara ... that was Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina\nYeah it's a it's incredibly disrespectful and you know she just really shows um how warrants behavior although it's less crude than some of the comments who have been made by Donald Trump about you know Pocahontas and demeaning women this in a historic figure and making that into somehow is for\nTrue but it's still problematic and it's still\nA completeness understanding of what I native identity actually is and it perpetuates this myth that so many people hold I mean you live on the east coast and you're here almost everyone having the story of being part Cherokee on their mother's side um when there are real tricky people still live today and we should respect that and understand her native people really are\nWell I'd like to bring in a mock a CIA Hans from Anchorage, Alaska could you also comment on this controversy I use an extremely critical of the fact that Elizabeth Warren has released has taken a DNA test\nAnd released it could you explain what your a problem with this is your criticism of\nThe DNA to itself is just another use of a colonial narrative basically\nIt uh the ultimate goal of a DNA test is to\nProve that Indians are immigrants like everybody else and it's a again it takes away from the idea that there is a tribal community with a governing institution that's been around before the United states and there are reasons the tribes are around\nWith ten thousand your histories in North America\nCan you explain what you mean by that that they did the DNA tests are there to prove that are indigenous people a Native Americans are immigrants like everyone else why\nHaven't Tobar a who's written quite a bit about this is talk about that that\nThe it's basically coming up with a a a narrative that says a\nUse of figure out where folks came from originally and trying to figure that out rather than to connect with the stories I mean a shiny better for example one of the things that just a I Love about my own people is that if you look at the history of North America we won ... hunted messed it on\nAnd you think about that is an arc of history that goes back\nMany generations that is much deeper than a test that you can use\nYou even suggested ... cars that are releasing her DNA test kind of disqualifies her to be president\nSure I mean the campaigns are about stories and what story are going to tell about yourself and I'm here we are three week less than three weeks away from an extraordinary election and we're talking about this instead of the extraordinary election I think just from a strategic point of view that makes no sense\nLet's go to Jesse Ross in Seattle author lawyer member of the black\nSea nation I as you watch this I'm from the northwest Jesse and talk about your response to that not only um to Senator Warren doing the DNA test and all the way she has very slowly represented herself\nBut also Donald Trump and I and his comments ... continually right through this week talking about Pocahontas\nBanking and good morning thank you for having all of us um it's good to be on this very esteem panel\nUm you know I I had a few reactions number one is one concerning the media generally and it would be nice to have quote unquote native stories native beans stories that weren't centered on white people\nUm that something that's very common whether you're talking about Hollywood dances with wolves little big man a Elizabeth Warren every single time we've seen native and mass media it's in response to white people doing something really really stupid or saving our community\nAnd I that's a false narrative and so it wouldn't be nice to see our our communities that are that are actually pushing ... on amazing recovery\nUm relationship to economics in relationship to education in relationship to language I'm actually have ... centered around this story as opposed to around the white person and the native people being collateral to that white person\nI'm also a reaction is that um you know\nElizabeth Warren obviously she wants to be an ally but she doesn't want to be an accomplice meaning that she's feeling still willing to make native people political fodder for her own political survival as mark pointed out you have native women\nI'm Better running is stored numbers and doing has stored things in this particular two thousand and eight you know election Sharif David and Kansas\n... in in New Mexico Paula Jordan running for governor of Idaho\nBut yet with all these amazing native women's stories this white woman wants to send her this Indian narrative is made of narrative in politics around her as opposed to going out and campaigning for them two weeks in advance of the two thousand and they in elections [noise]\nExcuse me and to me that does make me question her judgment\nWe we definitely ready for we um you know condemn\nDonald Trump for his emotion malady and his competitor was news and unpredictability was she does a Maury Povich light spectacle revealing her DNA results as opposed to doing the actual work of a leader\nYou mentioned Jesse ... and I want to turn to 'em what she said the Democratic candidate for Congress in New Mexico who could become the first native woman to serve in Congress she tweeted this week\nSenator Elizabeth Warren is DNA test confirms a family history she has long shared with the world and I acknowledge her native ancestry is testament to who we are as Americans the oppression native people have experienced over the course of our history cause many native\nAmerican families to deny their heritage language and culture and I understand why this was the case with her family centered Warren has been a sister in the struggle for years for indigenous people's rights and for all of us who weren't born into the top one percent\nThe revelation of senator warrants Native American ancestry a significant for her personally and I joined her and celebrating her ancestry\nAh that is the ... of the Native American a congressional candidate democratic candidate in New Mexico who couldn't well become um the first a Native American a ... a Congress member your response\nTo what she says Jesse Hi Congress woman she has colon it\nUm and I believe that her injuries David will coal\nBy that title as the first native Congress people in I'm In a in a house and that's going to be an amazing celebration and wonderful wonderful event for the United states politics in the United states history generally\nBut for um for you know Congress woman how and that is they typically gracious and amazingly brilliant response\nAnd absolutely I'm sure she does celebrate just like all of us cool if you want to be into the fold socially that's a beautiful thing you want to find out why you know this was the year of the native woman and I'm you know Elizabeth Warren evidently he wanted to upgrade herself you know beyond say style\nBut that doesn't mean that requires these mobile Maury Povich light theatrics in which they do it and disrupt a flow where you native women are rightfully getting a lot of attention politically and a lot of resources politically and do this as opposed to doing the work it's an incredibly gracious and generous response from Congress woman how and\nBut that doesn't mean that the timing is correct number one nor that it wasn't something that you know that she necessarily thought out or her people thought out properly\nAnd your response to Trump saying he'll give her a million dollars that she takes a DNA test now saying you know I never said anything like that\nTrump's a pig I mean he's a liar so that shouldn't surprise us I think both of them for making native ancestry into a spectacle", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "18"}
