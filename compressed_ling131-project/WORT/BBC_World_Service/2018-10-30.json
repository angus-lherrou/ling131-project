our colleagues are we heard a scream and she was on the phone and and she was talking with someone and we really didn't know what had happened at that point um and then as\nTime to continue to proceed we discovered\nThat there was a possibility of a ... there was shooting\nAnd it was a possibility that was a family member not really understanding and knowing what had happened or we need easily brand I went out to the location we had several members of our team there\nAnd we later discovered a that Kelly watch the news the cheap equity officer\nUm in metro government will metro government or that it was her father I'm Ari style or who had been murdered 'em and another loan another woman had been murdered in the parking lot I was a horrific day a sad day and we're continuing to grieve through this process\nBut one of the exciting things is that we're very resilient city\nAnd we've been working on some things in terms of out of Kelly's office or as the cheap equity officer in terms of looking at these very types of issues\n[noise] well I I wanted to ask a representative Adam Scott in terms of the the reaction of some public officials are are are in the area about whether this was a hate crime or not or could you talk about that and the judgment that people did or didn't go through a very uh soon after\nThis uh this crime occurred\nDefinitely and when something like this happens entire community ... and his anxious and stressed out and often look to elected leaders to provide some direction and guidance and in this situation we\nAre as an African American community or failed by many of our elected officials who refused to call this what it was such as a hate crime and when you kill to black people in this challenge and it's just style it and you try to break into a black church that's hate crime and to have people at the ...\nUncle and state level\nShe used to even call it a hate crime message too many of us in community that our lives day not anti narcotics or some people and we shouldn't have to beg to college they split it is we hope to have\n... he had to back out late last night that revenue in chains you work for the Mayor Tom can you talk about yes on can you talk about that and whether they're ... they're ... than they are getting immediately call it a hate crime\nWhere I can share with you the mayor did come out and say that it was a hate crime you talked about the fact that uh the situation was driven by hate when you think about and I had the privilege of past year and a local African American church in ... in the city\nAnd understanding in terms of what the community needs and and and the hurt that a community goes through and they experienced as\nAnd just recently on yesterday a mayor Greg Fischer and several local pastor's a faith leaders in our community sat down and talk with the commonwealth attorney Tom wine and talked about this very issue\nOf a hate crime a it was horrendous hate crime and mayor Fischer acknowledged that he had been a fight with it and he agrees with the community and the families\nAnd so he is very aware and very in tune and we've been working on these issues of for the past several years\nAre working with gear a governor lives for racial equity and putting together racial equity plans in terms of our community one of our um tenets in terms of when we think about our community is a very compassionate community\nSo our mayors heart was greed he's angered but also we are going to move into action we've put in action plans and we're working with community leaders to begin to look at how this could never happen again in our community how do we avoid these types of things\nAnd so as a community we're very resilient we're very focused and we have a plan in place to be able to execute that this won't happen again [noise]\nWell a representative Scott I Want to see if you are if you agree with the assessment on forever and James and also if you could talk about this whole issue of the of the blue lives matter legislation that went through the\nOh the legislature we have to make sure that um we have honest conversations about what got us here and when we have a political system\nThat passes hateful legislation when we have a societal a issues around comments that are made whether you're calling young black kids pumps that Doug or whether you're passing legislation like the black lives matter building\nAnd changing Kentucky's hate crimes\nLaw to now include your profession what you choose to do\nA if you were first responder including law enforcement\nOr that sends a clear message across Kentucky about whose lives really do matter and then this year passing a so called gang bill that we saw Mississippi in eight years since it's been passed it only black people have received an enhanced intense from that gang bill to support it and then pass that bill here in Kentucky\nSends a message across our black communities in other communities of color that you are under attack by your own\nElected officials at the local and state level and we have to have those conversations that say wait a minute what are we doing to make sure that we're looking to restore people to their fullness rather than to incarcerate them so that we can justify building more prisons\nAnd I wanted to I'm correct we it said the St Louis police chief but it's the Jefferson town police chief Sam Rogers I'm a ... we had said the ... but the Jefferson town police chief Sam Rogers who\nI'm told the first Baptist church on Sunday that the shooting was motivated by racism was a hate crime um can you talk I'm Reverend James about uh the feelings right now and inside the church that Bush apparently tried to get into your the Reverend of another church or how\nChurches are yelling right now um and also this being\nThe one\nOf a series of attacks this week I mean you have this men allegedly saying um to a white man standing outside with a gun outside kroger's whites don't kill whites like saying don't kill me I'm or he's not going to kill him\nAnd then you have the omni letter bombs ... now apparently Fifteen of them sent out to people who are critics of President Trump and then of course the horrific\nA synagogue a massacre that took place sat at another place of worship in Pittsburgh the funerals beginning\nToday I went dead on an anti Semitic shooter who also linked on a Jewish groups helping immigrants and his fierce anti immigrant a hatred\n\nIs is it's it's a very sad time in our country when we have these types of acts of hatred in our communities and in our churches and synagogues\nAnd mosque when you think about all that has taken place across the country but one of the things\nThat people of faith recognize the fact that these challenges are written in the holy word that these things were to come and so one of the things in terms of what we find in what we see as faith leaders as community leaders is that it is our faith that really drives us beyond what\nWe see and what we experienced to hope that we know that with people coming together and staying together that we can change\nWe have to realize and know that we ... this is not a time to\nTurn on each other but it's a time to turn to each other\nAnd so what I've seen across the faith community talking with all kinds of faith\nLeaders across our city and across this country is the fact that we have a a reality that we have to look at in confront and when we talk about hatred when we talk about the rhetoric that is\nComing from our ministry ... all these types of things that we as a people if they have to rise above it and take action you know the reality is is that it it takes us as a people\nTo recognize what is going on and then we have to go to the polls next week is going to be a very critical time for our country that we need to send a message that this type of behavior this type\nOf situation that happened in in Pittsburgh that happened in Louisville is totally unacceptable and we're going to change and the way that you change that is going to the polls and sort of failed remedy is rising above a Reverend James\nI wanted to ask you in a in the same vein for the President Trump a\nOr after the attack on the synagogue in Pittsburgh said that perhaps armed guards were needed at places of worship\nA he said similar things after the Parkland shooting that are that are armed guards or the army of teacher she he ... he suggested impossibility arming of teachers what's your response to this idea\nThat maybe a houses of worship should now have armed guards as a means of protecting themselves\nI don't believe that houses with say our schools need to have armed guards you know that that's not why we attend church we attend church to be able to connect with our God and to be able to realize that our faith protects us an even with challenges come against us\nOr we'd know because of the worst says no weapon well formed against this\nDoesn't mean that the weapon want calm but it means in terms it won't prosper that it won't it won't destroy the hope and the resilience of the people in spite of what challenges\nThat we face that's why in terms of having an armed guards you have to be secure and understand the Bible teaches us that we need to be wiser served in Syngenta was a dog that means you have to be alert and awake in terms of things that could potentially happen\nWe can't look at this is sort of just the abroad problem of how do we fix social media how do we fix is took him how to fix Twitter I think it's important to really narrow the question and say I'm Twitter Instagram Facebook are being exploited by hostile actors and by terrorists to recruit people who will commit violence\nHow do we focus on that particular problem and how do we how do these companies take particular responsibility for white supremacist terror\nAnd how those terrorists are using their platforms\nThe Robert Bowers account on ... breed posted another user who wrote open your eyes it's the ... the evil Jews bringing the filthy evil Muslims into the country\nUm if you can talk about um his link Bowers link a white supremacist link\nBetween uh Jews and Jewish groups were about to speak to representative of highest he particularly focused on this issue\nThat a refugee I'm I'm resettlement organization was bringing what he called the invaders and I'm a Brian ... of CNN just looked at um a Fox News and other right wing outlets and saying the level of\nUm times that they are talking about invaders just in the last\nFew weeks has so escalated\nAnd Bowers himself said I like the way they're changing the language of aliens illegal aliens to invaders\nAnd it's this link of immigration as President Trump now even if she goes to Pittsburgh tries to divert attention to the border sending saying he's sending the fifty two hundred soldiers to the border sooner on the border there'll be more soldiers than in Iraq and Afghanistan on sending more than fifty two hundred\nUm soldiers to the border and also saying he plans to through executive order and the birthright citizenship\n\nI mean you're pulling all of these incredibly troubling threads together and it's really important to recognize that they attacked us on the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh wasn't attack on Jewish people and the ... areas of the people who died are just heart wrenching\nBut an attack on Jewish people for supporting refugees and attacked specifically targeted at\nAn organization that was helping ... has a she bought ceremonies in honor of supporting refugees and and drawing on the Jewish history of persecution at\nTo emphasize how important it is that people who are fleeing violence in terror elsewhere in the world that we have the capacity to welcome them and give them a safe place and that that is a moral duty ...\nAnd in talking to a representative for highest the particular a refugee organization and that the shooter named and that he said if you will to his rage that he shared a link a to a synagogue that were hosting these kinds of events you know she said that there are still wrestling with what it means to be targeted with violence\nParticularly for fighting for this basic humanity for treating other people with basic humanity and that is what is so incredibly tragic here at that that this congregation and these people were targeted I'm at because of their humanitarian impulses because of support for Jews for refugees for people of color and\nAnd that the overwhelming will do the anti\nDefamation League is founded anti Semitic Jew incidents from the U.S role by fifty seven percent in two thousand Seventeen the largest single year increased\nSince it started recording such statistics I'm Wondering if you or your strengths and this is of course not an isolated situation here in the United states or there's been a rise of minutes arts committed incidents across Europe as well I'm Wondering if you could uh uh uh talk about uh the\nContext in which is occurring as more and more of a right wing governments are coming to power all across the industrial world and even in many parts of Asia Latin America as well\nYeah so obviously the context of rising anti Semitism is very disturbing and what was particularly striking about Robert Bowers the Pittsburgh shooter is it in looking at his\nOn line a profile on gap and the post that he made it was clear that he was channeling a lot of very ancient anti Semitism but a lot of the troops and the hatred that he was sharing a are very are centuries old but this is not a new phenomenon and the anti Semitic violence\nIs a very old and a very dangerous ideology but Robert powers was also someone who was actively in communication with other white supremacists someone who was very familiar with the events of Charlottesville where white supremacist groups marched through university town with torches Santa chanting Jews will not replace us\nAnd some of the statements that he made on his account suggests that he was familiar with those debates about what people who are white supremacy in America should do the optics of different kinds of action what's going to be most effective\nUh for advancing his white supremacist beliefs again this belief in an all white country that the United states has only a country for white people that other people should be shut out or don't belong here or shouldn't be allowed to have citizenship\nAnd so that you saw him\nThis platform interacting including interacting with other white supremacist activist I spoke to one activist it was an anti fascist from Charlottesville\nWho says that she constantly monitors gab\nFor the harassment of white supremacists and she actually got some of these Robert Bauer post um that they did she pass them by she saw them she had screen shots of a couple of them\nBut the the kind of hatred that he was spewing with so common on this platform that there were so many dozens and hundreds of men sharing equally extreme racist propaganda that nothing about what he said has stood out to her\nThat this was someone who had apparently harassed her directed directly is I'm a massage ... nasty\nComments and then appear to go on to commit a mass murder at a Jewish synagogue and she said she's still wrestling with it because what he said on that platform the kind of heat that he was expressing was so common that it didn't stand out it didn't seem exceptional\nBerg Mayor Bill de Vito ... speaking I'm about what happened on Saturday ah the synagogue attacked the darkest day of Pittsburgh history but said armed guards are not the solution\nI think the pledge that we need to be looking at is how we treat the guns which is the common denominator of every mass shooting in America all the news of rules that are looking to express screech rude drew murder\nSo that's there to do he also said that President Trump or should not come today to Pittsburgh but they are busy burying the dead this is President Trump right after the massacre talking about armed guards\nHad production shy of the results would have been far better there will always are just starts to spread but they're very odd\nSome kind of a project to try to jump all\nMaybe you should have been a very much for Georgia\nHe was able to do things for Jewish or the will to do it here the boys were outstanding players of pollution in front of a job it is you know\nNumerous Phillies were badly\nSo that was President Trump calling for armed guards\nIn the synagogues I'm Lois back at if you could talk about this and also I mean as we're talking about this violence you have\nUm grad Bush or in the Louisville area and Jefferson town I she has a numerous weapons are not clear whether he has been legally he had to hand them over because of its violent background again so often we see the links to domestic violence in their past but ...\nBy these men are able to have these guns course Bowers used an AR Fifteen\nThese linkages to violence and and this might you might think of as a stretch but because you are a guardian reporter I'm thinking about your colleague Ben Jacobs on who is body slammed by the Montana Congress member to plead guilty to criminal assaults and why I'm bringing that up now as President Trump just last\nWeek um held a rally in Montana\nWhere he applauded\nA June fourth day for body slamming your colleague at\nThe guardian this in the midst of\nUm uh the investigation into the murder of a ... with President Trump taking the side of the Saudi a leadership and not to mention the CNN mail bombs and President Trump has not stop attacking the media all week\n\nOne thing I Want to say that it's tremendously important uh in these times where um the amount of violence and the partisan intensity seems so overwhelming is that being a gun owner in America is not a radical thing in this country may not be ... not everyone may agree with us but in this country it is a normal thing to be a gun owner\n... millions tens of millions of Americans own guns are roughly a third of households are gone owning households um so I think it's really important not to ... indiscriminately lumped together a lot of different issues um but to say that there is a different a big difference between being a gun owner in America and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "city": "Madison", "day": "30"}
