Scholten and a district that Trump won in two thousand sixteen by twenty seven percent margin\nMeanwhile attorneys representing three Kansas men convicted of two thousand sixteenth plot to bomb a mosque and murder Somali Muslim refugees are arguing Trump's hate filled rhetoric should be taken into account and result in a more lenient sentence\nWhich is very interesting is where birthright law comes from where the fourteenth amendment to the constitution um how it developed and that's what you document in your book birthright citizens tell us its origins\nYes you know the U.S constitution the Seventeen eighty seven constitution was largely silent on the question of citizenship\nAnd so the issue arises when we have the emergence of communities of free African American these are people former slaves who by the early Nineteen century\nHave created families communities have woven themselves into the everyday fabric of the nation but they occupy a um ambiguous status before the constitution\nThere were those who argue that race is a bar on that blackness prohibits ... citizenship for African Americans and there are others\nWho begin to make this argument that no citizenship and is not rooted in race citizenship is rooted in birth and African American sees on this and wages campaign over many decades in the years preceding the civil war advocating for their status as permanent\nMembers of the body politic as full members of the body politic by virtue of birthright and\nThen of course the the Dred Scott decision the infamous drug Scott decision during the the bottles over all the future of slavery in America you're talking about the impact of a lot on this debate\nAbsolutely Dred Scott is himself an enslaved men who is suing for his freedom he's doing so in a federal court and the question arises does he have standing or the capacity to sue and a federal court because only citizens can bring cases there\nAnd the court can Clunes certainly the Dred Scott himself is not a citizen he is a slave um but then goes further to declare that no black person be they enslaved or free can ever be a citizen of the United states\nThis is a devastating blow as you can imagine to free African Americans who have long promoted the view that they are birthright citizens but what's important to remember about Dred Scott is that its impact on the ground and the daily lives of African Americans is very limited\nVery few chords are willing to enforce the literal terms of dreads Scott\nIn um the cases that they hear um state legislatures are not prepared to defer to the courts reasoning and African Americans even in the face of the disc devastating rhetoric in Dred Scott continue to wage a campaign for\nCitizenship into what then becomes the era of the civil war\nI'm sure you found as a historian teaching at a university on how little knowledge there is of history and then when you refer just in Dred Scott\nExplain who he is and it's crusading attempt to challenge this and how um the amendment comes out of what this perhaps most race since decision of the U.S Supreme Court but it came out of activism it came out of dread scotch bravery who was he\nI'm Scott isn't enslaved men in the city of St Louis Missouri I'm his case arises because in the company of his owner Scott travels to free territory I'm among those places Minnesota\nAnd the claim had long been persons who um were held as slaves but reside in free soil became free themselves now Scott\nI'm lives in these Minnesota Territory he meets his wife Harriet um they begin to have a family they marry and then finally they return to St Louis where they are still held as slaves and by the early Eighteen fifties I think they are concerned that\nUm they might be sold that their family might be separated um they're always at risk as enslaved people and they begin what is as you as you explain a series of freedom suits um a tireless effort to secure the freedom for themselves and for their two daughters\nUm these cases make their way through the Missouri state courts um and when they fail their wind up before the U.S Supreme Court\nUm their chief justice Roger Tony I'm now notoriously pens and opinion on that um deprives the Scott family of pursuing their freedom claims in the federal court\nUm but as importantly um make sure that no African American slave or free can bring claims before the same high court Venus so you could just\nTook a certain through water happens after a subsequent to the civil war when the fourteenth amendment is adopted and the and the intention of Congress are are in the ... with the passage of the fourteenth amendment\n... so I'm African Americans are going to be um among the first to attempt to volunteer\nI'm In the civil war era to serve and to support the union army on their view is that this is an extension\nOf their long quest for citizenship that military service service to the nation this capacity might further open the door or make their case I'm for their status citizens\nOn the thirteenth amendment as we know an Eighteen sixty five will abolish slavery\nBut the thirteenth amendment does not comment on the status of African Americans before the law before the constitution this is still an unresolved question and the campaign to the fourteenth amendment is precisely designed to respond to that long campaign that African Americans have\nA wage it is to um resolve\nThe kinds of ambiguities the kinds of dangers the kinds of ... the former slaves face without a resort to the status their status as citizens\nAnd so in Eighteen sixty eight um after Congress has um promulgated fourteenth amendment the states will ratify it and for the first time the U.S constitution will provide that all persons born in the United states are citizens of the United states it is a remedy a radical remedy\nTo bring millions of former slaves into the body politic\nBut it is written in a way that gives it a lasting and enduring effect which is to make every person regardless of race and I may say regardless of religion regardless of dissent regardless of political affiliations make every person born in the United states citizen of the United states\nNow during the debate over the fourteenth amendment 'cause there are some ... or a relatively small\nA number of scholars who support the viewpoint of Trump's the or\nThe birthright citizenship husband incorrectly of a interpreted a book that but even then in the debate wasn't there a debate as to whether this is a amendment would extend to people who were or or where the children born here of immigrants\nImmigrants are not what troubles Congress um during the fourteenth amendment debates on what Congress is concerned about when it cars out an exception to the fourteenth amendment for people not subject to the jurisdiction of the United states what Congress is concerned about are three things\nI'm One of the children of foreign diplomats who might ah incidentally be born in the United states the fourteenth amendment does not make them birthright citizens\nCongress anticipate the possibility that the U.S would be occupied by a foreign army and in that case the children of soldiers a foreign army would not be birthright citizenship even if they were born in the United states\nThe third category of persons who Congress is mindful of our Native Americans and here um we're in an era where native communities native nations um continue to exert and to enjoy 'em the independents sovereignty\n'em and Congress does not interfere or impose on that sovereignty by wholesale ... native people us citizens that will happen later in the twentieth century\nBut it's just say that no Congress has not thinking about um what today we might term an authorized or illegal immigrants [noise] um but it does carve out an exception for persons who are said to be not subject to the jurisdiction of the United states and this is the language that I'm a President Trump\nAnd others have seized upon um as they have looked to constrain or curtail the effect of the fourteenth amendment\nYou know when we were covering the protests around the killing of Michael Brown\nOn a few years ago and fluorescent diving you are in Ferguson, Missouri just a few miles down that same road is the cavalry cemetery where Dred Scott was a buried\n'em but I wanted to go beyond the Dred Scott and talk about other cases or you look at and birthright citizens I wanted to ask you about one Kim arc that Chinese American cook who was born in San Francisco and

let's begin with you in Sao paolo your response to the election of both for NATO who won by quite a margin why and what do you think\nIt's a hard to ... to me the\n... of his election to such a young infringe I Do democracy such as ours are I think he won for several reasons is very difficult to\n... points just a single one but I think it's the result of many many years of a criminal your station of the political class in Brazil\nOr this is a long time coming it started a way that being a operations\nThat the police the federal police and the ... version is Cherie\nUh didn't Brazil a but the fact is a mini saw this coming but the political establishment couldn't believe it was possible I'm ... also a represents a\nThe military dictatorship ... in the country which is which is pretty pretty strong\nBut I also have to say something that [noise]\n[noise] Mm not many people who are um put on the table which is there is a mess a psychology things are happening here in Brazil\nThere is the fact that they left in Brazil is being\nCalled criminalize and\nA demo nice for\nQuite a while\nSo both ... results of many many things\nAh it's hard to pinpoint just one reason\nAn James a profession changed screen I'd like to ask you in terms of the impact of the ... elections which did not get a whole lot of coverage here in the United states on Latin America and really the ... a democracy is across the the the world because people forget Brazil is the\nFifth largest country in the world and populations got more people than Russia or Japan or and so what happens in Brazil really has a big impact or certainly uh\nThe Latin America because it represents a about half of all the south America's population\nI think that the election and Brazil reflects an international trend that we've been following\nIn Russia in the Philippines in Poland and Hungary in the United states and conservative governments that come to power in Chile and Argentina and by the way\nA and the ... government which I Would consider worse than the Trump Administration is probably going to be a implementing a series of extremely reactionary changes to the\nCountry which will see a decline in the standard of living of ordinary people working class people in addition to attacking\nThe environments are tearing up international agreements or do forests seeing the Amazon region and a\nChallenging the Democratic rights of eligibility community the women the black moving in Brazil all of which have been fighting for the last Thirty years for full a democratic rights in the

voted for ... that's former army captain praises the military dictatorship attacks gays attacks women on and I and then talk about the issues you explain that professor grain\nSo that there's no question that there is popular support from also NATO who seems to be the savior for the country who is going to offer simple solutions to very complex problems his solution to increase violence criminality is to arm all citizens\nOr his solution to a criticisms by human rights activists of the police excessive violence is to\nEliminate any investigations of a police when they go into a a community and shoot to kill\n'em in this regard I think immigrants people's left the country and other moments um fall into the category of those in Brazil who are listening to these ideas of both and I do have an\nThat they will solve very complex problems are with his simple solutions um the humidity is very diverse in this country I think there are a large number of Brazilians who have been very consistently supporting the fight\nFor democracy in Brazil that have been very vocal about they do remain a minority of the community in this in the United states\nAnd I'm Bruno uh thought too hot in terms of the racial and class implications of this election clearly under certainly under the workers' party for the first time indigenous people and\nAnd are afro Brazilians started to have more rights and more of a tension and services and affirmative action from the government what do you envision happening or under a under most NATO\n\nOr he didn't ah he's not the president a yet\nBut if you follow the less a couple of a couple of days here in Brazil there is a radio violent attacks on ... ... in a in a D. or Amazon\nAnd the fact is that this man made his political career I fighting\nA very strong and uh aspect of their president in history we changed the oppression of them I'm I'm Sorry 'cause I'm studying a lot the pressure on the\nUm uh\nThe minorities in the country\nAnd he unleashed he are out there lies the media Terry police in Brazil which is very uh I'm I'm ideological or to um act even if he's not getting the proper um\nOrder so it's going to be hard you know it's going to be hot it was ... or something that was in clear\nAnd these dark aspect of the Brazilian spirits ah won the election so um it's going to take a lot of a organization and a lot of support from the\nInternational community\nSo how are ...
