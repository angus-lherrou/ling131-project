completely devastated by this news the fact that this man is allow can do to to live a\nBoard is your understanding that you make a lot of money has to be on the side for a long that'll be good but I have to know what I'm going to do to make the money and I have a lot of ideas okay for you\n\nTo go to the bottom [noise] how about you said that you wouldn't be good to get some brothers together

jihad but they really need the money\nIn that show had Hussein and again to bring this back for people are just joining us now had Hussein who runs the prestige limousine service that was involved in this deadly car crash he was cited no worse\nAs for dangerous vehicles this one was not the best to be on the road and Scott hiring and it's the one that crashed killing all twenty all Seventeen people end up in the car and drive our as well as to um patches fine you're still talk about that in defending your clients and how they ended up in jail because\nThey just such Danny not so much of your clients they're clearly desperate and sometimes trying to get away from hand he's coming up with a plot all the time he shows in Senate on the shows that in the military base\nSo in the case here there were a lot of different ways we're ... we're we're compressed in time in a sense because it starts in um early two thousand and eight and it goes all the way the two thousand nine nine months of recruitment\nAnd during this done much crude and people are leaving to keep walking away they can't find people my client comes in the first time he appears on tape anywhere he says to shed by the way thanks for the job I really needed a job that they're very I'm here to do damage to the world a new job and I mean literally weeks on the street\nSo this persistence is what ultimately the FBI's allowed to use to say let's compress it all into one moment what do we have we have people saying in clips I'm here for the job what the trial was about was pulling back that that ... that that bandage that hides the actual wounds\nAnd the woman's wish I had the same doing whatever he wanted to do and that's the connection with the case here today it's not because he was an informant then and lives in that he somehow legally responsible for this it's because every day of his life and every minute he's ever had he's had no responsibilities for anything\nSo he comes in he lives about his immigration and it was the application for ... never punished he comes here and he creates a fraudulent business never punish he comes here and he does a bribery scandal the DMV and he's never partners to comes here in the lives of the trial up in Albany never punish becomes very files bankruptcy\nFertilizers bankruptcy application never punish comes your trial and then for this whole case here lies and every step of the trail exceeds his authority makes offers binds the FBI to things never punished at trial he lives on the stand but man turns the jury and says this matter\nFiring never held accountable for the governments then it says you're doing a great job and the terror case in other cases he's done and now with this so the timeline is for all of us to watch this to say he's never been held accountable in his life for anything\nSo what does he learned from that he learned sociopathic the ability to say without remorse without any concern without any hesitation or do whatever I Want so if I Want this truck on the road that goes on the road and who says no you may know we're still paying the salary he's making hundreds of thousands of dollars doesn't pay taxes on it he lives in Tibet felony crime\nAnd I mean sometimes you don't pay taxes on the government's pays the money you mean the FBI here in\nOur trial came out that he got sixty six thousand dollars and the year before a trial to pay taxes on that money to gift so what does he learned he learned to do anything he wants he goes to Pakistan wherever he is who knows if he's actually there when the sun is yours dinner for\nMaybe his son takes the beating for um I don't know when did you mean who knows who knows she comes and goes as he pleases\nHave you ever been to JFK and see the line to get it out of JFK do you think he stands on that line he doesn't he just disappears with during the trial he disappeared during the trial came back nobody says we know where he is the FBI agent handler who's on trial on the stand so as you go to follow them in Pakistan no ice and\nHow do you know he's not actually a terrorist maybe he's the actual terrorists\nThere isn't isn't there a question of when he first came to United States from Pakistan ... murder\nCharge show he says right we don't even have proof of that but he absolutely said that he was a victim of an unlawful arrest and all these other effects we have no proof that that is true and the FBI never offer proof that was true the only thing we know that the FBI is they said about the foreign the trial\nThey said in a letter and internal memoranda said we know these guys are totally incapable of an operation with out our informant\nI Want to go to a comments that have been made a statement that an issue and by ... groups in the U.S or the Muslim selling attacking committee project Saddam and the coalition for cattle feed and issued a statement about her than saying quote the limousine company is a ...\nBecause to hit on this road of calamity\nShy sense of debt to justice has not been paid the years spent in prison and the years still to serve for the phony crimes that has an engineer for the FBI cannot be recovered for the men he put away\nAnd the terrible irony of a felon convicted as part of a DMV scan who's now responsible for the faulty operation of a vehicle that killed twenty innocent people\nIs not lost on us so a lyric ... could you respond to that and also say um what you'll recall from whose sense test too many uh you said that in fact you thought he was taking a direction from the FBI\nThough one of the things that has always troubled me about Hussein in response to the project slum statement on earth that she just read is going back to his initial charge which was the and the fraud um you know the FBI always says FBI's argument is that it needs a criminal to catch a criminal\nBut going back to that actual ads which was in the ... I Believe it was in ... in the early to thousands\nI my question is why does sci choose to hire this individual because that very act\nUm which for which they could have prosecuted him and put him in jail\nIs ultimately what kill these people on the fraud getting vehicles actually the ... what he was convicted of what he should have been convicted of what the FBI knew that he was doing was helping people to receive driver's licenses illegally\nAnd his son in this accident than not have a license to drive the vehicle so I ... I I have not heard much scrutiny around the FBI 'em to date I've not heard the bureau make a statement about its informant but I actually question the bureau really and why why they chose employ this individual after knowing his capability around these ...\nLyric I'm you spoke to the mother of David Williams' one of the new broke for I think they're in jail what for twenty five years when she learned if that's terrific car crash that involves the men who ended up getting her son and prison what did she tell you\nI'm Elizabeth ... Williams was just horrified um you know she legally\nIf she was just wondering like any mother would she still trying to get her son out of jail um she understand that in this but you know the injustice occurred so I think her first response with a legal one I'm going back to sort of the point that I spoke on um is there any way that that the I can be held accountable for this man now that it's clear\nUm that the original crime when they hired him is what killed these people all of them at least so she's wondering how this current event might impact her son shards might impact David I'm freedom\nAnd the last ten seconds your response embrace I'm sure when you heard what happened in ...\nYou know it's more the same for this young man a machine does whatever he wants to do throughout his life that it's not just that there are so she passed among us because there are it's what our government tolerates the sort of craziness\nLike the last story both Scott the governor in Florida will just tolerate the nonsense let's duck ... and harden soon if your heart and said about the environment Heiden said about justice if you're hiding soon about all the issues are important to us\nWhy do we ever think we should be credited give the bottom line is the the wrapped their arms around a lawyer and here's the IRS would report more to explode\nAnd as Michael German said and a remarkable film or by David Hall Brunner a the HBO film the uh the Newberg staying quoting Michael German an FBI agent uh ... after nine one one after nine eleven uh\nHis colleagues at the FBI were saying you know the rules no longer apply and he was walking around saying what are you talking about", "year": "2018", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "city": "Madison", "day": "11"}
