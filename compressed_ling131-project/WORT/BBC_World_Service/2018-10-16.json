Garcia Marquez without the hyphen then that registration is kicked out and it's put in this kind of limbo status and because\nUm things like a a hyphen or accent mark or a Y. instead of an eye those kinds of things immediately began to go after the names um for African Americans for Hispanics and Asians this is why you're seeing that kind of\nDissed proportional disproportionate um\nElimination of these registration cards it it's it's as pernicious as Kris Kobach cross check [noise]\nAnd this whole issue of having one of the candidates for the seat also be in charge of oversee the election process so could you talk about that as well\nYes and so I imagine this year you're playing a game where you're trying to win but you're also the referee and so you get to choose when a foul has been called anybody would look at that and say wait a minute that game is cute\nAnd that's what's happening here integrity would require Brian Kemp to recuse himself to step down as secretary of state in this kind of high profile election instead he has not and so we see things going on like prior to this\nUm we had the ... they're trying to shut down the polling places in a majority or\nA majority African American counties or county that has a sizable black population so like in Randolph county um where one of camps allies try to you know recommended that seven of nine polling stations shut down\nUm before the general election I mean that kind of interference that kind of skewed\nI'm I'm a decision making\nIs what is what Stacey Abrams is talking about when she says that it is calling into question the legitimacy of the election is calling into question legitimacy of our electoral processes and so a secretary of state\nThat is the bedrock foundation of his role is to ensure the integrity of the election process sitting on top of this one undermines that\nBrian Kemp the secretary of state and the Republican candidate for governor ... Sunday my opponent is unapologetically extreme she's banking on illegal immigrants to secure a victory for her at the ballot box professor Allison\nYes and and so that is campus so much like Kris Kobach out of Kansas I'm you know Kobach has been writing that lie of I'm a non citizen voting and math I'm skewing the elections in Kansas and only he can block them\nAnd so and by raising the flag of illegal immigrants it is playing to a racist trope um that in the body politic that these immigrants are going to somehow steal our elections\nBut he cannot point to note saying the same way that Kris Kobach could not point to all of these illegal immigrants um it is a fiction it is a lie it is a myth that as being used\nTo stir up fear and to justify the kind of unwarranted voter suppression techniques that the secretaries of state like Brian temp and Kris Kobach are using\nLike to go back to this whole issue of will do the closing of polling places or most people who really don't pay attention to what happens in polling places all of them there's\nA and could you talk about the impact on voter turnout of all of sudden or either closings avoiding places or shifting the ... voting place would from one location\n[noise] to another just before an election\nOh absolutely I'm so one of the things to to pay attention to is that after the Supreme Court got at the voting rights act with the Shelby County beholder decision and twenty Thirteen\nBy the time we got to the twenty sixteen election states that had been under pre clearance and that is where because of their history of racial discrimination at the polls they had to have all of their voting rights voting changes may or approved by the department of justice\nAfter the voting rights was got it eight hundred and sixty eight polling places were shutting down by the time we got to the twenty sixteen election\nBrian camp has been responsible for two hundred and fourteen of those polling places being shut down\nWhat the research shows is that for every tenth of a mile that a polling place is removed from the African American community black voter turnout goes down by point five percent so the more you move these polling places\nThe further and further the more and more you're able to depress the black voter turnout\nSo we had a an instance in Sparta\nWhere a under the guise of being fiscally responsible they were going to consolidate the polling stations well when they consolidated the polling stations\nBut one for the black community and I can say the black community because we do have residential segregation in the United states so for the one in the black community that one was moved Seventeen miles away\nNow think about that\nFor trying to vote and what we also know\nIs that many in the African American community do not have a\nCars they don't have personal transportation so they have to rely upon public transportation so when you move a polling place further and further away from the black community by that very moment that very instance is designed to the press the black voter turnout\nIn June democracy now spoke with Stacey Abrams a democratic candidate for governor in Georgia\nVery Kim\nHas unfortunately built a very strong record a voter suppression and yes he and I have to leave a conflict at a number of times and I think I'm I'm very well I'm not I don't think I Know I'm very proud of our record of beating him of forcing him to restore the cancelled registrations of thousands of\nCompelling his office to do the right thing when it comes to voter registration but also I think it's a challenging conversation to have both\nWith secretary cans and with lieutenant governor cable because rather than focusing on how we move the state forward they've both focus unfortunately on quieter forum of bigotry and how they want to harm communities and hold us back\nSo that Stacey Abrams speaking ... about her opponent churches secretary of state Brian Kemp in Georgia lieutenant governor Casey Cagle I also want it to turn to the Republican Senator David Perdue of Georgia and who was captured on video Saturday as he snatched\nA cell phone out of the hands of a constituent\nWho asked about Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp who Purdue was stumping for senator Purdue is on the campus of Georgia Tech in Atlanta\nWhen a student tried to ask him about his endorsement\nSo ah how can you endorse a candidate to Robert Robert is one of the owner of the reason why\nSenator Purdue return the phone after student demanded it back on Sunday produce office called the incident a misunderstanding saying the senator thought the student wants to take a selfie with him\nI'm\nA professor understand if you could comment on this and as we wrap up this discussion about Georgia who is voting right now I mean in some states there's no voting taking place but what's happening in Georgia\nSo first on I'm senator per do you remember senator Purdue is the one who opened a one of those Christian breakfast is um but\nThey're praying for Obama's death by saying you know make your life be ended short you know quoting us a song\nAnd you know may your wife be left I'm a widow and your children homeless and beggars so this is Senator David Perdue um and and Stacey Abrams is actually right that the the language that we're getting from\nI'm Brian Kemp and Casey cable has been the language of fear\nHas been the language of stoking um um racial animosity racial anxiety ah and and bigotry and sold and they're they're selling fear as as they're as their component for why they shouldn't be in office\nAnd so what we're seeing right now is that we have early voting going on 'em and the\nThe I I'm not sure how how risk it has been yet but I Know that um the grassroots organizations had been very active and getting people registered to vote getting people out to vote and because Stacey Abrams in ...\nAnd I want to turn to a map of the country on and talk about it with the states to states in the country which everyone including people with felony convictions are allowed to ...\nMaine and Vermont you can vote from jail on in the strictest states Florida Virginia or Kentucky in Iowa all people with felony convictions or permanently disenfranchised\nFlorida has the highest number as has been said if a disenfranchised voters want to point four million adults in the state can't vote\nOr because of having a felony conviction send me in this bipartisan a coalition that has formed talk about what it's like to work with these different groups and what are the polls indicate for November\nFirst of all we don't even call us of the bipartisan movement\nWe are organic grassroots movement that welcomes and enjoys bipartisan support we're not leading where the partisan nature of uh of this topic or the issue of voting what we're leading with is the human nature\nYou know that they're real people's lives who are impacted by these policies and because of that we've been able to first of all recognize\nThat that selling disenfranchisement now impacts people from all walks of life which now allows us to go into communities in rural parts of Florida in urban parts of Florida and have real conversations with real people and really connect with the pain that their food\nBecause of that because of that what we've seen is indicative of what we're seeing now with the hurricane relief efforts that we've always seen that in the aftermath of a hurricane no one cares how the ... votes\nIt no one cares how much money they made only thing they see is another human being and need and that's a beautiful part of this campaign that we haven't brace and we all onto for dear life because at the end we are organizing folks along the lines of humanity\nAnd because of that we've been able to get people that that that that that throw off their part of the same clothes and come together as brothers and sisters are in this movement as Americans that's rallying around each other and knowing that what's that his faith it's paid so we can have a organizations like the tax watts\nChristian Coalition freedom partners that stand up and say you know what\nIt is time to bring second chances back to the state of Florida and\nThey could do that alongside the ACLU a organizations like Advancement Project I'm I'm alliance for safety and justice and for all the rights restoration coalition\nThat is to me the most beautiful thing that we're witnessing hair I Believe that we are becoming a shining light for the rest of the country about what's good when people can elevate themselves above partisan bickering above racial discord\nAnd connect along the lines of humanity for the good of all people\nAre I'd like to move from Florida to another uh another state that's also a scene of a disproportionate targeting a racial minority in the Supreme Court has ruled that will allow the state of North Dakota\nTo enforce a new voter id requirement that will make it harder for Native Americans to vote during the mid term elections\nThe state's new voter id law requires voters to show identification that demonstrates a residential street address but this has already rented many tribal IDs and violence since many Native Americans who live on reservations depend on post office boxes to receive their mail\nOr the law could make a big difference in the close race between\nDemocratic senator Heidi Heitkamp and Republican challenger Kevin Cramer or the races expected to help decide who controls the Senate you talk about that as well\nSo the north Dakota voter id law has flown under the radar relative to\nGeorgia but it's just a serious because the way this Republican voter id law is written is that most tribal ideas are not going to be accepted because they do not have a residential address in them\nMany Native Americans live in rural areas on reservations they don't have address as they get their mail at the post office there's nothing wrong with that but this ... written to not allow PO box is count as an address\nSo what's happening now in North Dakota is that sounds of Native Americans could be disenfranchised by this Republican voter id law according to federal court statistics twenty percent\nOf eligible Native American voters don't have the correct I D\nAnd that means about five thousand Native American voters might not be able to vote in the next election and there were running out of time\nTo try to get them the correct ideas right now I mean we're basically twenty days away from the election and\nHeidi Heitkamp only won her first race for the Senate by three thousand votes with strong NATO support now you're talking about a much larger percentage of Native Americans who could be disenfranchised so this one voter id law in North Dakota could cost ... percent sea and could cost\nDemocrats control of the Senate so it's a very very serious situation we're also talking about the most historically disenfranchised group in this country who faces all sorts of barriers today and now thirty days before the election they find out they might not be able to vote in a critical midterm election it's absolutely shocking an appalling was half an hour it's a kind of it's\nAlso particularly interesting that this is happening at a time as a Trump continually attacking a Senator Elizabeth Warren are trying to use the word Pocahontas the name Pocahontas as a pejorative to describe her she has now gone and gotten a DNA test which she says from us Stanford professor\nThat say she has Native American lineage an ancestry as she looks like she's about to announce her bed for twenty twenty a presidential uh for the ... presidential election\nJust imagine Amy is voter suppression North Dakota got a fraction of the attention of Elizabeth Warren's DNA test or Donald Trump's Pocahontas slurs and I think what we should be focusing on instead of her ancestry is all the barriers that are being faced\nNative Americans in this country you can go down every single statistic\nAnd you see the problems but particularly with voting there was a long history of disenfranchising Native American voters of making polling places very inaccessible of gerrymandering district so they don't have representation\nAnd now right before an election a new voter ID laws put into place that could disenfranchise thousands of native voters to me this is absolutely outrageous it's on America and and the fact that this election North Dakota\nIs tainted by voters depression you can't reverse it and so right now people have to do everything they can to get Native Americans so that they can get the idea is they need to vote for this law was specifically written it's very very clear to disenfranchise native\nAmerican writers and an hour and what are the ... in terms of the fact that we're only weeks away from the mid term elections clearly\nThe Florida referendum or whatever happens there will only take effect for the next elections but what can be done now in Georgia and in North Dakota or to be able to have some ... I have a\nHave these folks have their right to vote on before this election\nIn Georgia there is a lawsuit filed the to allow the pending registrations to go through even if you are on pending registration you can show up and vote with an idea at the polls so it's very foreign people know that they can vote in North Dakota the tribal authorities are going to have\nBasically a temporary IDs they're going to give people a letter saying they have an address poll workers are supposed to accept that but we have to be very very vigilant here and that's why issues like election protection are going to be so important 'cause I'm extremely worried people are going to show up in Georgia they're going to show up in North Dakota they might even have\nThe right documents and election workers won't be able to won't won't tell them that they are able to vote\nAnd I'm a ... ballot initiatives that have um that will change the restrictions and other parts of the country\nThis is huge because there's a ballot initiatives in seven states that would dramatically expand voting rights restoring voting rights ex felons in Florida to making it easier to register to vote in Michigan Nevada\nTo cracking down on gerrymandering and places like Colorado and Utah and so despite all the focus on voter suppression there is an opportunity to dramatically expand voting rights\nTwenty Eighteen and there is the best opportunity in a decade to make it easier to vote for millions of people so I think that while all the focus is on suppression and twenty Eighteen the landscape for voting rights could look dramatically different in twenty twenty if all of these ballot initiatives paths or even if some of them just passed and twenty Eighteen\nWell we want to thank you both for being with us Ari Berman of Mother Jones linked here pieces and Desmond made as a Florida writes restoration coalition Desmond I'll see you on Saturday Night in Melbourne, Florida at the Gleason performing arts center at will be doing a\nPublic conversation about this a groundbreaking amendment that has been proposed in Florida and then meant for when we come back we continue our conversation with Carol Anderson author of one person no vote stay with us\nW all our teeth thinks it's listeners sponsors and community shares of Wisconsin community shares and its member groups envision a future where we all have clean water and air all neighbors have family supporting jobs and ... communities in Wisconsin are safe healthy and thriving\nGifts may be made to community shares and its many members nonprofits including W.
