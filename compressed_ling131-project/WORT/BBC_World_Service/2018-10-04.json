um first I mean this is a massive piece which has been reissued on Sunday is that right by the New York times many page piece on headline Trump took part in suspects schemes to invade tax bills talk about how you found this information and what were your key findings David\nI'm well first how we found it was kind of the old fashioned question was um [noise]\nAre going to courthouses um scouring a public records a knocking on a lot of doors and gradually over many months piecing together billing this trove of documents I'm a\nI'm a over a hundred thousand pages\nI'm by the time we were I'm ready to publish\nUm and and I think most significant when I'm In terms of been for people to be able to assess the store\nI'm it's important to know the um this includes literally tens of thousands of pages of never before seen documentation of the actual inner workings of for Trump's real estate empire\nThose documents if I could just interrupt me think those were confidential record so you don't have gotten those from the public you know you want to give those by knocking on a lot of doors doors that you know\nI'm not going to attract [laughter] should try [laughter]\nMajor financial like Kelly what you say in legal transfer of wealth\nSo I think there's two corps findings one is simply that\nThe the the narrative that Donald Trump has sold to the public for many decades now the thing that made him famous that gave him political\nPower and that ultimately I think was the central focus of his presidential campaign has this narrative that he is a self made billionaire\nAnd what this story really reveals is the extent to which that just simply doesn't square with the facts um that are uncovered and and that we show in this um stores that sort of I think point number one point number two is\nNot only did she receive four hundred and Thirteen million dollars from his father not only did he receive another hundred and forty million in today's dollars in loans from his father but that that amount the amount of money was significantly increased by a series\nOf tax schemes that\nThe tax experts that we consulted within our reporting laying out to them said this these things go way beyond the normal tax avoidance strategies that wealthy sophisticated I'm a people will will employ in any event to lower their tax bill and these were\nIs this was a set of of maneuvers that were actually intended\nTo deceive the IRS about the value of things that were being given from Fred in Mary Trump to Donald Trump and his siblings\nAnd I think those are the two main points that\nYou know there's a huge amount of money flowing not just when he was a young man but actually throughout Donald Trump's life especially when he was in a financial difficulties especially when he was taking on new projects um and that that river of ...\nWell they were both very much so but it was gorgeous tax evasion and tax Dodgers and we're going to find out just what those were were speaking to three times Pulitzer Prize winning journalist\nDavid Barstow who's just been attacked by the White House for this massive experts say in New York Times about how Donald Trump I gained his well stay with us [noise]\n\nJobs in it [laughter]\nTry\nNot to\n\nThese days\nThe the\nTo\nThat called old men\nTrump um the song was written but never recorded by Woody Guthrie again by Ryan Harvey Anita Franklin Tom morale oh\nI'm yes a Woody Guthrie never recorded it but it's about his landlord Donald Trump's father Fred Trump\nIn the Nineteen fifties Trump believed in the Trump on on a Woody Guthrie lived in a Trump owned apartment building in Brooklyn that says democracy now democracy now ... war the war and peace report I mean he good with their means shape\nThe New York times experts say on Trump's track tax ... to the ...\nWhat kinds of reference several reporter who did groundbreaking lock on Trump sign on for\nOne of them with the late Wayne ... who wrote the book ... the deal and the downfall he appeared on democracy now in June to have the sixteen and fat fat Trump financial support of Donald Trump with quote unbelievably crucial and Donald rise to prominence\nHe opened his first office in Manhattan the rent was paid by his father's company out here on avenue Z in Brooklyn and uh everything that he did when whether it'd be the grand Hyatt\nThe grand Hyatt for example to get the financing he got the financing from to banks that his father had used used his father's relationship banker\nAnd the father had to sign the financing agreement so I mean they're not going to give a thirty year old kid\nThirty five million dollars in Nineteen Seventy eight to build a hotel it has to be done with Fred's resources and Fred Trump\nWas a great outer borough builder and really built good housing twenty thousand units totally all over queens all over Brooklyn some of them ... hours like Trump Village many of them single family homes\nBut I Want it to go back to read from your point David Barstow you write the most overt fraud was all county building supplying maintenance that company\nFormed by the Trump family in Nineteen Ninety two all counties a sensible purpose was to be the purchasing agent for ... buying everything from boilers declining supplied it did no such thing records and interview show instead all counties safe and millions of dollars trying for Trump's empire by simply marking up purchases already made by his employees\nThose millions effectively on tax gifts and float all counties donors Donald Trump is siblings and a cousin fried shrimp then usa padded all county receipts to justify bigger rent increases for thousands of tenants state\nYeah um I mean this is something we're [laughter] um when Donald Trump says this is old news I can tell you that the\nNo one had ever heard of all Tony building supply and maintenance it's never been written about describes anywhere um and this is actually a kind of a remarkable and aware that were we were when we were peeling back to wears on this\nThat felt it was like\nOne of these sort of gritty scams that you might see in the Sopranos rough it's [laughter] it's setting up this company\nTo make um basically it's huge cash gifts from ...\nTo his children look like legitimate business transactions let me give you a just a really simple examples is one that we describe and we actually show in the story the actual invoices and purchase order so you can also see for yourself exactly what I'm Talking about sort of they set up this company all Tony building supplying them and it's not a real company\nThere's no corporate officers it's actually headquartered in the basement of for Trump's ... a favorite nephew\nUm uh the owners\nOf all county building supply though we're ... for children and his nephew and off all that happened was so Fred ... anytime Fred Trump was going to improve his buildings um she had to buy stuff right\nAnd in this case as soon after they form this company they bought sixty boilers sixty big expensive boilers from a company in the Bronx\nFred Trump himself personally negotiated the purchase price of these boilers\nHundreds of thousands of dollars worth of boilers\nThe man who sold Fred Trump these boilers Leon these men I'm told me in an interview that one day he comes back to his office so there's an envelope and as a check huge check from this company all county building supply say who the heck are these guys\nNever heard of them didn't know who they were\nAnd what that was was it was all county building supply was paying him the price that Fred Trump had negotiated but then all county building supply would turn around\nAnd would send an envoy to Fred Trump for the very same boilers but the invoices padded marked up twenty thirty fifty percent more\nSo all it was doing it was basically it is just a a a a a invoice having operation it was taking the things that for Trump was already buying\nAdding twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred percent more and then charging Fred Trump Trump was effectively overcharging himself that's what what it looked like on paper but in fact all of those profits are then slowing directly to his children that's point number one\nAnd a child Donald Trump says like forty\nAbsolutely absolutely this is part of a fairly well considered an orchestrated strategy that the Trump family came up with when they realize you know we said Trump is he's getting up there in age she's starting to suffer some ill effects dementia other problems and they're real\nI think if he dies\nAll of this empire all of the buildings and ... and huge amounts of cash sitting in his accounts those are going to be subject to uh fifty five percent tax uh inheritance tax\nAnd so the idea was well wait a minute how do we how do we get how do we pull that cash out of the empire before it gets taxed fifty five percent how do we shift all those buildings into our pockets before they get tax fifty five percent\nAnd in this case I think one of the things you know all county building supply case\nThe ... and I think it it it helps you sort of see at least the mindset here is not only do they come up with this ruse basically\nTo disguise cash gifts was legitimate business transactions but then they submitted those padded any voices to the state regulators who govern uh rent increases in New York\nAnd they use those ... invoices in order to justify rent increases for thousands of the tenants who lived in in ... uh uh apartments mostly we're talking I'm ... you know these are working class middle class folks\nWho we're seeing are rents go up you know five ten Fifteen dollars a month in part because of these inflated and voices from all county building supply and maintenance\nAnd can you speak ... about the safety ... mind and and in Brooklyn which ... Maine and investment in in the Nineteen seventies\nSo yes so um so ... serious really one of the largest federally subsidized um uh housing developments in the in the country it's ... massive it's even bigger than ...\nUm apartment complexes and and in the seventies when they were trying to build ... city\nThey needed some extra money are looking for private investors who is basically going to be this investment that would create ... huge tax law says that's why rich people wanted to get in on stare at city it was crazy\nHuge tax losses so Fred Trump to use his losses at stare at city to shelter all of his profits from his empire so he made an investment into stare at city but he also made an investment for his kids as well\nAnd so Donald Trump starting at a very early age was getting these huge tax breaks from stare city in fact those tax breaks\nHelp them avoid paying any federal income taxes at all in the late Nineteen seventies\nAnd uh and then and then of course as as time progresses stairs to me is now worth a heck of a lot of money it recently sold for nearly a billion dollars and in fact that investment that Fred Trump made way back in the seventies\nIs going to give Donald Trump a windfall of sixteen million dollars this year\nBefore we go to Frank how much money you save French translated in taxes\nHundreds of millions of dollars hundreds of millions of dollars\nAnd this and I think he's had fifty million and standing there\nWere so yeah I mean here it's pretty simple pretty simple math right the way we see that he transferred well over a billion dollars in wealth to his uh his siblings\nFifty five percent tax rate Syria talking about a tax bill unexpected tax bill around five hundred and fifty million dollars the tax records that we obtained\nShow that the Trump family paid fifty two million in a in gift in estate taxes so rather than paying fifty five percent tax rate they paid about five percent tax rate\nQuestion then is how did they avoid the other five hundred million dollars what happened to that\nUm first of all just to be clear not all of that we're not we certainly don't say in the store and we don't we don't allege anywhere that every penny of that was invaded money some of it was just usual tax avoidance measures that are rich people use\nBut certainly a very significant portion of that came through tax schemes and maneuvers that the experts that we consulted with said really cross the line\nThen come back to this discussion what was illegal what was improper David ... three consulates are present investigative reporter lead reporter on this massive\nThirteen thousand word peace investigating a Donald Trump's wealth and where it came from the title Trump's\nEngaged in suspect tax\nSchemes that she ripped riches from his father is democracy now back with the Barstow in a moment\nSupport for W T comes from greater Madison vision a ten minute survey gathering public input on regional gross the survey shows possible futures for the region and explore social technological an environmental changes the survey is at greater Madison vision dot com\n\nW O R G things that the listeners sponsors and five nights a locally owned cloud service provider of enterprise level IT infrastructure consulting hosting and management services on the Web at five nights dot com so number five one to one thousand the\n[noise] Mm\nAnd the good old [noise] and and all around [noise]\nOh\nBryan times by Roberta flashes his democracy now I'm Amy Goodman within their means shape our gas for the hour is the three time Pulitzer Prize winning journalist David Barstow did a massive exposition and the New York times this week that's going to be re issued on Sunday", "year": "2018", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "city": "Madison", "day": "04"}
