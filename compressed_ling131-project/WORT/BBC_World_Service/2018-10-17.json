thing that's wasn't actually inside\nAnd then they claimed he left the twenty minutes after entering the acclaim that's was never substantiated by any sort of evidence the first bizarre\nThings to come out from the Saudi authorities was they claimed that this seven story building\nBehind me that has a dozens and dozens of CCTV cameras a insult around it wasn't recording\nOn a day which cost a lot of doubts as to what exactly happened a few days off dramatically from the ones missing the Turkish authorities released their CCTV footage of their cameras that are positioned outside the door of\nThe consulates which clearly established ... and so [noise]\nPutting the onus or responsibility on the Saudis to ah them prove that he existed they failed to do is on um officer that's we started getting some leaks and information from\nA source close to the investigation who are speaking on condition of anonymity and they established who else um on Saturday evening so roughly about four days off to\nSomebody and said that he had indeed been killed assassinated murdered inside they'd been released footage of um Fifteen Fifteen man hit squads that as you mentioned flew in early on that day and it included\nMembers of Saudi through a a a these security personnel Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman are members of the special forces of Saudi Arabia and most importantly it's included one of the kingdom's top forensic experts a man who is a price himself in his career as being one of the top of the experts\nIn Saudi Arabia they flew in the morning\nAs you mentioned on a several flights on the old flu outs bar two of them\nOn a a private jets are that are linked or are owned by a company linked to a also directly from Hama been among the Saudi royal court since then the evidence that the Turkish authorities have has been shared with\nUh the U.S intelligence community it seems that the Turks diplomatically speaking of been trying to uh walk a tightrope they were looking to get some sort of support from their allies in NATO as well as the Europeans there was a interestingly enough or comments that were made by the U.S intelligence community to\nSeveral American outfits where they described the evidence that they were showing by the Turks I truly shocking now for them to describe it considering that they are the intelligence community that were behind\nOr things like a prison as well as a Guantanamo and other a huge lead a distasteful let's say or outrageous\nIncidents goes a long way to show just how gruesome details all of\nThose recordings are if the U.S intelligence community saying ... ... it was shocked by what they saw\nUm the problem about this case where maybe what does a making gets so a significant as it's not just a case about a generous winter then was murdered there is so much more [noise]\nStates geopolitics diplomacy the future of Saudi Arabia in there I say the future of the middle east because up until now people were looking at the Saudi Arabia's future under\nCrown prince Mohammed bin Salman mind he uh through his very aggressive foreign policy in Yemen in Egypt and Libya and so forth\nAllied with uh the crown prince of ... have been dictating how things are moving in the Arab world if indeed\nThe Turks are able to prove beyond doubt that he is the one as they say a who or did the assassination which I'm officer okay if indeed the international community is to step up and maybe respond or should\nTo the uh to a crime of this magnitude well I'm not a it's an sleep\nOn the ignores the Vienna Convention in terms of what's diplomatic missions to be used for one the targets a journalist will not essentially a ... D member or a dismembered rather uh somebody while he was allegedly still alive\nThen that could very well the at least the hobbits a man's influence not necessarily vanish but at least slipped to a certain extent and I think in that's considering the a huge amounts of investments that the Trump Administration has made\nIn my I'm I've been talking about on the links its highest ah that is what may be making things or take a lot longer than they should in terms of wrapping up the criminal investigation and establishing what sorts of retribution or should be placed on the criminals behind\nWell Jamal I wanted to ask you specifically about to Turkish governments release of information it's been coming out sort of in dribs and drabs over the over the period of\nA sense could show she entered the of ah the consulate or wanted to ask you a first why they took so long to actually go in and investigate since they knew early on apparently\nUh that that a crime had been committed a and what do you think is behind the or the or the partial releases of information over this period of time\n\nThink Turkey's foreign policy establishment um\nIs under a lot of stress that has been before this when you look at the war in Syria when you look as are the DCCC crisis when you look at the courage of separatists and many many other issues the usa an order event I think they are not happy that this has landed on them\nI'm I'm they suddenly found that they are currently now being dragged into a confrontation with a Saudi Arabia with which although I'm papers and I live they don't really see eye to eye on several issues\nAre in the beginning it seemed that the Turks were trying to exhaust diplomatic a coffee doors\nBetween them and or avenues rather between them and we all are by trying to maybe get the Saudis to old enough to see what happens and therefore uh it wouldn't be seen so confrontational when that didn't happen\nThey started leaking bits here and there are to try maybe a gardener supports from other countries like the United states like a return in Germany and France\nIn order so that it doesn't mean a as what's not framed as a Turkish Saudi spots but more so and international outrage at swap Saudi Arabia I have done more interestingly I think the latest to leak that we were able to get or the late just two bits of information and we were able to get from\nThe attorney general's office the nights that his team enter the concept behind me and then later the details were the gruesome details of how to modify so she was a indeed murdered\nI think the timing is very important they came right off the Trump initially tried to flow to the idea that this was rogue elements that were behind this and therefore I think the a search warrant it should just missed out completely by showing\nWell how can it be a rogue elements if indeed it ah took place in a consulate studies or a diplomatic missions are under the direct order or control all the governments and secondly the details of this taking place\nWas done when Trump to try to maybe throw the idea that this was a somehow in a row corporation a an interrogation that went wrong and the fact that you would send your head all the expert at the fact that uh he was a Damascus will she was barely question there\nOh of course from a Muslim fuck descended upon by the special forces officers and a beats him and killed in the way he was with a a cost a lot of doubts on the idea that it was simply on some through and sort of goods or questioned him enough\nPeople didn't really listen to the orders that they were given over the the Turks themselves have a lot at stake here a lot just in the sense that they don't want to call this rift or fall out the circus economy has been suffering quite a bit recently uh they've been trying to maybe make amends or a close relationship with\nWashington and we've seen ... and ... with the comments coming out of the Trump Administration following the release of\nThe pastor so like I say this is a case of got to do much more we've\nGeopolitics on ah the interests of power groups than it is about unfortunately just the the the case of freedom of expression and a journalist who's been assigned somebody to\nYour friends with a Janelle ... brother is that right you just saw him can you talk about how his family is responding right now what they're demanding\nBleach entering the building you wrote in your tweet you couldn't make this up literally minutes after Saudi authorities said Turkish investigators could enter the constantly cleaning team arrived to enter into the building\nAs we wrap explain the significance of this as President Trump says that the Saudi regime is conducting a thorough investigation\n\nThink um the way in which this operation ...\nUh happened on this is a very much a reflective of the policies we've seen of carbon some months so far it is essentially a excuse me to to put it in this way but it's a big two fingers up to the world\nWe can do whatever we want and nobody's going to do anything about it we sold out in the war in Yemen receipts everyday when you're bumping school buses and children and nothing happens we saw that's on the blockade them cathartic we saw that with the uh abductions over prime minister\nThe Lebanese prime minister was literally kidnapped\nAnd nothing happens so as far as the Saudis are concerned in the beginning they told you know what we're going to get away with it when that starts maybe puts a bit of a ... a or pressure on them and they said okay would allow the investigators to come before the investigators in front of the world\nThey were like okay we're going to clean up or we can clean up I mean obviously in the end of the day the people will say well you know you can't really clean it up or why would you do that\nAll of this or many days and so forth but it's about the message that you can reach any\nUh opponents are critical voice in any country whenever you want and nobody's going to punish the regime for it and even if they do catch the regime they can do what they want a a as a result I mean you would think that's an active crime scene even people walking in sort of forget about cleaners that in itself will be something that was ...\nFor everything for the fact that that was a lot of talking in front of the cameras speaks more to the breeze\nFrom New York Times reports for the fifteenth Saudi men implicated in the killing or directly linked to crown prince Mohammed bin Salman security for more we're joined here in New York by ... investigative reporter who's been reporting from Saudi Arabia\nWith the ... Center for crisis reporting her latest piece for the intercept headlined Jamal ... she wasn't the first Saudi Arabia has been going after dissidents abroad for decades um\nIt's great to have you with us Sarah I'm we were just speaking with ... a shy out if you can add to what she was saying what you think it's important for people to understand at this point many wondering why President Trump is doing PR work for the Saudi regime\nOr even before they say publicly he says maybe it's rogue elements when we're talking about an official government building in\nSaudi Arabia I mean in a turkey the sorting consulate a show she disappearing they're October second with his fiance standing outside for hours waiting for him to come out and he never did for Saudi Arabia said he did walk out and now it's been two weeks and they've had to change their story\nSo that really well I think in many ways all the story is incredibly shocking and its details it's really just a different than degree rather than kind as far as what we've seen Saudi Arabia capable of doing\n'em over the years and particularly under the crown prince so on as a reporter pointed out many activists and journalists have found themselves silenced in one way or another or or placed under pressure even while abroad and on the latest developments with a ... D jays case have only further\nAnd reinforce the feeling that many activists and writers and students than on any everyday Saudi who maybe abroad feels that they're never quite beyond the reach of the Saudi Government and\nAs as their prayer privacy previous guests just mentioned um there's a mall was not even a dissident she was very clear on that well he was alive he was a reformer for a long time you with the loyalist than it was only in very recently by many didn't yeah yeah exactly for not ...\nI mean far enough he he wanted to even believe that my husband Solomon couldn't deliver on some of his promises early on 'em but it was only when he saw the crown prince taking actions that directly contradicted all the promises of reform and liberalization that he felt the need to step out so\nUm yeah we we see all of this before in in a sense and we I've spoken to many Saudis on\nWho have spent years abroad who who maybe like ... show J. put themselves in a self imposed exile on because they felt it was no longer safe for them to be speaking out or or writing on\nFreely within the kingdom but then on as some of ... on family experience some of their family might have been placed under house arrest under travel bans on\nThreatened or harassed by the government so there's none of this I'm In many ways this is not\nUm a departure for Saudi Arabia and I'm In the same same way you mentioned Trump's response unfortunately we've seen him very very willing to be flexible on the truth it changed his story to really not\nHonestly be um apparently looking for the truth but looking for a story that fit I'm as a justification for what he wants to do ...\nWill just been a lot of attention obviously in the world press to the the the right of women to be able to drive in Saudi Arabia under the crown prince been solved the border is the actual situation for dissidents women dog ... to Saudi Arabia to\nThank you for asking about that that's something I think that um we we on those with who are following the story this summer on or really confounded at the\nWorld's lack of response when Mohammed bin Salman made\nA lot of pomp and circumstance about finally giving women the right to drive up until this\nPast year on women in Saudi Arabia where the only woman on the planet who didn't have that right so it's very symbolic and it was a meaningful change for for many women on but the world was willing to ignore the fact that\nAt the same time Mohammed bin Salman was jailing the very women who had worked for years or decades calling for the right to drive among other human rights and rights for women on losing\nLula as he's ... says I'm among many others had tuna sassy some of the most prominent women activists some of them had to work in the seventies for equality um were jailed um without any real public charges or in the case of losing they'll have little\nGovernment propagate and rumors that they were foreign agents agents of ... thought um and\nAnd and explain the earth is brilliant piece over the summer about when the decision came down what they've been fighting for four years I sometimes getting behind the wheel being arrested when the decision came down they got calls I'm like a ... a flu\nI'm not to speak or to tweet about federally yeah\nLet's talk about ... for a second silly and Jane was in a losing was a prominent human rights activist and she was in ... when this announcement\nCame from ... from king Solomon um but as part of ... ... grants um agenda [noise]\nUm she was in Riyadh only because she had been abducted from the UAE he a few months before she was studying for her masters in ... and was arrested forced to return to Saudi Arabia placed under the travel ban not allowed to leave the country again and then a few months later on was arrested but before that when she was sitting at home watching the\nAnnouncement come down about women driving she knew about that as a from a few days prior when the royal court called her personally and told her to remain silent to not speak publicly even in praise of the of the new lifting of lifting of the ban as", "year": "2018", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "city": "Madison", "day": "17"}
