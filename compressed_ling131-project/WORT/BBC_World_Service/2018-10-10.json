the international criminal court if it went after Israel or the United states for war crimes\nAnd the U.S refused to sign the global compact on migration a set of non binding rules for safe orderly and regular migration well Nikki Haley did not say why she was resigning she dismissed speculation she'll be running for president in twenty twenty\nPresident Trump says he'll name a replacement in the coming weeks on Tuesday set his daughter Ivanka Trump would be incredible at the job as long as the Trump later tweeted that she would not be replacing Haley or the person who does replace sure we'll have to go before a Senate confirmation\nDonald Trump also said one possible candidate is Dina Powell and Egyptian born Goldman Sachs executive and Trump's former deputy national security

Arabia she attended President Trump's first meeting with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia\nUm had been some on NBC report she was also involved with overseeing a two hundred billion dollar arms deal between the U.S and Saudi Arabia\nTo talk about the significance of Nikki Haley's departure and the role of the United states at the United nations\nWe're joined now by Rashid Khalidi the Edward Said professor of Arab studies at Columbia University author of several books his most recent brokers of deceit how the U.S has undermined peace in the middle east his next book titled the Hundred Years' war on Palestine will be out in may\nProfessor welcome back to democracy now like you and your first response was a shock to you like to so many others\nThat was a surprise because she put such a a a a nice face an articulate but on a post who the horrific and then they were but [noise] um ... Iran when so many on so many ...\nOf what she was putting forward while perhaps red meat to the president's base is probably aboard the most of them\nAnd then has contrary to what she said maybe it's much more isolated internationally\nIt's also interesting that timing or maybe she just said I mean they were saying that it didn't they didn't want to look like after the midterm elections but they say that last\nWeek the resignation letter was put in which was right after I'm a judge Kavanaugh at the time testified during the FBI I suppose that investigation so I'm just say the least there was a lot of tension within\nThe Trump Administration around us um she didn't say anything about this at the time but of course if she ran in the future she could refer back to this period of time that she actually resigned\nRight into Disney or so from the president during the campaign by saying any allegations by women should ... should be heard and to be investigated so she's a very ambitious woman if she's planning Iran should Trump not run again in twenty twenty or twenty twenty four this sets up perfectly I mean it's it's perfectly that\nThe the ambitious calculating nature that she was already show at the un and in South Carolina I wanted to go\nBack to um [noise] what Nikki Haley said sitting next to President Trump and the White House\nUm about her relationship with both Trump's daughter Ivanka and son in law Jared Kushner during the news conference she's single then out for praise\nSyria is such a\nGenius that no one understands I mean to redo the NAFTA deal the way he did um what I've done working with him on the middle east peace of mind it is so unbelievably well done and an office and just a great friend and they do a lot of things behind\nThe scenes that I Wish more people knew about because we're a better country because they're in this administration\nThat was Nikki Haley again speaking in the oval office next to President Trump talking about Jared Kushner um this is your expert teacher a Palestinian American professor or the ad where it's I eat professor at Columbia University um talk about\nJared Kushner and what she described as his remarkable are incredible role in uh in dealing with the middle east\nWill you would only consider a remarkable if you think that denying that the Palestinians have a role that the Palestinian refugees should return or have any rights that under ... is a good thing that Jerusalem is the capital then should be a capital for Palestine\nUm the policies that she has put forward advocated so effectively and articulate lay uh our policies that are abhorrent to most of the world most of the Arab world many Israelis or realize that this is leading them down the path\nA to a situation where no compromise is possible where Israel becomes a the sole ruler of everything\nUm and Trump seems to be very content with those are the Palestinians are should accept whatever places offered to them in this process and that is what does with Christian or has been doing\nSystematically on Jerusalem on refugees on the idea of a Palestinian state um the dismantled all all the elements of what I've always considered a very bad American policy has become much worse a science to her so Jared Kushner is a genius\nIf you believe that Israel has one and can impose any terms at once on the Palestinians who should not have sovereignty self determination or statehood if you believe that and it's a wonderful balls\nOn may fourteen the Israeli military massacred at least sixty one unarmed Palestinians are wounded and that's one day twenty seven hundred more for protesting in God's against Israeli occupation in the opening of the new U.S embassy in Jerusalem\nAt the United nations US ambassador Nikki Haley blocked up call for an international investigation into Israel's actions\nI asked my colleagues here in the Security Council who among us would accept this type of activity on your border known one with no country in this chamber would act with more restraint then Israel has\nMarch thirty is the beginning of that right of return campaign protests on Israeli soldiers and\nSnipers have killed at least on an area of one hundred Ninety five Palestinians wounded more than Eighteen thousand your comments on what she performed at the United nation\nNo country on earth\nThat shot thousands of people on the other side of its border in a situation in which none of its own citizens were hurt one Israeli soldier actually was killed\nBut without exception would be would be free of condemnation in the United nations imagine if the United states shot down hundreds of Mexicans killed two hundred\nAnd wounded or maimed thousands across the border inside Mexico in the sovereign territory of another country it would be completely unacceptable the Palestinians clearly don't have rights that can be the victim can be vilified by people like Nikki Haley the it's it's revolting\nThe very the very the very description of the Palestinians as the aggressors and the Israelis as a victim Israeli snipers are targeting these people one by one\nAnd the Israelis are being defended by Nikki Haley at the United nations\nJust before the U.N General assembly denounced Washington's decision to move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem\nA new U.S um ambassador\nHaley tweeted a warning to other nations she wrote quote at the un were always has\nTo do more and more so when we make a decision at the will of the American people about where to locate are and say we don't expect that at least we helped to target us on Thursday there'll be a vote criticizing our choice they us we'll be taking names the ambassador famously said professor housing\nI mean this is the most vibrant expression of American exceptionalism I've I've ever heard um United States is not bound by laws the United states is not bound by conventions the United states does exactly as it pleases the issue of Jerusalem is a complicated legal issue but it's not that complicated\nEverything United States has done his credit uh seven decades or in fact a little more of international consensus uh as far as the treatment of Jerusalem and they don't care a lot of the United states under Trump to the United states has always done more or less as it pleases but at least it paid lip service to to to\nLaw an international legitimacy not under this administration\nOutgoing US ambassador to the United nations Nikki Haley um a lot has to say the least Ben whatever's happening behind the scenes in lockstep with uh the administration she announced in June\nOr that the United states was withdrawing from the un human rights council accusing the council's being biased against Israel\nFor too long to human rights council has been a protector of human rights abusers and assess full of political bias regrettably it is now clear that our call for reform was not heeded\nThe significance of this well you're in the United states is is claiming that only its views count them the views of the entire world on these issues um or or or simply irrelevant as far as this moves ration is concerned the United states has run interference Israel protecting in the United nations\nOf for decades now um and I expect that to continue a irrespective of whether Trump stays on after twenty twenty unfortunately but this is the most egregious example this I've ever seen\nThan some dissident who was disappeared and stumble\nUm or the hundreds of thousands of Yemenis who are dying of diseases like Colorado that are completely treatable because of the siege are imposed by the side of ... and ... and their allies in Yemen are these things are obviously unimportant in Washington or one would wish that are supplying senators and our sue pine members of the house of representatives\nWere represent we'd get up on her hind legs they could actually affect us at the Trump Administration will but they could uh and this is ... this is getting more and more agree just I don't know how much longer um people are going to be able to stand the stench\nOf this kind of absolute monarchy or imposing itself in stamping out all kinds of about basic freedoms while offering you know basic basically token reforms\nIt's wonderful that women can drive there'll be great if women could open their mouths it's wonderful people can go to send them us it would be great if they could freely buy books and talk and have newspapers which don't reflect the kings and the crown prince his point of view\nThat's freedom um and that's what's being denied to the side of these and what Saudi Arabia and its allies are are doing all over the region or in every country in which they're exerting influence they're not working for democracy there working against democracy\nAgainst constitutions against representative\nGovernment at working with the United states for example ... hand in glove with the United states is helping them target in Yemen United States has refueling in Yemen United States is in his hand in glove and everything they do\nMaybe not in his disappearance um but the United states has been since Nineteen thirty three it's the longest relationship the United states has in the middle east before Israel was even established before turkey joining NATO the United states and Saudi Arabia where like this very very close and that relationship has not really changed one bit since then\nI mean a tank and machine holiday and let's say it for cash\nThe Arab studies at Columbia University the author of a number of books his most recent brokers of deceit how the U.S has undermined peace in the middle east is next book the Hundred Years' war on Palestine will be out in may but says democracy now when we come back we had to Minnesota\nTo the valve Turner's will join us in Studio they were just acquitted and we'll speak with climate scientists James Hansen who had hoped to testify at the trial will talk to him
