why don't you begin by first describing your response to what is known at this point about what happened to the Washington Post columnist I'm Jim al ... and then the circumstances under which you talked to him and what he said to you\n\nWhat happened to John ... is a barbaric evil\nAct of terrorism by planted\nOrchestrated by a regime that wanted to silence him they saw him as a trade there they saw him as a slave as they see all their citizens ... sell them on the crown prince ... his own citizens of this\nThere his subjects that he can do whatever he wants it can take of their lives and around him\nThere is an size or who've been actually a very vocal about reactivating an assassination plan\nTo go after ... every critic of this crown prince to this crown prince has felt that Jamal betray the royal followed ... actually advised word for the royal family for many years\nAnd then was banned from tweeting or writing last year so Jamal decided to leave the country because he ... he thought that they were going to go after him as they did with many other intellectuals critics journalist lawyers human rights activists\nSo he left the country and he came to America so he ... his word and his right they can continue and he could\nContinue to be the intellectual that she is in America he thought that he was safe however he felt that he was being pressured between now and then he received in March last year and a letter from a Saudi prince who's telling him come back\nCome back actually published that left her and that's out at prince was arrested and probably beaten up and tortured that's widely ... he was telling ... miles comeback\nBuild together with us this force a Saudi state this crown prince is that a former within twenty four hours this same mind was arrested and Jamal tweeted say if a prince can pay one billion dollars to be released from jail how much money\nAnd the prisoner of conscious and a critic need to pay for the crown prince will be released from jail and I think it was a moment when the crown prince came to America\nAnd wanted to appeal to the American elite and the media especially in Silicon valley and Hollywood and he wanted to dine on line with them and many fell for his share rate and this is one ... criticism became even much more important I interviewed Jim mile [noise]\nBecause I did a cover story in September the ... about ... we were trying to expose the true face and she'll American the American audience\nAnd especially lawmakers who were celebrating this man\nOn sixty minutes that this huge ever thought about this crown prince and they even went as far as saying that he is a new face and his former calling him that for rent is like calling David do civil rights activists it's it's ... it's outrageous so I did discover story I interview John uh for one hour\nAnd we talked about everything and I remember we were both shaken by the fact that this crown prince went as far as kidnapping a prime minister of Lebanon ... he lord him and he summoned him and then kidnapped him and arrested him and forced him to resign and it was an attack them\nTo turn their reaction by the Lebanese so he can use the Lebanese reaction ... reaction to go into war against Iran\nYou said in that interview that he gave me he said our only hope is the international community are only hope to save the Saudis and
