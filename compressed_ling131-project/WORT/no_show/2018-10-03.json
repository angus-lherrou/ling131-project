I just want us you know I said I I Want model very of a tough sell at a high school a little bit yeah um and just to explore the wonderful work painting of that era\nAnd I wanted to split the groups because with larger groups or I can find that sometimes that style of music just gets a little heavy right um so in my mind a renaissance music I I just see a smaller group doing those so\nWe have um [noise] the amount of very peace uh discussing the dawn and the rising of the sun and how what amazing it is um we then lead into a Thomas Wilkes a as best to was from my most Hilda sending from the ...\nUh and then that leads us into a ...\nNewer Madrigal a which is the name of the concert in time of by Steven salmon and that is a double choir plus solely choir\nUm that is a let's just say it's a it's a difficult peace isn't extravaganza yeah yeah I Would say yes yeah and it has a yeah it has challenged us in many ways but ah I think\nWe're really looking forward to a performing in a beautiful taxed by e Cummings radios thank you love each Cummings are so a wide variety for many different tastes something for everyone and it's happening this Sunday at seven PM\nTickets are available at the door that that trinity Lutheran Church in Madison located at Nineteen oh for Winnebago street and if you want more information you can go to mid west coral artist dot org or calm\nWell look into that well let's you know it's brand new but there's a website and there's a Facebook page you can like all the information about the concert is on there of course well we've been talking for a long time so I think maybe we should give listeners a little taste of some of the music\nThat they would hear if they came to this concert with some representative recordings\nUm I think the uh we're probably going to give you a taste of a now sleeps the trends in battle my poll Mueller um one thing that I Would just to point out to the listener as as you're enjoying this\nUm this is a fantastic tennis and palm of course and um [noise]\nUh the original poem juxtapose is the crimson pedals and white pedals a so passion versus purity of love or a fidelity if you will\nAnd of course in real life those are often clashing construct and so I think me were uh may have been led to use a huge\nBruce seconds or ... in this piece um they provide wonderful um harmonic conflict and yeah it's the way the pieces written\nIt I don't think that there's a lot of stress and those what we would think of his dismisses the dissonance is almost are confident as though\nThese two ideas are living in harmony with each other if you would [noise] so it's a really fantastic\nAs we listen to this we're taking your pledges we haven't had one in a while and we need to get those in before the end of the program six so eight to five six two thousand one call up and pledge your support of a musical offering and W.

this program is provided by medicine essential southern Wisconsin magazine one hundred percent dedicated to covering local businesses nonprofits and people making a difference in our local communities now publishing six issues per year providing fresh local compelling\nA I met in large part that's because the the the thinking is that um ads could influence how those uh how those senators vote on judge Kavanaugh's nomination\nOr the goal is to create a sense that voters um feel one way or another uh about a judge Kavanaugh and that the the senators should take note of that feeling\nUm another two point three million has been spent in Maine I'm a uh assuming that that that is targeting Republican Senator Susan Collins who is not up for election um but again is seen as a potential uh a swing vote on judge Kavanaugh's nomination\nUm now I think it's important to remember that all these millions of dollars of as I've heard it from folks in the states is leading the airwaves just being blanketed with ads I'm ... and while they may create a sense\nThat voters feel a certain way about judge Kavanaugh's nomination\nUm there is no we have no idea where the money comes from much of the spending is from national groups that have no connection to the states um and have no reason to disclose their donors are so while while the goal maybe to make\nA senators to think that there is a of movement to foot in their state or to support or oppose judge Kavanaugh uh the reality is that much of this money is is not coming from anyone even connected to the west Virginia and North Dakota or India\nTo this ... that you you were talking about over nine million is that in ... does that include the spending on social media to\nSo that only includes spending on television\nUm this is the first year ah we really have been able to get a good look at spending on social media\nUh unfortunately the tools Facebook has put out there are still being perfect and so there are a little difficult to use 'em to get exact numbers but defense we have is that somewhere between a two or three hundred thousand and and about a million dollars in student spent on social media so far\nI'm On social media um groups opposing judge Kavanaugh's nomination are spending a little bit more um than groups supporting judge Kavanaugh but both groups both sides are spending on social media and it really is a many of the same groups that we're seeing spend on television\nYou know the um the results and ... on a track to spending um we don't really know who these people are are we can get a I guess is what they want we could ask 'em what they want 'em but but you know it just has his general effective alienating\n... it just makes me monetarily now even more\nUm is that do we know what the effect of this kind of blanketing of sort of hostile ... all of this has on voter participation\nSo it's a great question I we I don't know of any perfect research on on the effect of these ads but what we have seen is that the the U.S Supreme court ah generally at least in the past compared to other institutions the public cold than him\nPretty high regard um the public respectful to play in court um they understand the role would apply even that needs to be independent from the political branches\nOf but that's also something that we've seen over the last two decades or it it looks like they're not but the climbing of it um it still the Supreme Court gets more respect than than Congress does\nUm but uh but it into climbing and I think it's it is no coincidence [noise]\nUm that that the
