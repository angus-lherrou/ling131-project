down in it and you know\nSit down and read that our time is it\nCan happen that they are\nNot known in reducing\nUm and the next step is for those entities to than divest in boycott from the companies because that's what really complying with the treaty calls for uh the treaty prohibits everything to do with with nuclear weapons [noise] I'm\nIn Europe Georgia bank has already divest it a a major Belgian bank is divested the biggest Dutch pension fund has divested and in this country of the cities of Tacoma park Berkeley Northampton, Massachusetts\nI'm In Ohio have uh have have ah divested in boycotted the company's\nShow 'em you may want to know what what are these companies I can lift just a few and you may have heard of a Jacobs Engineering General Dynamics Honeywell which probably made your thermostat a Lockheed Martin Northrop Grumman Raytheon texture on Airbus Boeing\nUm and ah the don't bank on the bomb campaign don't bank on the bombs dot com\nOr produces an annual report that we base our campaign on about which companies are in what they call the hall of shame and also which financial institutions are supporting them\nShow up boycotting adopting has a long history of success um General Electric used to have a nuclear weapons division and closed it in Nineteen Ninety three after a successful citizen boycott the investment campaign\nI'm sure you've heard about South Africa's a successful the the anti apartheid development and boycotting um process there which was which was very successful\n[noise] um so ah so that's what we're working on and a\nHoping that that cities in states across the country just like with the Paris climate accord will say well our federal government isn't ready\nTo take this on but we are uh we are rising up we the people are taking it upon ourselves to comply with this amazing beautiful treaty the treaty is that the game changer we've been waiting for the whole world is rising up to get rid of nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons\nUh countries are dragging their feet [noise] uh but we the people of this country the only country ever to actually use these weapons\nUm we are a ... you know acting with each other if we all do this together we can\nWe can speed the process of elimination before these weapons eliminate us [noise] um\nSo one other thing that we're doing is uh we're promoting um a candidate's pledge um so we are working at the level of of citizens and and also at the level of politicians\nUm we now have people said this would never happen but we now have three members of Congress who have pledged to support the treaty and um we are expecting that to catch on and and for there to be more and more\nUm so what is the only show I I should I should really know this but what is the official ... but the un it's rations official position on this treaty I'm Sorry what was the question what\nDoes the U.S who isn't treated you know and nobody is US's position on this treaty owe us boycotted it yes I just wanted to make sure we're going with with that okay and you're going to have kind of the\nNegotiations their discouraging other countries\nFrom finding it so we might be from the ground ... you really needs to be from the ground up\nYet and citizens in the United states that are supporting the treaty are expressing solidarity with the movement around the world so you know our little campaign made headlines in Japan\nUh we just went to Scotland and did a bunch of things with the Scottish anti nuclear weapons movement and um they really really appreciate the solidarity we don't want the world to perceive our country as being a model list of of nuclear weapons madness [noise]\nUm so this this is a very important that the citizen level also um in relationship to the rest of the world\nSo how big is north Hampton\nHow big is north Hampton what do we have thirty thousand a little over three thirty thousand people and then put you on like Lydia are campaign coordinator who worked on the north Hampton campaign\nHighly doubt Hi Lydia so can you\nKind of give us a rundown how did it go in North Hampton on mute the city uh recently voting to align with the twenty Seventeen treaty\nYeah definitely um [noise] so basically north Hampton last week passed a executive policy order um after a group of citizens worked closely with the mayor um to make it possible\nAnd the order essentially committed this city from eliminating all ties to nuclear weapons industry as\nWell so it committed than to divest things from the twenty six company um and to bar any future contracts\nOr services the city my currently have a ... with the company is essentially just a small group of probably about five or six\n[laughter] very committed citizen volunteers that worked closely with the mayor with the city council um first north Hampton had passed a city council resolution I'm expressing their support for the treaty and calling on the U.S she signed and ratify it\nUm but it's like you said we really don't feel that that was quite enough but I wanted to take it to the next level and the mayor luckily here we have a good mayor he supported us\nUm he investigated the city's connections so we were able to determine that they had a very small fraction of investments in the nuclear weapons companies um and under this policy they're committing themselves to getting\nRid of those investments completely um and to allow them at the treaty\nEventually helpful I mean I think we should be no I mean investigate what's you know in the portfolio writes bank event that's when a contentious\nNo really I Would say it wasn't that contentious um I I think that this is one of those things that it is such a massive industry that nuclear weapons industry but it's also a shadow industry so we're all connected to it in various ways but I don't think people ...\nSo I think he then to throw bailing that people don't want to have their investments going into that kind of\nKnow Lydia and um it keeps a standby there so so Dr ... the um you mentioned the alignment with the twenty Seventeen un treaty that they'd vestments but also this piece about the fold power that the president has to launch this war\nMean I think we need to is that is that part part of this whole thing as well right that's\nRight well you know we're working that divest meant angle is kind of\nAn economic pressure we wanted to bring but we're also a\nGroup of us have been meeting with our senators and also with our local representative um about this issue and in in the Senate there is a bill twenty forty seven which basically restricts the president's approval of ability to launch a war without\nCongressional approval and so that's kind of a first step basically saying that Congress needs to reassert its authority to\nDeclare war ah but then there are many other bills are the most important which I think is um a commitment by the government to know first nuclear strike in other words the U.S will never use a nuclear weapon um uh you know as a as a the for the\nBefore anybody else\nThat they shame you know just ... that that that the u._s. boycotting this um you know the people and that's just so shameful what else can you say right\nRight yeah um yeah so we just thought it's time from the grassroots up just start pressuring our legislators pressuring the companies themselves you know using the pocket book\nTo make a change um we we we we also understand that we're talking about economic conversion because a lot of people uh I I used to work in the panhandle of Texas a lot of people in the ... area that I mean they all work\nFor pentax which makes nuclear weapons and also dismantles them and\nUm so we have to find alternative employment for them and Vicki you've talked about this a little bit economic conversion you want to\nSomething about that\nYes we don't want anybody to their job we don't want corporations to go out of business we just want them to shift over to industries that are more socially acceptable um the industries that support life and not match that\nSo they're not there are constitutional limits to what the government can do a census yeah and uh well we'll move on from there ah later what ended up happening was uh the\nVarious groups that are challenging the census have shown that a very strong likelihood that secretary Ross is acting and in bad faith\nWhen he decided to add the question so when he claimed that uh the voting rights act was the reason why they needed citizenship question information that he was not telling the truth and that's provided an opportunity for folks them in your case in other cases around the country to start getting documents from uh\nBoth uh the Commerce Department in the Census Bureau and also to start questioning people from those organizations or or federal agencies under oath or to find out what really happened and this has gone so far as to allow the plane just to question under oath both secretary Ross\nAnd John Gore who's a high ranking department of justice official and that brings us up to last night so\nThe Trump Administration has been losing in these cases right and left with all their defenses and every time there's a new document dump the case becomes weaker and weaker a secretary Ross and John Gore were said to be questioned a today and tomorrow or the federal government is now trying to stop those depositions\nAnd they've taken this all the way up to the Supreme Court so now we're waiting to see whether the Supreme Court is going allow the depositions to go forward\nThe U.S Supreme Court and I'm just I went to the ... going to happen there\nWell you know here's the thing the um it's hard to make ultimate predictions here but there are a couple of things to keep in mind one is that the Supreme Court generally doesn't like to get involved in in discovery disputes like this this isn't really a a a major issue um so there's\nLikelihood that they could support the lower court's rulings the other thing though is that um\nThe ability to question secretary Ross comes from the plane is making a really strong showing\nIn the first instance that he wasn't telling the truth when he spoke to Congress and he told Congress that he wanted to add the questions help enforce the voting rights act that he wasn't telling the truth when you wrote this very long letter in March explaining a white he wanted to add the question\nUm it is very clear that the voting rights act is not why a youth ministry she wants this question civil rights groups around the country or in other groups including the Brennan Center of already stood up to say that we don't need citizenship question information from the census to enforce the voting rights act\nAnd it turns out that secretary Ross cleaned\nOr in March that\nThe department of justice came to him to ask him for this information but we've since learned through these cases that actually secretary Ross went to the department of justice first\nAnd initially the department of justice didn't even want to recommend the question it was only seemingly after some arm twisting that the deal Jay agreed to write a letter or asking for this and so that the deeper evidence suggests that\nA political actors from the White House and then folks outside the White House including possibly ... you've got in and Kris Kobach has had a hand eye in adding this question and that their motives are not about\nGetting the full count that the constitution requires um or helping him for voting rights it looks like a at the very least this is a move designed to scare\n'em immigrant communities in the country from not getting counted and and not getting the political representation or do they may also be an attempt to try to exact some political revenge on left leaning states that have large numbers of citizens\nThe problem with non citizens that the problem with all of this is that\nThere are states across the political spectrum throughout the country who have large numbers of non citizens so it's this is really an issue that's not really a red state blue state issue or a Democrat Republican issue\nStates across the spectrum are going to be hurt if everyone isn't counterfeit uh from not getting enough funding for schools and\nMedical care and roads or to not getting the kind of seats in Congress that they really deserved so no this is kind of an issue where\nUm [noise] everything ah suggests that whether you care about a good sense this or a fair democracy you really should be against adding a citizenship question administration doesn't really have a leg to stand on so much of all that it seems like the government's case is very weak\nThe onset of the what's what what are the questions we need to be getting answers to I'm from the Commerce Department secretary you know why do you want what are you going to do with this information\nI mean I think in the immigrant you know ... ... ... to someone lawfully present why would they want to identify themselves said they could be located\nFor ... you know where those questions\nYou know I think that one thing that will want to find out is what's the real reason for ask questions so we already know that the voting rights act claim as it is a total sham\nOr the really unclear question at this point it's okay you're clearly not doing this for the voting rights act so what are you doing it for and there could be any number of reasons but they're all bad and\nAnd you're in it and not not for the purpose of why we do the sense is right or is exactly\nThe um I I think that that was so how far how you went to that because people might think what is so I'm hopeful about a citizenship question but you know it could be used\nTo identify locate am round up people or other activity and then his courage people from participating who um should be counted\nRight although I think or maybe I can add add to things that so yes there are definitely concerns that citizenship information might be used for immigration enforcement purposes but it's important to remember that federal law makes it ... London like clear that that would be illegal when you provide your personal information to the census\nIt's not supposed to leave the census in any form that would allow anyone whether it's another arm of the federal government\nPolice or to\nIdentify you are and extracting information about you specifically so those protections are in place people are nonetheless afraid so I think it's important one to get the message out that federal law protects you and to to really pin down the government and get them to make it clear that they are going to\nStand by the very clear law this um but also when we're talking about people being harmed by the question\nI'm not really simple example our roads every one I was in your state will use the roads whether they're citizens or not whether they're adults driving the car to children in the car\nIn order for our roads to be fully funded we need to know who all is using them and if it turns out that\nUh our estimates are five to ten percent off because the census says uh somehow Mr excluded non citizens well guess what the roads are still going to be used by all the same people who are using the roads\nAnd we need the full amount of money to make sure that you know our bridges don't fall apart and our our roads are functioning like everyone has a stake and making sure that everyone is counted\nAnd speaking it's Thomas loss of the Brennan Center for Justice Thomas I Know we're going to have to be talking with you I'm a lot more frequently but I think a couple of other things I wanted to ask you about so there is a citizen ths ship questionnaires\nI'm lawsuits trying to get more um information about why this citizens ship question is being asked\nBut they're also um lawsuits regarding the under funding of the census is that correct\nCorrect ... can't get into an update on that it's not\nYou know those suits are moving a little bit more slowly the citizenship question questions the thing that's really hot right now but you know the the general issue with the Census Bureau even before the citizenship question was that it was that Congress has been\nMassively under funding the census for basically the last decade um the census is the biggest non wartime deployment of federal resources are historically\nAnd any given year as we get closer and closer to the census the amount of money to spend on ramps up to billions like we're talking three billion four billion five billion dollars a year Congress has decided that I didn't want it to cap\nA census costs that whatever it costs last decade even though the country's grown dramatically since then the beer it's been sort of fighting to cut costs\nAre but at the same time even that inadequate funding has been an adequate refunded\nOr so there are lawsuits and there's also a lot of advocacy going on on Capitol Hill or to make sure that Congress fully fund some senses and this is one place where listeners can reach out\nSo the um the this this human visual attention um and this you know so important what we're talking about ...\nOh image I'm imaging and perception also important for you know I I was wondering if it had to do with being able to when people um remember 'em or perceive somebody turned been their attacker and then be incorrect is at the same sort of\nUm problem we're talking about with miss identifications\nSays that brings in chew and then that scenario in\nMemory and that's a whole nother issue to look like hacking about lead visual attention is at this moment what you're looking at and then what you park high is and and what you do or what you\nCan report that you saw and let you do as you're looking at once you start talking about and as a previous attacking event than that as memory and that's a whole nother says shes\nWow so um the the I Want to direct people to doctors losses um ... visual reasoning lab really really interesting I don't have time this morning to discuss that with you but I I Am sure going to

economy is pumping out great gobs of new wealth and blue birds of happiness or spreading joy everywhere\nYou can imagine the comfort that this report has brought to the forty five million Americans now living below the poverty line\nThat line means they're trying to make ends meet on only twenty five thousand dollars a year not per person but for a family of four let's see any of Trump's advisors try to live on that before smuggling claiming that poverty is largely over\nWhat's at work here is the political manipulation of statistics to support Trump's ideological delusion that poor

Michigan on finish American festivals and so I got to speak use my finish language goes a little bit in the upper upper mid west it\nWas pretty great great you've been busy men during much of your life than you and you somehow managed to work in the history of star day records during all of it yeah what got you interested in star day\nWell I graduated with a a songwriting degree and nothing to do when I finished my undergrad degree and so I I had just finished making my first record that was with Kenny Roberts who recorded for starting among other labels and um\nI was curious about his recordings and he introduced me to Rosalie ... speaking of euros theme and a rose introduced me to Don fierce and Don Pearce was the founder of this record label and had produced a lot of Maddox brothers in rows of four star before that and\nHe bought an older labels that we didn't and then made into a big what\nHe bought into four star he bought a share with I'm I'm thinking of them just aren't storms in daily is that the origin of the start a name\nIt's the origin and to start a name so they ... they started this label jak Stearns was left ... touring manager and he sued lefty for breach of contract and took all that money and wanted to start a label that he wanted ... jukebox distribution so we brought Pepe daily in\nAnd they released three records but they didn't know about copyright they didn't know about managing artist of anything so by the fourth label that fourth record they released they brought in ... peers and that's when they actually founded the label together\nThan parents came down from the of the northwest summer Oregon and Washington\nHe's he's from Washington but he was he moved to start office to Los Angeles so even though it's mostly a Texas music label it was based in California and eventually to to Nashville right\nIn Nineteen fifty seven they went to Nashville and became the largest independent country music record label in the

R. T. eighty nine point nine ... and my guess\nIs uh the the incredible Lisa Graves um\n[noise] and we are talking about what influences us politically and we have a caller who wants to join us and I'm actually I'm slightly nervous about this caller because it's called his name is Julie and I think it could be my mom\nAnd so I'm like I'm like I'm going to embrace but I think my mom is calling me on the radio right now I'm so yeah I was hit with here from from Julie\nHey mom yours which I listened to since Nineteen eighty one I'm super excited and I'm also watching you and you look fabulous don't tell people you don't look fabulous\nThank you my which is kind of various mom feedback\nAt different thing than what you ladies are actually discussing but my question was really kind of a shift to the politics that are going on now which is why Scott Walker continues to portray himself as the average Joe in a suite blue button down shirt with the wind background and I want to know if people are gonna fall for that when we actually vote\nI actually think that's a really fascinating question\nUm because I think it it it's a question that is\nPart of the way the pendulum swings in terms of\nPeople of color are women are constantly trying to make themselves seem exceptional see seem\nParticularly intelligent particularly capable accomplished um you know are always trying to to say no I I really I haven't given a lot to what I'm doing um and then and then you know ... white guys\nGet to do get to kind of position themselves as as every day folks I was just like everybody else and that's why you should trust them and that's why you should believe I missed because\nThey're just they're just like you they're not you know the beneficiaries of of all of this privilege um you know the the hard working hardworking guys who who pulled themselves up by their bootstraps and just happened to want to be in charge of\nEverything um\nThank you my my my engineering data and so\nVery dead on very dead on but I Want people to remember when they vote that that is not the case and hopefully you know will step up our game and we'll be at the polls and people will remember what we're doing so good luck to everyone and you look fabulous\nThank you my mom was very supportive and also a a state employee\nSo she's out here in the streets talking about essentially the person who signed their paycheck um and and the way and the way that they've crafted their image and I think that really leads us into the larger conversation Lisa which is\nYou know what what is the images that we are attached to right now as a nation what are what is what has gotten us to this point what are the belief um that are influencing us who who who are who's influencing the the people we trust to two lead us\nWell I I I Want to get to that and I promise I Will I just want to say to your mom Julie a congratulations for raising a such a strong and I'm\nTremendously devoted daughter who spend so much time I know you do ... trying to make our world a better place so\nI'm really congratulations ah for um a job well done I suppose it'd be the way to say it because I'm In awe of the work you do I'm In so many ways in our community here in Madison with the safe and everything else [noise] um and so um I I just can't ... I\nCan't move on before I say that being on the way you want to say something\nAbout about Walker though and let me just speak in my own personal capacity and not on behalf of an organization but just as the ordinary citizen\nYou know I I I think that the contrast between\nUh the image that Scott Walker tries to craft in ads and more is in stark contrast to what\nActual documentary evidence about him shows not just the policies that he's pushed through that have been so extreme and cutting education budgets here in the state I'm really putting Wisconsin at a disadvantage Wisconsin Wisconsin I put his advantage\nUm in their um opportunities for the future and more\nBut also you know a couple of years ago there was a huge article in the guardian um that included um track a reference to Chuck set Scott Walker ahead solicited from some of the biggest\nMillionaires in the country he listened to them um for a a a group that was going to run ads to protect him and protect his allies in the Senate\nUm after the um after the you know in in light of the controversy over his efforts to crush unions in the state those included million dollar check from John ... million dollar checks from a minority by the way but it's a middle do check from\nUm Simmons interest Simmons who passed away but who um was the leader of a corporation that\nWas a facing litigation in Wisconsin for lead paint\nA lead paint poisoning of Wisconsin children I'm and I'm you know\nHe said that those those huge checks there's substantial turtleneck guardian article I Would encourage everyone\nTo read it it was really astonishing and I know over at PR watch I'm married but hurry and our team you know pulled out some materials from that story to really highlight of what the documentary evidence showed but it shows you the pattern of extraordinary corruption in my view\nOn that investigation as your as many of your listeners know was cut off by a deeply biased of conflicted\nState Supreme Court that's that forwarded that investigation from going forward but with the evidence shows from that investigation the material that the guardian had shows that Scott Walker was um listening checks for massive amounts from rich individuals in order to help himself and help\nHis fellow Republicans in the Senate even though in Wisconsin there are limits on how much you can consider it for your own personal campaign um there are limits and disclosure rules\nThese things were not disclosed until that guardian story and they are jaw dropping shocking evidence of his corruption and his willingness to basically work behind the scenes to raise money for a secretive group\nOr to pass that money through to run ads to basically bankroll him and his buddies to keep them in office and it is a tale of corruption notwithstanding the fact that was called the Supreme Court was so corrupted that it\nTo um allow that investigation to go forward\nRight and that is a deeply nuanced understanding of of Scott Walker as as a person who who functions in a specific way so who he works for who he collaborate spent but that\nIs harder to see you recognize and dissect then then an image of Scott Walker that portrays him as like just a regular bald in white guy who loves his\nKids and and and\nWants wants to you know a\n... you know restore the traditional values of our community um I think it's really it's really hard to\nFor for people to to see a Scott Walker as dishonest I think it's really hard for people to to see a Republican politicians as I'm\nConsciously and intentionally doing things that they know in the long run a harm our our economy and our community\nI think\nI mean they they have a view of economics that is I Believe is credited um in terms of this idea that um there's some sort of trickle down reality for Americans live you know the idea that if you give tax cuts to the richest millionaires\nA millionaire you know companies that somehow that's going to result in\nA huge benefits for their people it it really doesn't and it sure it's been shown time and time again that that actually does not um dramatically improve our economy in fact it really just dramatically improve the bottom line of the wealthiest few and you can see what happened in Wisconsin economy relative to other states like like Minnesota\nAnd you can also see when that when that a same Koch Ed Koch brothers sort of caught economic plan was adopted in Kansas more fully and how it completely crush the Kansas the economy [noise] um\nYou know as opposed to policies that actually benefited ordinary people even when you look at a Walker's job uh you know so called job and first of all the numbers are you know sort of ridiculous and and not well supportive at all they're they're really almost a fiction but if you look at the amount of money for some of these\nCorporate incentive programs you could create more jobs just by having those jobs bill by the state rather than passing the money through a Foxconn or some other corporation it's really obscene and you mentioned that word of the beginning of this conversation\nPoliticians on the Republican guys like I've been saying recently and they've been saying for a long time and now she was working so well that when people see any type of public person succeeding rock Obama and then they got that Obama backlash part of it but there's more than that you know you know what's it like that working in your cubicle next to drive in the same\nYou know a mini Cooper is you like 'cause then you the same as him and they hurt them so much for some reason I just don't understand why we're not having that conversation now I Want to hurt\nSo bad that she will hurt yourself you'd rather pull us down than lift all of us up together\nI think that's actually one of the more important conversations you can have especially in result to the confirmation\nThink one of the things you talked about over\nOver a guy in a within media is really why are women I'm ex you know ... are why are women supporting Donald Trump's administration why ... why we're there are women\nWho who were ready to to tear apart Dr Ford um when she spoke out against being sexually assaulted what is it that allows us to to not vote in our own best interest um and and and how do we\nAh how do we have that conversation how do we have that really that really complicated conversation of saying hey people are making decisions that in the long term result in their continued poverty and their lack of education and their lack of access to health care and they're doing at\n'em because they feel that they are that they have been given that they've been given an enemy to blame\nAnd it's not that people who are making decisions about the policies that impact their lives it's their neighbors and their colleagues um it's the it's the people who are among them but don't look like them or I don't think like them that that people have been I have been pitted against one another in a in a way that\nThat does not allow for us to work together um\nTo be successful as as a community um we you know we have lost our ability to root for the immigrant hero we have lost our ability to to listen to two women we have we have we have really a we have really found a a place of of tremendous divide\n'em and that is part of what is fueling this current moment and our political reality thank you so much while he for for joining us on the show so do you want to kind of ... respond to to wait while he was saying\nSure I'd want to thank you for your heartfelt comments um you know I think that it is a it's really been a surprise to many and and I'm a white woman and I count myself among those who were surprised by how um how much or racism\nOr anti black racism which is racism really yeah is I'm dominating some subsets of our population\nAnd and I think that I I certainly saw it um and I've seen it in in many ways over the course\nOf my life but I I had not\nReally realize how much of that uh that white supremacists or racism was being stoked I'm\nA so deeply um I thought you know I I Would I Would track some of the right wing um activities against Obama and it was repugnant and outrageous\nAnd you know an obscene again that term comes back\nBut I didn't realize how much some of that was resonating with um I I I what I Do believe it to be a minority\nOf the population but in minority that is you know I'm white a white predominantly white male um and also um and also white women um the statistics coming out of the election and twenty sixteen indicate that\nI'm a significant number of Trump voters were actually upper middle class middle class white\nUm and and not a not as many I'm a poor white says as\nAs as as people think but in fact there certainly are\nA number of of whites across ideological across the economic spectrum have supported from\nUm and I think it's hard to really over estimate the impact of Fox News and the dog whistles other racist dog whistles that it has blown repeatedly or through its commentators and more to really fuel this alternative narrative this these attacks on Obama that helped fuel\nA and push Trump or in the office and also I mean just this this the the whole performance of Trump as um as really representing their uh this sort of racist grievance\nUm this attack 'em on so many Americans based on the color of their skin or their ethnicity of origin or yeah it's\nIt's just it's just it's just astonishing and appalling but I take some um and take some hopefulness out of I'm looking at statistics I don't think these are distorted statistics but they certainly indicate that um you know Trump did not win the popular vote\nHe was um he he lost that election by millions of votes I'm In this most recent a vote on Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court um even though it was a bare majority vote in United States Senate the senators who\nConstituted that numerical majority actually represent fewer than half of the Americans living in the United states\nUm there's such just proportion and our political system you see that with redistricting here in Wisconsin in terms of the way I'm for instance the state voted\nIn the twenty twelve a presidential election democratic voted for Obama but because of the distortions of district ... uh fuelled by you know Republican alec members and with the American Legislative Exchange council or working in concert with alec and\nOther a right wing entities to\nA basically a strip people of their true representation in our state\nUm we have a state both of the congressional level and at the state level that is dominated by a Republican even though\nComing out of that twenty twelve election um that was not the case and even if you look at the numbers from twenty sixteen I'm Trump barely won in Wisconsin and yet you don't see that sort of divide on within our state legislature or the Senate or the assembly in terms of our representation the representation of Democrats\nUm or progressive in our in our representative um bodies and so in some ways what we're seeing across the country or in Wisconsin a nationally is that we're having really in some ways minority rule\nWe've got a concentration of power yeah we've got a concentration of power and I think raises an area in which it is it to the deciding factor right 'cause\nBecause Trump has been able to utilize fear of rape I'm an an an accurate\nA dialogue around around sexual assault\nUm to to make himself seem like the protector of of of white women I mean he he took on a full page ad asking for the Central Park five to be executed for a crime that they did not commit he called Mexicans are murderers and rapists um you know I I\nWhen when it is a black or brown person accused of sexual assault\nI'm Donald Trump is Vietnamese Vietnam Vietnam we against sexual assault a and it was it was amazing to watch\nSomebody be able to occupy the kinds of space that that our current president occupies if you are just tuning and you're listening to a public affairs on a W O R T eighty nine point nine if you want to join the conversation a please do the number six zero eight to five six\nAh two thousand and one we are on the air with Lisa Gray Davis a former director of the center for media you're listening to me I'll eat ... your very own a home grown homegrown a local activists\nUm and and we are talking about what influences us politically what shapes us politically we're talking about you know what what happened in terms of our our\nOur Supreme Court what's gonna what's ... what's coming towards us this November 'em and told me so that's a really really where I Want to take this conversation as we we still have the capacity to make change um\nWe still have I have the capacity to to continue to to shape our our community um and fight for our community and and I I Wonder what do you think is going to influence folks and November what is going to get people to show up and who's going to show up\nWell it's certainly the case that you know a building on your your statements about the Supreme Court that um that Trump and Susan Collins of Maine and other sort of embrace that embrace the notion of the presumption of innocence for Brett Kavanaugh ... notwithstanding the fact\nThat presumption of innocence gives way to evidence\nAnd Dr Ford testimony was in fact I Witness testimony\nUm that was a cooperated by by subsequent um or at least prior to now consistent statements well before Brett Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court cooperation that the FBI refused to look out in the whitewash that was orchestrated\nBy the White House working with a third McConnell and others to try to be sick or ...\nThe gay singer Brett Kavanaugh um and the presumption of innocence is obviously important in the criminal justice system before someone has their liberty taken away I think it's totally inappropriate in the setting of a judicial nomination where the question is whether the person has an exemplary background exemplary character\nOr to being trusted with a lifetime position on our highest court\nRuling for decades to come on ... on issues that affect our lives and our future\nI think that Brett Kavanaugh failed um failed\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise] inches futures one day ten band music festival to
