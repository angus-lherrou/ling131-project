O. R. T. this is Brian standing\nOn Sunday October seventh Brazilians went to the polls to elect a new president hard right populist candidate higher both an auto one forty six percent of the vote among a fuel to Thirteen candidates narrowly missing the fifty percent cut off to win the presidency outright\nBoth on our on our heads to a runoff election on October twenty eight against the second place finisher Fernando ... of the center left workers' party who finished with twenty nine percent of the vote\nJoining us now by phone from Rio de Janeiro is our good friends that he is blind shed welcome back to the eight o'clock bugs that are you\nGuys nice to be here so\nHow you were both in our owes been described as a mix between Donald Trump in Philippines strongman Rodrigo do ... do you think those comparisons are apt\nUm well ... let's put it this way you should not Donald shop or right I think that comparison is completely ... he's only Donald Trump in the sense that he's managed to kind of polite\nOf of a fake populist victory of sorts by appealing to people more face instinct sitting there more um [noise] you know racism and things like that sexism homophobia and that sense yeah he's kinda like Donald Trump but in terms of policies and in terms of what he\nPlans to do to the country he's very much more like where the ... and even more so there are specific Brazilian things that we fear that he will do that really don't apply to where they were to get there to work to Trump\nOr what are some of them and what are the fears that those folks and civil society ... how about both an audio\nWhile the big fear now is that he's going to three democratic means reinstate the zoning dictatorship people should remember that when the Nineteen sixty four dictatorship occurred it never made a complete civil break or with the government that was there before it they basically\nTook over power kicked out a bunch of of congressman and university professors and everything like that and then they said OK Now we're going to you know putting in a couple of writers on the constitution and we're going to say some people can't be elected to public office and\nWe're going to put it in the military jumped out of it is going to control the country but everything else will go on line I'm only in the constitutional Guam normally\nAnd then two five four and more success of what they called institutional lax they gradually up to Nineteen sixty eight ramp up into a very hard core dictatorship but it but no time to be ever say oh we're stopping elections were never going to have elections again a president's weren't elected\nBut you know a city council people elected state governments had to end up being elected the the people in charge just gave themselves the the right to basically kick anybody else that they didn't like who is elected some what we think is is that both not is going to try to do something like this again\nBut it's more a little bit more of a teen of democratic applications he has a big enough of a he has a big enough majority in the house of Congress he will have a big enough in charting the Supreme Court that he can basically rewrite the constitution however you want without ever really [noise]\nStop being everything and saying oh you know we're going to have to do a dictatorship so even in the best of all possible circumstances even in the\nEven if there isn't a huge outrage and movements in the fighting in the streets and big demonstrations he can literally re changed the constitution you can reform the constitution anyway he wants pretty much\nAnd then of course if there are a huge demonstrations and there probably will be we've had over a million people mostly women came out against him because he's at varying the fashion as candidate and we're in the streets a couple of weeks ago then you know you can always declare a state of national emergency in at that point we're we're in\nAny or he's full force for both so not he thinks Wilson is great because he thinks I think on a rip level is his class in his race is ever going to protect them you know he's not going to be one of the persons who gets killed\nSo you have you know this division and all these communities you have women to get married and they're wealthy and you know they're not working class women are full force against them mostly on\nBut you know you got all these other people who are not you know that that show ... all those communities that are against it massively against them there there's still the smaller communities smaller fractions that for other reasons for intersection analogy\nThat you know ended up being forum or or like um so you know both and I just have to find ten or seven days you oh yeah I mean four in favor of them can or seven five feet of all I'm In favor of them\nAnd then you know it looks like wow look see their black people in shape for why ... why are you afraid [noise] All right\nWe've been asked for as for a ...

[laughter] [noise]\n[laughter]\n\n\nTime\n\n\n[laughter]\n\nDa da da\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre very rare and then\nOh\n[noise] [noise]\n\nIsn't that good\n[laughter]\n\n[laughter]\nAll right so the first one is um so this will happen in the uh [noise]\nA a ... second half of the show once we get really at once Wisconsin It's in the United states are now in the war actually excuse me this this song is actually just technically just before we enter the war or kind of overlaps and I'll explain that um which is a in early April of Nineteen Seventy in the United states declared war\nOn Germany officially Congress passed the resolution and the the president a Wilson signed it\nBut just days before that they were I I Believe it's three referendum in Wisconsin Monroe man to walk in Sheboygan and the referendum asked do you support a declaration of war\nAnd the votes in all three of those municipalities were overwhelmingly no like like Seventeen hundred to thirty kind of kind of votes and um\nAnd uh the one of the Wisconsin setters at the time was was Robert ... better known as fighting Bob La Follette and he of course was was strongly oppose the war and voted against the declaration as did nine\nOf the eleven or representatives house representatives from Wisconsin\nAnd so there were a pacifist socialists who are opposed the war there are sort of moderates who just kind of thought going you know which ... maybe should really think about this whole war thing and then there were Germans who just weren't very excited about going to war against their families or their their relatives\nUm and of course you know those those would overlap so shortly thereafter I think a newspaper in Indiana\nScold asked the question is will Wisconsin be known as the trader state after the war\nAnd that caught on and and it was never really shook the moniker um even though after the declaration of war and I really after the workout running Wisconsin actually had you know many many people served from Wisconsin\nBut dumb at that time and and there were still although I should say by Bob ... still stayed a bill to the war as as did others um but because of of the law the Espionage Act and things like that on those people were were quite literally the silent store or mostly silence\nI'm so to commemorate that are unique period of history in Wisconsin this is where I wrote a song and and uh this is called the trader state\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nNo not at all why does make\n... ... and others you know the thing is I mean you just be a man with a common and the lady on answering machine guns and said Hi that in Wisconsin\nBut on the line with God man why can't you know it was gone\nAnd in the neighboring town which says that trade or a state\nThat yeah that's a just a hell of\nA sentimental we've called the trader when someone refuses to march to war so ah it's something that's been at least around for a hundred years thought many more years yes yes writes\nAbout one other thing a parable that I just thought about that it's one of the band that's playing on their show or their November criminals and that was the uh the name that was given to the Germans to find a peace agreements or which was\nNot a good settlement for Germany but anyone who wanted peace was also considered a criminal or fifth columnists or something like that back in Germany\nYeah rights are and that's a really good point um and that actually has a song another song in the show that we wrote that or maybe we'll get it will do definitely play one of these mornings hopefully next week I'm called why does it have to be me and it selling it first from the point of view of it is actually the armistice negotiation which is I'm\nA ... you know the the Germans who waged a war basically abdicated right before the end of it and and let the Social Democrats finally have power and let them deal with this problem of what some render\nFavorite political cost for for a massive devastation right yeah so yeah this is very interesting it was hearing the call and response or obviously the voice of Wisconsin or something by the lead vocals amend the chorus sort of being like the rest of the country regarding everything about what's ...\nYeah that's that's exactly yet so it's sort of a conversation probably a little bit more of an argument um and and a lot of a it was meant to sound like the two\nWe were sort of a technology revolution right now and we see a lot of ethical questions happening with technology and you know genetic engineering and cloning and all all kinds of different ways that that we're ... we're still trying to catch up\n\n[noise]\n\nWell the guy down on\nThese green fields and ran the warrant wind blow to gently Iran hobbies\nDamn\nThe trenches are vanish now on earth\nKnow barbed wire no guns firing now\nThe body\nGrave yard is now no man's land ... my strong mad mad mad\nLine Diane fellow man and a whole channel you know\nThat then maybe I Am from lonely day they sound them by lonely their rivals five years down\n\nThe bureau ... and it's already been my only last a\nLittle or a [noise]\n\n[noise] and I should add it right there in the song did the pipes the flowers in the forest shown Michael Jordan we'll play the flowers and for us on the bike or wealth through about it's great to have a sexual back\nPiper who is part of the show and I just wanted to mention if you'll be other folks of all sort of course when Michael dark and who's been associated with the characters are yup uh for many years so for the November criminals from Milwaukee and also other Milwaukee band the ... in his famous orchestra it's going to be a righty and that's a fun a combo different\nYeah yeah for sure that's and that's a nice thing about it\nThese ... changes up a lot and it sort of like a festival where you get to see all different types of bands accept that a band will play [noise] we gotta marching band they sound really I don't know just getting 'em but they you know a ... play a song or two or three and then another group will come on and then another people come back and see if it's\nGonna be a yeah I'm Ben at the same time you have a backdrop of just all these images and all these ideas are being protected behind this or not it will be something to look forward\nTo yeah and I and I will say that it's really it's it's you know it's not a military history or anything like that and then we're not talking about troops moving um battlefields and things like that um maybe a little bit of that just for reference in terms of what Wisconsin nights how they learned about the work the newspapers but really it's it's it's trying to build that emotional connection\nTo people from that time and see in the ways that he was different than and see the other ways that it feels like it wasn't so long ago or so far away right\nOkay so yeah this was the second installment we're gearing up for a

O. R. G. eighty nine point nine FM Madison and W. O. R. G. F. M. dot org gee my name is Patty ... and I'll be your host this hour Tuesday November six is our\nYou'll need to mail a copy of proof of residence and so for a lot of people that that's their driver's license or or state id credit there a address its current on that\nBut um other common options are a utility bill or I'm hunting license it's things like that and so you would need to mail a copy of that uh to your clerk\nAnd the mailed applications need to be post marked by Wednesday I'm so just the conscience of of the the deadline to get that done but if you don't make it you can still registered to vote on election day\nAnd I would add to little things and that many people think that they can use a lease as their approval presidents and that is true if you're registering in person at your core classes or in person at the polls\nBut if your mailing in registration form you cannot use a least as a proof of residents okay\nAnd the other thing I Would add is if you do have a driver's license that has your your current address on it and you have access to\nComputer you can just do the whole thing on line and even if your driver's license doesn't currently show your address printed on the front you can go to the DMV the website you can change your address with the DMV and maybe in fact the DMV already has been updated with your current address\nAnd as long as it's in the DMV database currently you can use the my vote that W. I. dot Gov Web site\nToo just register online\nAgain you have to do it by Wednesday\nOkay and that was that was the deadline that I looked at and was really kind of bowled over by [laughter]\nThat I even though I thought we were doing the show well in advance and it's like oh my gosh there's still a really short deadline well during out there's kind of a good reason for that because they after you register\nUm the Wisconsin elections commission then sends a postcard to your new address and if for some reason that postcard is on deliverable like that address doesn't exist ... they they will not put you on the registration list\nAnd so there needs to be some time for all of the forums and the online um applications to be processed and for those two for the postcards to go out and be received\nAnd then for the ... to create the pull books that will be used at the polls so um that\nThere's a reason for that twenty day or Ken delay right [noise]\nSo I I also realized that um early voting has started to Jay at at Madison public libraries are there other places that are offering early voting where I could vote\nToday [noise] uh yes so let me just clarify that city of Madison residents can vote at any medicine public library and at the um streets division in the east side\nUm and that those hours or any you can vote any time that the library is open up until half hour before they closed so you look for the hours of specific library um people who do not live in the city of Madison may also be able\nTo vote early in their clerk's office and uh the best way to find that out would be as Eileen said go to my vote a W. I. dot Gov put in your address\nFind out who your clerk is and you can contact them by either email or by phone to find out what their off offers\nUm ... what times they offer for in person voting we also have on the leaks website the same page where candidates answers as we have a link\nTo a um document that the Dane County court compiles were um they've asked all the local clerks and the whole county to please provide the hours um men and locations of what when they are offering um early in person absentee voting um so that's another option\nOkay and if let's say I'm using the again as as our test case voter um if I go to my public library to vote early and I'm not registered\nCannot register at the same day as I fill out my ballot you absolutely can\nWhip up with one exception the exception is that a registration is not allowed\nOn the Saturday Sunday and Monday just before the election\nIn parts of the reasons that I explained the horses are producing the pull books they're sending them out to be printed and so registration no one can register to vote the Saturday Sunday and Monday before an election but you can register at the polls so um [noise]\nYes you can absolutely register um just before you vote okay can I just add one thing oh certainly if that's what you're going to do to make sure you bring your group of residents with you because you don't need that to register yes okay but I Will tell you that if you're registering in person\nYou don't have to have the proof of residents as a paper form it can be simply um\nYou can just show it on on your phone for example so if you have if you can pull up your utility bill or you can pull up a credit card statement on that has your name and current address on it that will work now that's a a new addition yup oh a paste up a bank account um those kinds of things\nThat can be used as previous presidents if you don't have a Wisconsin driver license that has your current address on it [noise] okay [noise] so um if I Want to\nGet a state issued ID card because I don't have a driver's license and I'm not intending to drive [noise] what what I Need to do in order to get my my photo ID from the states\nYou need to um to go to the DMV um and they've got a a process for you to get 'em an ID and you need to decide I guess what kind of idea that you want um one thing that's really great is that if you if you're just going to use the id for voting purposes\nUm you can get an idea for free and ah the DMV has a a petition process where if you don't have all of the the typical documents that you think that you would need to get an ID I'm birth certificate Social Security card um I think you need to have\nA document that ah\nI guess one of those proves your citizenship but um but if you don't have all those documents we can do is you can go through the petition process and it's actually on um the the DMV to go to track down those documents rather than you having to um track them down yourself and you'll get a a receipt that you can then use that to vote [noise] okay [noise]\nAnd I would also like to mention that if you need help doing that if you need help find figuring out what documents you need finding how to get them I'm\nGetting a ride to the DMZ\nThe Dane County voter id coalition has a hotline\nAnyone can call from anywhere in the state it's area code six or eight to eight five to one for one\nAnd advocates will get back to you and walk through what you need and if necessary arranged for a free cab ride to and from the DMZ\nUm because as many of you know the new location of the DMV on the far west side is not accessible easily by bus so if you are not a drive\nHer which if you need an ID probably means you aren't a driver [noise] um [noise] uh you you might have a hard time getting too so uh we can an advocate kennel sore um arranged to meet you there to be sure that uh you can get through the whole process without any hassles so fantastic\nAnd on that note I Would also like to add that once again union cab of Madison will be offering free rides to and from the polls on election day\nAnd I have a pretty long list of the municipalities where union cabs democracy in motion free rides are available um so I Will read through this list at least once um because it it is pretty long\nSo if you live in Madison son prairie Middleton ... short would the town of Madison\nThe town of blooming grove in which the segments are with in Madison\nThe town of Burke four segments which are with in Madison maple bluff or Fitch Berg union cab will to pick you up at your home take you cheer pole and pull them pick your backup from the pole and take you back home on election day\nAnd you can get more information on the union cab website at union cab dot C. O. P. at least I Believe that's the correct address\nOr six oh eight to four to two thousand and again that's part of union cabs democracy in motion program and a please do support union cab because they are local their cooperatively run organization\nAnd they've been offering the service for I'm not quite sure how many years but I'm a long time and and they also have\nAnswers in their cabs on a lake or the lawyer rioting and get yourself all for it I had no idea oh that's wonderful yeah I I don't like to add you know we have ...\nThe people who call and a colleague and say I'd like to help drive people to the polls\nAnd that's something that the league does not organized but the um one of our partner organizations common cause I'm is organizing a volunteers who would like to help drive people to the polls and um so if you go to um this this is\nUh professors are I'm bringing up voting and licked and the election in their classes and there are lots and lots of events on campus the league is doing a lot of outreach there\nWe we were um [noise] uh every fall the students get a free bus pass but every fall they have to go and pick it up and get an activated and so we have\nA we had volunteers for three weeks um on at one of the sites where they pick up their bus passes so that we could also get them to register to vote at the same time\nAnd um we are continuing to do\nVoter outreach I'm right up until the deadline of the Wednesday I'm for ah to get as many people are registered as possible um it's\nYou know the vet school at the medical campus um at the unions um so then within ... building [noise] right\nYeah and we're um we're seeing that same kind of level of on new commitment and knew a gate engagement on campuses across a Wisconsin as well so we've got odd leagues who are making you know brand new partnerships they're working with people who they work with on the path to now you know\nWhen I get back a and I guess but we focus on on voting and so it's really great to see\nUm people people get engaged and it's happening across the state\nGreat and I was also wondering um because this is seeming like a pretty important election you're if you've had interest from from people in other parts of the state that may not be served by a week office\nAnd if they're interested in starting new we chapters and if that has actually happened this year you know\nSo we um we got seen a lot of a new interest um and you know we\nWish that we had a local league in every city or county across the state but you know right now that's not not the case so there is a room for growth and there are areas that are you know reaching out to us at the state office\nA lot of people who are like you know we really care about voting we want people to make their voices heard how do we how do we do that we know that the league has um you know it well established and you know knows how to how to get this done um so we do have people reaching out a\nNotably in the the new glare the area I'm In Jefferson County there is a really active a\nGroup of folks are there um and we had a a new league join us um greater ... valley this year and they had to cover a huge section of Wisconsin and they're you know just super active out their registering people to vote\nI'm trying out new technology um and new ways to reach out with more people\nTested you know we've also had a Indian county we've had requests to um to do events outside of the county and when when we have the people power to do it we we try to do that but um or to find someone\nLocally who can okay so um we we've been talking about students what about people at the other end of\nThe age spectrum seniors and uh and people who might be living in some form of assisted living facility we're not actually living alone at home anymore what ... what is the outreach for for those people\nWell actually I'm a I'm I'm going to be a little careful here because okay I'm not entirely sure I'm going to say this rate maybe a Lincoln correct me if I'm ... there are a election laws that are covered this and also the city though the local quirks are required to\nGo into facilities that are care facilities and do 'em with\nIt isn't necessarily the court but they have deputies their mom ... voting deputies who go to facilities um and assist people um with voting and in fact\nIt's a little\nFuzzy because you might be living in in a you might be living independently in the facility that has people who are more confined and\nYou know and there's some there's there's some question about um well\nI'll just say that it gets confusing and if you if you want it to request an absentee ballot you may have to wait until after the special voting deputies have come through an offer to channel for you to vote with the special voting deputy before you can request one by mail and if you're traveling that can be a problem because if you if you're dates are wrong and you may you may run into trouble\nBut um but the people who really have difficulty getting out and are in an assisted living facility are serviced by the the clerks\nOkay and then uh if you're more independent but say you let's say you gave up you're driving license or say you moved here because your children or grandchildren are here and you never want it to get a license here because you weren't diving any more [noise]\nUm the D. V. actually offers a\nAn ID that\nNever expires that is a non driving id and that's one option for people who are able to get to the DMV\nYou would find that kind of an ID useful for many purposes so it looks like a license but it's a non driving ID and you could use that as your voter id but something else that I think a lot of people don't realize is that there is the option to get something called a permanent absentee ballot\nAnd ah when you reply for a permanent absentee ballot you certify that you are indefinitely confined\nThat does not mean that your bed ridden it doesn't mean that you can never get out of bed and you can get around but it means that your age or some disability makes it difficult for you to get around and the getting to the polls on election day might be a real challenge for you if there's a long walk or a long wait\nOr a bad weather conditions and so you can then I'm request to have a permanent absentee ballot and that means you will always have it mailed to you without needing to continually request it\nAs long as you return it every time it will continue to be mailed to you and in that case you don't have to provide a voter id\nSo for someone for example who has moved here from another state to be with their family never had it Wisconsin license doesn't see a use for this non expiring ID that might be a good option okay and I only did you have anything to add to that\nThing broke a spelled out really well I Will say that I'm gearing up for the election a lot of local leagues have also been invited into um some of these assisted living homes more um retirement homes to help voters that register and help walk them through the process\nOkay now and we do have a a senior liaison program where we have a league members to adopt a senior living center or a senior center around the county and they make sure that those areas have\nPosters and materials and information um to help them we also I'm often will send out a ... a little blurb\nFor their newsletter to ah it so that when the most senior living facilities have a whole kind of a newsletter and or something to remind people of of election related information okay\nAnd we do have a caller on the line I an please go ahead with your question or comment\nOkay Hi I'm I was passing out get out the vote literature a few years ago for an election and my impression was that the most confused people at that point because you know rules change\nUm were students and especially men student and I wondered whether you would repeat you know very specifically the requirements for students to vote especially if they're not voting at the tea or you know voting early\n[noise] a short Pentagon where they go to school you know I mean just just if you could be a specific of us at all because I think some of the people who are supposed to be explaining we're not at that point quite sure either\nI I can do that um [noise] so I I've spent many hours registering students how do you do [laughter] pretty familiar with the ... the problems so the state law allows a student\nTo choose to register to vote either at their home address their permanent home address or or from the address that they're living at a on campus or near campus um at the time of the election [noise]\nSo in that the U. W. ... for example there are two main situations that we encounter one is the Wisconsin student who has a Wisconsin driver license\nBut that license has the address as their permanent address and they don't want to change that permanent address with the DMV because they want to maintain it at their home address\nSo that proof of residents that many people would use and will that would allow a Wisconsin resident to register on line for example can't be used\nUm about what we can use is a document from there um you W\nO what's called their students center which lists their address and they can have a home address mailing address and that because it's the state university isn't official government documents and so it serves as a proof of presidents and it can be\nDone electronically and in the city of Madison um the court allows you to email your proof of residents to an address uh that they have which is called P. O. R. which stands for proof of residents P. O. R. at city of Madison dot com\nSo if you take a screen shot on your phone of your students center which I'm from the page the personal information page that shows the W. banner\nThe your full name and the current address where you're living that serves as your previous presidents and you can use that along with a completed paper form showing your your local address [noise]\nThe game on\nI think that it'll\nBe\n\nMe this is Emily don't forget the joined me and then Monday that ... act that now where I'll be chatting with the Madison roller derby there on the verge of ... to ... to tune in to hear some of your favorite gator top of me about their big and\nRaise the plans for the next year again don't forget the tune in to the accent that where the money that is yeah it'll be ...\nYeah so ...
