Ortiz commitment to community access to the air wing for this hour we have during the year when he was over to a member of the public\nViews expressed on the access to our do not represent the views of the station\nStaff programmers or the board of directors we'd like to show to be as unpredictable as possible so we need your creative ideas it's a fear treat you give us what you've got and we give you the facilities in any help you need to get your program airborne so let your mind wandering wonder\nAnd when the inspiration for some pretty good radio glows with a clear bright light get in touch just go to W.

M. ... where did you\nLook on the website for\nSigning up to host an exercise programs are scheduled first come first served [noise] and now it's time to be given another foray into the freest foreign program on the W. orgies country\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nYou listen to it you know what I learned from your to exercise rather Eugene and we're going to be talking about some things here mass incarceration and we have a guest\nAnd um her name is Melissa ... and ... I'm doing great how are you I'm good I'm good\nWell one of the British here because this hour we're going to be talking about mass incarceration and um you are a representative of actual prisons are ordinary women that is correct and uh I wanted you to give a little bit of information on that and we'll go from there\nOkay I Am currently the president of expo we are a statewide organization that's led by directly impacted people\nI'm when I'm most proud of is our commitment to this is dismantling all systems that support mass incarceration and access of supervision and we're also dedicated to creating just systems with policies that build healthy families and safe communities and we currently have seven active chapters across the state of Wisconsin\nAnd we have a chapter here in Madison that is correct and so anyone that wants to be involved they are getting involved\nThey would be able to get involved or by contacting our website which is ... Iraq's dot org or getting in touch with Moses ah which is the wisdom affiliates are connecting with them to be able to connect with us\nAwesome awesome so how long have you been with a explore\nI have been with expo as since May of two thousand sixteen\nUs over two years I joined a expo when a couple of my friends had passed away after being incarcerated at to cheat a correctional facility\nAt that point I knew that I needed to be involved and doing more and we were seeing a lot of women at that time pass away and with these particular women that passed away a they were really close friends of mine and I wanted to see what we had moving in Wisconsin when we talk about\nA mass incarceration of incarceration of men and women and so I was able to get connected with the Milwaukee ...\nSure and went down there to visit a forum and I felt that was my place to be\nOkay and ... that's ... that's pretty awesome and so you've had obviously experience in him being incarcerated obviously and also you your your journey was the Milwaukee I'm chapter first so what's going on in Milwaukee right now as far as actual\nUh as far as ... with Milwaukee I one of the biggest campaigns that they are leading is the clothes SDF campaign and what a significant about that campaign is there has been Seventeen that's\n[noise]\nMm [laughter] ... [laughter]\n\n\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter] [noise]\n[laughter] [noise] [laughter]\n[noise] and then the [laughter] the\nWire\n[laughter] [noise] I\nHoping that by law will do a lot more trouble\nThan I Do a lot\nFor\nAll\n\nThe time and [noise]\nI'm a retired\nOf times I'll turn on a on a I don't know I Know for\nBuild each other is powerful and I really want to uplift that I'm so first of all what am I I'm One of my goals when I went into the institution was not only to to take a look at myself but I wanted to know the women that I Lived with many of these women um\nI did not grow up I'm In the city they did I didn't grow up in those neighborhoods and some of the stories that they shared with me or were very very impactful um especially when you talk about women are being incarcerated uh\nFrom Milwaukee ah from Madison and again I'm from Appleton, Wisconsin a very different environments um but when it comes to building those relationships with women in the system or the ticks a level of trust and uh\nThey have to fill out they need to know who you are first and I I really reiterate that anybody uh when it comes to Fort Lee Curtis rated people it's a matter of of observing first before they engage\nUm but I was able to to build bridges with many of those women and I had one woman in particular\nWho was serving a life sentence in that facility and a couple of women who were serving life sentences were my mentors and I want to be able to uplift that because we have women still\nAre that are incarcerated after two different kinds of the late eighties early nineties that are on old law\nUm and the sisters ah we're really significant to many of us and and try to figure out why did we get here and who you are um the other side to that is at the time when I was incarcerated or back in two thousand three there wasn't those programs there wasn't necessarily rehabilitation other than schooling you had anger management or grief course\nBut there wasn't anything specific to address how did you really get here and that was the women you know we as women band together uh\nAnd ... and sought out our resources to feed us and at the same time uh we knew that we were also in an environment of strict survival at that time and when I say survival I mean it was a matter of um it's something ... something significant happened to you or even medically\nI mean we were seeing a women um\nYou know taken wrong medications\n[noise] um that were given to them or we saw some older women I'm getting really really sick and that that wasn't being address at that time so for many of us we we need to take care of ourselves because if something happens there isn't going to be that office that's going to be there\nSo what did we do ah we worked out we not only had to work out and exercise to take care of ourselves mentally but most importantly physically\nOr so of building a bomb or keep them everything and ... that's ... that's for a unifying drugs to cure when words when you've been unifier that doesn't matter who you are and where you calling from ...\nWith something mental person you learn how to a shake it off here and I'm\n... and it's so ...\nThat's a lot of strength\nAnd then you also taking a look at uh what are some of these women incarcerated for their sentence as I mean seeing some of these women um\nAnd hearing the stories of having to take a plea bargain environments and homes that they grew up in a with a lot of trauma childhood trauma sexual abuse physical assault so many of them\nAnd we would sit there and and discuss those stories over and over again and try to find ways to build each other because like I said at that time that was not going to come from the institution\nAnd when we're taking a look at 'em even to with women on the racial disparity side um there is and I want to uplift is there is a difference between how black women in white women get sentenced to me to this day and we have a a an amazing black woman a Nancy ...\nThat is still stuck from the war on drug air and from the late Nineteen nineties she was sentenced to sixty five years in prison on Thirteen grams of cocaine oh and to this day uh\nShe has not been let out well and she is just one of many examples of we still have women incarcerated or from the air from the war on drugs\nAnd is this is definitely are approaching ... I mean the system of\nGovernment has ... that are good\nDr being able to\nGet us in a position where we have nothing right because if we go back we know that\nIn the United states there's a Ninety seven percent conviction rate because people take do plead of\nThe bargain because the system doesn't very ... good job of of the press and people I mean to theirs than even here in Madison along we've had a suicide in ... we have I Know back in two thousand and three we had\n... were sleeping in and Joe's on the floor three people on the foreign and a man in the cell and then you had a first the first person that was laying on the floor got the room and they stopped that due to a and a a lawsuit\nBut now we have that going into our prison so now dodge correctional as actually having people laying on the floor right now as we speak so what do we do it that when they actually put in a lot of people and filling the prisoners up to the point where we're laying on the floor is now\nWhere there's silver fish and there's just not sanitary using the same ... that you use I Am and over again so and we need a reform and that so\nPeople are hands talking and they might want to me like how do I get involved with this and like man this is some do stuff like what is the first step to they're going to actually do to um get involved if they want it to\nThe winter but the bottom but then again every time\nYou have a new one first thing I was all do\nDoubt paranoid like easy to do and I know she probably thinking I'm Craig no plug it did it I Wish I were picked a little bit quicker then again I Would have ... I Know what that I had no regrets but so do you have a chance I get ... ... ...\nMaybe I Do that every time I think about\nAll of my main thing\nTo turn it around\nThem they're a\nBaby I burn it or at\n\n\nYou're listening to eighty nine nine W Archie FM access our this is rather Eugene with Melissa hey hey hey so um [noise] those are\nListening I Hope we can you informed and educated and I'm ready to a\nRow with us because um and if you want Swedish tune in in a call in to five six two thousand and one if you have any questions or you want to you know talk about\nWhat we're talking about um comments concerns you about nature um let's get uncomfortable so we can work through that and um be able to\nUm\nUnite it's all about uniting literally it's all about understanding once we can understand we can unite even uniting to understand is is a great thing is it can be a great thing because you're taking yourself out that conference on and and holding your\nThoughts that you have and listening to that person that's the empathy part\nSo putting yourself in that in the shoes of that person when they're talking and ... really envision your life and those that person's shoes so they can get an understanding like okay I can see how this can happen and realize that that's a human being\nRight so like you said human beings I mean these are still people and when we talk about many of these people I you know what role at some of these people took a you know and I want to really uplift I mean we have a lot of them but when men and women incarcerated in our state that are\nExtraordinary and a lot of people are a lot of them are visionaries a lot of them are creators and it it's surprising to me even when I think back to just even with the women um when you put in his position of survival and you're only given so many things to use it's amazing what you can create\nYour use for projects\nAnd so forth and I think even with the men and you find ways to bill\nAnd even ... I mean even like if you lock down like twenty three hours a day like you know you\nFind ways to play chess you find ways of play spades and you don't even see each other but you find a way right are you also find a way to make a TV remote where you have to turn the TV because of the devil you left it on and you guys want to watch it because you only get to me an hour a day\nSo I mean just saying stuff like that but also from that little bit of point of unifying to a bigger point of making a movement to where\nPeople actually saying enough is enough you know what can I Do to help push this asshole someone that the other day I said you use your white privilege with white privilege I don't know like privileges I don't have like privilege and I said this is white privilege\nYou drive in the same cause my brother's driving same color making modeling year you're both doing the same speed limit no tend to windows or nothing who you think he's going to get pulled over first\nThe brother is because there is a quota that's\nEmbedded into the system and if people don't know that it's realistic ritual let's stick with you there\nIs just happens to be that way because the system is designed that way just like in protocol officers of police department have a protocol to follow so if people don't understand those protocols they're subject to those mistreatment says going to happen if they don't understand those protocols\nSo we've got to also understand those protocols understand where and how\nWe\nCan alleviate or tried to ... the shootings that happens by officers we went with it being with African so called African American man majority\nI'm and I'm not saying the police department anything like that but the people that we put ... on put the badges on we haven't had a psych evaluation who hasn't done\nThe ... the the the psych evaluation even in the jails you know\nGo to protocol whereas containment and put a dog is put an animal in a cage and treat 'em like that\nLike if if if people saw what the people did and Joe and in prisons\nBecause they have so called powering authority they would say and and look at it as just animals pretty much look I'm In Atlanta said there's an animal they're sitting there say that's inhumane whether we also know now we're getting to where we're going to be able to segue as too we also know that\nPutting someone in administration confinement for more than Fifteen days is considered inhumane noses that from the United nations himself so even that being said\nWe actually are in a play that we talk about but you talk about like an animal and they can't like animal in a cage\nLike the solitary confinement than the voices of those who have been locked up and uh that was actually out put together by to leave act bar and I want to give him credit for that and we actually have a play coming up in the late on the ah\nThe second and third time November of November ...\nAnd like an animal in a cage and we actually have a truck that I'm In the back of the truck is actually ah it's actually fixed a as an actual sized replica of the cage of a cell with the bed and the bathroom mirror and the camera in there so people can see that with the rap that would be on\nOn the truck so\nIf you want to come out and see that you could see that\nUm there'll be and I'm white\nNovember second the third is it seven PM so seven PM so if you want to come out and check that out this be cool if you have any thoughts on our website just people want to get more information\nWhere in Beloit or it's the uh college in boy ah I'm I Will bring that up real soon and while we\nPlant looking for that real like I'll just add and so when we talk about solitary confinement oftentimes people might not be aware of what that is I'm so basically a seeing eye called solitary confinement disciplinary separation or administration of sag and ...\nThis is done inside the prison system there is a under the deal see three oh three there are several different rules that men and women have to follow while at the facility and these rules can be as simple as disobeying orders a disrespect ah\nTo enterprising and I mean all I did some of them are just ... it through our room in the exact way yes\nUm and so with that what happens is some of them are classified as major or minor offenses and so you can get a ticket for it and with the tickets are either the lieutenant or sergeant is going to read what the consequences fall behind that and many men and women\nBecause of those get put into a separate unit which is solitary confinement and you are isolated\nBy yourself see are taken from uh the cell that you currently have all your belongings and if you're sharing it with somebody and you're removed from that and you're put into a cell\nA with ... with nothing uh you may have a pen inserts\nA toothbrush sits over your ... ah your pinky finger a small ... in a small bar soap and that's it and then possibly able to shower at three times a week and I as as far as my experience\nUm I was in isolation solitary from Ninety Days and and that I think when you talk about women I mean at that time we were given\nJust a small amount of pink soap to not only wash your hair and wash her body and now a with hair I mean there's no way you could wash your hair with that I think even as just me speaking from a white woman there was no way that I I wash my hair during that time because it would have gotten extremely tangled [noise]\nI had for everyone at work or uncomfortable and they all just what they respect ... and at the same time they know that I Love them and it's all about love and unity and we don't get uncomfortable we can never move forward that's how we break barriers to some other\n\nTwin boys they're

they released off sway when ah when they were just kinda trickling it out to test it out for radio so it's nice to hear a different take on it from Irish\nFrom there we went to a an old and in quotes I guess it five years old and the show which actually it is five years as an eternity and there was a Andres ... are doing the forgotten that just has a real nice since build up that that was\nPart of the mix CD that I had no idea what the tracks where when I listen to the mix and that song came on the since and it just got my attention right away and like what is the song and had to go out and find and just a love throwing that in um the bridge things nicely to go into churches that was a miracle remakes by of the one that claims\nAnd are throwing the churches in here because we got\nSee churches play Milwaukee last Thursday that was amazing I I hadn't seen them before and a three twelve for folks to count their drummer ah from Glasgow odd descended on the er riverside theater in Milwaukee great grown and put on an amazing show and they were\nFriendly and little tiki at times deprecating self deprecating played all the songs I wanted to hear they did not leave out a single one and I just had a nice high energy the whole time I'm really good showing lemon seeing them if given the option\nYeah I've heard good things and I know he chalked it up a little bit leading up to it um

have on in the background\nAnd with the correct pronunciation of\nOf course you have to wipe off the microfilm thanks for at least three rated you're sharing with the community it is it is a luckily it's just an audio medium and all you can do is your voices and not have to see this whole thing but uh\nFrom room that we're going to go to a row nan hair is a scene\nOf the enemy nation because uh today I just got the uh from the metropolis folks the new song from the envy nation it's called when is the future and I'm not sure if it's a question because frankly like it's any second now it'll be the future of\n'em up or maybe it's more of kind of a a esoteric all kind of thing where it's\nYou know when is the future not like a question but more just like you know when actually the word when is the future um so I we haven't figured this all out yet I haven't had a chance to dig into it because I just got it today so\nWe're going to we're going to let you figure out when the future is with

Rose Bowl and there are a lot of people coming in this town for hockey games and basketball\nAnd [noise] [noise] how\nDo you manage or city were so many different energies are\nMost of that is built on trust and partnerships and collaboration and honestly building relationships that people get to know you and my biggest thing is having people get to know you\nAnd building authentic real relationships um one of the things that I don't feel has happened enough over the last couple of decades is um our leadership actually getting into the community\nIn a very real respectable way mhm we we send our staff and the community but our leadership need to be in the community they actually need to know what's going on they\nAre are are residents and our partners and our\nUm community partners need to know our leadership by first name and they need to know them very personally are visitors need to understand that when they come into the community that they have leadership that they can trust that they can call that they can depend on\nAnd on the way that I plan on leading\nIs that I Want folks who either live here who visit here to know that\nWe do have an open door policy that you can touch and you can communicate and you can collaborate with us on a very real and personable level I Want everyone to know that they have access\nAnd that that trust is there and I don't see that I work in government now I work inside the city now right and often times I feel that folks feel that it's unreasonable it's unreachable it's not tangible\nYou got to know someone to get in or you got to have a certain level of education to navigate or you got to speak of certain language to navigate where you've got to have a certain\nDollar amount in your bank account to navigate radio a couple a couple of things came to mind one uh that you mentioned with housing and I do want to talk about that but right when you said was that leaders that have to be out in the community and in in my mind the first thing that came to mind when she steps and so\nI'm here somebody who's going out and getting in the commute\nThe and she's called on upon as a drug dealer and [noise] I actually had a conversation with Sheila I'm just last week at the YWCA um racial justice cement\nAnd I don't know the the whole story of what happened but these are very real things on these are very real things that happen to people of color and when that unfolded I wasn't surprised um\nWe're we're not surprised but then are we predominantly saying let's put white leaders in the community so that they can be out in the community so that they feel safe doing so because there there was a moment in her life where she had to take a pause even if it was for a couple of days to say in my safe out there\nRight um I think all leaders should still be in the community and I applaud Sheila for doing exactly what she did yeah and I will\nSay to Sheila um continue to do what you do yeah because if we don't\nGo against the grain of comfort and complacency [laughter] nice things will continue to happen and when our Dominic culture continue to call you still go against the grain and you go in answer the call of our residents\nWho have these shoes who need our help we have to get a way of uh\nYou know the status quo being comfortable in Madison we say that we're diverse in Madison we said that we're not doing the Wisconsin nice\nBut we are right and we see that I'm not a racist\nBut subtly and also sometimes very explicitly we are right our leaders need to recognize that you know OK I'm dealing with my unconscious bias what are you\nWrite and Sheila face that someone called mhm someone thought someone put her in a box mhm\nThat could happen to anyone of us that's my greatest fear most of the officer\nBecause in NPD known me but I tell them all the time what about the ones who don't know me mhm right yeah what about the ones who don't know me right the ones who know me I trust but what about the ones who don't know me right now\nI work with them and I I I I I'm very pleasant relationships right\nAnd so we have those issues are based on\nCultural politics are happier and then we are boosting the er I'm seeing that we share in common like the housing market in Madison right whether you're brown scanner fairs and things are going up into foreign affordable housing and real estate is getting tougher and tougher matters\nWhat are some things you see that we are facing as a city but we get also ...\nI'm going to add to that too because I think each year and I think this number might not actually be correct I think it's a little bit higher but thirty five hundred people experienced homelessness and since two thousand that number has been increasingly growing for families with children absolutely\nAnd\nOne of the things that really needs to happen with the Affordable housing arena is one I always start with the word that the folks that I work with you know every time they ... they hear the word affordable housing and I'm In the room they look at me and they're like oh here she goes again she's going to start Iran [noise]\nFirst of all the definition of affordable housing is a hundred word and it was started back in the early sixties um we need to really address that\nUm we really need to start using language in a way that the community understands it's a word that we use but it it's oftentimes taken out of context affordable housing in in itself has multiple layers right\nUm we talk about section forty two properties are developers get this funding\nIt comes from our tax base this tax base comes out of kid\nTo funding and I'm just funding our community don't understand that language they don't understand how our developers get this fond\nNow I'm going to ... when the ... and then we have a person of color on our community when in your mind you know use and only people of color\nVery successful and to be rock bottom I'm I have the whole spectrum and it has had it not been for my blood family and my faith family that had supported me in this community um I Would have nothing\nAnd so that's what I'm grateful for um that we have a the diversity of that and they have been from every walk of life every spectrum of race and ethnicity and I'm grateful ...\nPrinters give time as a thirty eight but we need to know real quick how do people support you where do they find you where do they have any that's coming up\nI'm I Am planning my I'm coming out this month so be looking for that\nUm this is all very new for me and so I'm

about your book and you being you what the first of all I'm sure you know I Know what is your ... from the law is big league or the south or ... years now it's been a while it was amazing and I enjoy the marriage thing I remember the football years yeah long term it\nBut I mean it seems like it with a long time ago but rare\nAlso seeing like it was just yesterday a thank God thank goodness for the social media and those things we can follow each other and watching you grow\nUp so um you can you can hold you up for the the ... tell us a little bit so now we remember the football where I knew you

actually complete I'm getting out into the world and now that you know\nPeople who are benefiting from it you have to ask that actually empowering pardon absolutely um yeah so it's a great feeling I'm an accomplishment knowing that are so many people want to write a book um you hear so many people oftentimes\nStrive to write a book or want the author of book I'm such a actually put the working yeah and uh see see it coming to fruition ism either\nSo before we get into what it was what the book the title and the subject matter of the boat\nA little more about that but you know some of us I've I've worked on a book I published a view is not easy what was the process so you think probably for years\nI should write a book I should write a book I should write a book and then you start how what was day one like what did you consider the official start right well I mean was it like that for you to actually write a book I should write a book guys ... years seven I wrote a book right and then you finally start writing that book\nI think when it went to the editor for his round of editing yeah um and then getting it back you know you think your when you say I'm an intellectual I'm a scholar\nUm but then to get it back for very humbling processes the either the corrections and things like that but I knew it was real at that point when I um had contact with the professional editor\nUm there's no turning back I knew I had the fences a project\nSo tell us that the title of the book and we'll motivation behind the title of your own mind\nYes twelve method is to make your AB students comfortable even before the learning starts and so the motivation behind the book was to uh empower other administrators other directors managers um and that do basic education field or my

of places do great work\nYeah so I as someone who was in local government I already knew that there was\nImpact people in our area um and and ... to some of the ones regarding local control which is a huge issue here an issue of why a lot of Republicans are supporting my campaign over Rogers a because he has been a huge proponent of\nI'm limiting the ability for local communities to do what they know is passed because they're on the ground with the people in their community uh and and just seeing that I'm On a local level\nI'm One of the other things too that\nRoger has done that has a lot of impact here on uh he uh and uh another ... percent authored a bill\nWhich I'm declassified a certain portion of Wisconsin protected wetlands ... allows builders without permanent now the film ... so the business lobby loves him for it um but ducks unlimited trout unlimited or people with flooded homes and basements not so happy about things like that um and then at other\nYou know ... more a obscure one because really impacting the Holocaust as it is I'm Roger authored um some legislation to close loopholes attack was all known as the dark store loophole which allows um big box retailers to have lower property taxes and they really should have paying less than their fair share\nUm he authored a bill to do the right thing and then after heavy lobbying by Wisconsin manufacturers and commerce he killed his own bill down her\nYeah and I mean it's it was very dramatic and now he's campaigning on being the person who wrote the bill and it's going to close that loophole hoping that everybody forgot about what he did last session or rather what he did not do last session so\nMy opponent has a lot of areas I'm happy to exploit 'em and frankly uh the leadership that he has shown is the leadership sort of in title alone and not necessarily in really being a champion for his name unity\nTalking with the Wisconsin state Senate candidates lease not grass and Chris Marion we would love to hear your questions or comments join in on the conversation give us a call it area code six to eight to five six two zero zero one where you can send us a tweet to W. O. R. T. talk\nChris can you talk to us about some of the issues I'm definitely gonna\nA picture of your community in and remind us I'm your district district Seventeen ... a Senator Mark line it includes plant down reads Bergen Richland center\nA governor dodge state park which for me that that that the destination when you say that I Know exactly where your district is now um but tell us about some of the issues that are\nAre coming up that are important to your district or do you do you're hearing when you talk when you're ...\nYeah we I'm Sorry I Love you but I have\nThe [laughter] stay on the district showdown here\n[laughter] it's just so beautiful it covers most of the drift with area in Wisconsin It's a very large long um spread out district 'cause it's very rural we have about a dozen cities everything else is villages lots of towns\nUm a lot of open spaces lot of beautiful wetlands hunting fishing lots of agriculture my county in particular is the most ag dependent county in the state\nUm we also experienced the highest number of farm bankruptcies in the nation\nThis past year in ... western Wisconsin\nHad the highest farm bankruptcy rate and we are on track to be that this year I'm very hard time in agriculture so\nYou know issues here have a lot to do with um similar similar bills so the wetlands roll back\nUm while Wisconsin manufacturers and Congress was biggest push for those the big agri business groups representing the largest farms they really want to roll back those wetland protections as well\nUm so that is an issue here and mark line of course supported supported that a ... rent on radio or talking about that bill ... um when it was up for vote and he said you know most of these wetlands are the equivalent of when you drive your truck in a wet field and it makes routes and\nIt's growing those right that's\nThe kind of wet lands that were going to remove the protections from you know of course that complete garbage\nShort um some protections ever everywhere\n... ... ... exactly and um wetlands are hugely important really for our infrastructure that we've built over the years as we've seen with with my district has had catastrophic flooding\nRight in the middle of the district in a little bit in the northern part of it Juno sock Richland counties I'm\nA several communities may never have their main streets again love our viola a very difficult to bounce back from and of course having wetlands upstream are the sponges that slow down the ... of\nUm flood on on the different river so you know we're in the crosshairs of this environmental debate that's going on water is kind of the battleground I think for the next decade and then in addition to that we just have basic economics wearing a chronic workforce shortage just like the rest of the state\nUm Foxconn is hugely unpopular out here because we are not going to benefit from it and the money for those cash payouts you know came off the top of money that we needed for roads and schools and for main street redevelopment I'm In addition\nAnother Ninety million dollars in transportation funds were taken from\nA local roads and sent to Ninety four to complete what Foxconn needed so we're we're feeling left behind as usual\nHere in the fly over parts of the state and um yeah so that that's kind of the main issues facing up but we we need to have strong schools we defunded not just K. through twelve and not just universities but also more tech schools so\nWe have a terrible shortage of skilled trades people um that difficult to find people to work on your car your house or to hire for your business so we're feeling the pinch of all of a workforce and and the housing crisis we need our tax\nStay right here in our district and I don't want to see any more going to a project like Foxconn\nThanks crisis that really does mean a picture\nAnd that's kind of how I'm feeling these days just kinda surrounded by friends and um it's really exciting I I Will say one thing that's changed in the past\nWeek with the Supreme Court discussion is the stories I'm collecting from women at doors and that parades even of their stories of sexual assault and always followed up by why they didn't tell\n'em right away and in many cases why they never really told and I think that that is an important um it's important to hold those stories and likely I've been in the position to ask a lot of young women to run for office and I think I really ...\nAnd I'm working toward um\nLeveraging this energy that people are feeling about the national dialogue for for good and not for apathy you know this could be another situation where we kind of give up and feel like oh my gosh\nYet another message that we can't come forward I think instead the messages you know what let's get more let's get more ladies on the judicial committee you know let's get more of us everywhere in Wisconsin three quarters of town boards have no woman\nRight make the board I think\nThe time of change that I can correct me but now it's time to change that yeah\nIt's time to change that and you know [laughter] we'll say my first experience on the county board my very first day when I showed up in the in the courthouse a gentleman came up to me and he said hey young Philly where were you when I was looking\n[laughter] and uh that was my introduction\nAnd these are these are winning among women stories you know all across politics and all has every industry you know right you you and I talked about we're both on the county board I have stories\nJust like that um we all do from the county board but I also have stories just like that from you know when I was a journalist from when I went to law school when I became a lawyer you unfortunately this no matter where we go these are the stories and when we get more women leaders and then we change we change the dialogue with genes of style\nYou know I I'm you know I I didn't blow up that situation when when it happened to me and I I you know kind of [laughter] it wasn't quite sure\nHow to respond but I recognize this guy was actually well meaning you know you meant it being super friendly rang I thought I thought\nWow well when there's a eight of us women on sixteen member county board you you just won't have that sort of\nOr the world as well have you seen have you on the sixteenth ... you know instead of to when I write I write I'm delighted to say that I I\nIt worked likely I work really really really really hard to ask women to run I actually host or treat at my farm house every year in the winter it's called the whale sisters [laughter] um ... shake it up and it's for women who want to get involved in politics and we have about\nThirty people who stay the night and the get\nGo deep on how we can make this happen and my county board now is twenty five percent\nWomen wishing that are then they're getting their candor yes it is yes it is you\nGo Chris I Want to keep talking with you but now we have joining the conversation with us is Laurie hockey and she also is the first time Wisconsin state Senate candidate running a as a democratic against a Republican male and come in and I so excited to have Laurie joining us hello Laurie\nHi carousel thanks for inviting me on today I'm really excited to be on the show\nThank you trust thank you so much for dining Ari if it were I it's none of us were in the same room browsing how together we're all we're all here together ... so I Will tell a quick story which is uh I'm I'm good friends with Janine di who's the\nHead of the Senate Democratic committee and she's on the ... on board with me and I called Jenny and I said Jenny I Need the campaign manager numbers for all of these candidates can going to reach out and they want them on my show and ... recommended that I should reach out to first\nAnd of course it was the three women Laurie Chris and a leader in just Julie as well who couldn't join us a Julie ... another Kennedy but Jenny said Laurie has the best story\nAnd I should tell me no more I don't want to know where it is I Can't wait to hear Laurie tell to me so with no pressure [laughter] but tell us about what made you motivated to run for office\nWow well first can you guys been a great support so that was kind of hard to say that my story is great and honestly I until I started really talking to people about my story I didn't think of it is really very different from anybody else's story and and what inspired\nFor me to run was well after the two thousand sixteen president presidential election I remember that night looking at my husband and\nSaying you know no more\nLife as we know it just kinda sitting back and\nHoping things work themselves out and that's that's over and you know I've always been\nYou know kind of us more of a silent supporter I've been lifting up causes that I Believe in all along but just\nYou know you get caught up as a woman I think especially\nPutting others first you know you're you're you're reading your family and a lot of cases and you're working on your career and trying to keep keep up with all the other people who you're working with and and the opportunities and you're just kind of get lost in that and after the election that knocked me out of that kind of\nI don't know protective cell I guess\nAnd it made me start working with out with other groups in the community to just work for positive change my husband and I created an indivisible group called left to vi right after that and started reaching out to people and are pretty conservative district to find people who are just\nLooking for change no matter where you're coming from politically just people who wanted to get active and that led me to a community meeting\nWith a group called forward can OSHA\nWho was um which was partially created by another woman who's running for state assembly in my district and you know Washington and at that meeting I'm One of the leaders from Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin\nWas there saying to people look we're going to lose funding for Planned Parenthood if we don't have people step forward and give their\nTheir stories and and just start reaching out to the public about all the wonderful things at Planned Parenthood does and this was during the threats of the eighth you repeal right after you know right in early two thousand Seventeen so at that meeting for the first time ever I shared with\nOne of the representatives from Planned Parenthood my story for Planned Parenthood which was when I was a brand new teacher I was under insured and I went through a health emergency that was fertility threatening and says Planned Parenthood was my health\nCare provider at that time they caught the problem early referred me to a wonderful doctor and they were able to save half of an ovary which allowed me to later on and have that same doctor who Planned Parenthood connected me with delivered both of my children well down the road\nSo they don't have this opportunity for me to give back to an organization that had given me so much\nThat led to me meeting on Cecile Richards the former president of Planned Parenthood and I'm going to Washington with a lot of other former and current during the patience to\nLobby Congress for you know keeping Planned Parenthood funded so I found myself and speaker Ryan's office in Washington because he he's my um representative with many women for other women from Wisconsin and my Thirteen year old daughter who wanted to come with me\nAnd as I was telling my play parents that story and making that hard asked at the end of you who you talk to Speaker Ryan because she said representatives she wasn't in the meeting will will you talk to him and tell him what you've heard here about the importance of maintaining funding for\nFor so many you know thousands and thousands of women in Wisconsin alone rely on Planned Parenthood for for their reproductive healthcare and for the cancer screening that they get and for you know FBI detection in treatment and I could tell they look on their faces that their minds is already made up\nAnd so I wasn't in hunts and realizing that if I wanted my voice you heard I needed to fight for it and to speak up more um and that led to\nMore advocacy um after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas shootings my daughter again wanted to go with me to speak to our at this time representatives in Madison about her fears and my brother's fears about going to school after that and to talk about good sense gun laws\nAnd we found ourselves in um now my opponents office\nOn again I still had no intention to really run for office at this point but my daughter was fourteen at the time\nKnow list of concerns for him and also you know hard ask like I taught her how to do and you know by the time she was a season at the cat because she'd already button [laughter] Capitol Hill to lobby of Washington and and as she was you know talking to a representative in in Madison\nI could see that he was dismissing her and I thought OK so every level of government we should have representatives to listen to us and\nPut out there to lower people and he is very quickly moving through this agenda for example he ... he criticized Wall Street and ... you know corporate money and the coke um other politicians as being coke ... and yet his staff his administration with people from Goldman Sachs and\nOther parts of Wall Street and it's probably the most um uh the wealthiest cabinet I Believe has been reported that we've ever had with more people from ah corporations who make claims on government\nNancy McLean this has been a fascinating conversation yet we we are out of time nonetheless I I Do think you're greatly\nI thank
