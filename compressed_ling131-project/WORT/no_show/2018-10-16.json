R. T. eighty nine point nine\nMy name's Emily and I had the absolute pleasure to introduce several of my favorites skaters from the Madison roller derby I'm sitting across the wonderful people here at work from alligator or Alice good evening and tornado alley hello\nHi ladies how are you tonight great how are you I'm fabulous thank you I've been looking forward to death and just want to thank worked eighty nine point nine for having us here today we also have a fun musical guest that we're going to share with you that goes by okay indigo and we'll hear some live music from her shortly\nSo I'm looking forward to that but we're going to go ahead and start in with some thoughts questions and feelings about Madison roller derby they are exploding all over the scene of some new things en route and I want to hear about them so\nI mean I kind of start a little bit with kind of feeling out everyone Patrick experience with the roller derby so tornado\nBut you want to give it a whirl yeah sure [noise] um so I grew up in a small town in Indiana and I actually worked at my home town skating rink uh for about eight years through high school and college so I was around ... from the time I learned to walk I learned how to skate so I've been skating since I was three years old\nI'm my career really didn't allow for me to do much skating or anything like that so there was a big chunk of time where I didn't get to skate when I finally settled down here in Madison\nI knew I needed to get back on my skates I needed to do something active and I had actually met alligator at my job [laughter] she was on our show for an interview and I talked to her a bit about you know my speeding past and she talked to me about roller derby and so finally I joined and\nIt's been great ever since that's what a great story I Love that you got yourself a rink rat oh I heard that before that's Vail is big time regret I spent most of my days there that's awesome I ... is getting too I'm not a particularly in the derby myself but I Do appreciate roller skates and roller skating and roller rinks and everything about what you do it so I'm excited to learn more okay bring it to me telling me about your experience\nYeah so uh this is Eli I'm I grew up roller skating on the weekends I grew up in Evansville, Wisconsin a very small Wisconsin town was a whole lot to do in a small town uh but we have a roller rink and so I went roller skating pretty much every weekend because I was a musical theater ... growing up\nIt was a good good uh and uh that's how I Would say quote unquote got into trouble which is not a lot of trouble um so ... so yeah I\nGrew up roller skating or was not a particularly athletic child I Would say\nUm and my life took me many different directions and uh and brought me back to Madison I Would say about Thirteen fourteen years ago and I got in touch and saw roller derby is I'm actually a saw carry a ... on my space\nI got in mind that [laughter] yeah and it was like\nReally want to go see that and so I was working at a salon with the two uh two other skaters at the time uh who are unquote squad my home team and I uh so he started going started volunteering and helping putting them\nChairs a and then when draft came mom came around or in the spring or in the summer I was like yeah I Need to I Need to do this\nUm and it was wonderful I mean it was a great community to be a part of\nAnd to grow and meet people and as an adult or you know I think sometimes the chances to meet other adults especially women\nAnd then in a to create really great ah adult relationships and a is really challenging sometimes outside of work or sometimes outside of the bar culture or or\nKnow what to focus on there and it is easy to see that one skater with the star on and that flashy skater sometimes\nOn to follow that action and that's a great place to start yeah but then sometimes you get in and and take a step back and you see the blockers and the movements 'em and you can really pick up ... I said Hi wanna watch roller derby so I can look down on the track the organization of how the blockers are working together you can get it\nA much better perspective and analytics from that from a high higher vision you'll do a really nice job making this a a a a visual way for people to a imagined as if they have not gotten a chance to see it before um by way of explaining it over the radio so thank you for doing that for people that don't know\nI'm really quickly we're gonna we're just split for just a second and do some music from okay indigo which I'm very excited about but I just want to let people out there know that um there's some skaters here to talk to if you've had this burning desire to call it talked to a skater this is your chance you can call and ask questions about\nHow to play what their experiences how to get involved all kinds of other things so it's W. R. T. a nine point nine and a six to eight to five six two zero zero one\nAh we're sort of take calls and we'd love to have that after a few minutes of music feel free I think they'll route I'm back to us at any point when you call and we'd love to hear from you lots more information to come about\nThe fact that Madison roller derby is a nonprofit they work with the community for the community\nVolunteer all over the place give back all day all year and they have many many many people men women and soon to be your people winner and we're going to talk about that that super exciting um but yeah we're going to split for a minute and let okay and they go join us for some music so please hold [noise]\n[noise]\nOkay can you hear me [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nMm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm\n[noise] ...\n... when ... when we went\nTo the main page and\nLet me in the middle of the land then kinds moaning isn't the hottest rage and he put me on hold\nAnd then I called him saying [laughter]\nAnd if I wanted to that not nice man can jaw so ... ... and I watched him as he watched me grilled ...\nAnd we share in a warm but we each had our own lighter\nIt but it's the same name for the quick isn't to burning\nMan and a lesson that I ... he still needed learning yeah Mm\nSo I live in in the morning and have you with morning yeah that's a strong word he says and not really adult and dancing\nIn streams of done the you've got one thing to them then the dominant you voiced Elaine this plan or you've got one thing to ... the\n...\nStrangers in the morning unless he wakes up bin ... maybe ... they really rely on men him any harm\nBut I can fly away and this time no I\nCan't name slap you away this\nTime and\nHe'll tell you his story but as I as of late don't bore me they wish\nTo show me some than real\nMm\nThat was like oh yeah\nWas awesome thank you say oh my gosh thank you okay and do that was fantastic kind of getting cherry um [noise] there was a little clicking in the background and that's my daughter who is getting very close to okay\n\nAnd if they didn't live\nThrough were shy or in that [laughter] I Know as we're about community radio here we go [laughter] um I I Know it's [laughter] it's okay [laughter] um my family's out there listening and probably can hear ivy my daughter so that's fun for her and everyone but anyways back to the story that hand so\nI Want to talk to you ladies about um several things but I Want to focus a lot on the nonprofit profit aspects of Madison roller derby um there's been growth in chains and transition and so much wonderful things so many wonderful things in a time in which you know I've been aware of you and gotten to know some of you I'm In\nPrior in in the future and that's the exciting part so if anyone I mean ... if you'd like to kind of start talking about the aspects of the nonprofit and maybe some of the details that folks out there don't necessarily realize that you do in the community that'd be great yeah yeah\nSo um I think a lot of people probably know that we do a lot of community outreach\nUh every member of the league is required you know for their membership in order to be a part of our organization to participate in a certain number of community a promotional and now fundraising events throughout the year\nAnd we were born of grassroots we were born of our community and we were born of our friends and our family and friends of our friends and friends of our family who knew us and came to watch a skate and\nSo it's the community is just an intrinsic part of our organization just in terms of where we were we were born from and so\nWe get back to the community through active volunteer efforts we also have a\nCharity organizations every game we donate proceeds to I'm I'm a charity of a of our choice a we have a very democratic league and so we um everybody gives their ideas and suggestions of who they want to support in any given year and then we all vote on\nUm different um [noise] uh\nThat we want to support financially and then through that vote would decide who those about charities are every year so um we were\nFor a a regular for profit business through through our history and tell around two thousand Fifteen or so when I was elected as general manager and I inherited this decision that the league had made by vote again to add a at a leak meeting that we wanted to transition to a non profit\nUm our our goal or ultimate goal has been for a very long time to have a space of our own for roller derby and I'm as I'm sure people in Madison listening know owning any kind of property or renting large you know buildings is not a\nA an inexpensive endeavor so we decided that's going on profit let's look at fundraising I predicted it sucks look at ways where I'm giving back to the community can maybe reverse and maybe they can get back to us if we can mention they get into her own our own destination\nSo I transition to lead to a non profit we were approved snap just like that without a question within a month we had the answer back\nUm we're a little bit nervous because there's it's it's different a founding a company or an organization as a non profit versus taking when that's been running for profit for its entire history\nAnd then asking the federal government hey we want to be recognized for doing more than just making money 'cause that's the core of a non profit right your mission is not there to make dollars\nYou make dollars in order to function but your ultimate goal is to do better than that and do more than just make money sources getting back to the community and women's empowerment a leadership opportunities for those who participate in roller derby\nThing for filling us in on that um there's a lot more details so that more details excuse me to how\n'em but definitely check out the website it's it's a fine website has got a lot of information and their stuff being added all the time about how you can get involved what there is going on events to come when the season starts you know the competitive stuff all the way to the most Hugo she loves stuff so it's all on their\nUm and it's here to right now so if you know we love where it's been a long time\nPartner to MIT I think from our inception we both have them partnered with with W. R. T. I'm so we have a sponsor them there we also have our community outreach partners so everybody has been a part of it is somewhere highlighted on the on the website\n[noise] yes definitely so I Would like to invite people out there that are listening to call in and ask any questions that they might habits six oh eight to five six two zero zero one there was a question that came under my nose here and I'm not sure if it's just a question from the producer someone called but\nSomeone needs to answer how exactly is the point scored [laughter] so roller derby is played will take a like two steps back roller derby on a flat track\nUh so if you if you'd seen a roller derby played in the seventies early eighties and you saw that banked track\nA that is still there in some leagues but we do a flat track\nA seat as Alex said before you have a lot for blockers from each team and a jam or from each team whistle blows and aj Amazon the gym or have to get through and pass the blockers from the opposing team the first pass the first pass through a ... is the initial\nAsked uh the gym or gets awarded a a earns a level called a lea generous data for should ever out which is a strategic a\nLot of the nation yeah so basically give them control over the gym every subsequent pass they get a point for passing\nOpposing blockers legally so again thinking about that legal that uh that please let like moving point score a or that moving ball or that every time that jam or passes and opposing blocker legally they got a point for them\nSo again it's the blockers working with the cameras to create those points situations and to create those points wow\nThat is going on it there's a lot going on and I think the things that people problem is is that first thing is that they had to shake at us like notoriety and they're like now you're\nIn charge of what's happening next and everybody's like on it you know that that's interesting I mean that's that's complicated it's often yes yeah I I'm curious I just want to know again 'cause I'm not I mean I grew up on roller skating but not in the sense that you all talk about so I Want to know\nLike you can answer one or two questions the best move that you've done like that you're most proud of that you had like you know a hall of fame like record it'll be on there or like the worst like ... like pick one or both or on a circle so I don't know\nWho's going first you know I read your [laughter] so my um my biggest crashed I caught my biggest crash\nWas in my first ever game and a\nSize of rocky my first game playing the clot squad and ah I made the mistake of course of turning my back to the track and just the right way ... came up and just clear she just clean my clock I went down\nSo hard that like and it was right in front of the bench and it was at the coliseum so like all of fans up there it was one of those hits where everybody just goes\nCode [laughter] and my whole\nVenture right there in front of me and they go their eyes get why they go are you okay and I was like yeah and they just stood up and got back in ... I wasn't hurt or anything but it was a really really big hit and then when it was really stuck with\nForever I Love to jump back up and got back in ... oh yeah and that is the way I look for yeah yeah and you don't really have time because if you were on the floor you're ...\nFor that other jam or to pass without having to make any effort and you know so as a block or you want to be in front of that opposing jam or at all times because if she passes you she just got your point oh\nYou can't have that can't have that ability purpose protective gear and the heads are all very legal it's safe you know there is no throwing elbows like back in the day shrimp and you go to the penalty box trained\nWe train muscle trait and when we I'm part of our training and practices to learn how to fall and build that muscle memory so that when you go down in the game you're falling in a safe way that you're not going to injure yourself\nOK yeah good we're proud because I think a lot of guys we don't want to you know competition we want to see well after it as well what's your most famous\nI wouldn't say famous so like I said I grew up in the skating rink I grew up doing something called jam skating it's it's kinda like over is dance it's kinda like dance but like you usually don't like hip hop music or you know whatever and so I grew up skating without toast jobs\nSo this is my uh this is my rookie year actually I'm I'm not going to be a rookie as of friday but so I like roller derby for a couple of years uh so my biggest thing was getting used to wearing ... skates\nThat'll trip you up if you're not you literally [laughter] I done and I would just be like skating along in that state brand lady you had a practicing it'd be like just like [laughter]\nIt took me so long to get you into stops but yeah that's that's kinda my thing is yelling at my toes so you're famous for having to really learn a mating with Joseph and not even getting pushed by going over there and yeah nobody I mean nobody theory I'm just I'm On the ground and that is the same rates right what am I even\nUm you know a ... have been skating a long time uh I've had a lot of people and fallen down a lot so I'm I'm just going to say that I Am I think I'm well known sometimes we're taking really big hits a and falling down real big backwards in like ... other blockers\nBut that does lead to sometimes that good like just feet would help in the air [laughter] right down into like Alice says like you you fall like\nThat and you're just like get up get up to get up get I have to think it's more of the like the like nope nope not going to stay there because you hear the whole grab and grow older or no you're not going to get up and going to get back in they're totally unfazed just like I don't know what as the ... and then later like\nWhoa [laughter] and I wish everyone out there could be it the expressions and the actual physical movement that's happening here right now because\nThe lady's just went through every moment with me [laughter] I didn't get to share it was already killed a lot but I feel like I was there it was pretty cool um we're gonna take it out a quick break to have more music um but it was going to put a little mini plug in next we're going to talk about an event that's coming up that we'd love to have everyone involved and in some way or another so\nThat is December ... but we're going to listen to okay and the goal real quickly again welcome indigo\n[noise]\nPots around here I got [noise] [noise] [noise]\nOkay ah first of all thanks for having me I Can't think of a cooler crew to have my intro to war it um so my first time that I played it was an original it's got a salesman song and then they said the cover and I'm going to need my cousin ivy to join me\nYeah bring her up for this one here is you know the court and this is called I Would let you on science so you know when they come in at a chill out whatever besides that one\nMm Mm Mm Mm Mm\nMm Mm\nMm\nMm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm\nAh I when I came home by and\nSees the yeah I don't know\nMy son\nWho\nOh Don upset that well the ... ... ... and healthy everyone has the price of times I have to\nIt by not good point oh ... oh yeah and then the fans who only because I was trying to fit in\nI'm In uh I'm Evan ...\nIn ... some yeah not don't show up oh Mm Mm but ... we watch them then knock it off to the ... and just be key from laced in high\nSchool I was like ... by\n...\nThey had\nWill light you\nKnow the last oh oh oh\n\nCome on come on and tell me some men tell me some or I'm ...

nine W Archie medicine\nLet's do a quick recap of what we just heard here rise to fall got things going with in the wrong hands\nCultural warfare politic kill\nThat you were in an old doubled drivers song die self explanatory rats conflict and central disorder from Chicago that contact and just say hey we got this band and we send you some music we listen to what we're like yeah definitely will be happy to play it and it was that easy\nHere about a metal band and you have good original material\nFeel free to send it to us and we'll feel free to play it and they actually sent me a couple of CDs too so I Want to thank Rob pets all the geo we're sending media CDs it'll be in my car\nAnd I appreciate you sending some use it to place so I've got chaos to be here with no further do\nThere we go [laughter] and you went to a I got Steve here and Joe Joe\nSo we're gonna talk a little bit about the split you did with turnout you've got three songs on there which earning a player but we'll talk a little bit first so how did the split come into play or [noise] yeah I was just an idea\nBetween a U.S in Chicago ... here and not you know trying to get a you know some Midwest black metal hot there which is not a whole lot of uh\nIt's just kind of an idea we work really hard on it and kinda focused on ah\nThe idea of an eclipse of you know kind of eclipse sing together so a basic concept than uh the artwork kinda displays and a little bit I see that yeah so that's kinda how I came into play and we just took it our ways and came out with what we got here today\nSo I guess I'll talk about the lyrical inspiration for the songs in the next after we plan but um how long have you guys been together like two thousand Thirteen I think okay I've I've heard the name around for quite a while now\nSo I I was talking to us yet off the air so tragic death is just kind of on hiatus right now 'cause I think last time your ear you're here with tragic death\nOh yeah yeah ... or join I also play in a tragic that uh you know that's actually based out of California now so we try to make it out there and do what we can vote on you know long distance does definitely made a little bit difficult to write stuff\nYou know actually last night we just got done track and vocals for the newest album for tragic that I Would say anybody who knows of that man should expect some new material for that pretty soon but you know is Wisconsin based band chaos if he's pretty much the main focus out here in the Midwest now\nThat's cool it's good technical black metal good production I was very impressed with it yeah thanks man there's not a ton of black metal bands in this area but the ones that are around I think are are pretty good\nYou know I think the ones that are around really you know you you got to make a a huge effort to kind of stand out and with what we have and they do an excellent job of that who else in the scene or are you impressed with at this point you know that's a great question or\nI'll answer for myself uh I I really like ... they are so great I'm definitely got that great black metal ... to it\nThere is a terror not obviously just the main focus saw for for the split\nEspecially if they're they're a grape and other Chicago\nBut ah you know their song or to own a ... that's a good band that I have not heard yeah they're pretty good they're really doomed based as well but yeah they got a lot of black mental elements and another band that I personally really enjoy playing with is a\nOh man what the heck I can never infertile alter yeah oh screw up those guys' names in front of all their man but what are they from I Believe out all Clair yeah so\nWent to high school and will clear yeah there's some cool bans around Wisconsin but you got kind of dig deep and but just keep looking never saw it as clear as a hotbed for black mental exactly [laughter] yeah so you gotta make do with what we get out and they do an excellent job so that's been I really enjoy\nSo you've got to show coming up we do ... where's that going to be a ... okay you know that that places really starting to get going\nYeah I really like yeah I played there a couple of times now it's one of my other bans in both shows have been pretty good they're there hasn't been what I Would consider a metal club here in a while and\nThat's almost be getting ... self as what I Would consider to be a metal club or a ... a good cross section of different types of metal bands playing there\nThey definitely do a good job of uh bringing the metal out and you know to me nothing pairs better with metal than me I automatically think Vikings and stuff you know as we can have means so yeah we're looking forward to who you're playing with\nWe actually got to a band um doom fist that's I've heard of them actually yeah good buddy of mine she had a\nYou know he's a good buddy of the metal scene in general man that guy is a a good force for the metal scene and definitely doing fishes bans check a new one project of his\nAnd then there's another band who who else was playing with us a hunger man yeah hunger hunger in space it out on a man but yeah hunger moon and there are definitely another black metal band to keep keep an eye out there most of the more of the kind of like post black metal that you kind of hear of like I\nKind of along the lines of I hate to mention that because it's such a cliche nowadays but the death having kind of style you know I hate ... yeah [laughter] yeah I don't blame him\nThe overrated dog ... there's a lot of other ... I'm going to be a great band they're great man yeah\nOkay let's get to the music itself I'm going to play the three songs up your sports will turn right and then we'll come back and talk about this on ... you want to ensure the first one is called citrus are true that was enough that correctly the drop grew yeah to me while ago [laughter]\nThey're basically comes from a couple of with the essence I guess so to speak it's a basic ... ... what a tactic remains is the other side of a sudden oh yeah you guys talking about the darker side of things yeah\nWell I Am happy to be playing the speech was innocent charity rape no first and only on much\n\nUm\n\nSay\n[noise]\nMhm [noise] [noise] man\n\n[noise] again and again man\n\n\n\n\nDa and and\nAnd [noise]\n[noise]\n\nNice to speak to this specific\n\n... and\n\nThat are put on your\nTo play around with\nOver the last ... ballet and I found I write offs\nDon't know when you're married and ask them [laughter]\n[noise]\nLast year he would do\nAnd China but by the time and\nAnd [laughter] to be patrolled\nOther end of the two\nA a\nA ...

candidate I'm Mike White who's the Green Party candidate a doctor in La Crosse and a twenty year military veteran And Arnie ends who's at MIT grad and who's running as independent starting his own party called the Wisconsin party all of us are frozen out of the process\nTo clearly were not being represented you know mhm [noise] so\n... if it if there's one big obstacle in nearly that you can overcome when isn't\nWell I'd have to say it's money in politics okay um because we see especially at the federal level but at the state level too\nThat our representatives in Congress\nDon't even write their own bills anymore and they don't read bills they complain every day some of them complain every day about the fact that\nThey're handed bills to vote on that or hundreds of pages long that they have to vote on in a couple of hours ... um they complain that the honest ones complain about um the agency's write their own bills to be passed an expected to be passed and then a lot of cases lobbyists write bills and hand them to\nUm to legislators to pass or put them in committees\nAnd if you're a ... a person that Congress and you don't play along\nThen they basically take a bill away from you give it to somebody else\nThere is this a I'm a Facebook um video series called the swap right now where it's it's getting you know talking directly to people who are currently serving U.S Congress who valley the same thing so I'm a lot of it as money mhm right now if you want to be if you want to share a committee in Congress\nYou have to commit to raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for your party so for example ways and means which is very\nThey set the agenda for for the congressional sessions sessions um that's about six hundred and fifty thousand dollars because it's a powerful position\nIn because you get a lot of campaign contributions as something that people want to do if they're sitting in Congress but that's the tradeoff they make they have to go so that you are and see the DNC and raise that sort of money then that's how our government currently works\nAnd we see from uh the election process here in Wisconsin too that are quite often the candidates that people want even amongst Democrats are Republican candidates aren't the ones who get case in point Bernie Sanders and twenty sixteen ... he won Wisconsin yet the delegates\nFor the at the DNC to the Democratic national convention went for for Hillary and that's not Wisconsin wanted on the ballot\nUm and that's not he says he's got totally flipped around because Hillary Clinton was the money candidate and Bernie Sanders is not the woman to\nThe deep pockets and that sort of support from the national ... how do we have a kind of well see we have [laughter] we've got a different way of looking at the other parties do hear a lot of uh talk about campaign finance reform and I'm not opposed to that but I think the problem is\nThat it's naive to think that McCain fined gold which is the big um campaign finance reform in ten or Fifteen Years ago\n[noise] uh that ... you know having setting up rules isn't really gonna work because there's always a way\nTo bribe somebody ... let's face it it's bribery there's always a way to bribe somebody really the best way to do it and this is really a centerpiece of of my campaign is more local control so those things that government does\nThat can be done locally and I think because of the Internet because of\nHow we live now because of our society and our economy where more able to do that we don't need to send people to Madison or to Washington to sit together to meet and decide things we can do all that mean huge corporations have\nAn organizations have meetings on line every single day there's no reason why we can't get things done um statewide went wild legislators are still in the districts but I'm the more things are that are local\nUh especially things like schools but if we're if we if we are pushing more taxation to local levels\nAnd more authority or more decisions that it's more transparent and you can't fool people as much if they can go down to their city county or city council meeting there um county board meeting whatever and actually face the people that are\nThat there that are making decisions on their behalf mhm um then that that are really meaningful right not to go to county board meeting a lot of the things that the county does\nIs are mandated by the state and we like to return that authority back to the county level and the and the city level so that people can make their own decisions on a local level and and government can work at that level much more transparently and that makes it much more difficult to influence that with money if you think about for example when a huge lobbies in Wisconsin is a\nThe construction of the road the road builders\nThey would find it a lot more difficult to influence legislators if they had to go to Seventy two county border things [laughter] you know as opposed to what they can do in the in the bowels of the of the state Capitol in terms of influencing budgets are how projects get done or whatever and it's just one example\n... so of course and I have is with the Libertarian Party is so what do we do like we've been at this for a while right saying we need change we need change we're not allowed at the table how this year came we say we're going to take the Libertarian Party that we're going to take the view Anderson's or the world seriously\nWell I'll give a complement to a lot of the media they've started reporting a me as somebody who's um one of the Bible candidates\nBut basically it started with a Charles Franklin and the Marquette law school polling he decided this cycle that I got enough support to years ago and the libertarians in general I'd gotten the support maybe through the Gary Johnson a campaign and twenty sixteen\nThat we deserve to be offered in the first line so when when they call a market cause people and asked who do you want for governor mhm they say Walker ... and they don't go walk her ears and that on the second question say well if there are other candidates included\nSo that's a more realistic polling um debates or a big one but you know to be honest with you I don't think as many people you know we complain about debate access and and I think it's a legitimate thing but um I think more and more people are getting their information\nOnline and not really watching the televised debates I'd our time finding the U.S Senate debate between Baldwin it ... ...\nWhenever it was a week ago friday was the first one\nUm it wasn't easy to I mean you can find a public television but it wasn't something that was in every household on that stream t._v. now oh yeah yeah exactly [laughter] so I think people but the biggest barrier and this is I think it's a ... higher brain can be very hard is that people talk about politics in terms of bipartisanship both parties that sort of thing that we really\nSee the world of her condition to see the world and uh right versus left bipartisan sort of way and\nThe intellectual discussion just isn't isn't that it's not that way it's not that simple\nIt's not linear it's not bipolar and if we just see options and are willing to not to not give up our vote to a lesser of two evils sort of thing ... which is a huge huge thing people say well you know\nUh I Can't I Can't vote for you I support what your what your what your campaigning on but I Can't let\nScott Walker back in office another four years so I'm going to go for Tony ... or vice versa whenever it might be that people need to remember that their vote their voices their vote their voters their voice and that if they do that and they want to send a message to the you know politics and to society and to the government that\nThere are other things to be considered then you have to vote and look at it as a more of a long term process and not keep telling yourself or be told that this is the biggest election of our lifetime so we can't afford to vote\nOur conscience that lets you also have a protest coming up for this Friday night up at night in a friday night the the the debate is that channel Fifteen and for a drive in Madison we're going to be protesting from six until nine what kind of liberty so before we are several or do they have another question for you know share our life\nWhat are we do what do we do to educate the populace the people to make them more interested in being involved in politics is their plan is an idea what can we do because we debate but often we hear about\nDoesn't seem to pop loses in ... I think they just need to look and not sit back and expect to be told what their options are and who to vote for and you know be hand hand fed their their candidates and the people that do go out and look ahead of time do consider all their options\nBut a lot of people unfortunately are so used to feeling like they don't have a choice that feel it in an engaged disengaged from politics and either don't vote which is about half of the population or don't decide or even investigate till the last week or the last few days\nAbsolutely who is that fair enough so ... we'll start if you could tell us a little bit about if I learned as a listener\nSure uh there's either center has\nBeen around a since two thousand six and ... were based in Milwaukee but we work nationally and internationally our mission is to foster civil dialogue and invite trust in the midst of differences and so we do that\nThrough training facilitators both youth and adults and working inside organizations inside communities to really help people have difficulty\nConversations in ways that help people feel heard how a truth be told and ah and civil dialogue to to happen on your\nRoof or were you tell us a little bit about the center for community stewardship and maybe ... how the partnership ... centers in front of our communities through she developed over\nWell that would be great um the center for community stewardship ah works with people who are\nWorking to make their community better through um [noise] serving the physical sponsor for a start up organizations as well as for ... services and you're actually part of how this came to be um Heywood as part of one of our communities\nThat has been meeting for about a year and a half now to talk about what kind of service we can provide the community in one of the things we wanted to do was to be able to have um large scale dialogues and the community around challenging issues and so\nWe were contemplating how to do the best and found as I learned center and we're excited about what they were during the Milwaukee and so we reached out and we partnered um started talking\nAnd from that came a wonderful project on the north side of medicine awesome so I have a question\nAnd and I I I Know the answer to it but I Know there's a lot of people out there that's listening that maybe don't um so we talk about facilities and in circles and um [noise]\nUm education on how to have conversations okay so it seems logical to most people how to have a conversation so explain what's the basis behind this\nUh well I Would say that a lot of people spend a lotta time bringing people to the table they say we need to have this conversation it's important and and it usually is very important to across a on a major issue\nAnd yet I I've seen that then when people are brought to the table there's not a lot of intention expertise about the structure about\nThe conversation is going to happen and\nThat's why we have taboo topics the things that you're not supposed to talk about around the dinner table for example because we know how those conversations go toxic communication put downs shouting each other down there's very little listening and those kinds of conversations\nSo we'll have a picture of how we would like a conversation that go we have an idea about what's important to talk about but I think that more and more we are lacking uh the skills to have civil dialogue mhm and so what a professional facilitator brings and what are\nWhat are our organizations bring to the table are are people who are trained to hold the space or to allow other people to really ... listen to others uh who might disagree with them a who might be coming from very different points of view and experiences from them\nAnd also to feel deeply heard and that's one of the things this either center has in the past couple of years led thousands over ten thousand people in in civil dialogue and the number one thing we hear\nFrom people as they say I just want to be heard I'm not I don't feel heard and um when people don't feel heard all kinds of things happen that are are\nThat are challenging a much much more challenging for society to come back from um so we provide the structure where each person has a chance to speak when at a time\nUm and we slow the conversation down intentionally through the structure and the facilitators there to bring people back to agreements that they make and that's a really important part as well that ah [noise]\nWe ask people to think about the agreements that they'll make participants themselves um that really transform a dialogue from what could be a debate or an argument to something that is transformative notes or rock tools and of course ... yeah [noise]\nIt in Madison or or whatever\nOf those communities are too also and and individuals who are paid to facilitate from the community um to really lead these conversations\nAdditionally part of this program is a planning committee in any neighborhood we go in 'em and we facilitate in\nA again we're using facilitators from the community represented in representing the community but also we have a planning committee from the community compulsive residents that\nThat really um identified the scenes and issues for that community so [noise] but we don't want as well you all need to talk about XYZ mhm and this kind of about us without us\nAh um initiative so it really is is driven by residents for residents and we'll be doing another office illustrator training so if this sounds like something that you are interested in definitely I'm being talked about\nThat we're going to give the website to its community dash stewardship dot org a forward slash north side\nUm where you can go and register so also I'm getting children involved that's an interesting concept to me and I do want to thank you because you said something really interesting we're talking about conversations circles and things like that but you also pointed out a lot of listening and\nIn the first time I had gone through when the listening was a very important thing 'cause most people if they actually get in touch with their real selves they realize we're not very good listeners and so\n[laughter] we're always especially in a conversation 'cause we're always planning on what we're going to say next right and in a these conversation or\nThese circles that you guys actually you know hosting support 'em once you're done speaking you do nothing but listen mhm um you can't respond so you're that that programming that we have in our head that is to auto\nPilot and start to um create responses is no longer necessary so I did love that you pointed out the listening portion of\nBut back to the kids how um how do parents get their kids involved in something like this\nWill use are absolutely invited to attend a we have seen that um youth being heard is absolutely important and use or being involved in the design and planning from the very beginning\nUm their voices need to be heard and so that's why ah the listening circle model\nUh is is important because the youth get as much time as an officer to speak and to share if they want to no one's ever put on the spot to say anything but\nAnd I thought that that was really passionate for me because you know when people do get pulled over and they haven't paid that parking ticket that it's not just a reality for them they're not just a victim in a car that it happens literally that everybody in that officer that's pulling you offered me also have a parking ticket or unpaid\nEnron and unbeknownst to them and so it it is a very human\nThe process so are you a list on our\nSite today the October twenty four in November twenty eight for the next listening circles I have to ask you something that you're thankful for about ... about being here in about this moment in this\nTime I I Would have to say I'm thankful for residents who who are courageous and show up even though I'm they've experienced trauma\nUh I I Would have to say the officers that show up even though you know they're coming to his face and no one wants to ... ... wants to walk into a space and feel attacked and so\nWe're ah I I guess I'm and thankful for for everyone who who who's\nBrave like that we we we don't talk about creating safe spaces as as a guarantee but we do talk about creating brave spaces\nAnd so just the the courage to that those residents had to step in that's like you and Lisa\nYeah I'm really thankful for all of the wonderful people on the north side they're helping to make this happen the north side is our pilot a location for this project and there are just a lot of wonderful people in that community\nTrying to make it a I'm a better place and so I'm really thankful to I'm piloting it on our side\nThank you thank you press is Michelle thank you to Lisa for joining us [noise] thank you for ... for doing this thank you day thank you ...

I don't know [laughter]\nIt's called fun home the musicals called fun home a forward theater as putting it together and if you'd like to have a conversation with us join us and uh have questions or thoughts from Matt in Claire maybe you've seen the\nThe play the musical and have some thoughts of your own we'd love to hear it give us a call at area code six so eight to five six two zero zero one reason elicit away send us a message on our Facebook page or pages of public affairs eighty nine point nine F. M. Madison\nSo\nI forgot what my next question was I had [laughter] part of this is you know and maybe this is just me reflecting my moment in time as a forty something you're older but I really appreciate plays and when you when it seems like\nYou realize you didn't have the answers as a kid you don't have the answers as an adult very much so life is always complicated and beautiful and all of these things and I mean I think that's the power of a reflective kind of a piece that this is a coming of age story because it includes\nSort of the callers uh Allison but also sort of this looking back in and\nI Want it to almost be like in the end you realize I never had the answer is I never will and I'm just going to keep you know going forward kind of\nThe army and I think without giving too much or where it's very much Allison storage are still you know ... ... whose putting this this whole thing together and and it's about her search yes for for answers then unreal isn't yeah\n... there's there's there's no coincidence that that her coming out to her dad and then his suicide\nHappened almost within the same time frame and so I think for for her you know the impact it had on how you right yeah and so those two things are very very connected to hurt her coming out and her dad finding out her dad was gay and then killing himself\nAnd so I think and unfortunately there there are a lot of things that are never going to be answered or uncovered you know and who hasn't had that with somebody that's passed in their life and you're like oh I'm never going to find out now what was really going on and so um it really is her\nIt's looking back on some of these moments in childhood and being like oh on the surface this is what I thought it was but now that I Know what I Know\nI'm again we were just talking about a ... a net a blend them you know how to keep talking about hindsight is a gift and you know when when once you go back and you look at some of these things and you realize what was really going on\nUm I think Allison is going back to some of these memories and like oh this is what I thought it was really in this and um\nAnd it's just again yeah excavating and putting those\nPieces together constantly asking the question of the issues sort of watching the memory it happen or an introduction to interject and call him a letter is that we would have thought that what happened did you why why is that you guys still\nQuestioning herself like she ever I mean she jokes about that in her and she she wrote journals I'm growing up and and and even in her journal writing it's like this happened I think\nUm and I you know blah blah blah and it was so she's even as a young age was constantly questioning like what is the true your minor league fame was saying that yeah exactly exactly or consent mhm\nClaire can you tell us a little bit about forward theater as well you know this is the tenth anniversary or with the there is an overture center yeah there are resident yet rather than company don't even have ... yes yeah the play house one of\nThem and is this the first musical that is ... first ever musical been seeing there was certainly singing and then and now The Simpsons\nAnd oh yeah ... that's what I've learned that it was already out of it the grass [laughter] but yes this is officially\nThe first musical theater piece that forward theater's doing it in their tenth anniversary season and their first season where we've we've moved to for shows instead of three so they're expanding um we've hired on a new managing director Julie Swenson which is really really exciting and so we're building and growing and\nUm yeah it's a really really really exciting time for forward theater and there is so true I Love working for this company for so many reasons but there is so true to their mission statement which is to provide\nAnd artistic home\nFor people in Wisconsin and that's that's actors directors designers technicians they they provide a professional place to create wonderful art\nAnd they also have a civic duty to the community and so everything that they choose to do is not only like let's bring something to Madison that people aren't going to get to maybe see anywhere else but also how is it going to connect and engage with our community and and how can we make those bonds stronger it's not just you know serving providing that that resident home friday is also serving the community and a wonderful\nThing that I Love about it too is that not only is it certain community and here are stories that that we think will be of interest of the community but then it actually literally engages with the I mean you know many companies are like\nHere we are presented this and now you take it right and and there's a talk back after every single moment of a former theater show and so we really get to engage with the people who\nKnow how did your process and we all have it together and and and that's really special and and uh I\nI Do I live in Milwaukee and best of Milwaukee um and do a lot of work with um for stage children's theater there and there's a talk back after every one of those performances as well so we got to you know\nI actually the family yeah and and and the kids\nReally you know are interested in like how did you do that to these ... these are facts and to be a slam in terms of a little bit more about the seems to play but it's\nI Love that aspect of of a\nIt's a reminder also that that we are all just people in the same room together and we've told your interests are yeah if we can hold you the story but we're we're people who've told you the store we aren't actually these characters we are we are all taking part in this thing together and it doesn't exist\nWithout all of the people in this room that um actors designers director\nAudience technicians like everybody it doesn't exist without all of those folks and so it's really great to have that conversation afterwards\nThat that's one of the secrets of success yeah or the other and they never got thrown out or you know Madison repertory before that you know in its attempts to be successful you know professional theatre but but it\nIt ... it didn't succeed and the end ultimately ... forward theater not only has succeeded but thrive definitely definitely yeah they they they they are doing everything right in the way that they engage with the community and the way that they treat everyone that comes in\nAnd also um require a lot of um you know some of the member to uh taking care of them at home so that program started because um W. to require um family member who are able to get to participate in employment or\nJob training and and um there was no one to care for them at home or to kill time or you know kind of like a provider\nCase manager and all that so they were getting kicked out of the ... [laughter] and then um get shell started to a kid or the services that are appropriate for this population in two thousand so along with a family member who are able to either protect\nBut in an apartment or um job training to meet the requirement or whatever you choose\nNot to win the ... start program started and then the core of services um mentor out and then um since um there's not much of services available to this population\nAnd the language barriers also play a big part of written and transportation also and then um he was a difficult to\nHave access a services to this population so get your house instead of just providing mental services ... it's providing um wraparound services including case management how much more and\nCitizenship um housing as a side all of that and I wanted to focus a little bit of those sort\nOf an all those other piece why should because you know I think I Want to make sure everyone understands what we're talking about you know I've had I've definitely uh gone through periods in my life where I've you know gone to a therapist to give me some assistance and working my way through things that have happened to me\nAnd I go to the therapist I have my forty five minute session and I go home that's not what 'cause she ... house it is\nCompletely different you know it's like a destination it is\nI'm kind of like one ... one stop shop and again are more likely than um we have a psychiatrist on board psychologist\nAnd clinicians who are on Muslim levels on um social work and also um staff or doing case manager and\nOn but also and um [noise]\nDue to the complexity of the you know the needs in the population so it was founded on we have to provide everything in order to meet the needs just not not only the mental health piece only but we need to cater services like citizenship\nOn housing I'm also employment some of it and then um you know cannot like as a sigh all of that and I also wanted to talk for the better more about the your citizenship yes plan because um\nYou know many people will wonder why you know sit\nIs it should become part of the mental health services\nAnd that's a really important question and also important point to a point now too is that um\nYou know we came from a country it's a room by communist and um I don't want it to compare the two of ice or anything like that but I'm In communist country people would you know are coming to the night or taking family member and then they want to come back\nAnd then I'm Serious citizenship in this country provides a sense of security sense of feeling safe and then um the easing the tension that you know family\nFeel like in you know I Would say I'm become an belong to this community and and I can access to the other services are available to the citizenship of the United states and and I truly\nA and Americans if you get a citizen and then they won't have to worry about you know I was coming knocking door and taking them away or or us thing you know people to\nPut it into um highs I'm holding center that so that's a really important because I'm then I'm\nI think two three weeks ago right now I came to ... some of the people out of fear right and then that creates a lot of years something like that then that's citizenship would prevent all of that to happen to this population\nHere for the fuel saving them to feel more American Nights and then that would also reduce them ... or the tension or ... and that will help them to live a better life\nI'm a piece that will allow them to heal and Tim to somehow move on from the trauma that impacted their life which trauma that I Can't even imagine the terror and and and how intense and\nIt must be to try and work through that and how important it is to have arrived to understand that so people would come to ... house\nBecause that was a place where they felt understood and they trusted people so they could have a conversation about housing and education\nThese things because you were a welcoming community\nYes ah to get where where are our took you know more than ten years to work with the community to gain the trust\nAnd also to um you know have them overcome some of the stigma saw in the ... because I'm not to any culture but nothing mentor house to present the highest stigma in our culture and and especially among\nComing from a country where I'm very limited um western treatment and then the mental health\nConcept is not exist in our home country before we come here\nAnd then people wouldn't anything that I you know and then I'm mentor how it's so it's I'm being labeled as someone who is not normal or a crazy and then people will tend to stay away from the beginning when we provide mental health services to this population\nNo one will come to get the treatment was you know I'm services until the ... been seen by the primary doctor's for many times until they\nCould no longer find anything wrong with them and then they come to a mental health services to get suffers from us and and meet with ...\nIt wasn't even saying they would think they need it because I so stigmatized it wasn't even id and be blind\nRight and then we wouldn't even know that um are the harsh up or the experience that they had in their home country the cost of their chronic illness or the mental ... and a lack of sleep and not the nightmares all of those\nWhat has ... has has been open since two thousand since ... and you serve almost a hundred and fifty to two hundred people every year with services and programs and and and their families as well\nYes um we um [noise] yes and the people who are we just uh within the program and so it's a numbering um two hundred eighty two or three hundred clients including among the ocean can vote in but I'm the program\nNot only for the individual who are we just the to the program will also provide services the family member and some of them work and that's what so I Would definitely servings the whole community and then um [noise]\nIf here's a you know what we have been telling people all the time that I'm you know to really function in the family we would provide you know treatment or service to\nElderly or a member of the family who are or were impacted\nBy the you know why experience so they can function better not allow the family member to strive or succeed in their education or you don't have a lot of stress in your home for example\nIf a family who is dysfunctional and parents who were coming home yelling shouting at a time than children's or younger generation wouldn't be able to concentrate or um succeed in there and you know educational employment ...\nAnd so the reason we're talking specifically about because she has right now is because after being open since two thousand and the success for Eighteen years uh all of a sudden because she has found out that it was potentially going to close for\nLack of funding and you found out this summer with very little notice right\nI'm from the less Eighteen year with other than you know the program it's been going where well and um eventually um we lost the funding from MGM contract which is you\nKnow state late contracts contracts are now transportation services or is this\nAnd then um were not told of the contract and then somehow you know some of them who\nJust didn't reply back and there was a pastor due date so they told me that contract without us knowing and then um we found out that um we're no longer have the contract and then we are in financial um\nUm you know short fall and then we moved into CCS but when you see as community comprehensive services or some medical and building a ... and the county\nThe code because you know you need the services you need to write officially provide so that you get the funding for the services you\nDirect suburb services will be reimbursed a hundred percent from the states and then we didn't have enough time to do that and then was we were told by Jenny
