O. R. T. eighty nine point nine of public affair with Ali ... I have ever Mitchell in the studio with me today\nI'm ever it thank you so much for being here in the ... really appreciate them to uh how you doing good girl\nI Am going to like you get to look at Michelle Obama because this is where I'm writing last the last person I had with Lisa Graves that she gave me a little Michelle Obama no book I was like I'm going to write all my interview questions in this book um [noise] it is\nI I don't think we could start today without acknowledging what happened this past weekend without acknowledging the the ... the lives lost that tree of life synagogue I'm so folks who are just trying to worship\nI'm Alive lost the the two grandparents who were who were gunned down in front of their grandchild or I Know that you spoke at the vigil I'm Wondering if you can can tell our audience a y you spoke at the vigil or why you felt like it was important for you to be there and and tell us a little bit about what you had to say\nLimited in specific ways may not even able to identify those needs for themself yep [noise]\nThat's crazy and the parents may not know and the parents may not know so when you would you send a kid and you know that that's on the other side of that sentence 'em ... how do you make that decision what what makes it worth it for you to send to cater to Lincoln Hills or to send a kid the corrections or to send a kid\nTo any institution where they might be harmed abused neglected a medically or you know not supported in the ways that they need to be other ways that are developmentally appropriate\nIs a very difficult decision I mean it is the hardest decisions I have to make sometimes and you know uh and that's why I say I believe in the graduate approach was one of the hardest things that you know we're trying to approach um\nYou know the steps that we take in a manner that's consistent with the growth of the child so you know I like I said before we never I never start there always are All right let's figure out what kind of treatment plans can we work on right now I go home\nYou know stay out of trouble or do you know don't do this\nRight you said in the young people to reading book\nI mean books movies you know to try to educate them about what the system looks like and what ultimately might look like if they continue doing this for\nLooking at alternative that promote young people's growth I I read this\nA well teaching a couple of weeks ago to my students and I've read the blue aside have you read the ... I I feel like everyone should just read the blue aside once a year um but I read it this year and it struck me a reading the forward which hadn't happened as much for me you know I usually really dive into the tax and the and the characters [noise]\nUm but I was reading the forward and I'm just going to read it to you when I began writing the blue is I I was interested in something else not resistance to the contempt of others are ways to deflect it but a far more tragic and disabling consequences of accepting rejection as legitimate as self evident\nI knew that some victims of powerful ... turned out to be dangerous violent re producers of the enemy who ... humiliated them over and over\nOther surrender their identities melt into a structure that delivers a stronger persona they lack most\nOthers however grow beyond it but there are some who collapse silence Lee and anonymously with no voice to express\nOr knowledge that they are invisible to the death of self esteem can occur quickly and easily and children before their ego has legs so to speak coupled with the vulnerability of youth within different parents dismissive adults in a world in which it's language laws and images\nReinforce to spare the journey to destruction is sealed\nFolks who are just tuning and you are listening to\nW. O. R. T. eighty nine point nine I Am here with judge ... Michel and we are talking\nAbout juvenile justice [noise] how does how does that passage speak to you and the work that you're doing how does what Toni Morrison is articulating a\nI mean that resonate with you I mean the sad reality is that uh I mean majorities kids who were senators institutions were invisible\nI mean the the whole process is to make them invisible um you know the you know what you could have children that never come back record you could have children who never have an opportunity to have any one\nA visit them whether in those institution um and you know and the fact that they're public defender appointments and wants to disposition orders into which means that their sentence\nA means that they don't really have an advocate for them if they would find themselves into a very complex place\nUm so you know I I don't like the idea and I think I think for the most part you know we try to put people in the black holes and we get rid of him because we out of sight out of my [noise]\nBut I I just have chosen not to do that I bring 'em I Choose to make the key is visible so I'm I bring 'em back in court all the time I make them transport them down back from making hail to bring them here if I have to send us a kid up there\nAnd I bring 'em in once a month and I just see what's going on I think they can make them be able to let them write me directly\nBecause if they ride anybody else they could stop that but they can't stop them from writing me directly I make them pay for ... so they can be able to communicate to me if things going on so I can pull them quicker and see what's happening in their life situation\nDo kids reach out to you regularly to kids reach out and ask for help\nYeah I don't have a whole bunch of them that are summed up there and so a couple that I have I mean yeah they do that and and not so much help but they give me insight into what's going on high as work and what kinds of things working mhm so that if things are not things started to go on a different direction we can pull him in and do something different [noise]\nWhen I talked to two young people about slavery I talk about slavery as a form of domestic violence um it was you know the people who who inflamed people they live together and they were often related um [noise] and when I talk about that\nTeam demand met I I talk about the Thirteen is a mammoth that's really a a shift in branding that we moved slavery from the private sector to the public sector and we moved the identity of a slave to the criminal and that was our way of saying\nYou deserve to us so what do you tell a kid who has been beaten and abused and neglected their entire life and is now sitting in a facility thinking that they deserve nothing better than the\nFirst thing I Do like it before we have to go to a citizen [noise] I may tell a trial that I'm Sorry I'm Sorry that your life\nHas put you in this position where you are being hurt that is not how life is supposed to be you nuts rules have been treated like that and I'm Sorry that even this situation unlimited resources that have have not been able to capture your attention I'm and I'm Sorry that we're in this position right now\nBecause you know for the most part I think the least the kids that I have I have this and\nThey they understand because I take time to explain what this means I'm there that's where I was going back to the boiler I don't start with that I start with a conversation about are you giving me input into what you need I Will make them give you what you need\nAnd when it gets to a place where um you know they can't uh no longer balance and then we make the shift toward you know okay maybe is a care facility where you could try and get some other a resource to support you may be a better option for you and for some it works and some doesn't\n[noise] how old\nDo you have to be to be tried as an adult him the state of Wisconsin tried as an adult yeah [noise]\nUh I don't know if\nThere's a you can be waved to into the court how early can you be waived into without court\nI Will say fifty\nI ever had yesterday that you can be as young as ten years old and waved and to adult court and the state of Wisconsin\nWhere I Know that you I mean the juvenile system doesn't start charging you do you uh ten years old mhm now haven't I haven't seen any\nHere's where the ten year old you know or even Fifteen year old younger a been a waved to adult court\nSo the majority of students or young folks who are uh tried as an adult are sixteen Seventeen yeah how do you how do you feel about that do you think are sixteen or Seventeen year old should be tried as an adult\n[noise] minute as difficult I Can't because I Can't speak to you know what I've seen because I haven't seen those kind of cases are I Know that in Milwaukee I Know a lot of judges deal with those ... cases where\nUm you know young people or sixteen Seventeen eight years Fifteen sixteen Seventeen are creating a you know uh doing things with the community that does harm or individuals and individuals in a very tragic way\nSo we live in a society where two year old shoot people on a regular basis but like we live in a society where where violence has been normal lives where\nAre you know we're young people have access if it's harder you know if you give my four year old so I think is a ... you know she didn't questionable character at this point in her life I'm just gonna be honest I think it's my job as an adult I sell your friend asked her mom to keep encouraging her to use her body for peace but if you had her a rock\nChances are she will throw that rock right\nShe shouldn't be given a you shouldn't hand her a butter knife right if you give her so so some of what happens I think is that we put kids in situations where they have access to to really dangerous scenarios and then we say well you shouldn't have done that well you should have never been in the position to do that ...\nAnd ... and that's where I think that's why I think the conversation ... ... you know when we when I'm doing this is talking with him about you know what situations the beginning and then trying to work hard to fix the other alternatives that was and they found him\nI mean some of these kids are grown up in very tragic situation I've never seen even as a you know I went to I went to more house you know we were reading the Lewis Hi Toni Morrison deep black black power\nCommunity we'd be there for each other I've never seen in my life uh\nChildren who have nobody I've never seen that before and you know you know while there may be some you know what we're trying to figure out what to do with this\nThat that if some of these kids had\nA place to go they wouldn't be in detention in first like ... and so they should be given the same freedom as someone who had a place to go when they come in for their career and that is what I Believe needed to have and they they deserve to be there they should not have handcuffs on them because\nThey own a sanction for how they acted in a foster home\nYeah that's not criminal [noise]\nKnow the judge you know once we had some conversations and pull some statistics and so uh what the real data look like you know I think the other judges were able to come in and you know and supporting their own ways and continue that policy is shifting that presumption now coming in\nRooms or you know you ... reasons are using uber\nAbsolutely so if you are just tuning and you're listening to W. R. T. eighty nine point nine with ... with the public affairs and we've got ever Mitchell in the studio with us if you want to join the conversation or we still have a lot to talk about uh the number six zero eight to five six two thousand and wind we'd love to hear from you\nI think one of the one of the things that becomes really\nUm [noise]\nSo fascinating right when you talk about racial dynamics and education which is a lot of what I Do um a lot of people love to talk about like pie charts and graphs and all these things that show us hey a black students are being are being suspended more of their being expelled more they're being sent out of class more there are not necessarily being taught to read\n'em and and they're being arrested more well we we arrested a hundred and fourteen kids one year Ninety seven of those kids were black\nAnd so with adults look at a pie chart you know they're like oh that's very interesting but for a kid sitting in that classroom I'm sitting in the classroom and I watch all the black kids around me get targeted for discipline and I watch myself get targeted for discipline and I watch nobody\nDo anything about my ability to respect the integrity of the classroom disintegrates years um and so I think one of the things that happens when you're talking about the justice system\nIs that a lot of our young people now have grown up watching a people like themselves be shot to death by police um or be\nApprehended unfairly by police or be pushed to the ground by police um and there is a deterioration of respect and and trust for our criminal justice system [noise]\nAh ... how do you tell a kid you're accountable for what you do in a in a society uh that doesn't tell a police officer you're accountable for what you do what do we do when when a when a\nWhen a law enforcement officer makes a mistake that results in harm or death um how do we have those those same use universal standard\nAnd how people should treat one another and no matter what their job title is yeah\nI think for for young people especially those involved in court I think that it ... you're right I mean they don't have a trust of the system and they don't have any reason to trust us unless you give them one\nSo you know when when there are injustices that happened that are happening to them they have to see people who are advocating for them to get something this fair and\nI think one of the reason like a majority of my children even if they ... and I called children but the kids who are fundamental jurisdiction the reason why I think the majority of them are doing well and listen\nIs because they know that I have advocated for them and they have seen this and if we can change right Jessica's systemic barriers exist\nDoesn't mean that they have to always exist in the matter that they have I mean in you know at least they can say that you know when this was presented to me as a stemming berry and people told me it was impossible for the change\nAt least is judge for heart and it changed you know I don't I mean I can prescribe to believe that yes you know just working hard maybe good enough but we really have to see these systemic things change and shift a in a way that benefits them so that they could feel you know uh you know at least better\nAbout how we are working together you know the long term impacts of you know I'm taking my church to go see the hatred gear within you know we didn't have to move the we want our conversation because\nIt is they are angry they are frustrated they don't feel that the their bodies matter\nAnd from all the things that I'm starting to really look at and learn I mean they're they're they they have paid attention\nOn giving credit to to Alex gee that that anger is justified Mm right yeah so I I think\nYou know we we have to so often when we talk about kids they have to think about the examples that we're setting you know those things that we are teaching them are okay and so for teaching our kids that violence is okay and that sometimes there is a good reason to shoot another unarmed person\nUm [noise] it's not just about the kid right when it you know shoot somebody\nThe person to Blaine is not that to you know the person who left the gun out um\nYou know I I think that that there is there's a lot of soul searching that we have to do as a society but I Want to move into a a a slightly more positive now and just ask you what do you love about the work that you're doing right now what what inspires you to get up every day and\nYou know transform the system and work really hard and mentor kids and come up with new options in and be creative um what what do you love about what you're doing\nI mean they're the the what I Love about it is putting my power behind young people that are fighting for change I mean the to support like the young people from urban underground in the work that they did\nOn Lincoln heels and to bring them in and to let them know that they have this inside you know this person a power outage judge who they're supporting them and to see them believe again\nAnd not just the system immune system is one thing but just in blackness in of itself\nBecause I think as much as we have lost a belief systems we lost a belief in blackness as well ... are they don't believe they didn't believe that you know someone in positions of power even cared about them which will say like I couldn't you know we just had to sit and just just sit on that for a moment\nOr that I was a one of the first black man of power that they had actually sat down with and listen to you know um\nNow I have to say I love that about what you do too I Love the idea that there are kids who walk into a courtroom and have no idea who you are and immediately have some shred of relief and just looking at you as a um\nAnd by the time I get done talking to them how firing them loving own on\nThen you could tell the anxiety go from like way way way up to all the way down you know and there was some negative somebody put out some negative they said you know a report that one of the kids said oh we can't wait to get to judge Mitchell's courtroom and they spent that they spun that end\nSome negative as I say that I'm going to give these kids\nAre lighter or something like that but I as a\nKid I say why why don't you say that what does she mean but he said because I Know you hear me\n... I Know you hear me ... or whatever whatever happens happens\nOr at least I Know you hear me I Know you listen to a memo you'll see me\nAnd that was coming from a fourteen year old you know so let's you know that they they are seeking to be seen as speaking to your show so the manner which I've seen these kids and the ones who don't come back to see them change their lives be be better\nYou may ride me notes and they send me stuff they're called me after they've done the let me know we still out here I'm Still doing good\nI mean that's that's the stuff that gets me you know puts more wind back into my lungs so I can keep you know stand up and doing this for\nThe majority of students who are arrested at school the majority of students who are busted out in the in the community are our students of color and our students with disabilities um how do you how do you address making you know the racial dynamics\nUm and making sure that it is developmentally appropriate how often does a student's disability come into play how often do you say oh this kid\nIs not cognitively in a space where they could be be making a Dutch the best decisions you know so maybe they their body is sixteen I'm cognitively their eight\nYou know how how do you reconcile those those dynamics as they come up and they come up very frequently given given the data that I've looked at the\nOr the number of children that um have special\nEducation these cognitive needs\nA I I I can tell you by the time they get to me it is and if it is so significant you know I you know our appreciate restored of justice programs and those are the process of they go you know go along [noise]\nBut I'm not dealing with kids who can go to a process identify I'm Sorry I'm done with dealing with babies who have significant mental health needs and sometimes they've never been evaluated they've never they've nobody has\nWe're very ... tried to come with a plan and these babies are fifty sixty years Oh absolutely and they have been\nA I mean I get angry I just I get angry because I just think about all the children that have been done away with and you know and I know there are a lot of times people in our community they get they get afraid because you got the dog whistles are here sending messages to make them afraid of these cute\nBut I promise you have every person said that with these children and look at what the head to go through and they look at\nIt's always a question Mitch good luck\nAnd that doesn't for lenders and politics the show is produced by deanna Martinez Christian ... is our engineer you can find the archives of our previous shows\nOnline banking you have a dot ORG I'm rich and I think for [noise]\nYou are listening to W.
