water up speaking and of course the you know a synagogue given to\nHis son which is gonna be a Senegal is French speaking Gambia is small sandwich which in Senegal is English speaking\nEnough cause like in the south is a Portuguese speaking and of course guinea besides the very rich history you know it's a it's independence was\nFor a buy a miracle ... the great a great a punt African and in in in the great color and the great philosopher good quite an agricultural engineer as well so I bought for ... and that to\nKeep a couple of at the ... the independence was forced by a couple ... one of the grits cold outside of Africa if you want to actually really undecided about a\nLot of the British a movement about a radical alternatives to uh you know a ... a copy it's obviously whenever the order to check or a ... of ... walking writings enough cause a um I Would actually now\nOnto a guinea and of course uh the second folk to about this week or this past week or worse the independence of guinea\nA deserve to be so happy independence to guinea is all my guinea and people and everybody else happy independence and of course guinea has a very strong guy\nOr a a a history in terms of their independence and are back in Nineteen fifty it's also a sequel to refill mostly rejected or the goals of how to continue or for guinea to continue on the French a dummy national French Colonial rule\nHe decided to say no to French Colonial rule yes the independence why Senegal in Abidjan ivory cause I said they wanted to continue with a French or a quote on the others and and so I said result of that\nAre sick or to be was forced to suffer because I didn't need the French food out everything out to dinner\nAnd are they to given all the equipment that they couldn't take that dumpy tend to see\nAnd uh and and and cause a\nA sequel to really was forced to kind of a a lead as the country um you know and you know just do a take on the country and in that effort he also you know decided to kind of what he he developed as authentic African to try to develop on are tend to\nUm you know a African as a nation of guinea to resist or a doctor or a that French a dummy niche and he said in his famous court that uh he'd rather\nBe free I said I said Pullman than be you know I'm done ... including ... you know it'd be in a you know have wealth but you are in slavery\nSo you know it's not a you know it's better to be free and your poll\nBut to rather than having a wealth and you are actually a slave so he actually uh you know went on even in the music he decided then to form bonds across the country so every commune in every uh uh community in guinea had it on bond and and and\nYou use music to rally to communities to rally society to run into people to watch this sort of an African is him into was this aspect of all tend to African African ... over the country and in in in in actually using that to kind of mobilized to society and and and because of that\nThe musicians in guinea developed a you know on the on the sequel to really\nUm even do it because of the aspects of communism and aspect of a shot losing it didn't much of the great music of guinea didn't spread out to 'em or the parts of the war because of all the restrictions but what happened was some of the greatest bonds that are out of that of Greece all planets actually\nWin guinea like the ... jobs a national like the hard way up on like a um you know ah the the the Audubon's like uh the twenty to November buying in so many of the band saw out of I'm going to get on ... ... is our grid bonds of ... in my job of there\nAnd and and they played authentic music and because of musicians we are paid by the states\nDo we are higher than paid by the states\nThey had nothing to do but just to produce music and so they wouldn't have bustle of bonds and bustle of communities and then I said it's old\nThe they had about four national bonds that image out of this bottles but every district in guinea had music\nAnd so I Will take you on to that independence or\nA song or for the I mean that was created by them bad jobs as we get into guinea and understanding the history that
