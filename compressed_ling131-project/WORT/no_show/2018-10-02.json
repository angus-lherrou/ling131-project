hear more about service dogs and for you to pick up the phone and call to five six two thousand and one\nAaron thanks a lot for taking the time to do this we're on the fun is all yours\nOkay thank you or so of again getting back to our dogs we mostly train golden retrievers and as I mentioned earlier we get them as a week old pops right out of the litter um we we um we go to breeders\nAnd getting a service dog helped him do all of those things he hit all of his goals and that was a really wonderful placements\nAnd ah you know just and it just reminds me just thinking about him um when his dog gets too old\nTo be a service dog any longer 'cause they do retire unfortunately especially with Golden's their hips tend to go\nOn but even if their hips don't go they just get older and they're not physically able to do some of the tasks for the person that they've always done and so when that time comes Kevin Will come back to us and he will get a successor dog\nAnd um you know we have a couple of people in the program who are under a third wag the dog and so that's the wonderful thing about being in business for Thirty years or you know you may have your dog for ten years\nAnd then you can come right back to us and get another dog and that's really wonderful because when you've already had a service dog you don't have to go through the training again you already know what's involved in so many of the people in our program come back to us for successor dogs and\nUh that's really wonderful so independents helping within maybe an economic situation or the thing that I really love\nWhen talking with people is when they tell us that having a service dog breaks down that social barrier between people with disabilities and everybody else\nAnd you know I hate to say this but I think it needs to be said many of the people that come to us looking for a service dog they tell they all tell us some not all but most of them tell a similar story\nThere out in public somewhere um they're they want to get into a store or something and there's there's not a button you know those buttons to press in the door automatically opens not every place has one of those\nSome of them you actually have to go up to the door and kind of pull it a little before it all open that can be hard for some people maybe they can't reach it or maybe they don't have the mobility in their arms to be able to do you have the strength to do it but they all tell a similar story that will be out in public\nThey can't get into a store place they ask somebody walking by for help and they go right by like they didn't even hear them\nAnd you know unfortunately that's what happens when when they have a service dog not only do\nPeople listen when they asked them to help them with something or without without them asking people come up to them all the time and ask them about their service dog now what that what that just did was they broke down that barrier I talked about people pretending that they didn't hear someone who needed help\nUm um it breaks down a it's great for the person to start talking about their disability how the dog helps them with their disability the challenges they have and how the dog gets them through those challenges um and so\nUm another story and I love telling the story to um we placed a a service dog and I won't say her name because she's she's she was I think there's eight or nine years old and she came to us\nAnd we don't typically place dogs with with children that young usually they're adolescence is a little older because they have to learn all of the commands to give to the dogs\nThat can get into the seventies and eighties in terms of number of commands you need to learn some of them are easy like sit in he'll but some are more complex like if you want to send your dog to the refrigerator to get you a can of coke well now you're sending your dog to another\nHe's using a ... here she is using a tug rope to open the fridge\nThey're grabbing their state usually have a shelf where they can grab things they're grabbing a coke which means kayaking their head to the side getting the coke\nBringing it to you going back to the room and shutting the door with their nose now that's four or five different things and one and so I it's hard for an eight or nine year old to learn all those command but also remember they're responsible for the safety of that dog in public and anything can happen in public\nUm but this this young lady she came to us she said she wanted a service dog because she wanted to do more things for herself\nMom was her caregiver mom did a lot of things for her as she was getting older is a very very bright young lady and she was getting all their she wanted to do more things for herself um she was having some struggles in school\nLike when could you know get it going to the cafeteria\nTook a long time getting through the line getting your lunch last time she didn't have much time at all to you to lunch things like that are picking up or pencil when she dropped it on the ground she couldn't get it by herself another kid would have to get it or the teacher would have to stop class and can get it for things like that\nUm but the the other is the last thing she said and the reason why we knew we had to get this young lady a service dog was she said that none of the kids in school talk to her\nAnd so we thought okay let's get this up to this young lady a service dog and through a lot of work and a lot of support from her mom and her dad and her siblings um and some time went by she's she now takes her service dog to to school every day\nShe gives the dog the commands she's she's responsible for the dog keeping us safe in public\n[noise] she does a lot more things for herself that that her mom used to do for her doesn't matter winter pencil hits the ground the dog pick the right up and gives a tour\nUm you know the dog grabs the money or when it's time to go to the cafeteria runs that had to tell her that she's there and her lunch is waiting for I mean there's just a lot of wonderful things you can train a dog to do to help people\nUh but the the best the best feedback that she gave us about her service dog was that she said that she was now the most popular kid in school\nAnd that's what I that's what a service dog can do for for the people that we work with it breaks down that social barrier between people with disabilities and everybody else and hopefully that was a good example of of how they do that but they do it in many many other ways\nUm and then I think the last thing um companionship\nUm these dogs as I said go everywhere that the clients go to work the grocery store\nMovies everywhere they're always there are constant companion there when they need some help there are there when you know they're having a bad day and they're feeling depressed nothing picks you up better than a dog especially a golden retriever um so that companionship is a really wonderful piece or just\nJumping up on the couch with you and watching the TV program um the companionship of these dogs is is really wonderful and you know I'd say the one drawback of a service to the the only thing a service dog\nCan do for our people is live forever\nYou know pet owners go through the through the same thing the dog simply don't live long enough you know if you get twelve Thirteen fourteen years out of your dog that's a wonderful long life but they leave us too soon and unfortunately and that's why we have the successor dog a program in place\nGod right I'm\nHearing it's okay they also get nice long life scans\n[noise] [laughter] that's true [laughter] um we have a pledge drive show here on W. R. T. and it's been really nice to come and be on the program and talk\nAnd as you notice he's talking and I'm not interviewing and we're not we don't have a program going this back and forth and that's because it's the access our Santa gender not ours and Aaron is here to talk and and um it's I I just love every minute of it I I had this funny image of a of the ah retriever going to the cafeteria\nI'm working through and what you mean Jimmy's down as well for that sort of thing I think we're learning it's more sophisticated lovers it's amazing you know it's really I'm really hearing a\nLot of stories about connection and support and it's so lovely to hear those on W. O. R. T. that's really what I feel like the station does a lot of W ... offers a lot of connection and support to the community as well\nAnd the court is direct for yeah I mean are\nYou can't W are to you might not pick your groceries up off the shelf for you in a way that it's nice to have assistance with if you need that but you know in some other ways to five six two\nThousand and one if you appreciate all of the assistance with news and entertainment that you can get from the station\nAnd W. or two of them don't orgy if you're there on the Web just back up to the front page of them you weren't he's a website you can find the police to pledge\nThat's right I so appreciate learning about all the different local organizations that ... a support all of our community members to live full lives and be fully included in our community and all the ways that we want to be\nSo that's really wonderful to hear about ... and if you were appreciating this show fewer appreciate it shows over the last few months and years from the access our as well\nCalling out to five six two thousand one to let us know and we have some good news here I get to ring a bell [noise]\n[laughter] like ringing a bell I admit so we have to pleasures did they we haven't none of us and we have Dan thank you so much to those do pleasures Dan is\nA wonderful pleasure by my own state and a ... thank you for your generous pledge a Dan likes the access our and you think an antique what\nWe really appreciate that and an anonymous also picked up to do be brothers CD so I'm One of the many fantastic CDs and um books and other ... find premiums that you can receive\nI I remember having in a woman's one time you know it was like midnight because I Would take him to witness to work on some skills well nobody was there\nAny on women's is open twenty four hours and I would teach him speak in the middle of women's and the only nine people in the store would come running to that oil because there was a dog barking wildly but I Would have to reassure them know I'm really working on a scale fee as best as a service dog and training\nBy the time we went to a cafe and um you know I was fumbling with my money and I had my coffee mugging and the other hand and he saw the opportunity at that moment to run into the kitchen\nAnd I was about three seconds behind him and had to talk down some very angry chefs that were in the kitchen why is there a dog in my kitchen and so this is a service dog and training and it's my fault I let go of the the leash and I'm Sorry and we all laughed about it later but\nYou know those are just a couple of examples I have had so many wonderful experiences\nWorking with a service dog and training so again I just say if this is something that sounds interesting you don't have to make a commitment just give us a call we'll talk with you about it see if he might be a good fit for us so thank you very much um to work for letting me tell wake story tonight\nThat was amazing thank you very much\nAnd sorry we have to cut you off [laughter] oh gosh I was running out of material and [laughter] oh I appreciate that you are and things that that was Aaron backer of weddings and he was er here to help or do I do an exercise program to talk about why is because it gave them an opportunity\nAnd it also gave us an opportunity to have somebody on that would that would talk about something that we can enjoy and learn from and be happy about and it's made my night no doubt about it to five six two zero zero one we're about\nHalf a minute away less than that than the end of the program as someone who thank Aaron [noise]\nAnd it wasn't this time it was with Jillian Jillian is called in and pledged and I really appreciate that Jillian thank you very very much\nAnd I I think I don't know any has been keeping all the pledges and she's talent and I'm just sitting here looking at the outlook tons of oil or any of my my ex\nI first of all thank you to ... about that is fun isn't it was pretty cool okay I like it so we we have not our pledge golfing buddy thank you so much to Jillian and anonymous and then we really appreciate your contribution steak you took Veronica for her online pledge thank you so much everyone and keep them coming\nFor a something wonderful that's coming up next to five six two thousand wind keep up the momentum supporting this fine station\n[noise]\nAnd we'll be back together time thank you [noise]\nYou've been listening to the access how [noise]\nThe excess hours W Ortiz commitment to community access the em [noise]\nFor this hour we'll turn your wage over to a member of the public\nViews expressed on the exercise I Do not represent the views of the station it's damn programmers or the board of directors [noise]\nRemember though that the show relies on your idea [noise]\nAn application to produce a program can be found on the Internet at W.

R. E. C. H. A.

I brought a fan with me and then uh there was a shooting here at the station right in this room which\nIs scary so we've other security so a lot of things have happened that were kind of unexpected and are in addition to all of the bills and stuff that we already have these expensive came up too so we're kind of like an extra need right now\nAnd I we could really use or how six to eight to five six two zero zero one go to ... radio dot com for a list of stuff\nAnd uh we've been talking tonight about big band Metallica not taking smaller bans on tour [noise] and ah [noise]\nI put a lot I got Russia plans and so all drum ... is an instrumental right here this album this tour was my first concert and this is why I'm playing it 'cause I knew that it was like first\nConcert July Fourth alpine ballet moving pictures that's just off the exit stage left album and it kicks into the drums so I was one of the jokes so now in the middle of why why's the kind of turned into its own songs\nBut um [noise] with uh [noise]\nI lost my train of thought I'm with rush there another band that's huge does evening which they took some opening bands with them a little bit but now they just do the evening with shows and you know they they did take some bands that\nYou know back in the day they took us to pick out a whole bunch of things to primary ... band that's just play down the street tonight um I guess the opening band for prime is didn't wasn't able to make the show so they played like two full sex\nIn a in a car overlap I'm at the ...\nAnd then uh we used to take a\nWhile they open for a lot of the more classic rock bands in the seventies but yeah when they got bigger in the eighties they kinda just became their own thing but like\nWhat's the catch is like one of the first fans that really took him out oh that's right yeah\nThat could you imagine going to see Russia opening for gas ... to open for us to I mean look how ... Russia I mean 'cause yeah what kind of crazy shows where I mean they were like\nThe Metallica that we see now the huge stadium show at the big production and that was like with some of these technology only imagine what had to put a stop the momentum back that\nI you know I remember back when I see more kissing you look up online I remember\nNot the crew peak that showed it to do\nOther doctors yoga was All right but that came out when I first got into metal I guess the\nFirst to motley crew records were pretty solid and then after that it was downhill [noise]\nWell I I finally saw their fellow farewell show was on like access TV or whatever I recorded it yeah yeah I was mostly fast forwarding through it but\nI mean I Can't sing while he can't sing Mick Mars can barely stand and it's really doesn't really care about rock music anymore so I mean really it's just Nikki sex and he's got his own band anyway\nThat also sucks [laughter] suck say um [laughter] and so\nNow there's like rumors that the Mali cruise making them you know they're making new music for their of some of their own and dirt as their autobiography is going to be a movie or whatever and there's ... there's probably going to be some music for the soundtrack close enough to where I really\nHope they keep their word I mean that was the thing they made such a huge deal about not reuniting everybody's suddenly farewell\nTour and then they don't keep their word so it's almost a tradition of yeah no segue into farewell tours I might as well throw on some of the music [noise] flower\nUh [noise] sucking about it right sure\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nSo Phil ... and\n... and [noise]\nThey might claim technically I was blank innocent I think of them every time I see one of those ... McLean trucks on the interest rates on those shipping companies and uh of course die hard [noise] so [noise] people had enough of this Rob Flynn putting the Dickens dictator [laughter] and most of the whole band\nQuit and then I guess the bass player that they just got ... thought about it and said why I guess I [noise]\nI'll stay and bond so they're just going to play out the tour they have scheduled ... does that leave school they're doing that they're not\nEnding machine as though is going to come back I mean rivals the Rob ... reform and well really that's not the original drummer and guitar player and bass player anyway if they brought it's been a full\n[noise] turned around isn't it I mean the claim again in regional number no um MS consciously yeah average ...\nIsn't the original and our player and then my wife's players although they've missed a couple of pretty solid records I'm no I'm not going out on a limb to say this machine has passed album was this one from my eyes [noise] they they have not made a better album their first one yeah the black name ... [noise]\n... they [noise]\nI think what happened was what happened to a lot of ... [noise] they don't have outside people helping them [noise] to say that [noise]\nThat song is too long you don't need those fourteen so [noise]\nAnd I think Metallica did that to going back to Metallica I mean they yeah they just get to where all you know what we're doing we're going to just do what we want well there's a reason why you guys were good before somebody we're producing it being the boss\nSundance worthwhile as like a a cohesive team yeah in some bans have these personalities behind them that just keeps going through personnel but it's there\n[noise] creative vision and driving force that [noise] you know keeps the band forwards and that can be great to listen to and see but probably not so great on a bus [laughter] [noise]\nYeah that's I think people forget about is or what I mean how many examples kind of thing and there's days in the ... [noise] and they lost in\nDanny fill top or you know all brilliant artists or writers and John Schaffer from ice ... mile either to ever what's Jeff ... yeah\n[noise] guy from into eastern as he [noise]\nYeah I mean you you have the artistic vision and and it's your thing and if you bring people on board if they're not working out for you to bring different people on board and if you are successful enough to be able to do that [noise] good for you if not then you're just going to go work at\nProduct [noise] more guitar summer [noise]\nNot that there's anything wrong with those two places fan you're going to be working in a real job and not living your dream as the\nTuring artist which is really hard to do is I think [noise] ... especially with the last machine has on them for us and the guys I think that was more Rob slim and the rest of the well it's weird that they\nSo far along after the album and before the tour to to do this like yeah\nWhat what happened something had to have happened and did something\nWith the the pay out of the tour or something like like what happened with the one bottle you know he was in Slayer [noise] they they didn't have an album for a while they were going to start some to her in Australia and all of a sudden he's not on the ban anymore where he just he was questioning how the expenses where he's like I'm not getting paid enough\nMe no he no I mean he's not dumb they were getting paid ticket prices were just watched the ban was giving him\nThis much I'm One fourth of the ban and I'm only getting this tiny bit where's all the money go on and they're like you don't need\nYou know you're out [laughter] pretty much [laughter]\nWhen I was like OK well fine I'm Out you know I got I got all kinds of other stuff\nTo do I we never really found out what happened with Slayer and why they're doing it I think that's\nPretty much calmer right on time arrivals already you could on record saying he didn't want to I mean he's more Catholic than you've ever been now and my thing and uh you know we're in and he's got younger kids and that and Jeff Herman dying yeah and just\nA carry came doing a lot of the writing and it's not really a collaborative effort anymore at least this five I get from\nThe news and it's weird because Jerry ... really hasn't done much power I haven't really ever done much outside of Slayer no I mean I think he did guitars on something and it's a little here and there but no side projects no\nThat's they're saying oh it's good I mean ... they're like\nYou know there are like a a Lars and James is their pad I didn't\n... probably take some time off I don't know yeah but I can see Carrie king resurfacing possibly with Paul buy stuff still drawing form and that could be doing something opening for Extra Lives should get Phil on someone sees\nIt he's been other press a lot of lakes and seas outlets are filling some on the illegals oriented and he is sober now for like ... and got a bunch of ... got his facts as back fixing these like in shape he's lost like fifty pounds since\nI was like yeah I'm sure he's in good form now there's a lot of pictures of people see meeting them at shows or whatever in the Memphis and it was like [noise] wow\n[noise] ... yeah it'd be cool to see [noise] I mean there's always the you know the talk of the ... union but that's not going to happen obvious that would be like having a van Halen reunion without you know ... ... yeah yeah\nBut there could be a celebrate like queen you know like a celebration of pants or a like a metal a legion\nPam Tara tribute or something and then I fell sing about something\nFor like dust did yeah yeah I'm not even maybe not even that\nThat was kind of weird [noise] to have them maybe not I haven't heard or the deal disciples yeah yeah\n[noise]\nSo who do you get to drum for for I mean obviously that exact wild probably take over the cars but who would drop [noise]\nYou can't play my Portland [noise] general you know\nYeah it's you know and he's like a ... a big guy and he's great a German just like [noise] just like us [noise] they didn't find any had no drugs in the system just died of heart heart failure large heart [noise]\nAnd that's another question I never I never thought who could really replace many pollens tend to [noise]\nThere was all those those questions are and who could replace might support lawyer dream theater you know like she looked like he would never leave and then he did you know meet me being a dream theater nerd or whatever but but yeah I think I even said once way back in before there was a marine started bike\nLanes genie is probably the only choice you know he's from their side of the country is their age does have the same musical background already played with James agrees yeah like a sham of a drummer audition saying [noise]\n\n... probably would be my choice [noise]\nYeah for Vinnie Paul ...\nAs far as I'm concerned planet got is the new ...

R. T. is\nWe we can pretty much play what we want on our show we are we don't have someone standing over us going hey play that new single from anti affliction at least\nThree times during your show you know we don't have to pretend to like music we don't like yeah we well we like to play what we like as as one of the main reasons but we also like to play things we think you like\nOver the years I've played a lot of stuff I don't like like for the first few years I played obituary\nAlly you hated and I hated all that I remember the way you would cringe when someone who's calling me ... road runner records yeah another band\nYeah decide yeah list just goes on [laughter]\nBut yeah mergers and and whatever but I mean that's just not I think we're just too old for music like this 'cause a lot of the younger kids like this stuff but it's funny that the evolution of this show you know people like seven dust and coal chamber and all that were bands that we don't even\nGet the new stuff anymore and that was like a staple when Ryan habits twentieth anniversary show\nTwo weeks ago I went and pulled up a playlist from Twenty years ago and it was like coal chamber corn\nI mean for Ninety eight there was a lot of\nI guess new battle but there was still camel corps them and all that too but yeah but I have this [noise]\nThen you got to ban that kind of started off similarly motion lifted wife that's also on road runner or they are now\nBut there are other stuff is heavier oh yeah [noise] had a lot more of the electronic stuff\nBut then their new stuff sounds a lot more or less than I Am on the books and just the whining singing emo [noise] type stuff\nI'm pretty open minded to most stuffing now but there's two elements and not only I don't like one is the whining he most stuff in the other is the shoe gays and floods you oh we're going to get to that later [noise]\n[laughter] yeah [noise]\nAre we going to play does have an ... should I not only now ... actually are coming to town [noise] but yeah they're one of the band but I'm not a huge fan of you know when you live [noise]\nI ... it ... me off as even call them black metal [noise] uh let us not black metal\nIn any way shape or form\nBut anyway let's see if I ever left as we've seen we saw um it's been on a stick with someone else\nBut like [noise]\nI forget we saw somebody we wanted to like ... or something I think it was ... yeah it was like why well it's good for like ten minutes and then it just got into shooter games and stuff for it it was just it just wasn't my\nThing [noise]\nDeaf having well their album and what their first album looks like ... like I said the last three or whatever it was like the top of everybody's on your list [noise] now like yeah but\nIf you like that happen you can make up ... W Archie and go see him we're not going to be there to tell you how much we don't like 'em well it goes from what I Want to be black metal and they're like hipster\nMusic [noise] yeah [noise] and I think to blackmail elements just there to be ironic [noise] but you're not fooling anyone you're not black mental [noise]\n[noise] I think it would take a little break let's say a couple of new releases here for ya [noise] um let me kill 'em up\nI think it's a typewriter bathroom break in a time for like an energy drink type thing and then we got a couple of new you know really real next and we [noise] we're gonna come back and ah\nShe just play the the whole new uh no not\n... yeah right [noise] I we do we do a top twenty chart and the top five ad church every week actually I Do it and it's kind of like the the checklist of what we're gonna play and it's usually it's like [noise]\nAll stuffed with Mike and I agree mostly agree on sometimes I have a thinker in there too but we we both go over it and it's like to do so we can we know we can play about thirty songs\nWere kind of a check and balance for yet another yeah [noise]\nSo we make the top twenty left and then a player new song off of it every week there's usually five good new releases and plus [noise] you know thirty more that are okay\nSometimes I lean too hard on black and ... you have to ... back in a little bit [noise]\nSo this week the new so normally on our our second pledge drive weeks we don't even touch this last\nBut since we do need a little break here and they're going to do some of the the top five new stuff like you said the show up with the humor to terrorize or I'm going to do some ... or ... and horrendous and then we'll be back in a little bit to ah talk more\nHorrendous word to describe the energy affliction [laughter] [noise] but they're good band so not advocate flexible motion with somebody who was in the background now for some of the older I remember seeing that one of the bank accounts and\nThey came out when we were surprised [noise] I think that was one of the ah [noise] the last um [noise] a rock star may have ...

CDs you have more than me probably your collection better than my definitely I lost count after three thousand [laughter] [noise]\nNo I just have a harder situation going on [noise] [laughter] [noise]\nOkay so uh [noise] I'm trying to think of the first time I saw Slayer I don't even oh it was crushing the titans and I remember that that was uh [noise]\nLet's see mega death was first house some changes for some mega doubt the Slayer then Amtrak I think was the alpine valley date yup [noise] and that was my ... through a temper tantrum on both sides you know why wasn't helping them all over the place I probably would have to [laughter]\nBut yeah it was like and then uh [laughter]\nThe runs off the stage and then like the manager of alpine valley pop out\nOkay you guys you got to work with this you are going to have shows like this anymore if you're going to be doing this kind of like how he got hit with a kind of like a parent saying we just can't have nice things around here basically that's exactly what outside\nAnd it's true though I mean that that's what's gonna happen I remember [laughter]\nWell I think I I wound up at my girlfriend's house late that night and she was picking gravel lot on my back 'cause I fell down a few times in the parking lot without a shirt on drunk\nI think I was just starting to date somebody and they were\nVisiting a friend and ... and that is either that or the Russian show I went with a guy who I went to college with the with the metal\nOn metal director and music guy from college kind of my mentor type and I'm like okay well then he lived in Dallas with and I was living in Dallas field at the time and driving back from alpine ... supposed to meet this girl here in La Guardia go can you just drop me off\n[laughter] so I had dropped off in this apartment complex or while friend of a friend and it all worked out I mean but yeah it was interesting\nWell I don't think I got lucky that I did but [laughter] I don't know how [noise]\nAnyway so I drank a lot that day I remember the first time seeing Slayer with you I think it was and I'm like ... we're going to the ballroom you've already seen them in Milwaukee tell em but [noise]\nThis was there was so bad as soon as ah [noise] ... you were like you know people come out of the woodwork deceased player and I was like OK I only get to the rave those to the bottom and it was just ... oh yeah it was like a sauna and it was ridiculous [noise] but\nIt was it was a good show I remember our whole lives diabolical and music and to her as a camera on all the way that will kill ... open those still in bands could not open for say it's like if you open for say why\nYou were just going to get food no matter who you are pretty much the only band that really didn't get their asses handed to him well yeah I I think they took some fans that they shouldn't have\nBeen killed or people weren't there to see them and it was pretty clear\nThe the one someone started from a ... show\nBut we were at together was a the towards the end of the show I think this is the same time on the drumstick got thrown out and then there was just a pile [noise]\nOh and the dude tried they can drumstick away from the guy that caught it and they wouldn't let go of it\nSo then the guys just started pushing down on the guy's neck with a drumstick trying to show come out none another dude came up and checked back I think in the Pacers so yeah and then it was crazy and then I think just erupted into a big fight yeah for drumstick that was the Slayer hatred arch enemy\nAnd that was one lumbar into it just came back\nI think that was the same time we're towards the end of the show there was a pile of ... on the floor and everybody was story was circled around it\nKind of going were like what's going on over there so we walked over there I forgot about that and there's a pile appeal and people started throwing dollars a dollar bills dollar bills for like who's going to be the crazy am after that\nCrap [laughter] someone waited until there is enough dollar bills in the vomit to buy a beer and then picked him out and walk to the bar and handed the bartender the ... dollar bills and bought up here [laughter]\nYep and pretty much as they charged for beers at the rate [laughter]\nThere is a quite a few ... dollar bills there\nYeah yeah I can remember when the guy grab him everybody just like\nOh that that's an all time classic on Saturday I almost forgot about that [laughter] that was\nPretty raw yeah but there's another story\nYeah this is all the ... this is a classic it's all on the way this\nLayer is actually my first time seeing Slayer because I question the titans is actually my second time okay um yeah the first time I saw him was when the first like a season since the bus\nTour when ... was opening for him but my ... my\nFriend and I decided to take a badger bus because we knew we were going to be drinking heavily\n[laughter] and I had\nI just to twelve pack of beer with than just a twelve pack just this all just getting prime I might get by with just a twelve pack just enough to [laughter] just enough to\n\nSpeak that call six to eight to five six two zero zero one\n\nThat the um the rave now has bands like thrice since either a liberal started on this either oh let's talk about\nHours I ever mentioned how much I hate [laughter] events either now there's actually wars fans it's either yeah yeah I remember\nWell I'm going to talk about the ... will put this off a little bit but er yeah they've got after the Barry White shop or about the only to a [noise]\nBig shows devil wears Prada I maybe for a come up to the rave for\nMetal is a lot different now you got oh temperature coming to a Shankar's [laughter] interesting [laughter] yeah all of the interesting\nSo yeah some of the other any of the town I pick them up or some metal shows and you know they're coming here to anyway ... pretty solid family\nSo we can really use up the pledges ... we're halfway through the show and ah we're we're wondering if our phones were quite honestly um we've been here and put it in the work we put in a time\nFor volunteers [noise] and ah they're still paying this silly and there's a lights that work there's\nSome parts that need parts and phones that need bills to pay all that all takes a a bit of money we don't have commercials but we do have listeners sponsors and that you or it could be you\nPut your name on that list give us a call six or eight to five six two zero zero one [noise] where you get a programming like this show\nThe show before something wonderful Twenty years who would've thought on this little kid from just fresh out of your W W s U M was still in college so Ryan parks guy taking over for the loud music some on our honeymoon I follow al rich you yeah no easy feat\nHe did it first show on a pledge drive\nAnd then a Twenty years now he's doctor Dr of something wonderful Ryan parks\nAnd then uh [noise] you know we have Lucas [noise]\nWas our after the guys show for a long time and turn it over to the ... and now we have a [noise] major Tom\n[noise] with wild and blue doing some really cool function fusion stuff last week of school driving home when you play in a place grapes the old school like hip hop Fox type stuff a place like you know\nIf you pay like ... like cameo band and they also\nHad gone to great show yeah and we're right in the middle and we've been here twenty bugs is probably the twenty fifth anniversary of me being cause I either\nA sample show an August the month of August of Ninety four like yeah we're two to five they'll put on this like can you do it for a month you can do you play your metal and and we'll see how it goes to show opened up in January\nBut yet we're still here [noise]\nI think I've been around for about Twenty years on roughly\nIn one form or another yeah you would call in that first year because we're on\nI'm back in the day is channel four on cable when there was only like thirty cable channels and you would have to have a little box or whatever and channel four was the public access channel that's how I discovered the money and they would have worked on when they didn't have programming which was in the middle of the night\nAnd a lot of people you know channel surfer and in the middle of the night here metal blasting out of their TV [noise] boom that's awesome [noise]\n[noise]\nAll right to five six two thousand one to number we talked earlier about um the next like ... big like arena metal band and ah [noise]\nI was a song on because it was going to be part of really cool breakdown Matias part [laughter]\nSo we have a player before that where they do a lot of just everything goes crazy this song has like the cool [noise]\nHeavy mock script part in it [noise] and ah\nI don't think they'd be as big of touring in the last few years if they didn't have that little uh incident in\nCzechoslovakia Czech Republic republic where a Randy ...\nIt's used the killing of manslaughter in a stage diver and he pushed off stage tough stuff man but you know what he didn't just go yeah we are not ever going to just starting to go after he actually\nWent\n\nTo face trial even though you while he was in prison for two months yeah the ... the got released to come back and they thought they figured he wouldn't come back with the stand up\nGuy went back to the whole trial and\nLot of the family and you know they were cool with them and you were school with them [noise]\nBut it costs a lot of new in the end it would just be a cash grab\nBy the government basically I mean people say our government is becoming corrupt and all but you know they have layers and layers of on some of the eastern bloc countries yeah we go to the U.S has layers and layers of\nCorruption that they can hide behind whereas they're just more blatant about it'll be another country [noise]\nBut yeah it's been kind of like\nThey didn't come out of nowhere but they really did kind of surface pretty quick [noise] compared to some I'm going to say anyone there was a void to be filled than they were there to say anyone is the best snow Sanders totally subject does yeah but I I mean\n... gone Slayer is gonna be gone metallic has kind of in a class by them so [noise] so I mean I think about who is the American\nIdol band and lemme God's the one that comes to mind well I mean you've got a five figured out\nWhat a joke to his department\n[noise]\nCoverage will be spotted\nIn [noise] yeah this is hard [noise] I I still miss my car service for the year and a half so [noise]\nBut yeah that would make my ears ring a little bit [noise]\nAnd yeah they played a last show they had a\nSeller has some problems he uh\nHe finally somebody had gotten in a motorcycle accident or something and their shoulder yeah got screwed up and he had to go through some physical therapy and he said he wanted to be a hundred percent yeah are they going to go to a guy from from the way I did a great job [noise]\n\nYeah you know at times or the tremors playing the part right there up behind the term riser and hide even smoke anyway [noise] you probably wouldn't have known oh no he nailed it completely [noise]\nIs another ... that have kept she\nShe starred in a band out of a commotion slash Milwaukee\nI thought they'd go a lot of bars that were said these are kind of the pet projects of metal plate for a little while after city\nAnd uh so when they're in their prime there at this ...\nThis was there like Maine album let's say their mode and\nRecorded themselves a metal plate basically signed them and then re release it so I think this is I I never really realized it until you know the band and you see the progression and this is probably what happens with a lot of fans if they have that one album\nAnd then the labels sites them and they just released that awful so their\nTour and demos and play the hell out of this album for so many years\nThat was their album and then they had to come out and then they got science did a big tour behind the album then they had to go make it back it up\nAnd then that obviously as you can tell by my tone wasn't quite as good as no it wasn't and that's why because you had said so much time behind that first out and that's why there's a sophomore slump for almost every bad as\nProbably a similar situation I was really disappointed they never came out was the surge was ... I mean the drummer died and they broke up while they're pretty much bigger try\nTheir got dropped and they they were pretty much broke up more or less yeah and then the drummer dies and that's ...\n... they were part of you know kind of a quick bad that happened to the new agents and that's a crash you know some other bands to stick around like have have are still around\nAnd they do a four different locations they told me [noise] pretty cool have you had to be a virtual reality [noise] you know like um [noise]\nVirtual reality goggles you wouldn't be able to look around and like you were there [noise] so that's pretty cool yeah I think it's it's pretty neat [noise] it's all from right here in Madison\nAll these last two bamboo and players should do that with the point\nI think they do already do [laughter] yeah I Know where do you think that because I'm\nI Know I'm just being sarcastic [noise]\n\nThis is the ah [noise] singer from unleash the archers [noise] who got on tour with Kelly in crime right now [noise] and the ... million private normal singer female or cook can't tour for some reason and they hired marry that was a little more to the thing\n[noise] so that's kind of what type those two songs\nSinging this song is I'm sure with singer ... interesting and these are both from\nAnother good or bad for Madison which is a kind of have some two years ago trades attack\nWas a great album and a great band that\nCould be destined for bigger and better things when they [noise] just too many swipe tours but I'm sure there's a lot lot more bans out there that I'd just bongo ... yeah\nI'm a Family Guy I don't get out as much well there's a lot of great bands around I just don't rely on people or send us down the radio station here some of the stuff we want to live here and play it next week or\nNext week of the week after will have a [noise]\nSteve from a chaos of being here that's pretty good stuff so you got a new repeat or a new split [noise]\nAnd ah that's pretty good stuff too [noise] kinda more African black metal\nI still remember that song from [noise] I Can't say their name on there but ac is the name and the band yeah no I don't want to do is split seven and she was your stupid things down [laughter] [noise] the funniest song titles ever or from you see I see [noise]\nYeah I'm I'm looking at some of the [noise] and you know what you know a lot of times\nI'm looking at some of the [noise] um song titles on here\nAnd it's gotten to where\nWe're so PC you know I feel uncomfortable even reading ... used to be like\nOh ha ha ha and I'm like oh\nI better not say that but yeah\nWe just can't I was on the program in community I don't want to be I guess to the program encouraging [laughter]\n\nAnd you know I I mean yeah [laughter] it's called shut up [laughter]\nYou want to get a great guy and a light came down to where I was looking at my at any cell phone mad like hot\n[noise] off anyway yeah see that's a that's what we got [noise] right [noise]\nThat's topic\nYeah moving right along on the clock here W.

I think every second punch travelers a new design we have some who shirts and and that's what's needed is like a new design every time we used to have new bumper stickers all the time we don't really do my perspective as much anymore but [noise] um [noise]\nThis shirt or this is a print to divert or there's a lot of like much there's a slight class that has\nThe will go from a couple ... was one of my favorite was at the microphone with the like the old time microphone the lightning bolts coming out of it and then there's some I have like a power\n[noise] this one is the theme of the pleasure of the girls are new thoughts like a you know like a sixty seventies you know love pizza [noise]\nWhatever a treaty with you know animals and someone playing guitar on and it's kind of folksy what's really neat and it's been a dark blue background which\nIs a long sleeve shirt as a hundred dollar pledge they also comes in a a print that you can get out of the same thing in the living by Seventeen print [noise]\nAbout ... I mean how cool would it be to have every W. or the pledge logo are worse you know oh yeah it'd be like having you know go records around your house or for me to light up their science that's that's my thing I Love light up here so [noise]\nI don't have enough waltz space to put on your side [noise]\nBut speaking of beer for forty dollars plus you can get a punch cards severe from a one time of beer from parts eagle\nOr next door brewery hop house rock hampering carbon for working draft vintage you get one pipe from any of those places on each and then a couple of troll too and then the success of need [noise]\nWhich they make fun of meat and the commercials it's kind of funny [noise]\nI I think it's funny they make fun of me like [noise] if we didn't have a meter in town I Would have been like what's needed you know some medieval thing but it's\nBasically beer boots and it was actually pretty good [noise] uh [noise]\nGet the punch card for all those for forty dollar pledges for sixty dollars you can get a pipe class [noise] but then you for eighty nine\nOr the Ninety cents just like eighty nine nine [noise] you can get the [noise] that's like a ten dollar discount I guess combined between the two ten dollars and ten cents [noise] you can get the pie class and the punch cards together [noise]\nOr if you wanted to do one of those are mostly evergreen touches you can sign up to do seven dollars and fifty cents a month and then that combo what's yours [noise] but the other big metal ... things\nWe have tickets [noise] we really don't want to go to waste cannibal costs of Haiti turned on harm's way Saturday in November seventeenth Ken I'm of course I don't think it's ever put on a bad show [noise] yeah ... [noise]\nWho's been the singer for kennel my costs longer than any other senior that's ever been in chemical corps if you want to call them singing vocalist [noise]\nSee where the ... red make America great ... hats\nUh yeah at the end 'cause he's you know buddies with Donald Trump [noise]\nAnd ah [noise]\nI I don't I never understood his actual just air cooled heart [noise]\nGranted I'm Out of hip hop fan but I I can remedy a hockey fan and I know Kanye West is telling us what he does use [noise] but he just sat crap crazy I don't I didn't even really hear anything that made me think that ...\n[noise] I guess there is a lot of people think he is but [noise] I I guess it's because I'm not in that circle of [noise] music there's not a lot of newer hot by rules like so most of my life so [noise] okay\nYeah that's terrible well put the prime is in the background because they were just dominate terrible this is the new prime and sell them as awful well you know they they built this thing up from their first couple album tour\nWhere you know people would tell left play pool [laughter] hey you guys are awesome and he'd go now we ... so they became my primary sucks was the thing that said\nI Am at play unbelievable shows and I've seen them slaves shows where it was just like in there and stuff and you know\nBoth listening [laughter] yeah at one show up to rave where it was a [noise] a vegan there was it was like a gym [noise] show and that was that was tough [noise]\nThat was a tough [noise]\nThen they you know the show is to Sylvia was awesome well yeah I I some friends who have said that they played a I had high hopes up I had high expectations for the new record and it just [noise]\nIt's not a well they they did a ... children's books or something like that or was based on a children's book similarly posts\nThe uh [noise] songs on the new record just kind of boring [noise]\nOh they played the second set with the whole album I God I Would have been wrong so they did the tablets are speakers too many puppies American Life probably ... that's a good first ... yeah and then they did the whole the saturating several album\nWhich is a new one [noise] and then they did\nA\nLittle throw my name is ... Jerry with rich driver [noise] softball impacted and they'll tell me to a child [noise] that'd be disappointed from rather than go I'm One of those fans\nAll you do that one song the whole show you're going to be the one song I wanted to see forget it [noise]\n\nI'm sure it was cool I remember seeing primary fish bones play together [noise] in the rain\nYou'll go ballroom I miss that show but I mean I've heard that and talked about by many people I I you know fish had their one one song back then which are among the play because you know that's that's what we're here for half didn't find it\nWasn't there like a huge shoes circle yeah for that show\n[laughter]\nI don't have that so [laughter] I'm sure you could find some fish going on over\nThe summer Saturday was kind of single back then [noise] and ah [noise] I remember the thing that came out and goes I Want to see the thing is that where ever seen and yeah around the sound board [noise] the hall floor\nAnd I I was running around him if he couldn't you couldn't avoid it [noise] and ah how cool [noise] I mean I think the ... I think maybe lamb of God to fight have done something similar [noise]\n\nAnd that was a [noise] I think we're up in the balcony and in the rain and it was um this would really get it on\nYour doubled tribal\nKind of a groove metal thing\nJust just a paid [noise]\nAnd they got a bad rap for a little bit in the beginning because everybody to start off your miracle chamber and you know new metal recall chamber was you know uh\nBack then people would say now they're going to start doing called chamber sons\nAnd then read it [noise]\nYeah [noise] desert basically said they're never going to rejoin both chambers [noise] but I might as well do couple of songs in Pakistan [noise]\nSee I was so terrible driver machine had were always kind of a good fit for each other but double driver being a little more concise some heavy [noise] and I still remember the\nThe first time we saw double drivers and house of blues in Chicago in the open for old house and there are all ... fans would like their backs [noise]\nOh yeah they were ... as I Know why I think ...\nWas on the tour and then for whatever reason cataclysm couldn't play some shows in double driver filled in and [noise]\n\nWhat's that right after\nOprah upside to road runner I think so double driver was still on the road runner\nSo it was kind of like a\nCross your cars road runner there for a little while just signed a lot of the already established Vatican became like [noise] the classic metals labor because they got dreams deer and possum\nI'm\nBlack label society in Queens right\nOr something you know they had a lot of [noise] already\nEstablished metal bands on just signed them the bases distributes distribute it\n'cause 'cause that Kim a day of of a record label\nWas pretty much a bank for band that's really all they ever ever work is All right we're going to frighten you all this money you're going to make an album it's going to sell and we're basically going to take our money back from other cells and we're going to pay the money for you to go on tour\nTo promote this album seeking somewhat records and it's going to take you maybe two albums started actually making money yourself\nSo we're going to basically take all the money that gets made back\nUntil you can start supporting yourself and then ... what happened for for a good chunk of the eighties and nineties now labels kind of more have this what three sixty thing going on where they they see they have\nTo really they do all the promotion the label of touring and all that\nBut if it's not what it was [noise]\nYou know the entire business model it's changed [noise]\nUm [noise]\nAll right [noise] hit the wall here man half hour last fall pledge drive it says are show is number one hundred and twenty eight [noise] I think that's the number of uh [noise] I don't know why are our pledge drive she has one twenty dollars\nIs not our goal [noise] it would be great if we were able to\nMake that for our goal my goal is not a whole lot and uh we're still waiting for that first call [noise]\nI said you like that whole check one two one two [laughter] usually are our tickets are like boom somebody wants to I mean these are good tickets\nAnd then we keep talking about a lot but it's it's one of those things like I Know there's people that are going to the show they're going to buy tickets why aren't you buying them from us ...\nWith with me I Am ring worm and that's like over twenty six so friday night and that's just the Sylvie I think that's probably going to be my first time at the Sylvia\nI Wish I could have gone into Chicago in the primary tonight but after ...

I'm not from Madison and sometimes I get that South side nor say if I was actually can see is like demographically this is the south side area which is like\nYeah we're pretty much on the north or northern titles all say what's the big creek neighborhood and then all the way down kind of below the belt lying to the badger rock neighborhood\nAlso over to the Arbor hills neighborhood and everything in between and then also a little bit over toward the Broadway area are heading towards ...\nUm so we have a lot of ground to cover we know that there's a lot of people who want to vote and just a need information about it or we also tell people if they want to get registered to vote or they can go to any Madison public library\nAnd also the early voting starts on October ah fifteenth that all the Madison public libraries and you don't have to go to your your home library for\nHappened to me downtown by the central library you can stop by and vote there or you don't have to go to the library in your neighborhood\nNo voting in every state is not the same there it seems that Wisconsin's needs to be very progressive like we have early registration you mention is how early can you register if you mentioned that again and and is it ... available now\nYep ah the one thing I Would encourage everybody to do is check your voter registration they actually sent out some postcards to try and find people that had moved or change registrations\nAre not actually knock some people off of the voter rolls we do have same day registration in Wisconsin I was so you'll be able to register at the polls but just to make things go smoother I Would highly encourage you to visit there is a website\nCalled my vote dot W. I. G. O. V. and basically on that website you can check your registration you can see what will be on your ballot you can check your polling location and it's just a great resource again that website is ah my vote W. I. G. O. V.\nUm and then again with early voting start in a you can do it now at uh the city county building and an October fifteenth\nI Will be at all the library as this kind of done locally in terms of the rules of Milwaukee has different rules the Madison does can also just started there early voting also some of the bigger cities have more early voting but er Madison's been great with or having it at the library is that's really increase the amount of people who are voting early and it's a great thing\nSo I Want to talk about like that the south side in Madison versus others and maybe um you don't know or have these statistics but um we actually live on this outside and I know where we go and vote 'em sometimes we make it by the hair of our chimney in in in that number is not very big\nAnd so you have a a pretty big job ahead of you being taking on this uh south north outside area as far as getting people to vote and they did he said that you were knocking on some doors or anything you can do that with an election\nYeah we know from past statistics that the south side of Madison has one of the lowest voter turnouts are the primary reason for that is because a lot of apartments a lot of people come in and out or when we're doing our calls we find a lot of disconnected number as what we do connect with a lot of people are so that is one challenge on our side of town\nUm but the great thing is is that when you do go to the door is he made some great people and everybody is ready to be involved they just need extra information and that's that's what we're I'm here to do so that a lot of apartments a lot of\nUm you know younger people that are coming in and out so it's just a matter of getting the information out there and in ah letting them normal actions coming\nI'm also the other thing I Would mention is in our area the congressmen Merkel Canada's a dozen having an opponent this year and Sheila steps receipt of somebody doesn't have an as an opponent this year but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't vote it's still very important in terms of the Senate race well Senator Toomey Baldwin the governor's race with Tony eras of Mandela Barnes\nUm the attorney general race with Josh call a state treasurer Sarah ... so there's a lot of important decisions that we made based on who we vote for 'em so some of those state ride statewide races if we can get the south side of Madison to come out in larger numbers that will help all of those races\nMight ... we were talking to one of the mayoral candidates about a week or so ago this last weekend at a black women as well as we've had a three them on you know we we've had three of them on and we haven't had this individual yet\nAnd uh made me aware that about only out of the two hundred and some thousand people in Madison and five hundred plus ... county only about Seventy five hundred but does that sound bite is that in Madison Dane County or a that's that's my remembering in a in an appropriate\nNot not throw Dane County are but in Madison that ah it's different between presidential years in mid term years we definitely see in mid term ... years or more you know younger people don't vote because it's not as a presidential years are just such a big thing that people pay attention to so it's a little more difficult in the mid term years to\nGet people's will be elections but that's why we need to have our volunteer teams out there working um in reminding people and telling people why it's important and some people say well it doesn't matter between the two parties and then I think in the past couple of years we've seen no there is a very large difference between the two parties\nUm and also just on the state on on the national level obviously and then on the statewide level um you know just with education being cut over the years and of course now Scott Walker's putting a little bit of money back and then says he's you know putting all this money in but it's still lower than the two thousand and a nine levels\nWith the education funding a pre existing conditions Scott Walker and the attorney general ... are trying to get rid of protections for pre existing conditions or they have a national law suits us trying to get rid of the Affordable CARE Act um so that's a a just a huge issues that uh people are very concerned about that and it's a reason to come out and vote this November sex mhm\nTell us if you is there anything else that pop other things that I like to think I'm In from burn on or what things are awesome [laughter] but other than is not ... you know we do the best we can what it's all about what may be one or two other things that are on the ballot there could be going unnoticed\nIn addition to the top races with senator Baldwin in a ... for governor and lieutenant governor um I'd mentioned the Josh Congress for attorney general sense Brad shovel as though our current attorney general Republican is is suing to get rid of the Affordable CARE Act\nOr getting Josh calling there would be great he's been really solid on a you know trying to reduce the amount of uh tricks that the Republicans are playing in terms of voting like when they wrote the voter id law they specifically target targeted college students to try and make us so that they couldn't vote and making it hard for them to\nUh since they move you know every year or so uh and not being able to use their student ideas they need to be a Scully or a special\nVoter id from the campus that just makes it more difficult for students and that was written specifically\nOr into the law by the Republicans lead attorney general race is very important what Josh call a running on the Democratic side and then also the state treasurer aside the Republicans wanted to try and get rid of that position I'm basically Scott Walker doesn't want oversight I'm so we want to keep that treasurer position we have a great candidates irregardless ski\nOr who's running for that and she's a great candidate who who has a background in a you know the ... and has very very interested so\nThank you thank you so much so much of it is plays drive time and I'm I'm fortunate that I get to read from

I Want to read a a paragraph now we're talking right now with assistant professor of sociology at Mississippi State university Margaret Hagerman ah her book is white kids growing up with privilege in a racially divided America and I'm going to read I quit a\nParagraph from there so a these are it starts off you're mentioning the names of some parents that you were talking with Tom and Janet along with other affluent white parents in this study who identify as progressive are often faced with what I refer to as a conundrum of privilege\nHow much work is enough\nHow does one raise children in ways that truly cultivate anti racist practices\nWhile still receiving an earned white advantage and the benefits\nOf class privilege is it possible to raise privilege children at the individual level in a way that maps onto their ideals\nEvery quality at a structural level\nAnd to what extent these parents exert their privileges even with in this context of race and class diversity\nAnd even given their good intentions to get what they want for their children so I mean not really robot home of the\nWell I Want this but how far should I go and\nOkay I'll send my children to the schools but when they send them to these schools they're going to have piano lessons after class after school and mass lessons after school and all these things so that if the school doesn't provided it's okay because I can provided on the side\nSo you're not really ... ever in the same boat\nAs everyone else even if you affirmatively choose to go there\n[noise] yeah I mean yeah and it's like you know I think that the biggest ... the bigger issue and I got a ... something like that again these terms but I think the larger issue is the fact that we live in such an inherently unequal society you know we have [noise]\nYou know wealth inequality that has stopped across generations right so we have\nForms that equality when it comes to class but also of course that comes to race and so you know it's you know I think the parents and my in my research are\nYou know sort of facing a paradox because they\nYou know again they're trying to make decisions about their own individual child in the context of inequality so for example if we didn't have such on equal schools in America than parents would not feel like they need to make these decisions to get their kid into the basketball if all the schools were strong\nThan that wouldn't be as big of a concern and so I think that the you know the larger sort of structural\nProblems that we have in this country particularly when it comes to things like educational inequality\nUm are what his parents trying to navigate the individual level and I don't think that that's easy\nHow does this when I was reading the book\nUh made in this part in particular it made me think about how much\nThe system is setting us up for this you know we defund schools so that we have to choose between the haves and have nots we set up schools where they don't get enough money we have to we need schools that have active involved parents on the PGA\nPTO otherwise they're not going to have enough money for our supplies are not enough money for playground supplies in the schools that my kids go do they have all these after school classes of the\nPie geo has organized so that even though the school district in cells cannot fun things for the kids to do after school don't worry we parents have come in and now there's all these programs at preschool so while I get to see my kids still attend Madison public schools\nI Am part of this structure that I worked very hard you do have an a cheap but I was able to have success after that\nHow much of this I mean that's what I was thinking about when I was reading is is that were set up a little bit to fail and the way we fund structure education and especially here in Wisconsin but I presume across the nation\n[noise] absolutely I mean I live in Mississippi and at least some um some stories about that but yeah I mean I think you're absolutely right I think that you know depending upon the individual you know parents to donate money and do fundraisers\nCetera so that you have enough money to do you know basic things at your school we're not is not in my opinion at least a good way to fund you know education I'm particularly not if you really want to you know have it be equal for everybody because obviously certain schools have parents that\nHave those resources to contribute and other schools don't um and you know obviously we map\nAnd segregation on to that and some other dynamics or you know I live in a state that is very rural and so there is another like it's a constant ... has some rural communities as well those those kind of differences are really meaningful and so\nYou know relying upon the local parents to raise you know I don't know I always buy chocolate from the kids in our neighborhood that see what they sell but you know it's like I Know what I'm buying those little chocolates that this money is going to help them have\nYou know a robotics team or something you know and so yeah I I think at a broader level of the ways that we as a nation or funding our education system um are are not ideal\nWe're talking with a professor at Hagerman about her latest book white kids growing up with privilege and racially divided America we're going to take a break right now due pledge rap and then we're going to come right back for interviewing more conversation with the professor\nAnd we're back here live in the studio I'm carousel buried and we're here with Diane ... and it is ... ... we we we agree that we can if you like the conversation that we were just starting we're going to bring you more of that conversation 'cause it's really a fabulous book\nUm let's ah have you call and get a copy of that book last week's books\nSold out we had more people that wanted the book\nThen we had we only had five copies this week we only have five copies of them don't be calling number six seven eight nine and ten that's not going to get you what you want to be so disappointing book last week was so good it was good oh good her right now I miss this one is as well\nDo five six two thousand one for fifty dollars the book is yours but you can make a contribution of any dollar amount you pay cash\nYou can pay my credit card you can paint check you can pay by

support ward every way so appreciate it so important to get out there and yeah and then the conversation to be have Diane and I were talking a just a few moments ago about how\nCertainly for children in my book who had parents that were you know there are some parents that were very much like I Want my child to watch these\nDocumentaries and read these books and you walk into some of their homes and they had some of the same textbooks that I was you know teaching in my class or reading you know on their table now coffee table you know so\nI you know I certainly think there's again variation variation is important um but for those children with parents who worry engaging with this critical sort of you know education or knowledge about race you know those children did have more on a thoughtful in my opinion and more sophisticated certainly understandings of that history\nI Want to pull out um one more quote there was another part of ...\nThe book that when I read it really made me sit up I\nI ... I was sitting in bed reading reading this over the weekend my husband started falling asleep next to me and I I Am I Will come up and I said you got to hear this\nPassage so I wanted to read a one more passage again this is from white kids growing up with privilege in a racially divided America and just a short passage is it's a conversation between two\nI I think they're sisters but maybe you can correct me to grow\nTo girls Erica and Maggie arrogance says they put signs with things that we shouldn't seen her school up in every classroom one of them is like you shouldn't call someone a racist or gay there's like there's always better words you use and if you're hearing a conversation like\nOh that's so gay or oh that's so racist you know you can probably use better words Matty so racist was one of the worst that people aren't supposed to say Erica yeah mhm like there's sag\nGay racist so yeah Maggie what if someone is doing something you think is racist Erica kids in my school aren't racist so that wouldn't be a problem that's that that's sort of blew me away\n[noise] yeah so the magazines actually me if I'm interviewing\nUm yeah yeah so I yeah [laughter] Joe diner figure out\nLike what's up with these rural than why you know why are they there and and now I was also I remember being very struck by that statement of you know well we don't have racism in our school that would that you would never have to use the word racist\nIn my school and like yeah you know I really thought there's a lot of research about what goes on in schools and certainly that that work on the work of Amanda Lewis I'm John Diamond you know there's some really important on a scholarship about what actually goes on inside\nSchools with respect to race and um you know if I did I actually go into the school for this project but I was really struck by\nHearing the idea that well my school doesn't have to have this problem um and even if it did I Would not be able to call it out because you\nThat word would would mean a break new rules\nAnd the school setting this up I mean to equate the word racist\nWhen the word fad human ... is a you know derogatory insulting term and ... there's no reason did you have to use the word fat raises is is a factual description of an action or person or\nA thing or or ... or something and to take that and equated the same as a derogatory term\n... is just sort of mind blowing\n[noise] yeah and you know I was trying to figure out why the teachers would have that rule arrive at school because of that rule and I think or perhaps perhaps happened um because the sense I got from talking to the kid that last was that you know a lot of times these kids were using the word racist as an insult in moments that has seemingly nothing to do with race so\nYou know even like in a in a joking kind of way so oh you're going to be on the block team and I'm going to an all white team oh you're such a racist ha ha\nYou know and so I'm Wondering if perhaps it was like they were trying to just avoid any of that altogether which again I still think of the problem because it's sending really powerful messages to young people about\nYou know language and about how to you know talk about these topics and so forth but um yeah I Do think that the children were also using the phrase racist and new kind of new ways um which also took away the significance of it you know if you're using it as a joke then\nYou know what does that mean you know was that made all of what you really think about that is a problem\nYou know ... ... we're talking with professor Margaret hang them in about a her latest book white kids growing up with religion and racially divided America gonna take a quick break right now remind you about pledge week where you can get a copy\nOf this book and support them re conversations and works that we're doing here W already and we're going to talk a little bit more about that right now and then come right back to our conversation with the professor\n\nWe go to Megan called in pledged for fifty dollars and got a copy of the book\nSo excited I'm I'm excited\nI Know Meghan she's going to read the book hopefully and we are going to talk about it not hopefully I\nI Know Meghan she'll read the book more and more detailed than I did and we'll have more questions and things to point out to me that I didn't see on my first reading and I can't wait and if you call him pledge a fifty dollars you can get a copy the book but Diane has found other things\nAll right so there's this whole thing of papers of different things when you could get if you pledge but for sixty dollars folks this looks like a great deal\nYou'd get a gift certificate for one hour massage which let's face it go for any way how much they are and what does the Dane County area and it's from a licensed massage therapist and if you think about ...

on on\nA film series you do featuring Italian films of course what are you in the graduate students at the Utah but you do this particular program\n[noise] sure so you W genetic I tell ya night is\nA graduate student initiatives and I worked together with my fellow\nGraduate students and we select the films together and we vote on which ones to show\nIn order to share Italian culture Italian language and also Italian cinema with the greater you W community and also with our students and so this all came about as an extra credit opportunity for\nOne one one or two to three to four students\nAnd so we definitely keep them in mind as we put together our lineup each semester\nAnd I noticed that you do a variety of films and specifically you do a combination of both classic Italian film and more contemporary pitchers told me about that\nThat's absolutely something that keeps people coming back to ...\nA lot of the community members and students that become majors and a graduate student says well really enjoy the classics so we tried to include about fifty percent classic\nFilms and then fifty percent up and coming directors which may appeal a little bit more to the undergraduate students\nIt's so you'll see at the end of the semester we've got a couple more commercial films that are new or is that we think the undergraduate students will really enjoy\nAnd of course the films that you're screening especially when I look at the classic films Italian cinema to this very day as well to please a major role in world cinema\nWell Italian cinema starting with near realists cinema had a huge impact on cinema worldwide shoe shock that we showed our first week is on the ... film\nAnd ... is our director and it's an excellent example of near realist film we've got non professional actors and the characters are speaking dialect shootings on location and then it's a story that takes place\nIn the aftermath of World War two so people in Italy are struggling and they're trying to find a way forward and the desperation in that movie is palpable it's\nIt's fantastic and uh so near real is found was quite influential on world cinema and Fellini of course as well\nI've learned out in the mirror real mean of course right Yankees train ride around a run around Nineteen fifty four he took his own signature style absolutely ups and yeah so tell me how do you go about picking your more contemporary films the screen\nSure so we started out the selection process by just sending out a message to all of our graduate students and asking what they would like to see us putting on\nOr including the line up for that semester\nAnd so part of its just switch films or directors the members of our department are familiar with and interested in sharing but also some of the newer films I've been looking into a couple of women directors that I wasn't\nFamiliar with until recently allowed it'd be ... and fanatical Leno we've included one film by loud it'd be ...
