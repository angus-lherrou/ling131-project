Mm\nBlue ... see\nMe\nSo we do know oh\nThey're not ... the ... can you talk about\nThat that's that's actually something new and we've been learning all about it although ... says a group of chemicals that has been used since the Nineteen thirties when it was first invented [noise]\nUm there are a large group there's actually an excess of five thousand he fast compounds I should explain pee fast is a an acronym it stands for PR and Polly floral alcohol substances\nSo you can see from them off or why we have an acronym ... are used an added to consumer products to make them resistant to water to Greece\nOr to state and so for that and it's very\nUm stable in the environment unfortunately stable in your body it stays in your body once you're exposed to it from three to nine years but it's used and things like firefighting phones to ever seen like at an airport and there is going to be an airplane coming down and they were concerned about a fuel fire\nThat the airport was formed\nThat's a acquiesce film forming phone and it's\nAnd I'm all military ah they call it a triple after these phones\nAre required to contain pee fast\nSo the military specifications even today and that's why you're seeing it in places like two acts Air National guard and if at Fort McCoy and folk field and the groundwater\nPee fast or very persistent and the environment there are similar to ... but they're even worse because they're highly soluble so they move\nAs quickly as water does drew a ground water aquifer um unfortunately we now know because of free search exposure to pee fast\nI'm is associated with a number of detrimental health effects\nI'm such as cancer ... disease but my biggest concern is actually around infants and and and babies um because its own and\nHuman breast milk in court blood serum levels have been in looking at and since that happened exposed issued drinking water is usually the primary route of exposure\nI'm the chairman levels are highest in babies which is a huge concern because they're a developmental tax and so that's one of the big concerns um other consumer products that people are probably more familiar with her like the do you remember the old black tough on pans that's P fast\nUm food rappers like around fast food um microwave popcorn but our focus is actually out in the phones and that the military facilities and we just learned recently that they will be testing for ... in groundwater at badger\nBecause ... is with us water to grow out of the been detecting residential wells\nUm here's the thing is we don't know yet\nThere is one site in a bind there and that for the military sites the military has only tested on site so if there's a drinking water well it serves the onsite personnel that's been tested but outside their facility ... test none has there's been no testing at all\nBut one site in Wisconsin where we do know there are very high levels is up and they're not\nUh didn't the Green Bay area the Tyco and full fire training facility up there um\nHas a tremendous groundwater contamination problem the health advisory the federal health advisory level for drinking water is Seventy seven zero nana grams per liter the\nLevels in the ground water at the end so facility in Marin at a greater than two hundred thousand so they're really high and unfortunately a number of of families I think it was thirty six families have been exposed to to be fast through their drinking water\nI'm told that that's because\nIt's highly soluble the groundwater contaminant problems are huge because of the three of them said and what Bree a Minnesota ... covers hundred square miles it's it's huge\n[laughter] even with\nThis that's frightening I mean it's more the um when I went out you know you\nWere actually calling for a complete ban on the fast that it'd be removed from consumer products that we because right now this is what's surprising to me despite the fact that it's been around for the Nineteen thirties\nAnd scientists have been looking at it for decades in the EPA has been talking about it for decades\nThe government has not said any standards in the state of Wisconsin there are do environmental standards for any of the forms that pie fast and so last year we petitioned the DNR has accepted that petition for two forms of pee fast\nNow at the time\nWe thought well that's going to be really good but then we learned that there's thousands of these so we have submitted a second petition to the state which they are currently considering for the sum total concentration and what that means as you add them all together and then you establish a standard because they're all\nDifferent combinations eat manufacture has slightly different\nSo um and this is supported by statements by the director of and I just\nI'm seeing the best way to protect 'em a human health is to look at them as a class and this is similar to what we've done for dioxins for ... garments for PC bees which also have many many different forms\nIs to look at what's the total concentration and at what level was protective of human health so that we're working on at the state level federally where else on networking with communities across the country in fact later this month I'm going to New England where there's a lot of\nAny organizing around this issue and we are going to talk about what can happen at the federal level because of the federal level ... is not regulated or the either so the major environmental laws like the clean Water Act the clean Air Act the safe drinking water act\nUm hazardous waste clean up laws at this it is completely unregulated\nAnd so it's making a very difficult for communities to get a response action because the military and even with state standards\nThe military is barking at compliance the earning Sullivan her way up at the Pentagon level recently testified before the Senate is\nDepartment defense may consider state standards but not necessarily comply with that\n... I'm Talking about the\n... ... ... in the center\nDue to be I'm ... I'm not ... not just the water but the food that I'm not water use to grow the fish any ... or any indicated there yet or do we just met no\nFor the most part we don't know that's one of the reasons we're asking for an inventory because Iceland is talking about the military sources states other civilian so the civilian airport there's ... there's chemical manufacturing there's been no\nSurvey of the of the state to look at where these potential sources are now there has been some drinking water\nTesting I Know I'm not perhaps answering your answer the question directly but [noise] um they're eleven thousand\nUm public water supply systems in Wisconsin and\nNineties for so these were for communities of greater than ten thousand or tested for ... so the majority of the law only nine eleven thousand have been tested those Ninety that were tested was ahead and fill that detected um pee fast and all the crosshairs\nNext time I Can't remember the other community right now but for by and large the vast majority of public drinking water supplies have never been tested and then you have like me with a private drinking water well certainly I haven't talked to testing and hoping that the army will do that so [noise] you\nA statute of limitations be on sexual assault cases\nAh how what should victims rights be if they uh have to want to watch it will have to press charges a criminally or simply for sexual harassment or sexual assault I'm\nWatching certain guidelines be like a what times should be considered legal sexual assault and what time should not be considered sexual assault\nUm this is what judge Kavanaugh is now allowed a choose\nTo do one of the only nine people in the country who can do this kind of a weighing in\nOver what isn't isn't considered justice and the\nArgument for the Republicans right now has been\nWe don't care if he's a rapist pretend to listen to ... to a Christine Blasey Ford we're not going to listen to any of the other victims and then after we pretend to listen to her we're going to say she was a mixed up a kind of weird and\nShe she mentioned was offered something\nFrom someone some time but not the one that she not the person she remembers a hundred percent clearly being her attempted rape is\nAnd she didn't have our our perfect victim genesis or something of what we might call the iconic are perfect written they destroy her\nAnd her Fifteen year old self and I think that was what was so devastating the normalization um attempt to normalize sexual violence in high school\nThat yes a hundred percent um the idea that this that they they they for the number\nOf trial balloons before a the hearings that ended up\nUh it through the media that ended up a showing up during the hearings and one of those was that this was just quote unquote highschool behavior and um and that is a quote unquote if and\nIf this is the new standard than every man should be nervous and that no man is ever going to be able to or will want to run for any significant\nOfficer job the idea there is that every ... you know it's an irony right\nBecause that must have been attacked for generations now as being man hating and when we we said that sexual assault of the problem um when media we get bombarded with but not all men you feminist hey man you you think all men are right that\nWe don't think all manner rape it but apparently Republicans do the I dare try to normalize the idea that\nEvery boy in high school just more history girl [laughter] that is not normal\nYou know you link in your piece um you linked to a a article I'm In the journal\nAggression Belgium and then trauma by an Sarah Jay hearts the perpetrator responses to victim confrontation I'm ... and victims self blame ... deny attack\nI mean first victim an offender too confusing silenced and victor's on victims um and I appreciate that Lincoln I Want folks to take a look at that because that's what they did deny attack and reverse victim an offender that that tactic\nUm was effective\nHe talked about it really I'm Sorry can you talk\nAbout that and then I went to ... please please comment on that and then I Want to talk more about your article as well\n[noise] sure um well the the study was really fascinating I'm Doug Owens\nYou just as you just read a is\nUm apparently the very time tested a strategy that shows up among sexual abusers when they are confronted\nWith their assault um when when they're asked for any kind of accountability they deny they reverse the or are they reverse they they basically as they did\nTo make a long story short they\nUh have they go on a a sort of\nGas lighting a strategy of making it seem like not only did they not do it if they did do it it's the victim's fault and uh so therefore the abuser is the real victim and that's what we saw in ... beach and it's also what we saw\nFrom Lindsey Graham and Orrin Hatch and Chuck Grassley\nHounding their fist on uh the the desks and and yelling about how this was how Kavanaugh enjoyed the wars indignities that anyone had experiences McCarthyism 'em\nAnd apologizing to him not to Boise for 'em\nI thought so yeah that makes you so we have to I think I'm Sorry we have the individual\nUsed by offenders abdominal but I I I think that the that when you talk about the others I was like a systemic\nUse of ... and that was painful\nBut yes that that's the thing right that they um in addition to\nAll behave like abusers um structurally the fact\nIs they believed in the other reason that I say history has regrets thing not repeating it that we had at this point in America the benefit of hindsight we could have done better than we did as a country and as a government\nUh in terms of the way we treated Anita Hill we could have learned from that experience and in bed\nThey doubled down and not\nOnly a work to reunify the notion that sexual assault is normal and should not be disqualifying for a judge even though it's actually a crime and maybe you don't all criminals on the court separate from\nEven actual assault maybe you just don't like criminals on the court um but they also made it very clear\nThat uh that they were going to structurally deny\nLazy Ford a fair hearing\nUm they did not allow\nAny corroborating witnesses or even though many said they wanted to testify they did not allow an FBI investigation before the fact won the FBI investigation happened it was just a sham version of it that was not allowed to ah to talk to most of the witness uh most of the corroborating\n... people who could offer testimony\nUm they did not the men on the judiciary did not ask Boise for question\nThemselves they hired a female human shields sex crimes prosecutor to act to grilled lazy forward as if she was literally on trial and then they did not have the sex crimes prosecutor talked to the actual alleged perpetrator or structurally\nIt was a discriminatory process and the gas lighting involved in talking about how they had treated her with such fairness was skin calling Lee disgusting [laughter]\nUm so yeah there there's a massive\nAmount of structural discrimination and\n...\nUh in creating a ... as a justice\n... attacking me ... reverse victim an offender it'd be a ferret Jay hurts the article coming on and twenty Seventeen the other thing you write about in this field and I I I I I I think it was\nA little bit of an antidote for me so please you know I I Would say charters check it out but you say I'm a doctor Blasey Ford was not afforded the luxury of expressing legitimate anger can you say to talk about that\n[noise] Oh absolutely um I and I want to I Want to right now just plug I'm Rebecca Traister has a book called good and bad I'm\n... has a book called a rage becomes her Brittany Cooper has a book called eloquent rage this isn't this is a conversation that is\nLong overdue that women are denied the legitimate political a motion of anger um and we are always\nEven in scenarios in which we have every right\nTo be of rage and righteous indignation whether that because uh we've been sexually assaulted or because somebody wants to somebody or a government wants to control our bodies or a we've been harassed or we've been paid less than our male colleagues whatever for whatever reason we might have\nA legitimate claim to anger we are dismissed if we show any sign of not being\n... complacent and go along get along and my role you look so much more pretty few smiles and all of that and throughout the ah the hearing lazy Ford\nWas as you said in the in the beginning um she was almost Haynes fully I'm\nPolite she said she wanted help she tried so hard to be deferential in her presentation um meanwhile Kavanaugh ... room and cry and why\nIn ... and acted basically like an overgrown toddler having a a massages tantrum might ...\nThat I don't think many people have noticed that time the the talks and she ... she spoke for I now I it's a little while since I wrote the piece but I think it was something like seven the minute they do something and he spoke for about forty five minutes so like\nEvery bombastic Jude in the office who wants to dominate a meeting and not let ... women get a word in edgewise each took\nCertainly changing is the music and he's a wonderful singer songwriter and son of mayor and Cheney the founder of or one of the main found is that the social justice than us and then a lady critters is that they are and the\nBoy who goes to the wire of the daytime anytime bank and I are are mutually workspace ... the band I'm really excited to be

program as well which we started this year which has a college readiness program for they they say middle of the roads students that they just need that extra push 'em\nTo get them to help whether they're first generation students of color um that haven't ... you know experience College of their parents haven't experienced college so that's an amazing program that we started this year I'm really fortunate to have it this year\nAnd then we um as well work very closely with Madison college because they have the scars of promise program for students that they will to bridge that financial gap for students and and pay for their\nUm finances if they're not able they're sad I'm whisk camp scholars program at Madison college on for stem subjects for science technology engineering and math and they're helping those students again bridge that financial gap for students that are going in that field and transferring into a four year college\nSo we're trying to work very closely um with those schools we have um [noise] uh\nPretty you know large school that work program for our students as well\nLike Andrea started them operation faster or students um can participate in if they qualify um but we have over Seventy programs at our school the ... okay ten percent of our students are in those programs that were always encouraging students if they're not they\nThem with that the help that they need to be successful has been a challenge for some of the kids that I've talked gotcha gotcha and do not have you seen any challenges are\nIn in in your your experience with your your years\nI think along with the academic preparation is so important and so when when the students aren't succeeding um or not taking it seriously they they don't understand how that's going to help them you had mentioned like how poor and you know even\nYou know some of your schooling was back then and taking it seriously and and if if those students don't have that support at home mom you know and and somebody isn't believing in um that's what we try to offer like Lee Child off and on that hoping that support and say this is you\nTake it out I called I liked it and it's such a golden ticket like you know the market [laughter] I like this is your ticket you know if you if you don't want a struggle that maybe like our families are struggling and like you won't have to rely on anybody won't have were\nYou know stay with somebody that isn't supportive and kind you know I feel that this is your tickets we try to give them that support and hope that they can do it they can do it and they will have to have a ... you know the American college is amazing they want to take everyone\nAnd I tell them you have a clean slate if you messed up the first couple of years you've gotta clean sites are older and you can feel it and it's so amazing when you see those kids come back and they matured you know why they are doing it sell enjoyable to say\nYeah that that's really important because um it it's amazing I was reminded of the the impact that hope can have when I was at the gym the other day\nFor the ... century and you know [laughter] you want to give up with the people she's like oh I actually did more than I thought I could yeah I mean it's it's\nDefinitely important to have that that have that hope um and then I like the the idea of the um the mentors and having other people can speak into that because you know it's just one of those things where you know like you said parents just aren't there the the information that happens it's not as valued\n[laughter] and maybe it should be at that age um so so I have another question for\nYou guys so if you are a um 'cause like I said my wife and are busy and we we struggled trying to keep all the information that comes at us from the schools but if you if you have a single parent out there who works and they just their job\nReality just won't let them get to all the PTA and you know teacher conferences and and you know dysfunction in that function\nHow can they connect with the the ministers like yourself the staff like yourself who are there to support the students and and make a connection to get this information to have a conversation to partner with you all in the schools how\nCan how can they do that when they're busy of Monday through friday is just not a reality for them to be able to you know be there after school or make a meeting how can how can they make\nMe personally [laughter]\n'cause I mean I I live a busy life too you know we all do but um as a parent I just feel like it is very very important as that parent you have to find time somewhere along the line you have to find time if it's to be an email\nYou know when tax 'em [laughter] you got to have you got to have a day off somewhere\nYeah [laughter] I Know you're not working seven days a week\nTwenty four hours a day so that there there has to be some time in there where you have to make time to make that connection because I Know um teachers and counselors and all of that we're in the schools [laughter] you know\nUm during those times and um and like you know some of us will give you a cell phone you know to reach us after hours and things like that but\nI think as a parent you have to make time not they don't make excuses ... will make time because I I Know how some kids feel when I'm\nNo matter what's going on the parent just never shows up ... and it might not be because you were at work you know it might not be because uh you don't have the transportation is a choice or that you were making as that parrot and so I I Can't sugarcoat it\nI'm Sorry [laughter] I'm not and I'm not just talking about African American parents I'm Talking about parents in general\nOr just uh you you have to find time to be involved in some shape form or fashion you know like me I'm more involved in my husband is [laughter] but uh sometimes we have to play tag right and sometimes I have to tell him you know what you're going today\nWhat [laughter] I don't know actually I don't think of all but you know just to get more involved you know because this is your child you\nKnow so you you have to have communication her teachers need to see your face from time to time you know so I'm as a parent you know these are kids um we're responsible for them no one's going to advocate in support him better than we do for and so you just um\nSo are you just you just have to find that time you ... you just have to [noise] um so once one of the ... of course from ... to was the um\n[noise] the idea of expectations are because that's that's not necessarily something the one person or one teacher woman is really can change 'em but if you're if you're a parent or you're a gardener of a child\nHow can you impart the expectation that your child has even if the expectations or would you hope we are at the at the school\nAnd yeah well\nAgain I'm expectations from the teachers are so important and like we said don't allow that soon it not to succeed because you know they're you know they had the ability if they didn't have the ability they would be getting support and one of those classes right they'd be getting math apart English supporter and we offer those now to students so there's really no excuse\nAnd if they aren't getting the help support they need we assigned them now likely assign them in the English it starts to assign them in Memphis sign them into science so that there are no excuses\nAnd we you know we double check those DNS lists like every grading period and then we you know a sign them to where they're getting support so\nThose ... expectations from the teachers are very important and like we said if we're not noticing that or just let it slip by they're saying well you don't care obviously it out and it it takes a while I mean it takes a while for them to join us as a freshman year because it didn't turn my Simon and nobody noticed that's\nCool [laughter] but you know they get that first [laughter] I guess they didn't notice right Renee wrote that\nGrades on again you know understanding that is that if you're if you don't care about that who does who remained them what are you going to do with those grades so again all of us you know have to be on board with that you know especially if the parents aren't helping and that his school staff absolutely have to be noticing and tell them telling them that they can do it\nAnd I am a firm believer the first teacher is the home okay and so if we as parents don't have expectations for kids or instill the expectations in them there and no one else probably will\nAnd so I'm\nAs a parent you know um\nIt's a lot that I that I just tell my kids you know like they say you you encourage them and you build their confidence you know like I I tell my kids all the time you're beautiful you know and things like that just those positive reinforcement those positive energy to get them out and feeling confident about themselves because if they don't fill it with an\nThen\nOne else was going to put it in them so if you have it already that's that that foundation or if you haven't already then you're going in and so regardless of what happens when you get into the school system you know you know what I can do this because I\nBelieve in me right and then you set your own expectations for and then when the schools don't or the teachers don't didn't like I tell my daughters than you prove them wrong what role do if you if the teacher tell you they don't expect you to do this do you do it and then you say now ... you know I'm\nAn odor that that's kinda how you know I when I had um my oldest daughter had an experience in the fifth grade [laughter] with the teacher and I'm the teacher told her she didn't come from the norm she didn't know what that meant [laughter] you know and so she came home and she said mom what is not coming from the norm me\nAnd I'm like Mm depends on how you doing [laughter] you know\nAnd so it kind of a ... ... it robbed us wrong and so when we went and we you know it was excellent teacher what happened it\nAll went down to they were doing the math problem and teachers nowadays they don't meet the kids where the kids are ... and so they were doing math and you know how you say raise your hand if you want to come and do the problem on the board and\nCannot raise their hand to do to problem on the board and she got the right answer machine and do the steps that the teacher said her or to do or whatever but the kids was like hey I did it easier we could do away while you know so I don't know if the teacher kind of get offended or what but the kids with like can't we just\nDo it this way or and then there was a power struggle [laughter] and um you know that that stereotypical type where are you know most African American kids come from\nInner city of Chicago ... and so we had the ... income from Chicago [laughter] you know um and we had to let her know you know she does have to educate a parent and it's okay for\nAn African American kids you know how to do a math problem right now um and so if we had not instill that in her during those early years anything she had come up against the challenge of anything\nGoing up ... to step back and gave them well you know and so we have to have the expectations before they even get into the middle schools and high schools and things like that and so then\n\n\n\nYou're listening to W.
