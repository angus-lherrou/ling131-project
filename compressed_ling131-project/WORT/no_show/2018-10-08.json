to it so many of the radium girls will no longer do pay to that point they moved on to other job said no we're not ready to not children for example\nAnd the other thing was that the seemed to me seems so innocent as well they just have a sort of Eighteen foot or it might be a fool to and say that when they didn't really think I Would think of it for us\nBut the thing about radium poisoning is that it is a poisoning that\nTight clay the our entire body and\nTitle be eliminated from the human body one fits in you could even NASA good and it keeps on an aging destructive radioactive power so that I came to\nThat a woman might suggest experience about ... is also has to fix the exposure soon became not just one Eighteen to put two and she goes to the dentist and help them pooled but didn't\nBut the next two would start to hug him the next to the next two until she didn't have to go to the dentist anymore\nBecause her teeth would truly fool out on and it was just horrifying poisoning you know if it wasn't in your mouth within you know back when your foot on what was happening with the radio was destroying the winning from the inside out\nAs I said I had different symptoms CDs off to they were walking by and so it took years to anyone to ask you pay attention I'm One of the things that was really striking to me in between the research for the couldn't following the story if the radium goes\nWith to realize that it was partly the women themselves\nTo kind of go together among the friendship that books on the side you know will you might have a fool me at all I could have fooled by but it's\nThe same thing you know how can we all be set you know these are now they've teenage Donald heightened to allow young women in my early twenties they shouldn't be getting all drug test you know they shouldn't how bad teeth falling out you know this is\nPeculiar horrifying but the only connection is that work for me what was so striking about be strong and\nIs the way with Ben who identified that was a problem and realize that something has to be done and then they tried to get together and to make things happen not only for themselves but to protect other walkers and other women who was still being hot\nNow virtually these are these homosexual went to a lawsuit to go over the corporations how did that come about and why were these suits historically significant\nWell again it took a long time because I'm you know anyone who who is the media with this kind of thing you know an occupational poisoning why she said that might be a little suits you know the company very quickly\nYou know bombs down the hatches out and actually you know to read the story of the rating goes is to bleed examples of egregious corporate greed that quite literally make two Jews drop you caught believe anyone would be that Thomas to be easy to critical young women\nFacing death on it's obvious that it's that walk on ... the pleading with it that way but they still deny it on the cutting spot you know actually takes the radium goes a long time to find a lawyer\nBut they were determined to do and the reason that historically significant as you as you all the question is because this was one of you know the ground breaking one law legal cases in this scale you know the case of the radium girls was one of the first cases\nWhere and in the soil was held his goals for the health about employees\nOn the radio and they'll sort of paved the way uh you know decades down the line to organize Asian such as OSHA\nA you know which protects thousands of people

of the things I thought was interesting as a parallel between\nA ... a young women and girls and frankly I currently we're a exposed as a result award we ... through the run over World War one\nAnd World War two comes around and people are working on the Manhattan Project for taking radiation sickness much more seriously or was there a direct knocking them they were using to the radio girls\nAnd I'm not stop documented I see that that aren't like say you know my radium golf I'm laughing about it he said you know that that don't they walk in the in the wild boar and say they say they need a

Bucky Badger badger\nSo it's really what we're just trying to do again as emphasized his whole community of artists and how art can be used as an avenue for the healing and one of the way that we really push that is also two of our staff are actually I'm I'm art and have studied art therapy\nAnd and Michael tell us how can art help people heal from a these kinds of experiences\nAre as art is very he'll say to me in many many amazing ways or me having cp\nIs having a server every the bad car accident\nAt five days old I was told that I might not walk or even be able to think on my own so with the art it became a positive\nAnd not only that it became my own little world does create in my ... my way of thinking my way of acted and related to other folks and myself\nDo you think it actually I mean there's there's been studies that suggest that um that are actually helps rewire your brain and do you think that's what's going on [noise]\nYes it is but also\nMe out to the positivity all around me so I have positive burns dies on my wall so when I wake up I could see because as you wake up you have to have something that'll drive you to doing better you know say like\nSay the mind is all is all is the mine say everyday existence ... hit show what she sees\nUsually turn now to be it's how you they wouldn't mind going so al ... positivity asked once when I wake up to as well as going to sleep\nAnd and do you have a particular audience in mind for your are\nEveryone everyone because I feel we all have a disability but to turn that disability say it to a capability that Superman is a is in us all\nAnd uh so finally um men well uh what steps can individuals take to address domestic violence issues in both their homes and their ... communities\nSo one of the things that I like to really emphasize is just getting out there and volunteering um there's many wonderful organization so you're in ... county that worked in domestic violence for example of days and end up these Wisconsin um another thing too is just educating yourself you know through those organizations or through multiple different readings that can be found on line\nAnd also keeping an open mind and believing victims when someone tells you that they're going through a situation\nI'm obviously either maybe many times on where you can't have like empathize or sympathize but you just have to try their best to really understand who is what they're going through\nAnd that these situations are very difficult sometimes it takes I Believe this tickets was seven to ten times for someone to get out of a domestic violence situation and then there's that whole process of mental process thinking I'm actually going to do at this time I'm actually going to do at this time\nSo really just being there for people is one of the most important things and just having that sense of like\nWanting to understand and wanting to know um and also going to events that I'm organizations have to take an opportunity to get to know people who are working in these fields and getting to know the people who may or may not have been victims and decided to you know talk their story and speak their truth\nAll right we've been speaking with men well Sara their community outreach and volunteer coordinator at you need those an artist Michael Ward thanks for joining us on the eight o'clock buzz you will be back with a Helena white ah talking about\nHer World War one diary coming up right after this\n\n\n[noise]\n\nOn November eleventh Nineteen Eighteen the allied forces in Germany signed an armistice agreement ceasing hostilities and what was then known\nOnly as the great war but what we know remember as World War one that's the one hundredth anniversary of the end of the war to end all wars draws near\nW.

T. forward slash or W ... whether a on the weather page the future graphic this morning is the usual go sixteen water vapor image of North America which is quite revealing this morning a lot going on there so if you have a computer handy\nUm pull up the top graphic on the page there\nAre because there's two tropical systems of not which I'll talk about the both of which may influence the weather one ... well we'll say I'll talk about that [noise] ah anyway if you're a stick of constantly being a wet and gosh dark until It's MORNING\nOr we will get some relief or after Wednesday of this week I Can't say we get a lot of sunshine will definitely be drier those we go out Thursday through the weekend there should be more son anyway in ... during most of that time frame or at least a higher overcast\nAh after uh September which was Seventy five percent wetter than normal the first week of October is turned up better than six times wetter than normal yes six hundred and sixty six percent as it turns out of our normal moisture up through while yesterday so that was the first week of the month\nThree point one one issue so far of rain in October when we should barely had half an inch by now\nThe sun is cracks through um increasingly over the past couple of hours and we'll see a little bit more of that today more so south and east and west so western north\nA strong returned flow from the north behind us so just upper forties with strong northwest early wins on Thursday the wind will be but [noise]\nOh probably twelve to twenty miles per hour and gusting up into the twenty mile per hour range so cool and cold actually in breeding Thursday west wind on friday but we'll high temperature or maybe just in the mid forties\nAnd a low temperatures possibly bottoming out or below freezing ... friday night into Saturday let's take the likeliest possibility with a little bit warm as we go over the weekend much drier at the end of the week so through a lake watch our they'll hire them lake [noise]\nAh them lakes were coming up a little bit last I looked a we've got about half an inch a yesterday through midnight in about another tenth of an inch is just you're in Madison at the at the uh thing county airport\nAh about another tens of an inch this morning we shouldn't get a whole lot more than the next twenty four hours and he just from time to time so but the lakes don't [laughter]\nThey are a base and don't need any more water and we can't seem to get the water levels to go down in part because of this a preposterous Lee wet eight weeks or getting on for eight weeks anyway seven weeks we've had now\nAnd they certainly don't need any more rain anywhere on the upper Midwest the entire upper Mississippi basin seems to be getting pretty well splashed with this ah yeah\nWasn't interesting fact I learned was that the city has given the sort of the calculation that every inch of rain might result in a three inch rise in lake levels just because if you mentioned the whole base and dreams into the lake it's not just falls on the lake it's what falls yeah areas around yeah I Know the run off that goes so as we discovered when we\nGot a Fifteen inches in just a small area west of the lake and it all went into the lake and then down the rivers so yes I was actually wondering what the ratio is I hadn't seen that but that sounds probably\nI write fee it linked to any other source it was just put on a general flood page from the city so I think probably vetted properly and\nUh one hopes anyway yes or I won't have an update this Wednesday I'll be off on the off from the news this week but I Will I'm being again next Monday to see what see we'll see what happens if we got a convincing freeze between then and now it folks have questions or comments about the weather from off the air do five six two thousand and one ... we'll talk yesterday\nOr I'll be ... I'll be here no kidding that's out so we did have a we have a frost are officially we\nHit thirty three I think on that one cold morning was a friday or Saturday morning a couple of weeks ago or so not technically a freeze that would count as frosty measure the temperature it's six feet above ground level\nIf it's common at thirty three and six feet above ground level it's almost certain you've got ice crystals and the grass below that so uh certainly uh frost then Kennedy Airport or you you may have locked out I I had some of my tender plants\nKind of started a little bit but I didn't even get a convincing freeze where I was a up in ... county so\nOkay so ah yeah that was just checking in little tip chatting at [laughter] All right thanks wraps thank you next week yes yeah\nAre up for another great weather forecast and a will jump right back into a some more music or we're having our friends or kiss or is Ken and Kevin stopping by and telling us about the greatest war there multimedia show that's happening\nI remember reading the arm is the end of World War one so that'll be coming up out of ten thirty to just momentarily but just finishing up but that of music from the

... and do me any\nNew the new\n...\nGoodman mood young then me a new job this man is due to John ...\nAnd then the show was a product of of what I Know which is playing and writing music [laughter] and what I Am a hobbyist about which is history and combining the two All right\nSo yeah it is a musical show so why don't we just jumping into one of the uh what do you have for a start yeah sure so we thought that you know for this week and and each week as you said a leading up to the\nTo the show to bury more November eleventh we would introduce some of the music that we're going to play in the show as part of trying to better understand what this says we call it a rock and roll history show\nAnd ah I Would say it's rock and roll history I'm more by attitude necessarily than than old genre I mean some of this stuff is definitely rock but some of its some Irish I'm ... and other things too so um the show covers a ... a lot of different aspects of the wars I think what the first on we're going to do\nIs from the last part of the show where we are talking more about the legacy of\nOr or singing you might say about the legacy of World War one\nAnd the or will be called the end of empires um that the chapter in the in the show we called the end of empires so there was of course the Russian Revolution um which is very famous the end of the German empire the end of the Ottoman Empire um which is you know today turkey in the middle east\nAnd also really the sorting through the beginning of the end of the English Empire for that matter even though they were technically a winner there's going to the end of their kind of colonial rule so this song or we're going to play this movie images behind it so that will be about all those things but the song that we chose is more in the kids' repertoire which is the recruiting sergeant\nWould just talking about the Irish revolution which had seeds in World War one although really got going after but Easter Rising was a Nineteen sixteen uh when when the Irish\nUh took over the post office in Dublin or an attempt to uh\nTo uh become a free country from England thinking that England was distracted enough with World War one that uh they wouldn't stop them and the Irish were being scripted to fight for the British Government or in World War one that exactly right so this song um is kind of represents the resistance that was happening and if they were the exchange between an Irishman\nAnd an English charge and who is trying to recruit him into the English Army and it's called the recruiting sergeant\n[noise]\nBy law down around in\nMiami you should use my\n\n\nDamage or were you were being by\nWell they may be no di di di him John John town made me and my dad uptown\n...\n... maybe it maybe ... liners\nBut you know\nWell the sergeant my Las ... nine ... mile was most dino makes when men were all his we might\nDown your ...\nDollar store Mormon meal below we now well having data Caitlin has been buying the dying\nHome or rain or when North Haven were known not gone out with a plan\nWriting in labor to be done like\nWas you know\nLetting men finding like well why are\nThey not made darn down\nIn the summertime are very good night\n\nWhile yeah that is probably what's Miller that's long from three failed so but yeah this is a interpretation that seems like it's more than a ... a minor key\nBut during the song is already summer as it is or it's a satire it's a black humor but this just seemed to have has it changed in terms of how you interpret it\nYeah well so it's you know we we we hold that one court for a long time which were really trying to hold the tension right because if you're in revolutionary resistance you're you're in constant tension right there's there's no you're you're pulling out all safety nets in the bottom are the the floor beneath her feet\nI'm a because who knows what's on the other side right and so a musical you trying to hold that tension\nAnd then we we are elongated the the lyrics are the actual lyric rhythm for those of you who are counting is is twice as long so that basically to hear the words better um because we like as as as those who've seen the ... before no we sometimes like to play things a little quickly\nAnd um it may be harder to hear the lyrics in that sense so we thought this would work better for that\nCertainly and one of the things that just came to mind is I Can't remember of anti war movement or even a it seems like the first organize anti war movements or at least once recorded history started coming around World War one\nThat we had a great ah ah ... the French a union leader and socialist who was murdered on the eve was leading a huge anti war movement in France right before the war started and his murder just a few days before the war starts so\nUh yes and then we had on the states people are still reeling from the civil war so they did not want the slaughter on that scale but then we have governments just really kicking into a whole propaganda apparatus or in high gear for the first time\nYeah it's true I mean there's a worldwide socialist movement and and the ... the socialists were pretty much across the board against the war and in Europe there are a lot of socialist you felt like\nSoldiers you know workers of the world unite right don't you have more in common with the person that you're fighting against in the trenches than you do with your own commanders in your own government\nAnd um and the United states or at least at first was very like you said unenthusiastic even from the government level was unenthusiastic but certainly the anti war movement stayed strong um for for a lot of the war in in the United states\nStates Wisconsin will play this song uh probably not today but hopefully next week um Wisconsin has referendum ... in a few cities are just days before the United states officially declared war and World War one\nI'm In early April in Nineteen Seventeen and the each referendum was voted resoundingly no I mean like like Seventeen hundred to twenty you know in these in these municipalities are that's the question was do you support a declaration of war\nAnd um and to one of the two senators ... voted against that declaration and nine of the eleven representatives voted against it\nAnd that actually gave Wisconsin to the moniker the trader state\nWhich I Know it's one of the songs that will be featured on the show that will be visiting the luggage or we're going to hopefully get some more band members because the song is a dialogue I I'm I'm singing sort of the voice of Wisconsin and then the band is responding with the voice of America how basically kind of this\nJust a combination of argument about not wanting to go to war and you should go to war\nUm and I think it speaks to a lot of conflicts about that how that that argument all of a sudden becomes very overly simplified when when the nation's really feeling the the march to to arms okay\nYeah so are the show again of the greatest worry it'll be happening at the Barrymore Theatre on a Sunday November eleventh which is a hundred years till the end of the war to the day when the cannons than the the trench warfare stopped\nIn Europe and yes an event that has a lot of repercussions so who else is going to be in the show I Know the kiss or is obviously are going to be there\nWere playing were playing musical you were playing about half the show maybe slightly more\nUm and we were playing a six or seven brand new originals as part of it and and a few more if you count sort of reworked a tradition nose or even a new covers\nAnd then um the labor and his famous orchestra from from Milwaukee which um I I don't know that he's played much here in Madison but um he's a really talented\nA singer songwriter he's really witty has a has has this great kind of dark sense of humor he's got this a song called a ... hour he's he's he's sort of lecturing about\nMarxism but in a while playing a ukulele [laughter] you know where the where the base and the guy hitting like a like a suitcase behind him\nAnd I'm so he's so he's going to do most of the material that he's going to the show is is World War one actual World War one songs or he's going to play this ridiculous on called Belgium put the ... on the Kaiser which is basically like propaganda and musical form\nQuestion is do they get to vote [noise]\nDo you think she sees her that\nI Do think he is so where\nDo you think the key is um [noise]\nAnd she buys the clothes that just

O. R. G. F. M. dot O. R. G. my name is Patty ... and I'll be your host today first before we dive in today's show I Want to thank everyone who pledged during our fault pledge drive\nThird year when I was here so Melinda\nYour new book starts out with the lumpy national anthem proud to be a lumpy by Willie French Lowery and and you were married to really French Lowery [noise] um yeah yeah you also write about the importance of songs and singing to lumpy\nAnd you know the proud to be a lumpy has a really memorable tune so I'm really curious if you would be willing to recite or if you feel like singing if you would [laughter] would recite proud to be a long before us\nSure Ryan we sing it with me oh fantastic with you [laughter] and I don't know where he's or do I can't sing it either but\nWell I'll I'll do my best yes I'm proud to be alone the in the end yes I Am when I grow up into this world I'm going to be just what I and my mother\nTheir father are proud of me they want me to be free free to be anything I Want to be and that's the core is there a couple of versus um it's a song that really is designed to tell us who we are but also we're we're going\nWell thank you so much I I wanted to hear it when I when I read about it in your book I thought I have no idea how this sounds so thank you so much for for singing that this is great for them so I was wondering if you could talk a little about the importance of singing and if you could\nTell us what shape note singing is and and why singing as important to the lumpy\nWell I'm the sort of centuries of tumultuous change that we've endured I mean much of it of course in the early decades of European settlement but the changes still to multiple is an ongoing\nEvery community needs forms of continuity you know ways to stick together and things that they share and the ... people have particularly used singing as a way to maintain our kind of strength or sense of being together traditions that are passed on to one another to to to subsequent generations\nAre often in musical form certainly in my family and so\nUm we use singing and all sorts of settings whether it's kind of entertainment or worship or funerals which is what I\nTalk about most in the book young or other types of how well there's many many ways to saying in the community um my family's things as they as they cook you know thing after after meals and food are really tied together in my family um\nAnd there are especially also tied together and funerals because singing it's such an important way to heal\nUm shape note singing was an early form of of um literacy education was not readily available to many of our people throughout the Eighteen hundreds and win shape note singing\nBecame part of our community um in the late Eighteen hundreds it also became a form of literacy it was a way that people learn to read not only music notes but also kind of actual words and notes um\nAnd shit and the thing is you know a form of Christian him singing that was spread rapidly throughout the United states because\nMany people in the United states were not literate and couldn't read from him books that they could read shaped notes and they could memorize what each of these shapes was supposed to sound like and that type of singing just took off phenomenally in our community because we we value music so much and we particularly want it to use it\nUse music as a as a skilled development um and when you can bring music and reading together just like you can bring music and food together you know the ... the impression left behind is much more um solid and long lasting\nYes so Ryan I'm Wondering if there are lumpy songs about water and about rivers in swamps that have informed your scientific work\nOh that's such a good question um [noise] ... you know [noise] the closest to the um [noise] uh\nThat I Would have to something like that from my own experience\nWould be um [noise] some of some of our church hymns that invoke water and I'm thinking about um\nA him slide on Jordan's stormy banks\nUm and and those for the call up imagery about crossing the river a that's doesn't important theme and a lot of our homes and so that\nI'm not sure the extent to which that informed my thinking about water or you know my decision to do the kind of work that I Do um but I Do often think about some of the lyrics of 'em a fan's to have to do with water when especially when I'm Out by a river\nUh-huh and so for for each of you does does singing and music player role in your teaching\nFor me it does I play music in the classroom\nAnd all the time I'm partly because as as Ryan said there's many ways in which water unfolds in our culture and you can see some of our traditional\nChristian hands or or church songs that that feature water the process of baptism I'm In the lumber river is a really cherished tradition among us and many people don't not as many people do it as they used to but\nThe river is also a lot more polluted than it used to be um and there's not as but the the traditions are the stories that are told around the advertising and the river are important so when I'm trying to convey all of that to my students\nAll use 'em\nSongs as as much as tax and sometimes more than Texas and you know the other thing that's really exciting about about American indian communities in North Carolina or the south east right now is the kind of cultural revitalization that's taking place and so people are writing songs and generating songs around cultural\nTraditions like canoeing um that\nHelp people paddle in a rhythm and get down the river a little bit faster and when that kind of work is occurring it again like Ryan said it kind of unifies our sense of community together with our our land and our water\nAnd our music in a really important way\nSo so Ryan do do you do you use singing or songs I'm as part of your teaching\nI aspire to okay and I'm not quite that Oregon [laughter]\nUh I I have a I I have some songs\nIn the back of my head that I that I Wish I could play a at certain points in my courses which focus on uh the the natural science aspects of hydrologist and water resources um they don't have particular cultural connections um and I haven't implemented any of these schemes yet\nBut I'm going to play music in my classroom\nSo Ryan I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what will happen to North Carolina especially\nIt coastal North Carolina as the earth's atmosphere continues to warm and quit sea level rise impact the rivers of the lumpy homeland\nYeah so one thing to keep in mind is is the geography of our homeland we we tend to\nTo talk about the coastal plane of North Carolina's where lumpy people live a but North Carolina's coastal plane is is really wide it can be hundreds of miles wide in some places\nAnd the elevations can be a hundred feet or more above sea level so lumpy homeland is not a place that that's in threat of being inundated by rising seas you know at least not in a different time scales that that that we're thinking\nAbout a scientist or now are there are\nUm cultural sites that are important to lumpy people and other tribes in North Carolina that that today are being eroded into the estuary and into the sea seas rise so we we are risking\nA loss of some of our ancient cultural heritage are due to the rising seas in erosion and unfortunately a lot of the sites are\nAre poorly documented and poorly understood and we we may lose them forever before we we learn much about them at all um some of the risk that we encourage further in the coastal plane where the lumpy homeland is\nReally a related to things like changing temperatures and changing precipitation\nThe temperatures are gonna rise\nA by the end of this a century a few degrees on average and those increases are going to be most pronounced in the summertime so our homeland has already extremely hot\nAnd extremely humid during the summer and we're only going to see those ah situations worse in and it's not just um about being comfortable or uncomfortable when you're outside and also has to do or has implications for drought it has implications for\nThe ability for people to to work outside without getting heat related illness and it has an ... implications for how much energy we use during the summertime lots of people living poorly insulated\nMelinda is the author of the new book the lumpy Indians un American struggle\nShe is an associate professor of history and director of the center for the study of the American south at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill right Emanuel is an associate professor in the department of forestry and environmental resources\nAt North Carolina State University at Pembroke and both Melinda and Ryan are members of the ... tribe of North Carolina\nSo if you have a question or comment for Melinda and Brian give us a call at six or eight to five six two\nThe euro zero one or email us at talk at W. O. R. T. F. M. dot O. R. G. you can connect with us at Facebook on Facebook at Facebook dot com slash W. O. R. T. talk or tweet us ... W ... talk and looks like we do have a caller on the line\nHi Mike thank you for waiting and please go ahead with your question or comment\nThank you for taking my call [noise] I Would like to me and ... or um they are they doing to two most important things regarding climate change in the first one is\nPlanning for the future because it is but I Do think top knowledge is nothing compared to what it's going to be in the future and humidity ads that problem solved\nAnd the second part of it I wasn't doing anything about the burning of fossil fuels that just in cars and airplanes all the way the United states citizens fly around like crazy where they have\nHer okay thank thank you for your your comments and your questions Mike so Melinda and Ryan who wants to uh who wants to get started\nI I can jump in here some of my work involves\nUm a fossil fuel combustion and things like this and I also well first I Want to say my my campuses in Raleigh not Pembroke oh we do have a university down there but it it's different from mine\nOkay sorry about that no problem a these are conversations that were\nJust starting to have a in my opinion in in in ... communities and part of the problem um [noise] that or not necessarily a problem with one of the things the delays or hinders these conversations and institutions like our tribal government\nIs that uh we have a limited capacity to deal with a large portfolio of of issues that face our tribal members on a daily basis\nAnd when you are placed in that position to basically do do ... ah on uh\nI'm a wide range of of issues you tend to focus on things that are that are emergencies and you're putting out small fires and it's our capacity to think about long range planning is really really hindered\nUm by that were so many things related to housing\nHealth care and yes of course all of these things are exacerbated by climate change under linked to climate change on some level um but we find our institutions in our government's dealing with the talk some old problem instead of some of the the root problems and I'd say the same goes for\nDiscussions about fossil fuel combustion\nWe are just starting to have some of these conversations are in communities and and within tribal governments and things like that\nOK ambulance or did you have anything to add to that\nI'm just a strong echoing Brian thoughts about the portfolio problems that are that are facing as um [noise] I think um the way that we're trying to capture attention around natural gas pipelines for example yes destruction\nOf the is one way in which our tribal citizens are very active in these issues around climate change um but the particular kind of peculiar legal position we're in related to the federal government has meant that\nWe don't necessarily have um that is the obvious mechanisms of legal access to\nDecision making that would um influence the way that the federal and state governments\nWhat the things that federal and state governments decide about about climate issues\nAnd it's my understanding that at least so far the north Carolina a legislature has been um pretty reluctant to even admit that climate change exists and my is that correct\nI Lived there and do you want to yeah those legislatures I think a whole been pretty quiet about the issue there was a very controversial bill passed out the state level a few years\nDo you go that um that had to do with planning for sea level rise in the context of climate change and ah but that's that's about the only way I'm the only ...\n... a active measure that I think our legislature has taken a lot of a lot of the policy has been set by inaction and so it's just sort of a perpetuation of the status quo in North Carolina there's the status quo involves a lot of fossil fuel combustion\nMhm so could you tell us a little bit more about the Atlantic coast pipeline um what it is where where it's being built and and how would impact the lumpy\nShare of the Atlantic coast pipeline is I'm a six hundred mile long infrastructure project that that's been proposed by energy utilities in this region\nAnd it would stretch from the fracking fields of West Virginia and Pennsylvania a down through Virginia cutting across the the Blue Ridge parkway or the blue Ridge Mountains and down into the flat land of eastern Virginia in eastern North Carolina and southern term in is\nIs a plan for prospect which is an historic lumpy community on the outskirts of of Pembroke\nOr the pipeline passes through traditional and modern day territories of several uh Indian tribes including the lumpy tried and when the federal government conducted\nI'm a demographic study of the the\nPopulations there will be impacted by construction and operation of this pipeline or their data sets showed that Native Americans made up a disproportionately large fraction\nOf the people living within the study area so about thirty thousand a Native American citizens live within a census tracks that are close to the pipeline correlate or\nAnd that number represents about a quarter of all the native people in North Carolina\nA and that's roughly one percent of all the uh\nNative citizens in the United states so it's a it's a surprisingly large number but federal regulators declined to acknowledge that there were any disproportionate impacts on poor or minority people\nAnd so what stage is the pipeline out right now is it actively being built\nIt in some places there is active construction there's been a series of a law suits court actions and regulatory actions that that\nCauses this pipeline is to move in fits and starts and so earlier this year the developers thought that they had all of their permits and approvals in place and began\nA some preliminary work and then there's been a series of stops and starts a primarily actions by the fourth circuit court of appeals which is hearing a lot of these complaints about a federal and state permanent\nSo it sounds like this is going to be a somewhat long process um to to fight the pipeline is that right\nYeah it it has been a long process today and I imagine it will continue to be a long process for the communities and the organizations that are that are actively opposing it and some of this opposition stems from\nReasons of environmental justice ... some of it stems from concerns about a climate change and resource extraction and of course these issues are really are related to one another\nRight and we do have a little bit to concerns the relationship of Long Beach to to their privately owned land so\nOf course the ... process a pipeline construction entails the energy developers to get permission from private landowners to to build or construct element whether the pipeline itself or all of the other staging elements of it\nUm and they've had to get permission from many lumpy landowners to do what they're doing now many of those landowners of course have seen their property tax values um\nGo down they've seen all kinds of things happen that were were you know not what pipeline developers promised essentially when they made these arrangements and so property owners are increasingly now getting more and more outraged about the conduct of the energy developers\nOkay and we do have a caller on the line Hi Michael please go ahead with your question or comment\nOkay yeah I've got a a couple of questions first or you mentioned at the beginning of the program about the last colony of Roanoke and whether or not a long these may be descended\nBaker
