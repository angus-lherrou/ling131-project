lives and some will be pre recorded tracks just to give myself a breather here and there\nAnd all of them will hopefully be enjoyable so I like to dive in right away with a piece that is dedicated specifically to all of you listening here tonight\nBecause tonight we're all unraveled our lives polled exposing the accordion that blooms from the fragile bonds of our paper dolls folds we realize\nWe're time travelers lovers and killers tele paths and dumb luck dreamers I my father and my unborn son I'm the woman on the bus the child in her arms the driver\nCussing to himself as his pancreas Lynch's against each pothole and the universe reveals to us how we are the most unlikely of every fat truth\nIn the walls reclaimed daily are Laden with false bricks that can be pushed in like a button on knocking doors that lead to new space but even there we get the feeling we had been here before\nOver and over and over\nSomewhere in a rundown apartment there is an ancient prince he's on the seventeenth life\nHe doesn't understand where he is the noise in the street or why these coliseum or dripping from his eyes there is a sparrow resting her wings she is the embodiment of short and sweet and every day she's pretty sure that you and die\nIn this whole damn world is something she'd dreamed up last night in her sleep we're loopers\nRabbit hole divers matrix upon matrix there is the illusion that we are each individual essence but in truth we share one sole\nIt is a firefly caught between the canvas and the paint and it floats cross this portrait of existence feeling each life as it does so meaning someday somehow\nYou will be the person sitting next to you in some way some law\nIf you will see yourself from across the room trust me fry of venue I smiled all your smiles your heart's pumping my blood are pulses or the waves humanity the moon I have been you know you are loners and regret or is\nHeavily you sit without a dream to hold your hand I have seen you\nTrying to crawl back through the rooms you have already walk through\nAs if you could rewind cut copy paste and create a new as if that or some kind of a miracle\nTall and glowing and tall and alive you have already walk through I have seen you you start like midnight wanders don't worry about the phone calls from family that you ignore and they have already forgiving you with hugs and pot roast don't worry about the debt friends who visit your dreams again and again\nThey're not tormented or lost it just means you love them so much more than the time they were given for you or them and they are you I have been you do not fester and a heap of sour loved gone wrong but rise above it so opportunity may find you\nIf you have hurts at the bottom of your heart did not go looking at them through the bottoms of your drinks reach down take them in your hands crumbled into pieces and toss them up to the heavens that swallow everything yet saying nothing because this life is moving cliff\nAnd the day we were born\nWas the day we let go so one clenched fists learn\nTo make music with the air around your fingertips the only moment is right here right now in right here right now you'll find every other moment to be\nA moment to be the wind that blows through the cemetery where children play be the relief in somebody's smile at the end of the day be these words\nFor they're no longer mine be soft lips for the springtime be boogie woogie jazz in Seoul be who you will keep jazz and so when something wrong is going down the the voice that you know be the son\nBe the moon be a cry for cry and a truth for a truce\nTonight unravel with me you are free\nMe I have been you I've seen you without a dream to hold your hand so hold my hand and we the firefly will flow out a new path resting now and then on the canvas absorbing rich paint for I have been you\nAnd when I Walk around this world and stare into your faces I Know you would have been me too\nSo I guess I've been writing poetry for um [noise] who for quite a while now I had my first palm published when I was about Eighteen years old\nTo help us get it get us in the mood of memory so to speak um I wouldn't I dug into some of the the royalty free music floating out there on the Internet in order to find a a couple of tunes to play underneath my words here and came across a a nifty instrumental peace\nPaul clean soul and another one called at rest both by a guy named Kevin ... so you will hear parts of those as well and uh we're going to go from one track right until the next year\nThe first poem is titled in a witch and the second one goes by the name of ghost rose Greene hope you enjoy\nIn a wish you get your thoughts in a baffling broken golden consciousness where truth lies and like a shift he's tied washing upon the shore of light wherein you find something missing but not fully miss in a wish\nYou close your eyes and he is still the outlying memory and keeps in a sketch is\nStill in silent as open heart so you press the\nImage with your own pulse remembering the rhythms no longer distinguishable in there for liberty only in a wish to go ... late in the ... like so much muscle memory teasing and sell them in the mirror after a moment tears gone with the candles fog\nStill varies cafe small happiness that with you only can exist\n\nGhost rose green green green green\nSky like I say this one's dead music\nThe says sour sweet and sour balls candy green\nGo go both the hat to animosity among [noise]\nGone male or female long\nGone silk we were going green really has really sweet between Scott\nKnown building here Scott [noise]\nThe saw dust landscape no longer dreams my grandfather no longer knows my name is searches and the night for items he never lost trying to conjure up a wife he barely remembers she hides in his wallet and the role top desk\nBeneath the cushions of the Davenport calling his name he's searches for her\nUntil the neighborhood drips out no more angels he's searches for her until all the ice cream is gone he's searches for her until ghost shaken hands guide him back to bad he searches for her\nAnd tell his warm metals are found he searches for her and tell he falls through the diamond earth becomes infinity a wakes in church portraits in VHS tapes right here him calling my name when I hear all of them calling my name\nThrough family reunions these table full of dead relatives they say the daylight dams the cornfields scheme the worms will soon be biting\nThan their voices go like exploding gravestones\nMy memories aren't fire\nI'd like to share a poem about my friend like cat can who was born in\nSeptember of Nineteen Seventy and died of cancer in October of two thousand seven um and if a\nMath is failing you at this point it does me sometimes a that would be he was thirty seven years old when he passed away um he was a a great friend or brother mentor director fellow actor and\nJust all around amazing human being um taught me almost everything I Know about acting in theater and uh as well as countless other areas of my life I he was also the first person\nTo explain quirky things to me that I didn't know about as a teenager like I'm like a Mobius strip um which if you're not familiar a Mobius strip is a a geometrical surface with only one\nSide um you might have had a a teacher at some point take a strip of paper give it a half twist tape the ends together\nAnd then trace that piece of paper with a pencil to show you how the pencil tip eventually covers the whole length of that strip and then reconnect with the beginning again that's a Mobius strip and his next palm takes that concept and uses it to go into a period of my life when I was living with lake and his wife\nWhile he was going through his cancer treatment and of course when he ultimately passed away this is called ...\nI Will be am who was before the end who is who was no more who will be then when then as now till now is not quite hear somehow\nGive me a half twist this band this with this\nSingle boundary reaching forward for that asks him to my eyes I pillars of books that are stacked those alpine heavens stories flapping open faced along the strip the verity of dreams alive in giant away your dreams used to be\nNow you said from our ... San afraid of being sliced out from that colossal film real and left behind on the cutting room floor\nWhen I was a boy I once asked if you believed in God you said God's perhaps only exist when you are thinking about them and probably not even that I asked if you believe that the world is myth\nAnd you said faith is a moment in this moment is missing this moment is missing or maybe faith as a concept has been turned inside out warrant on the wrong hand\nDo I believe in God I Believe in light I Believe in darkness I Believe in all the love sound in between I Believe the calmness that keeps old age from fearing deaths the parent horizon is annoying how this line discontinued will meet at starting point again\nUh persistence of perception one day you announce to us family and friends I have cancer I Am not dying of cancer I Am not dying and that day you aren't\nNeither are you the day after but as each new terror is detected the calendar gross heavy with emptiness\nOur home three times its gravity rhyme a sit witnessing this anti miracle of breath to bones I read books describing how we one day go back to our projection point not understanding the moral of the story and my burdens get the best to me like the anxious shepherd with is out of control flock\nOf sheep plane loads of our eyes as we hold you your future history\nSlipping away struggles cementing into permanence bankrupting unfinished business slowly ripping knew from us with no regard to quality until one day I lose face in the middle of a cold shower drowning in every innocent tier I here suffer and wishes silent wish for you\nTo die betraying the bonds and Brotherhood of friendship the spirit of survival forgive me please my friend forgive me please\nYou woke me up soon to be turn all sleep to tell us two things one should have spread happiness moved time forward to I Love each and every one of you\nYour face red white and blue humble his faces blue too but so blue it fixes green to understand how we raise our hands we can't green so that our voice and still has sound because how many hands up but the take for you to put your arm down for those\nBases believe we have nothing to say I go to have a political mission like a well trained parents who are born and raised\nA small town minds fuzzy TVs can easily Brian decent people as the animals are scum horses anything less for the two Americas I have a suggestion\nBut if you want to say the color of civil Jasmine I'm hoping your ...\nYour face in the hundreds of years of slavery colored and buy a cry for freedom if your space is the color of love even for your enemies such as a libertarian expression\nAs I say that\nBeing murdered in history [noise] some performed any privileged liars out there you\nStart off with five more hard to get what I've gotten more and it's not my fault someone else's life suffers please stop\nYou missed the point [noise] yes you probably did work hard to get where you're at and you know someone else\nThe struggles are likely not your fault but we both have the privilege of others\nAnd justice troops who has no real [noise] blamed\nKept the religious [noise] neither does he any conversation I'm privileged [noise] religion is about awareness\nThat is about knowledge been off and consideration for\nLess fortunate [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes you'll be going through your nine to five routine when\nCertain sounds or images will come out of nowhere and stay with you for years um I can remember driving on highway forty one when I came across an accident involving construction workers\nAnd they still have a picture of floating around in my head but there were sticking out from under the sitar and that was\nAt least ten years ago but the image has yet to leave me or the next home uh is going to follow the narrator through one of those kinds of days or this woman's cold and and the sound effects\nYou're about to hear are made for me by a very talented individual by the name of John sure that\n\nI always before my alarm the earth the pole so Nirvana still seeping from my dreams as small yawn escaped by Russell nice sheets lifted myself into a new cage ... pops in ... that follows me\nDown the hall in the kitchen by smack do eggs together [noise] catch doses it flies past my plate\nBacon his is in fact the pan scrapes my fourth and Its Food into my mouth I toss the dishes and the sink go off in the shower\nWhere my shower catty holds bottles of different melodies for how to start\nMy day I click one open rub it's hopeful tone through my hair [noise]\nPiano Catherine oceans ... lab the ring my scalp collecting Milky pearls they realize themselves rolled down my body playing against the bottom of the tub the water is sweet and even if all\nThe fan buses but not squeaks I dry dress brush my teeth a brief flurry of shoelace my alarm goes off fingers stomp it out I grab my keys the door to the back porch gas\nI secured the lock tracked down the steps start my car I stick breaks as a seatbelt flies in the way\nI roll down my window wheels lick the road and just the bird's eye candy glass\nMost of the branches and sunlight poking through is like sitting\nIn a song\nThat tries to groove with me\nThe rhythm is law was a string of sirens\nGood toppling by a park in front of the coffee shop\nSlipping side into a cloud of coffee to remain\nSwallowing of ceramic conversations someone approaching an apple someone's storing a beverage there is not one but\nTwo crying babes my head is slightly pounded through aboard Texas demons

strangers and masks um yeah it's it's a good one it's got to it's very stylish and it's got a good soundtrack it's a little violent but it's good I mean most good Halloween movie is a law violent yeah\nExactly um [noise]\nExcept for hocus pocus isn't really that violent and that's my favorite Halloween movie you know it was my favorite when I was a kid I loved hocus pocus when they air it in a union south like two years ago I think they do it like every Halloween it didn't hold up on Halloween now and back and I was like\nNo not at all it really did not hold up to my a childhood memory of it\nYou don't use me but you know\nSome movies don't hold up as well I really liked the movie Halloween town when I was a kid did you ever see that\nNo I'm it sounds like what it is it's a yeah but ah\nI watched it over the weekend or had it on when I was cleaning up my apartment just because I've in October I just like have like full stream like just like like I put in front of putting an album on in the background and just like watch Halloween ... and stuff\nBut yeah that movie was like really bad I mean like if you like something as a kid and you keep watching it as you grow up you can keep your love of it but if you stop and you go back to it you're like\nOh never mind yeah I guess 'cause then the memory takes over what the actual thing was so much\nThat is true that it's sometimes is not very like I watched Harvey the movie as a kid a lot and\nI don't know if you've seen it yeah about the bunny and that the bunny and I was like this is an amazing story I Love this or this guy has his imaginary friend that's a bunny and it's awesome and then I watched as an adult and I was like this is a movie about like serious addiction and like alcoholism and it's really depressing [noise]\nUm I haven't seen that as an adult yet I watch it as a kid oh yeah I mean like ... ... is\nThe severe I call it why does your hair [laughter] so I Do not not a happy film at all which was totally like memory of it that's well\nI mean different holiday and this is skipping for it a couple of months but same thing with um not white\nThat's the one with Jimmy Stewart oh yeah yeah there's that movie oh my gosh it's blink I'm like drawing it it's a wonderful life will be a lot of life okay I'll\nAlso super depressing the whole gamut of that movie is he wants to commit suicide yeah not something I'd gone I was kid no well actually I've never seen that movie all the way through because I always like started at like ... hours after Christmas dinner like at like at midnight come in like halfway through\nWell no I started and then they just fall asleep 'cause it's like already like the next day basically and I just say like a giant meal and I'm like yeah just yeah it's a movie for the I'm going\nTo finally finish it then they pass out so\nAnyway back to the music um these next few songs as I said are all from the soundtrack to the ... the film the strangers\nAnd we'll start out with some real haggard into strangers ... with mama tried that came this next chat came out in Nineteen sixty eight on an album of the same name enjoy\n\n\nThe worst thing I remember knowing long whistle blowing\nAnd the youngest dream of ruin your a\nFollowing that was my first love or by Gillian Welsh off the time the rebel leader and that last ... in the bean off of you in a new Sims studio debut didn't look I mend are those are three tracks were all on the soundtrack to\nThe strangers horror movie came out in the early to mid ...\nI don't remember exactly what you that one is that your top recommendation to watch ... [noise]\nIt's up there it depends on what kind of horror movie like it's definitely just more like\nYou know like it'll be really quiet and then all of a sudden someone jumps out and then it just gets kind of kind of violent towards the end so it depends if that's what you like but if you if that's the kind of thing you like then yeah it's it's a good one and the trick or treaters knock on the door and you're like\nI don't know if I Want to answer yeah maybe don't watch that movie well trick or treaters are coming to your house that might scare you and them if they can see your TV 'cause most of the time trick or treaters or kids yeah not really get appropriate\nUm let's see what's another oh Iowa my no top recommendations which is a movie that I watch not as a kid because it didn't come out when we were kids but um that I saw the younger adult and it still holds up [noise] um and when we had a party on on Saturday I dressed up as the main character\nI'm ... I really watched Coraline and none of these really good never seen it it's a really good it's pretty scary too\nI Would say for ... like a quote unquote kids' movie but um yeah I enjoyed it it's a good one\nIn case anyone on for the whole family we read now turned into a a movie review show [laughter] I mean I don't know under ... what's going on [laughter] um it's about ten o'clock you're listening to and I had a green world I'm your host Katie alone with a co host Tessa here\n\nOn W. or T a nine point nine as him in Madison, Wisconsin listener sponsor community radio\nYes and we have a little ... station business things to attend to and then we'll be right back with music\n[noise]\nW. or she's nine to have tournaments is coming up fast it's on November fourth extremely sponsored by Madison central\nW arches DJ's will be rocking lanes as opposed to the surprise is we've\nAll bowlers will receive it keeps the hands of wisdom with the W. or too low to buy tickets to the pick your prize raffle tickets are available to them at the sister perpetual indulge in the event you were Fifteen hundred dollars just to give away\nGoing to strike the ribs hidden from\nEarns you a free beverage after bowling enjoy pizza ... while the scores are probably some prices are do about\nAll for thirty five dollar\nProceeds benefits W. or to review\nWe're just fill out the form at W. or do you want to do with the registration\nForms are also available here at the station one Eighteen so Bedford streets and at least by press on Louis [noise]\nYou informed about ways to actively support your radio station this is W. or to have you done for nine of from Madison\nHi I'm Amy Goodman tune in election night Tuesday November ... for democracy now six hour live election night special Juan Gonzales now I Will be\nAnd you real time results from mid term gubernatorial one house and Senate races as well as ballot initiatives from across the country will also featured guest she won't hear anywhere else tuned in for war peace and election special starting at seven pm eastern on election night\nMarkets you know the coverage of the ... election will start at six PM right here on W. or to you know from Madison\nAnd we're back\nWith more Halloween to Mm\nIt's next track ... is by Karen Elson\nThe name of the song is it goes to a\n\n...

and welcome\nTo a public affairs It's Tuesday so that means you've got me I'm carousel Baird we have a jam packed show\nToday as always always so many important things to talk about but being that is one week away from election day I Hope you're all thinking what you're going to do a week from today how you're going to vote may be voted already like I did I voted last week Tuesday it was so easy at\nApplications that are being held up and the allegation is that there is a both a partisan component any related sort of on a race based to discrimination component to this\nAnd the numbers in Georgia that I've been reading about should the disproportionately it says I I think the number was around Seventy percent are um voters of color that are that are within that fifty plus thousand a registration that are not being process\nThat that's right and and I don't know exactly the reason for that disparity although I've seen the same number it it it may partly because\nOf you know there is a lot of enthusiasm among communities of color in Georgia for the Democratic candidate and so it may just be that there are a lot of people rendering exactly so that that may explain it but the but\nWhatever the reason it does indeed seemed to be the case that there is that disparity and you then they will question the motivation of the current secretary of state running for office holding back these they may well be votes for his opponents\nAn African American female\nOh who ... is the first African American female a poised to be a governor and in the United states and certainly in Georgia in their state right and\nSo what is sort of your than the pull you out of the box and and to ask your opinion what are your thoughts on things like this one this happening in Georgia can we see this in other states will this have a chilling impact on people voting or it's it's hard to tell\nHow much of an impact it will have\nYou know I think that this is really difficult to study empirically because it's always hard to do controlled experiments\nYou know if if turnout decreases in a particular election do you attribute that to rules we may have made voting harder exactly or is it because it just happened to be that people were less excited about the candidates for alleged\nDraining that day or who not only so many reasons\nRight and and even if turnout increases you may ask well how much more money to increase by if these laws were not in place so it empirically really difficult question and and I think then um that people's motivations are also very you know some people may see these laws that create obstacles to voting and they may in fact become discouraged and not vote\nOther people actually you know this really gets them riled up and makes them more likely to vote you know if someone tells me that they don't want me to vote then maybe I'm going to make it you know that much more of an effort to get to the polls and so which of those two tendencies prevails um you know hard to study\nIt and I know that if we want to talk about north North Dakota for a second chance the stories about the voter suppression that is happening disproportionately on the Native American\nUh a voter is because a new rule that just went into place and you can tell us about that in a moment but then there was also a follow up story that I just saw in the paper saying how now in a Native American tribes are more galvanized than ever to make sure their vote counts\nThat they're sort of responding of oh yeah you want to suppress me heck no here I come\nI I think that's exactly right so the north Dakota situation as they have a new voter id law that I'm as written requires people to provide or ...\nPresidential address on our ideas but a lot of people who live um on uh the the reservations on tribal lands in North Dakota actually don't have street addresses and so they wouldn't be able to to qualify under the district terms of that I Do\nGet they get their mail at a PO box and their home it's just the home on the street next to the street next to the street\n... exactly and and um the the the courts have intervened a little bit to dial this law back just just a touch but not very much but you know now are the tribes ... you're right or or being galvanized and uh and and I've seen reports that they at some point places actually intend to set up there\nAnd and help out on the spot create tribal ideas that do have um correct street addresses\nAnd uh you know and and so um you see an attempt or whether intentional or not to disenfranchise a group and that group pushing back but nevertheless\nIt is requiring everyone in these communities to spend their efforts doing this this is what do what they are doing jail you thought you were going to work today you thought you were\nAddressing any of the things that are happening in your life now they are now being forced to spend their time and energy nonstop on creating these last minute IDs that need do exist because what they had wasn't sufficient\nSure and and even if you just look at the University of resources and time that people are being put it that people are putting into political advocacy\nYou know the more time and resources that you have to to put into physically getting people registered or to the polls of the less you might have available to do other forms of advocacy so to convince people that actually they should vote for your candidate isn't one other\nOne the more overwhelming and sort of ... it seems that I just want to vote I just want to you know leave work for seven minutes during my lunch hour and vote and there's so much more it's not that that scenario doesn't seem to exist anymore there's so much more to it now\nKnow often you know again I I I don't know exactly what your experience was when you voted early but there are still opportunities um to you know hopefully go and vote quickly and easily especially for people around here who do want to take advantage of early voting system but uh you know around the country there are many instances in which we\nWe'll find themselves on line for hours you know instances in which they're local polling place has been closed and now they have to try to travel across town to in a new polling place or you know all sorts of ways in which if I'm states or localities want to make it more difficult for people to vote 'em you know they they can often do it\nWe're talking with professor Robert ... about the state of voting in the United states or if you have any thoughts are comments or questions we would love to hear from you give us a call it area code six to eight\nTo five six two zero zero one you can also send us a tweet that W. O. L. I. T. talk or even ten is a message on our Facebook page or pages\nPublic affair eighty nine point nine F. M. Madison So Professor before the show we were talking about there's also other states that are moving the other direction\nThat their intent is to make voting easier and more accessible and and trying to enact legislation that moves towards that can you give us some examples of things that you know in other states\nSo I I I think it is important to be clear that the picture nationwide is mixed and you know since two thousand ten nearly half of the states have adopted some measures that make it more difficult to vote but there are probably at least that many states that have done something at least to make it easier to vote\nAnd uh and and what are some of those are some of those mechanisms will one really notable one which is a move that I think is gathering steam is that a more and more states are moving to automatic voter registration\nAnd and and so traditionally in order to register to vote you have to opt in\nOr two registering and sometimes you're able to in some states were able to do that at a DMV are able to do that and I remember the ... vote or drive when I was a kid yeah and and uh but now I'm I think we might be up to something like Thirteen states that have have changed the system from an opt in system to an opt out system\nAnd so now anytime you go and interact with a government office like a DMV or some of maybe government benefits office um and you were giving them information they will automatically register you to vote unless you affirmatively\nAnd that you don't do that and and these states are seeing significant increases in voter registration levels and then we can see that then translate into actual um voter participation rates um increasing as well I mean I think that is still um to be seen but you know in in a lot of states for a long time registration really has been an obstacle in these states are making it a whole lot easier\nTo just to remind everyone 'cause sometimes these terms are are ... they sounds simple but they're trickier than we think the idea of opt in is that you have to affirmatively say yes I Want to be part of this group I Want to register\nThe idea of opt out is you're in it unless you affirmatively say don't put me in it\nThat's right yeah so you know if you go and get a driver's license and one of these states you will be registered to vote unless you say I don't want to be Muslim reason\nWhich I presume some people will do but the majority will not the majority will say nothing\nRight that the majority would say sure you know what and why not I mean if there's no additional nothing additional would be required of them in most cases and so\nThey'll they'll let that happen so that's you know that's one change that is happening in a number of states I mean even more states have done things in recent years like moving to online registration him which does make life easier for a good number of people I Would say that that almost is becoming the norm among states now to have on\nLine or he shouldn't have that in Wisconsin\nWe do okay I Do have online registration I Believe that it is now closed for this election so if you were not registered yet in Wisconsin and you still want to vote I Believe that you can still I'm In person registered this week at a municipal court solving and then Wisconsin is fortunate to have same day registration\nAnd and you need to you know make sure that you're showing up at the polls with your your proof of residents\nUm but but you do have that opportunity and so if you're not registered yet but you're interested in voting you know realize that you do still have that option a into many states that still is not the case if you haven't registered ah two weeks out or or or three weeks out um than you are or out of luck on election in a\nOf interesting and refreshing to see them Wisconsin still has the same day registration while simultaneously we're putting a where I stay\nThat is adding litter id requirements and and having conversations about whether what voter id what IDs qualified voter IDs\nYeah and you know there are there there actually are some I'm sort of inside baseball reasons why Wisconsin probably has stuck with same day registration ... which is that um under federal law they get some um some benefits them exemptions from federal law provisions by virtue of offering that\nBeing given the opportunity to have access to mental health care or alcohol or drug abuse if that's a coke or ... or interventions that that's appropriate and get back get them back into society and the way instead of you know frankly riding and president and the\n... we we're we're losing generations of people because of that then you know this and this is not a liberal issue I mean Texas has taken a lead on this they've closed prisons are they're diverting ... you're they're diverting\nNon violent offenders from law uh from from a prison system and getting them into vocational training and and whatever other than that\nDo they need getting them back on society of the weight of a a refunding is very very low it's cheaper we spend more on our University of ... or or corrections institutions that we're doing university Wisconsin system so it's a it's a money issue but it's a moral issue for most importantly\nThat sounds like you're hopeful that will form can happen regardless of the makeup of the state legislature if you're ... you're going to be able to move these ...\nAbsolutely absolutely no matter what angle you come from a a at the end of the day there are people that are being incarcerated or that it's it's not it's not effective for anybody it's not effective for them and it's not effective for society\nYou talked a little bit about education of course that the current governor Governor Walker who has consistently declined to be an option so great more time from time to talk with you Tony\nI'm [laughter] he's calling ... actually he's calling in the education governor or a you know talk to us about\nHow you compare your education platform with his education platform\nSure and you know it's it's laughable and uh I don't know anybody except shows just playing a he he came into office taking eight hundred billion dollars all of our public education system we we still are\nThat left the funding that we did when he entered office and equally important he decided to make a is your remember he's talked about the vitamin concrete\nAnd he decided to make our teachers and other educators I work with kids the enemy and I don't care if you're in a public sector private sector or if you're a leader and you don't want the best for me or company or your best from your organization\nYou don't do it by making the people that actually do the work the enemy and that's playing out in a lot of different ways so for example not having young people go into the teaching profession saw that's going to change is quite simple I have a budget out there that's really going to get us back to where we should be a as it relates to funding and that's got to focus on\nKids need to help the last ... or ... come from\nPoverty backgrounds are those kids that are a ... a struggle they because of a mental health issues are making sure that we keep our moral and legal legal obligations to um uh students with disabilities all those all those issues are part of that budget than I have a life or polish than the\nGood news is instead of having a given to Scott Walker and having him dismissive like usually does ah I get it I'll hand it to myself as governor and get it to the legislature and we're actually going to make a difference in kids' lives\nHow can you address the nation disparities cats can exist in our public schools and and I believe in a private school and members as well\nYeah it's it's your race racism issue in our state whether it's in the uh whether it plays out in poverty whether it plays out in the academic academic achievement correctional a Q A justice issues\nAnd a governor needs to take a lead on that and I know a lot of it has to do with how people view themselves are are as human beings but at the end of the day's having leaders talking about it is I think is very important\nThat will uh as as it relates to closing those achievement gaps we we have to make sure and where we're working actually\nUh well with ah some of our largest school districts that have these issues are going for it and making sure that we have the best teachers in the best principles of the buildings and making sure that we have the appropriate\nA cultural competence or among our staff members we we actually have a program right now or a we've cut back in the people that are at the school districts that are involved with cut back the suspension rates of kids of color dramatically in in those districts that are ... and cutting them at half\nIts ... keeping people in school and it was really important but we also have to make sure that we have adequate resources at some of our\nUrban areas especially and and also hire a rural areas that were achievement gaps are exist or they struggle just keeping the doors all so it's critical about having that but the good news in my uh make sure that way they they have addict\nBut researchers as the the good news also as we have this a broken English though that\nUh is in the budget that we're going to be providing\nMore money for making sure that a lot of certified teachers are rewarded and have them in front of the most difficult classes making sure that we are for mental health services are those school districts\nI think we can make a change Governor Walker has essentially politicize this has done anything other than the white fingers as treasury other teachers which makes no sense\nIn the final issue that was really important to our listeners when the economy there seems to be a lot of conversation about the president's jobs in in the low unemployment rate but I listeners we're particularly concerned but that's not that\nThe jobs that exist now compared to jobs that used to exist you don't pay as well\nA healthcare costs have increased so they feel like we're the numbers are distorted in saying that we have a good economy\nYeah and you you're absolutely right there I saw the ... you don't even have to look too far and that is so hard to find that out the United way did a study\nThat showed that eight hundred and Seventy thousand families in the state of Wisconsin are working families can't afford the basic necessities whether it's whether it's food whether child care whether it's ...\nThat's a lot of people and these are working families so yeah so the the the ... what Scott Walker talks about is just sheen it's is not it's not what's under the hood and so what what we need to do is frankly a change the way we invest in economic development the set of\nHail Mary passes to a foreign corporations and hopefully she'll be zero to catch the ball\nOr we need that we have to localized regionalized that they have the state working with local and regional partners to help\nYoung entrepreneur is help those people that are on main street uh Wisconsin to try that is where businesses are are are that beat need our help we're still very very well in that it's all the lights the rest of the country\nAnd then finally you mentioned health care that is part of it oh Scott Walker has completely abandoned a common sense when it comes to ...\nUh the fact that he didn't take the Medicaid like he was running for president as you alluded Barbara ... and he uh he he as a result of that he didn't take a the Medicaid expansion and that's\nCost our state one point one billion dollars it's also a car it's also threatening his stance threatening to take away\nPreexisting condition protections all those things impact people in the middle class and people that are uh are struggling a with a low wage jobs a mightily and so we're going to have better better take home pay we're also going to make sure that\nWe have a Fifteen dollar minimum wage\nAnd also um I have a plan and I've talked about on the campaign trail we can give middle class people a tax break or we're looking to do that at the ten percent great\nYou know anybody hurting a family or a hundred and fifty thousand dollars at your last\nBoth of the people that have been left behind and walkers economy that we are going to give them a tax break\nAnd related to that on the economy how do you make sure that people have access to higher education have access to\nNot just just the skilled labor training that they need but also you know the Wisconsin Idea is um being able to study and pursue the careers did they want to pursue and stay here in Wisconsin do you mean\nYeah absolutely that's credit card or as your listeners may remember that three or a Governor Walker tried to take away their Wisconsin Idea I I think he was a little careful that\nSeeking out the truth a part of that I think that aside\nOr we like what we've seen is going forward as a second two hundred and fifty thousand dollars out of the out of the I'm a University of Wisconsin system and that that has\nThat has just ... verse or impact or you\nKnow as as you take money away you lose staff members I I think it was you W Oshkosh or maybe Milwaukee that has lost Fifteen Percent of their faculty and then as a result of that there's fewer courses are offered mainly in the humanities which is ...\nWe're close to recover the good adult uh and then it takes longer to graduate and then there's ... I mean how what a what a\nDollar or the ... of a spiral\nThat we've had and the yes we have to register the kids young people can or any college graduate to make sure that they're able to refinance their loans and a at a rate that's reasonable but\nAt the end of the day we have to talk about the fact that state is invest more in the system where we're at the same issue it higher education is is
