A. G. did not seek additional funds for a state crime lab she didn't try to hire more analysts even though we needed to do that anyway um he just recently finally has made a request for additional hunting for additional analyst\nUm but that should have been done um years ago ... um if it had been we would have additional people who worked on this and if you look at the results you know in a two and a half years after we received funding um we had tested approximately two thousand kids are in Portland uh\nAbout three times have been tested even the Portland received funding at the same time in Nevada was twice as many um so Wisconsin's piece of testing was slower than other states\nAnd what you said is exactly right you know ...\nUh recently said that the that the mission has been accomplished here I'm a first of all we we still don't have confirmed results on a protesting all the kids but but more importantly as you were talking about the goal here is just to get tested this to get\nJustice for survivors of sexual assault and uh and energy I'm going to ensure that hits those cases are holding them thoroughly investigated and that getting justices priority\nTalked about sort of the ... the second piece of of of some of the things big picture that you were talking at the beginning about the opioid epidemic\nAnd me as the attorney general you know our current attorney general has sort of pursued civil cases are against the Obama administration\nFor a for a health care issues he's made\nA statement on a federal level for I'm against environmental regulations what would you do differently as attorney general would you have joined in on different federal ah actions\nI think there are\nThings we should look at this time I think one of the challenge of\nWar so Josh Josh Josh harmful yes we're having a little\nDifficulty hearing you I don't know if a perhaps you're moving around or something like that sometimes cell phones and just don't make the best connection so I Want to make sure every year every fabulous word that you say so ... started that answer one more time [laughter]\nI I think there are two things that are age you should look at in deciding whether to challenge a federal law our policy on the first is this a policy\nThat's harmful to Wisconsin knives and if the answer to that is yes then the question is is there a strong legal basis for challenge is unconstitutional or\nA is it you know what what is it otherwise would questions is yes that I think the state should get involved and do it in a in a challenge to federal policy where where there seems to be a clear difference between bread showing me is\nWhat we regard as being harmful to stop tonight to some extent where we think there are strong legal challenges so as a G um he got to stay involved in a challenge to\nA policy that guaranteed overtime pay for people who put in the hours and make between about twenty three and a forty seven thousand dollars a year I'm going to be fighting against\nFor middle class fan ... a ... um I don't think that's their lives in the interests of scotch of one of the leaders right now the lawsuit seeking to invalidate the Affordable CARE Act and if that is accessible protections will be eliminated for people with preexisting conditions on young adults would lose the\nAir and tea it can remain on their parents' coverage I until they turn twenty six I'm an ... budget office estimates that if the major components of the Affordable CARE Act or struck down more than thirty million Americans\nWill become uninsured I'm so to me that case he's clearly not and he was a Wisconsin I say gee I Would seek to withdraw from that lawsuit\nAnd ... that's ... that that some of the things\nThat we can do is you can do as attorney general you can get involved on on the federal level and they do not the right things for\nOur state and it seemed like\nThat is actually a roll the attorney general's across the country has been playing more so than almost any other state elected rule\n\nGee needs to be doing that thing up I'm standing up for our rights and protections um to get involved in a challenge to a a federal law policy the age he needs to have a forty from uh for me to the governor or from one house\nThan leisure okay um and I think there are places where our age you should have gotten involved and challenges or at least should have shocked\nAt forty I'm so when that neutrality was eliminated for example I'm more than twenty age ... challenged the elimination at a trolley that's policy that help consumers and help small businesses um it ensured that we had a fair and open Internet ah but ...\nDidn't get involved in that challenge she called the lawsuit frivolous um you know what that's the the boss will back protections for students who have been to a crowded by predatory for profit colleges again a number of a genes stepped up but not our current age eight\nI think we need to have an e G who we can count on to stand up\nUm when our protections are our rights are rolled back\nTalked about some of the things than the how how are these differences can make it a chain\nHere in Wisconsin you talked a little bit about the opiate addiction epidemic problem that we're having here that\nI feel like I've seen some language from you about um ... that you just mentioned right now with student loans and a private for profit schools are there ways that you ah could help make a difference to for consumer protection aspects here in Wisconsin as attorney general\n\nYesterday AG overseas enforcement of consumer protection laws in Wisconsin I think we need in the G who's going to do that\nMore seriously than our that our current age he has done it\nUm we you know for example um I think that if a predatory for profit college makes false promises to students in Wisconsin or it should expect to be held accountable if you know if for nursing home um uh is is involved in negligence when it comes to ensuring that\nUm people who live there are um are getting the care that they should\nUm again we should expect our energy to to um to be a watchdog\nFor consumers hearing the scotch and um we unfortunately haven't had that I think are under our current age ... and that's one of the reasons we need new leadership in the ... and\nIt's it's been said that you know the age role is supposed to be a watchdog but that the current ah A. G. right now has been one of the more political at age ... we've had in the history of Wisconsin\n\nAs far as people off I think he has put special interest of a ... you know I we touched on the\nUm the opioid epidemic and one of the things I mentioned is that I think we need any nutrients climate and the serious about holding the pharmaceutical companies accountable for a while or corn agent sixteen or\nAt least one Seventeen patients can be stretched back far enough to to hold the pharmaceutical companies accountable um and the good news is since this campaign started he's announced that Wisconsin is part of a multi state investigation into\nUm the pharmaceutical companies will ... academic um but he's also taken campaign contributions from patch for for pharmaceutical companies [noise] um I think we need an agent who's going to be a serious about holding these companies accountable for the wall shutdown that\nWe're talking with Wisconsin's attorney general Kennedy Josh call he is on the ballot in two weeks will you be supporting Josh give us a call we'd love to hear from you area code six or eight\nTo five six two zero zero one judge can we talk a little bit about the climate or in the attorney general's office in the department of justice which the attorney general is that the head of\nThat it it seemed like that you know tiny and what we were just talking about of we have an attorney general who has strayed away from the watchdog roll and and keeping Wisconsin safe as his priorities and instead has focused\nOn some more political aspect and as a result\nThis agency or for the state of Wisconsin that sort of prided itself on no matter who's in charge of our state we're going to keep our states have has gone a little way word and employees within the department of justice have expressed\nThat employee morale is down they've been asked to sign you know nondisclosure agreement how do you address that to make sure that we keep getting a the top quality of work done in that department that we need for Wisconsin\nOver sixty one former system a jeez I'm having to are smart campaign for for attorney general a forty five of them\nSigned signed onto a letter\nUm that explains the ... officers mess\nUm and so I I think you know those are the ... that's a strong sign that the ... not being effectively managed right now um and you know there's also been a I think clearly misplaced priorities I'm there I mentioned before that our energy is one of the leaders\nOf a lawsuit that is seeking to invalidate the Affordable\nCARE Act um you know we're in the midst of an opioid epidemic that continues to get worse we have a growing math problem and our energy is fighting to eliminate protections for people with preexisting conditions\nTook action to challenge the elimination of that that the recession of that policy the policy that allowed a dreamer is just a quick complied with the rules that were in place to to remain in the United states um so so there are some places where where agents can take action but but I also think our age you should be an advocate for policies that are\nUm they're gonna be the most effective way of enforcing the laws\nYou know call coming in from my kids who once said talk about the intersection of the attorney general's office and environmental regulations Mike you're on the air\nThank you yeah in particular not just because Trump has relaxed [noise] also\nOur state is taken up\nThe issue of greenhouse gases that the state\nContributes also climate change the future what it should be looking at [noise]\nJosh mayor in fact I\nThank you for that question might be the environment is an area where there are clear differences between\n... um we we had a candidate forum or last week that was a hosted by the Milwaukee Rotary Club and we were asked a question about climate change 'em and and bread channels response was to say I'm a uh that he believes that the climate is ever changing\nOpposite to what extent that's caused by human activity\nI he said he was not a scientist um and as I said you know I'm not a scientist either but ah but I Believe in science um and I believe that the overwhelming consensus of scientists that among scientists that climate change is caused by human activities um\nUh so we we just have a different starting point there um but I think that our natural resources are critical for our health for our economy and for our quality of life in Wisconsin and our age he oversees enforcement of our environmental laws um unfortunately under current age even seen a significant\nDecline in science collected from polluters I'm even compared to his Republican predecessor GB that home um and you know I Believe that when polluters break the law and make a mess and they should expect to be held accountable\nI'm just like anybody else's um you know but but uh in one case involving a air pollution violations in Wausau I'm uh twenty six team rational settled decades without a minute we'll find 'em whatsoever which is the first time that that's happened in at least decades\nUm another company is being investigated by by the you know again I and we face significant environmental challenges in parts of the state in ... county right now far too many families have to worry that when they turn on the tap\nOur groundwater is great I think that in Wisconsin in twenty Eighteen there's no parent should have to worry about the safety of the water that their kids are drinking um and and the other thing is rational has challenged I'm\nA federal policies that protected the environment um he was involved in a challenge to the clean Power Plan which was designed to uh to be a step in the dressing a climate change um so so environmental protection as an area where there are there are clear differences between ... author\nJosh we're getting a message that maybe it was an error on our part that you you weren't not sure if you can join

interviewed the treasurer candidates we've interviewed the governor candidate we've interviewed the lieutenant governor candidate a we have interviewed the secretary of state candidate\nIs really been

area code six to eight to five six two\nZero zero one and I know we were getting some great conversations I really appreciate hearing about all the different things that we can see what the attorney general can do it didn't always crossed my mind when I think of what the attorney general for any state let alone the state of Wisconsin\nCan do but the impact that they can have\nOn criminal justice reform on racial justice on um\nThe people that are in our prisons the people that are in our community on economic justice on voter access so many pieces that I think sometimes we ... we only look to our governor and a state house and lieutenant governors to lead on but this is also something the attorney general's off\nOffice can lead on I'm going to see if we have any calls coming in it does look like we have one or two and then we're going to see if maybe\nOne of our producers wants to come in and joined me on this great conversation\nUm but I wanted to hear from everyone what do you think's going to happen in Wisconsin and the election in two weeks and what do you think's going to happen if we have a split legislation legislature so we have a Democrat\nOr perhaps in the governor let's hope but I think that we're\nTo make some successes in the state house and the Senate ...\nWe're going to flip the state Senate but they're still going to be a handful of prominent Republicans in charge or ... so what does it look like what kind of progress can we have when all the partisan fighting is happening in uh Wisconsin in the United states how can we\nGet a little bit of both how can we find middle ground maybe lead American show what what you know kindness looks like we have a call coming in from Dan Dan thank you for calling what are your thoughts about the election coming
