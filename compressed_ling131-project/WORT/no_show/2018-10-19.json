T. six PM local news is seeking new producers were we thinking church\nMaybe you love books or beer or food once reviews on Pearl Harbor pro finally local artists have a lot of science [noise]\nWant to share your knowledge would W. O. R. T. listeners joined more than three dozen community members who work on our local news program [noise]\nKeep up with our recording studios professional microphones and audio editing software you produce a weekly five minutes segment for broadcast anti cat\nIf you have a fresh idea out a few hours each week to commit to get in touch contact news director Molly stunts that there'll be or to you by email she's up Molly got W. or to a friend [noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\nAnd this this is his listeners having fun for me to have you know\nWe're about to have on yes nerds about Iraq\nSo tonight we're going to be doing things a little bit differently um I'm your host Kelly shorts and with me is I'm Heather Alan and we'll Cushman and what we're going to be doing to fight is kind of testing the medium a little bit we're going to do some quizzes we're going to do some blind items and we're going to have a little bit of fun with\nThe strangest of click bait science titles and sound effects and the sound effects yeah we've got [noise]\nYou need to hold it up to go after them [laughter] [noise]\n[laughter] got that guy so bear with us it's nuts having fun heck yeah\nAll right so to start off with um I'm going to begin with a little game called a saves you a quick\nSo at least in perpetual weirdness about scientific articles and about how to actually find information that's useful and reliable obviously it can be very difficult to do so um as a producer of primary\nSure myself uh I think I feel like I have kind of a a leg up on some people in terms of what I look for and how I can evaluate the um [noise]\nUh truthiness I guess of articles um so some things that you always want to see when you're reading and again it depends on the level you're looking at but you want and what you'll definitely wants the hypothesis\nWhat the what the researchers were looking for a what they would expect if a hypothesis is true I'm not kind of gets a sort of developed in the background of the story\nOr what they observed some kind of a discussion and then if it's a real ... a ... study as a follow up and sort of what they would expect to see next to what the lab is working on next\nSo this is what you as like a science news consumer would be looking for or vote goes\nYeah yeah so so what I'm going to do is I'm going to read some titles that um I mean I feel like they could all be somewhat equivalent but some of them are from what I Would consider to be reliable sources and we'll talk a little bit about that and some of them are a little bit less reliable but they all kind of sound the same and that's the problem with ... Beatty headlines\nSo a Heather in will are going to do is they're going to guess where these articles came from and then just based on the title alone what the what it might be about\nYou know it's the art of writing a good title is very understated yes All right I'm ready for all right so the first title is and it's maybe just to warm up how nectar bats fly nowhere how nectar bats fly nowhere I feel like that's like a\nNewsweek level of title of level of detail ... title really\nTough ... yeah so are we supposed to be guessing like any like news like online\nThere seemed like just yet is it seems like a publication does it seem like it came from a like a peer reviewed journals site or something like that how people are media popular media yeah yeah I was so popular media or like\nPress release uh-huh yeah well that's good and then what what makes you think nectar bats fly nowhere a that nectar bats don't extend\nBeyond like a one mile range of their home base oh interesting\nI like that I was thinking or they don't like migrate over but I don't know if like about like ... year migraine or I dunno okay I've got another theory what if nectar bats fly in circles [laughter]\nYou know like the drunk birds are you getting warmer oh okay yeah I'm an actor has no clue [noise]\nUm I mean you're close I mean this is a literal representation of what happens like okay I think about what a bat would need to do in order to be an actor bat they need to have her in place that we need to hover in place right\nJust like a hummingbird when you saw how they fly nowhere okay oh so how they kept her uh let me let me find one here um\n[laughter] yes [laughter] either ... or ... or you [noise]\nOh man yeah fun and then okay so that was pretty interesting will also would you have click just based on the title alone\n... probably not I would have like like a lot\nLiberals to click [laughter] so some bats like the Palos long tongue that have evolved the ability to hover while using those cute little liquors to gather nectar from flowers\nSimilar to a different from humming birds this article describes on nectar bats versus regular old fruit bats have specialized wings would allow them to flap up and down\nThe extra energy that they get from nectar allows them to flapping hover like this so think about trying to swim in place in a pool right when you're trying to stay in place ... aren't just pushing down they're pushing up and down\nSo they're not there in the in the middle zone so that allows them to they don't they don't ... bounces much they're going to stay where they're at yeah interesting where does not appear so this was science news dot org which is which is an aggregator of actual science press so it was a press release but it was maybe just maybe it's the pitch above\nUm and a lot of like your regular yes yeah we're going to run into a lot of these uh there's at least four different iterations of this so listeners at home if you're interested in finding some science resources where you can read I mean like again like these are short little press releases if you want it\nTo get like the gist of what they're saying ah maybe taken 'em of some of these places these are all I Would give them my stamp of approval and I think that most academics would say that these are pretty reliable places to get your news so this isn't a corruption of what he fruit bat versus a nectar bed is actually doing it also is sort of a neutral thing to like did you have any feelings or emotions that we're a vote\nIt seemed ... to me I enjoyed a tad bit of wind Z but not super emotionally manipulative so far so that's good that's another thing I I Would look for ... for drawing you in for the sake of like this was an interesting thing absolutely [noise]\nClimate change would just was established by the United nations environment program and the world meteorological organization in Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight\nTo provide policymakers with regular scientific assessments concerning climate change its implications and its future risks there are nine one hundred and Ninety five member states that are part of the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change\nHad a Nobel Peace prize in two thousand ...\nRight yeah and very recently in their recent special report on global warming they raised the alarm that limiting warming to one point five degrees Celsius as possible within the laws of chemistry and physics but doing so would require unprecedented changes and without doing that we are in big trouble they FDA [laughter] they said that\nEvery extra bit of warming matters especially since warming of one point five degrees Celsius or higher increases the risks associated with long lasting irreversible changes such as the loss of some ecosystem so here's\nHere's the next question here's my next question for you [noise] um\n[noise] ready [laughter] okay [laughter] I'm\nActually conducted early scientific research on climate change I'm white year did Exxon Mobil began its own climate science research was it a Nineteen sixty seven when the top ... hit with Aretha Franklin's respect [noise]\n\nOr was it be Nineteen Seventy seven when the top pop hit with tonight's the night going to be All right bye rod Stewart [noise]\n\nOr finally what's it see Nineteen eighty two the year Olivia Newton John and Olivia Newton John topped the charts with physical\n[noise] what\nAre you guys think when did Exxon know about climate really bringing me back for [laughter] for [noise]\nUm I don't know what I mean it was Seventy seven yeah that's what I think your Stewart oh you guys are both race that is fantastic\nNicely done [laughter] according to Scientific American American Exxon knew about climate change in Seventy seven and\nSo yeah how much likely or will hot days be globally and this was a global increase of ... two two degrees\nDegree so that's the bad that's like the bad guy doesn't it's not the nightmares that's not yet said the nightmare scenario but that's not good no good at like ... dream great yeah that's kinda the end of everything we know right sort of a girl's twenty\nTwenty or\nI'll be ... a Fifteen right ooh [noise]\nThat is that it's not the right sound effect but you guys are wrong [laughter] no it's um\nTwenty five percent likely or that there will be hot day is a at that I'm for you know every day for the two degree warming scenario pang yeah it's it's significant and if we only ... only warmed by one point five degrees Celsius hot days would increase by sixteen percent\nSo significantly less we hold on [noise] oh that's\nA good sound effect [laughter] warming generally prices were all wrong [laughter]\nNot looking good\nUm okay so let's talk about flooding we knew it was tremendously high intensity rain events um for two plus weeks in August into September the Wisconsin initiative on climate change impacts has predicted that rain events will be more frequent and more intense as climate change progressive so let's just talk about flooding in Europe for a second\nAt two degrees of warming in Europe what is the predicted increasing frequency of extreme high flows in the ... river is at eight thirty nine percent increase in frequency of higher stream flows is it be Fifteen Percent or see Seventy nine percent\nWhy are we in the den you just you know there's there's\nA high level of detail available um where we can dig deeper into what's going to happen in different regions of the world I just take Daniel because it's cool shaped\nSo and I and I think we need or ... yards like reminding people do it while you're only we don't really have a grasp of what could happen right\nAnd what was going to go to ground threatening to go with me if the numbers on greater chance or is it pretty to increase in for a cat person sees Seventy five okay\n[noise] that's true well [laughter] so bad it these days [laughter] got it right it's fifty nine percent and flooding in the Mississippi River is similarly\nA threatened at um at two degrees of warming there's a fifty six percent increase the likelihood of frequency of extreme high flows and the Mississippi River\nOkay so I'm a wrap this up in one second let's talk about quotes it's so much fun\nTo learn about global warming and all the awful things are very likely to happen [laughter] you got to make it fun [laughter] so scary when you play a funny sounds\nSo which of these are not a quote from Trump regarding climate change oh no don't do this to me and you can do it I can no longer having fun [laughter] yeah\nOkay hey the concepts of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make us manufacturing non competitive that's a B\nGive me clean beautiful and healthy air not the same old climate change global warming bullshit [laughter]\n... I'm hearing this nonsense or is it see I'm not a believer in manmade global warming it could be warming and it's not going it's going to start to cool at some point and you know in the early in the Nineteen twenties people talked about global cooling they thought the earth was cooling now it's global warming but the problem we have\nAnd if you look at our energy costs in of all things that we're doing to solve the problem that I don't\nThink in any major fashion exists\nHe said that for all of these and all of those things are definitely sort of a I guess of all those all all of those he said he said he loves clean air [noise]\nKelly and will are very smart said oh you were you able to the good news nothing to worry about\nAnd that wraps up today is that last word\nThat was cool a real ... [laughter]\n[laughter] me either [laughter]\nOkay so far our final segment for ... I think um we're going to do a little blind item um I think I should probably explain this to our listeners in case you are not\nAh like me a a\nA frequent her of liberty gossip blogs I Will admit that I'm so blind items are the like the I don't know TMZ or something will be like so there's this aimless celebrity\nWho get caught cheating on his wife ... in like all these other things and they're supposed to go through the celebrity as it is like pretty trashy but we're going to do it with real life famous scientists and I'm going to describe their lives and you two are going to have to figure out\nOr decide who you think the gas\nIs that right yeah ready okay so the first one um I was going to start with the nationality but I think that's giving it away so\nWe're going to forego that maybe there'll be a hint okay so this physicist income is grew up relatively poor\nBut her father a well known teacher in locally uh instructed her and her siblings using old school laboratory equipment in their home that he took from schools [noise]\nUm after the laboratory equipment was uh the the the Russians who were\nUm [noise] uh\nOkay and uh I'm Glad you mentioned the photographer because I wanted I was wondering when I I I thought who took these pictures are just so wonderful or did you do the photography do most of the road or summer\nMan I did all the photography except for I think five pictures in the book ... um so we have a I'm a photographer who helped us out with a couple of story uh-huh and those stories ended up uh in the ... and every but everything else yeah Mm I shot\nBecause our our our kept feeling but these people were right here with me I'm going what rough and I it's as if I could just retarded touch the person you're wonderful yeah I Love the photographs [noise] um [noise] so [noise] um what is met Monday creative ...\nSo that was that came out of that period of time after we made solstice and a metal ... jet yeah and that's the name of that I'm short documentary about the raised right and then we started to think about wanting to do advocacy work for nonprofits\nAnd we had an opportunity with mid west environmental advocates to do some a video work I'm about mining issues and facts and money issues and I will be about that or become a company\n... [laughter] school work\nAnd um my company at the time it's called ... productions and met a means loving kindness and compassion is a word hotel a script\nYou're hurting that I'd already been a documentary filmmaker for quite some time and that was my company and then Megan had Megan Monday photography ... and then we throughout all these ideas we're almost going to be five four 'cause we're both five foot four inches all and that was close to a close friend and it was like oh it's just not gonna work so I\nMet a Monday was on the long list of like the five hundred company to come up with\nIt well you appear or there's something about if you appear to be taught or not\nDon't know if I ... I was surprised when you set aside for a A R yeah and neither of us are actually even fight for it [laughter] I Love your spiritual [laughter]\n[laughter] yeah when I when I saw a when I saw that a a measure Monday creative I thought about better world be a\nA Mel ... the main question I have I think more than any other particular one is how you found these people I mean when you go looking for a certain type of person or I mean how did you get these people\nWell maybe we should back up a little bit and talk about the beginning of of love us consulate in at her at as a separate project from the other ones that we are making some at a Monday the company was making that as jets at a documentary about 'em or a little it was a social media campaign actually\nI'm for mid west environments advocates and then we just continued and would make 'em different video projects ... you know um and on the side we had this idea for I left and\nSo it kind of came about in ... Thirteen and a twenty Thirteen ah we're looking around and things are kind of feeling fractured here in our state it was a couple of years after some of the resentment had been brewing and ...\nAnd we're also starting to be really concerned about social media not being this place that was bringing us together but more dividing us as we got into our out that you know at that time we really didn't know about the algorithms but now we do know that they were actually feeding us this content that like made him feel affirmed our beliefs are\nSo we started thinking about like a a Wisconsin needs some lover a hug or something positive and how can we use our soup\nPowers to do something like that and um you know we knew we couldn't change all the big problems that we're seeing but we want to be a part of the solution so that was where the idea of love which we love and confident and this idea of creating a really a digital project a social media based project that could\nConnect us using social media for good and this idea of the social identity of a um being from Wisconsin that's a socialite and his identity that can transcend the ones that divide us the political identities you know all sorts of things rural and urban stuff was going on at the time so it's like\nBut if we could all just at least agree on this and come to the space shuttle third space that we can all gather\nAnd that was where I Love the concept of love Wisconsin came from [noise]\nAnd so then we did have to figure out how do we how do we find the people that we are on the times when I'm a big part of it\nWas trying to use the tools and social media to connect people despite geographic different and so our vision was okay let's get a story from last saw and have someone in Milwaukee read it and\nI'm so we knew that we wanted to do statewide storytelling mhm [noise] so\nThe first thing that we did was we um called our friends you know and we lead okay who has really great stories that we know it'd be compelling to feature\nUm and we were a lot more spontaneous with our story telling one of our first trips we went up to um ... visited a friend of mine saw and she introduced us to a couple of people including taking us around to the farmers' market and we were just stop\nBut the stall and say how you do and we're doing this story telling thing you want it and you want to talk for a little bit\nHow do you feel about that and so that\nWas the sort of origin of what we were really spend less than a half an hour with everybody you know maybe like Fifteen minutes [noise]\nUm and then as we went on it became clear that there is a certain type of story we wanted to tell you we were really interested in getting a diversity of experiences on the on the project and in the platform and so we started being a lot more intentional about our pre production process and that was still sort of a ripple\nUm approach where we would\nCalled a friend who had connected to their friends and your neck to sit there and we would just have a long string of pre production cost we found the storytellers that we wanted ...\nMm now um [noise] there are a lot of stories I think the easy stories and write including the book yeah and um and I was wondering if there were stories that you have to leave out because you only have a space\nYeah there's we've prettiest about a hundred and Seventy five or a hundred and eighty or something like that stories featured story tellers and the project so it was um it was tricky really to try to get it down to eighty which is what is in here now and it's about a hundred and\nSeventy five page book especially one Seventy [laughter] yeah yeah yeah\nBut it's a it's a big book and it's a beautiful book I Love the\nThe the covers ... or as well as the the inside of the of the book and then as I say I'm looking at this moment Catherine now and um and it's just I just feel as if she's here she was about this [laughter] she's about to say something to me personally\nSo Catherine um she owns a little shop in mineral point and and this was actually one of the ones that was um [noise] more spontaneous I saw her shop which is a very it's a Cornish\nShops on all things Cornish and she's so passionate among the Cornish and her heritage and um she's a bart actually so she ... the Cornish culture and she um deserts you can't just spread it uh-huh and so when I um when I\nOpen the door and I kinda gave her the patch and she was like\nSaid you don't and so we schedule it and\nCame back yeah and um and she was just a delight yeah\nYeah and I I I'm I'm Wondering I was wondering you still am wondering if there were people that you had to really convinced to be included in this ... that were reluctant to either to tell their story or reluctant to do you have to be included in a book\nYeah um well I think that once we started to grow\nUm our reach became pretty big it's like\nTwo hundred five hundred thousand people months either work on line and so we knew that that came with a certain responsibility and gravity that we don't want to feature anyone that has um second thoughts about it and and there have there have been times where we have\nInterviewed people photographed people edited the story gone back and forth about the story and and just had to um you know put it to rest for a little while because it wasn't the right time so we want to just be really careful about\nUm [noise] uh the purpose is to honor the story tellers and not make them feel pressured you're now 'cause it's very vulnerable experience ... [noise] um\nSo what are we take a listen a bit to the song um regardless home\nAnd the and then you can talk about it a little bit outdoors\nSo when the song home and then we'll talk about that and then and then I Do want you to a group of about ... ... I just want her story ... ... ... so home by ... of Whitney man with the man okay\n[noise]\nHoney any Adam Sandler shot of nine key and then the name of gang run in the late\nNight around their name on icy and non fattening\nAnd um and then beyond that we want to continue that into the next year ... um so we're always we have a little place we could submit a story on our website mhm\nYeah that's what I was ... I was going to be my next question we have stores that they want us to tell ... become so uh where should they go on line no just\nLove W. I. dot com if you all very met a story or just see all of our past stories are there and then a Facebook um it's love WBAI project or if you just type in love Wisconsin you'll find the Facebook page\nAnd on Facebook we also have a conversation group that people can join and share their own stories so they become a member and people share stories with each other so it's just another way and participate in the project mhm\n[noise] now um we have about a minute left and there was something I remember seeing I didn't it wasn't something or a state where I looked into gear for me but I reversed you mentioned somebody who had a PHD in storytelling you remember that [laughter]\nUm yes I'm Tom ...\nOut here and again but it sounds like it yeah like Tom\nIs a friend and it has a big imprint on this project uh-huh and he's um\nOur data strategy and said he has helped us build our online digital brand and where do we maybe were you at the um what what ... launcher that very talked about him\nNo but I saw it in your own knowledge you know you're the man or what can you get a PHD in storytelling that is shorthand for a longer PHD it's like German um we'll have to have ... [laughter]\nOh wow so uh it's a it's almost eight o'clock so that means that it's time for cyclists to speak so I Want to thank my guest Megan Monday\nAnd the whole war was the editors and producers of love Wisconsin stories from the grave we call the home\nSo ah you can get the book that I'm a real one zone\nAnd the Wisconsin Historical Society museum mhm and or\nI've been with everything else on Amazon so a\nSingle man I recommend visible thank you so much for having us on well You're welcome but you were coming [noise]\nWeekly program on W.

I ... I Do have a friend who actually cleared out her ... her a or the space in her home that was just basically a graveyard of junk and it I mean at one point wasn't junk but now become that\nAnd she she she lives out of state so I I I didn't help her with us but she told me about it and she created a paint a studio ... per painting and now she has a show and it just you know goes\nI don't know actually does help or are to have some order\nWell there's order but there's she created the space to make I guess what you return as the chaotic a ... process and so uh she made space for that so that's that was put benefited her and getting rid of her stuff\nYou know what else um maybe maybe the stories are interesting you can give it up to name people because it is very personal it is what's or whoever you helped in what whereas with your new business is pretty new narrowed\nIt is it's it's actually almost exactly a year old um boy next week so I'm well there's ... ... you want and examples of how a ... what our focus is were or will yeah those are yeah well I saw you at a party\n[laughter] and that and that was one client\nWho indeed wanted to have a space to ... that was her main goal like we we boil that down to her saying I Want to have a space where I can invite people over for a party and at that stage her house she didn't feel is ready\nFor that we should say don't be uncertain so it was important yes you have parties will be able have parties and stuff we either now\nIs very she has a very cluttered life [laughter] but yeah and I walked in the house and and I had helped her with other parts of the home but the I got the ball rolling with her and she was motivated and inspired\nTo work and other aspects of her home and I walked in and I it was like a night and day it was fantastic and indeed there was a lovely party we're all enjoying ourselves or space\nIt was calming and it was fantastic to see uh I I just really get enthusiastic about\nSeeing that spark and people are where I'll come in and and we'll work on a project together and then I'll leave and then I hear about\nOh when I and then I went into the next part of the house or a you know worked on this part of the basement and ah and created a you know a place space for my my son or whatever it may be and that's always really great to have like oh no I'm doing my job to well because you're\nDoing it on your own now [laughter] well that's good oh but that you as a great figure out what what particular skills to have for this are all good at birth\nI have a lot of experience um I had a home that was filled to the brim with all kinds of things I felt obligated to take care of things um I felt obligated to take care of an old typewriter that I found on the side of the road I felt very\nOutliving we're an animal rescue like a human Mike oh it was very I made a whole story about it and\nUm I and I I I felt very obligated to anyway but\nI had a lot of stuff was what does that way and and so when I had to label moment of getting rid of all these things um I did do actually a lot of our projects within perform and stuff and storytelling and whatnot still doing that um but so I have experience and empathy I guess it's a big one ... and\n... as serious as the the process can sometimes be I also like to bring a lot of humor with it um it can be\nYou know we can get so stuck on one little object where\nIt's just impossible to let go just this one thing it's it's such a crazy phenomenon and then\nYou know and then we kind of lighten up the mood and you realize oh okay it's just a book of matches or whatever it is or it's just a T shirt or it's hard to keep that prospect of some time so that tried to interview some humor and um we get perspective that way but yeah definitely empathy um experience\nUm I just love organizing things I organized events and people and now places so I just I guess I I like to bring order\nWill as we wrap up the coal let people know how they would contact you and how far you have to do\nOr when the water to get what you can you come out and do a ... ...\n... you can you can buy may I don't know if I could just as they might

get around to and they just need accountability too like I said if a huge re envisioning of what they want to do with their lives and their space and their homes in a or a move or something like that

...\nUh okay so are you are a a chameleon low Murray that we had a lot of different projects out you know like to watch you from the edges and see oh she's singing some back up there she's singing some coverage as students there\nAnd then when when I saw you were in the Frank Zappa tribute band with Conrad that was like okay no I don't completely understand what this woman [laughter]\nWhy don't you though that are uh I just\nI just do the things I like him things that I enjoy it\nAnd that they have a project is awesome with them without challenging it is and how it interesting and music and then and this project is and you know more at more of my own you know kind of music baby\nAnd you do a lot of classic a jazz tunes in general but ah what how would you describe the seven tunes like yours\n... yes [laughter] well six of them are mine ones the cover of al Donny Hathaway song um which which is really cool he does it in for we did it in three with a string quartet at string quintet and roads\nAnd dad but but the rest of the chance I wouldn't I wouldn't really didn't last time as I Would classify him as Nassau are anti ... and yeah they they're they're pretty pretty self will pay ... lots of string section on the whole thing and lots of roads\nDid you are you so Conrad you're here you're mixed it but I'm guessing you're also sort of might have taken a little more hand in shaping and producing 'cause you're nodding here no no just mixed it yeah well\nWell he played bass is what I ... I\nPlay bass in you know low and I've been working together in a number of projects and I'm just really really very happy and lucky that she you know trusted me enough musically that the the album is especially the bass player\nIt's almost the lines that she let me play or almost counterpoint with vocals is much more for words than\nJust to sort of typical background baseline was so much fun during this rug yet along the beach yeah [laughter] and she's such a fantastic musician on every level that it's been such a pleasure from the beginning um\nAnd you know I Know she was a little tentative at first about\nProducing herself um but I've watched her go through this and she works so hard and it's such an amazing job putting everything together from the musicians and so we used to a couple of national session musicians or one of her\nA friend who is another musician that she's worked with regularly Melanie Joy Elvie um is the string ranger and she's fantastic I absolutely love the string\nAnd so on this record there are amazing and the but the everything complements lose vision beautifully and she was able to orchestrate over that and making all move forward and I just was able to kind of sit there and for once just be the bass player was four\nYears or so I'm a notice you play with a lot of people of my generation which is a different generation how'd you get hooked up

I think\nThose two things we need to do one of the week one of them were doing quite well one of when we're doing less well what we're doing well is what we saw last stop site is unite ching\nEverybody who wants to do something about the growing not your threats whether that structural damage ... greens Opie from churches or theatre club's coming together inside and we are United against this threats um we need a ... response\nWe're doing quite well the problem is the threat doesn't just come because\nTwo hundred fifty thousand people have gotten state comes because of real problems which are happening in German society that there are lots of loses some ... ... if you if you win that's\nUm walk the old traditional parties are offering is not very exciting a toll on this is why victory Maya both members of the Lincoln left bouncy which has about ten percent of the time of the center of the sports I\nJust try and not just that site not just a negative is I wanted to do something that's right some but we won't solve a pulse of alternatives we want to ... million ask them provide back to the social services back to a hospital schools and things like that [noise]\n... there was a problem on the left at the moment in the way a\nNot entirely United incidents how to deal with the um rubbing racist that race it racist threats it do you ignore rich on TALK about social issues or do you say the ... growing you need to stand up against race if you need to do that depend Mike when right Mike and rights\nAnd there's a specific argument about whether we should be ... or ... whether we should be asking broken bones from icons\nNow this might seem a bit so a bit east ... people vote ... on the left should become you can saying here is our old tend to have is how the world can be back to is currently being perceived as a ... foot which is pledging amongst itself I\nWon't go into the minute shy of of of why why why is what we really need to be a coming together and saying we're full of defending refugees we are full of ... ... that's a that's a an social social ... system\nI'm way out against the ... the ... a few people profit from the side where most ... most people lose outs\nAnd if we don't that's how I got thrown nuts it doesn't matter it doesn't matter how many hundreds of thousands of people we ... we we we've mobilized we're going to tell anything attract an attractive alternative poll to walk the a firearm is offering the moments\nWhen we were working on these ... who writes but we will be back to the site ...\nWhich do not go ahead you know a a yes or\nA big problem here is somewhat similar to that in the states I Would say well you have many different groups each fighting for their own particular aim which are good and\n'em you can uh Germany to the devastation of Libya which was done under the\nUm the ... a NATO [noise]\nUm but then as I Know a little doesn't seem to ever be a discussion of why did these people have to say\nYes this is of course the main problem the United states but then\nWith Britain and Germany and lots of other countries has ... ... is fighting a war in Afghanistan and and of course both started a war in Iraq and this war is going on in Syria and of course the refugees that complex\nMany were misused the main thing really is to stop those wars and uh I have a I have hope that this business with this journalist who was killed in Istanbul in Turkey may force\nCrump to ease off on his very close buddy buddy relationship with Saudi Arabia is of course one of the main causes of crumble as you put it in ... and ... other places perhaps that can be a change in that direction that people realize who's really behind all this trouble\nAnd uh and and the wars in Afghanistan and uh and Syria and and you are in\nA dress so terribly devastating to to human beings to children especially that has to be hop stopped and not and not be allowed to extend to get even worse as always that danger show that actually the whole world is facing these problems I think\nMhm [noise] well um we have very little time left um [noise] so if you each want to give us say very quickly very short\nI'm not I'm last\nWords full of listeners and and what you would like them to think about them and what do you owe thinking about so let's start with you feel\nYeah but one one thing I M came to Germany twenty four years ago I'm currently applying for German citizenship I the only problem I have is always will employ the couple of years ago and they might want him those stunts\nTwenty percent of the people who live in ... I'm not Germans I'm not as not being an outcry the outcry is coming because people\nHave a certain religion ... skin color or not it's something which we wouldn't need to talk loud about that there is no there's not a problem of 'em over and over ... integration there was a problem of racism and the problem of people having all sorts of\nStrange ideas in the head which has pushed by the major and politicians I think we're in a good position and something\nYou're not what we're doing on the ground in a national group in Berlin is trying to bring together the people who are have a positive contribution both socially I'm politically\nAnd we are gaining ... because it because we're doing things on perhaps it's time to be a little bit more ... more proactive in if\nYou hit people coming out with um it can ruin tide is the system the from the ones I actually this is not what it's like and you'll be surprised by the amounts of Russians which you Wilcox\nMhm thank you and Victor\nYes for may the conclusions that I'd been drawn a are that many many problems facing the world go to Germany and the states\nTo form the growing and that meant that upper once said that that gap between the very very rich\nAnd the rest of the working people including the very poor I think one of the problems for the ... that we sort of yeah\nVictory yo yo line is very very bad but we did we did get deal um the gist of what you're saying the BLM is\nThe one percent thank you so very much Victor gross limit writer leaving in ... and feel but one\nI'm also leaving in ... and he's speaking founding member of the link between international thank you very much both of you and good luck in uh Germany [noise] some\nReading some medicine by by thank you and we'll take a very short break and we'll be back to talk about Social Security and um the other ... pull them that there'll be an endangered lay the Republicans\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\nUm that was a major laser frittering I'm we're old dirty projectors with\nGet free never got love film and government men and a with us on the phone is Nancy Altman\nShe's the president of Social Security works writer of three books on Social Security um she has been featured on PBS NewsHour or MSNBC and even Fox News\nAmong others and um hello Nancy thank you very much for joining us today thank you so much for having me\nSo um we are concerned as we have been really full years about the future of Social Security Medicare and Medicaid but I'm just well last week this week\nI'm Mitch McConnell talks about his desire to end these blow them stuck about what he said\nI'm I'm way what do you think he said no\nThis is the ending of Social Security Medicare and Medicaid have been long standing goals\nOf really the extreme right wing better now in charge of our government and sure enough Mitch McConnell as you said just said that ah just like the you know the old joke about the\nBoy who killed his parents and then leads to the court that he's an orphan for leniency\nThey've ran at the data set where they are one point five trillion dollar tax break for mainly going to corporations and um and lawyers and billionaires and\nThey are now saying oh my gosh the deficit would have thought and we've got to cut these programs so that's what Mitch McConnell said blaming\nThese programs on the effort of course Social Security doesn't add a penny to the deficit\nAnd but nevertheless they're using it as an excuse and my concern is that this is what they're saying before November sex then if they remain in power they will see it as a license to just go after these programs and anyone who cares about these programs must vote on November sexed\nMhm [noise] so um you have been on a folks news or you must have made the I'm the only time I ever see busy for him in some place where it's blaring and and [laughter] no choice but um\nDo\nI Know that you're not necessarily an expert on that but do you think that\nThe people who voted for Republicans and I'm so Trump\nAnd who will be victimized just as much as you and me if these blooms obese continued do you think that they understand what is going no no oh do you think that they will just going to be new I'm voting blindly folded Republicans\nI'm so glad you asked that I mean I actually love going on conservative media because even though the um the hosts of the show or hospitals or these programs\nThose are the elites in Washington overwhelmingly the rank and file across ideology tea partiers agree with um with progress since that we that these programs are more important than ever we should not cut these programs we should be expanding numb and so even though the\nSo it it but I think you're exactly right until recently\nWashington insiders all talked about a bipartisan solution and when you say that which is code for cutting these programs when you say that um it's you know how or how are voters supposed to know\nAs we've seen in so many cases he was lying if you looked at as we're what he said before starting to run he talked about privatizing Social Security that it was a Ponzi scheme and he is surrounded himself with people\nMick Mulvaney Tom Price is now gone I'm a I'm the vice president Mike Pence and others who live throughout their careers they've been allied with Paul Ryan and I'm wanting to um\nTo really cut drastically Social Security ... Medicare 'em and block grant Medicaid which would really and all three programs as we know them\nMhm and I'm just briefly um is the um the additional a first um socal justice Gorsuch and then a tunnel most recently to the Supreme Court does that matter in this case\nYou know um fortunately in Nineteen thirty seven the Supreme Court decided that Social Security was constitutional it was actually a big question\nBefore that and people were afraid that they would\nThe Supreme Court would find that the federal government did not have that power now from time to time including Mick Mulvaney who's the oh and be director in this administration\nHas said well they decided that wrongly it really is unconstitutional but I think that's probably a step too far even for the current conservatives on the Supreme Court though I think\nAnd and the so I think expanding um Social Security I'm an acting Medicare for all if that's what the American people\nWant the good thing about the Supreme Court is they can't reach out and take a case um\nAnd without someone bringing a suit and I think I'm ...\nNow seem to be quite catch the\nUnreal totally out of time Nancy Altman um thank you so much president those Social Security works um people can do to your website and read most appreciate you joining us appreciate your work thank you\nSo much you Bye bye and thanks to Shelley's back with us and to Nancy\nMurray show am STD nor will be talking again next week by by [noise]\nAnd that's a public affairs which comes to you every weekday from twelve to one up next now it's melon Floyd says stay tuned [noise]\nMy mom would not be\nOn the news about that [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nWell good afternoon welcome to the male employed summer replacement Joel I'm male and he is Floyd got it right this week we did [laughter] it's practice yeah that is what does it in the [laughter] and joining us now says\nLet us know at high switching over from the other studio is oh I Can't hear myself oh no you can't\nYou know we can't hear any of us so that really were regulator right next to you know you only hear it may be better for you it was okay I rarely hear things inside my head [laughter] or enough voices already crowded out of that\nThat's good that's a little more that's come a little more would be okay we can actually this is yeah that's good okay you voted I did vote today it looks like you've got a sticker there yeah yeah that's what it how did you vote today um well I ... you can vote at the libraries\nNow yeah and so do you vote in advance of the actual voting and you go in in ...

going to help fill in yes yes yep feeling each like yeah [laughter] yeah [laughter] ... yeah that's how you doing\nGood I just uh helped Estee out with her show so I learned a lot about government programs and Mitch McConnell and [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nI have a friend who used to work in the U.S Senate and I'm Sorry [laughter] that doesn't come as no surprise to you but she said the two people she could pretty much get along with anybody she's very nice and but she said the two people she could not stand were Mitch McConnell and Ted Cruz\nFiguring [laughter] right\nYeah well that's the line about Ted Cruz why do people take such an immediate just like to Ted Cruz it just saves time [laughter]\n[laughter]\nOh it's been instincts really is out of the animal instinct have [laughter] I actually I actually have this as a ... a story from a neurologist who explains why you want to punch Ted Cruz and they'll say oh so we'll be getting to that later was that government funded that like I\nSaid any [laughter] there were a lot of volunteer [laughter]\nNo meet me [laughter]\nOnce in a lifetime opportunity [laughter] no it's science so we'll get to that later though so\nSo how's your weight than\nGood and fighting a little cold but not no not too bad so I Can't hear any coldness in your voice okay\nNo good but the other than the usual cold than [laughter] this is my disdain [laughter] that's actually helped me that [laughter]\nBut slate and tricks he took me out last night young at a good time yeah I heard you guys are having some drinks\nYes yeah we did we had some drinks it was in the news [laughter] all the time was have yeah we can't go anywhere without the gossip columnist picking it up [laughter]\nWe're going to say yes it's pretty much an extended ... yeah they both had really stressful day and so yeah I was just an audio off yeah [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nSo yeah that was fun though we didn't do that more often than just not an air no no yeah that's not extended\nRent [laughter] that's what this one [laughter]\nWait a minute [laughter] than what show would we do a\nSo so last night on Twitter I saw a few things about this racist ad on in in Arkansas did did you see any of this and you know okay so so if it was but it was very appalling and I didn't I just read descriptions\nOf the of the ad and I think is a radio at might've been a TV ad but uh but anyway so I didn't and I thought well that'd be a good story I'd like to talk about that tomorrow but it but this morning I couldn't find find the the tweet it actually had been deleted so I think somebody who was like like embarrassed\nBut it it got it so much attention so\nSo but I wanted to find it so I went and I and I and I couldn't remember what state or anything so I just I just Googled racist GOP\nAnd [laughter] and I thought well it'll pop right up right now first hit there were like [laughter] no not that well no not that no not that one [laughter]\n\nIt was really I met him I was totally caught by surprise that [laughter] on those results but anyway so it's a radio ad being run in Arkansas and supportive Republican representative French Hill\nFrench Hill when she'll that's a great name yeah it features exaggerated ... that's not an American name it's a French and it is I'm right on the French media freedom hell [laughter]\nThe alt right you know both sides both sides\nYeah there there and uh so it's it's a better part of course the town itself is basically founded on racism\nBut so these\nBattles continued to be fought but it's causing a problem for the town of Portland, Michigan\nBecause the town of Portland, Michigan has a police department has a Facebook page that are called the\nPortland police department ... and [laughter] people being human get them mixed up all the time and go on their Facebook page and make all kinds of comments about the things going on in Portland, Oregon\n[laughter]\nWhy don't you do [laughter] [laughter] the other\nPolice chief says um it's important that our residents recognize the context of these complaints are there no way affiliated with the purple Portland police department to Portland, Michigan [laughter] they had a whole bunch of one star reviews oh\nYes [laughter] review police departments yeah like a ... yeah it's like a preview you should be embarrassed for why do you what happened to the city would not use it in [laughter]\nI'm calling somebody else but it's ... a cute little town uh west of Lansing\nSo so if if yeah assuming that Michigan looks like a missing [laughter] where would it be on the ... [laughter] it's\nRight here along the lifeline oh I see yeah that's right oh yeah okay can but I think the whole year but I think the thing yeah yeah that's below the pinky finger almost\nDead center okay so that's where Portland is so there are other Portland's in other states I don't know if you knew this yeah I've heard that yeah yeah\nI mean I didn't know Portland was founded on Oregon was founded on the\nWhole state yeah they used to be like yeah they had very very strict\nLaws as to a race as to who could settled there and who could live in the city limits and\nYeah the gentrification happening now it's just all\nTo go out yeah right right yeah [laughter] yeah\nThe the yeah the pretty much things stay the same um but anyway yeah there are other ... other states I always thought there were only two yeah Portland Maine right which is the good Portland yeah and then Portland, Oregon which is the other Portland\nBut there's Portland, Arkansas Portland, Connecticut so Portland New York Portland, Tennessee uh Portland, Texas and uh Portland Wyoming in addition to Portland, Michigan\nTook a left turn Portland Seattle [laughter] I had a\nFriend in high school who are collected maps with all the news from Wooster Michigan and so he collects good maps that had\nThe town's named Wooster in the United states I forgot how many he had been there there are a number of states that have towns named ... okay\nWell I've got some state news as well oh good um I don't I don't know if you have this one but this is from the Wichita Eagle\nAnd uh and I knew I campaign tourism campaign Nebraska concedes that honestly it's not for everyone [laughter] it's refreshing [laughter] ah according to the chair of the Nebraska tourism ... commission on\nWho said we discovered that we can't offer something for it to everyone but to those that we can this campaign speaks to their sense of adventure and discovering what we as Nebraska guns are all about\nAnd that and the grass gets old tagline which the state stopped using and twenty Fifteen was Nebraska nice\n[laughter] all the mid west had a claim on right right yeah and I was Minnesota nice yeah\nSo I ask a knife the new brand platform is defined by honesty said the new Prescott tourism executive\nDirector of breast go never ask a we're okay [laughter] you probably won't like it [laughter] the over arching\nConcept of honesty is rooted in the mindset that values transparency purity and simplicity away of embracing the not so obvious bits of life\nFeel we've accomplished just one of the ads shared in a news release features large text reading famous for a flat boring landscape\n[laughter]\nAny unit camera legislation there you go [laughter] when I was in the last one ... to [laughter] we'll get calls and then yeah I Know at all that's not a legislature know than the drama dairy [laughter]\nSo\nWhen when I was in Duluth I worked at the ad agency to do and we worked with the um dilute convention and visitors bureau and they wanted a new slogan for for dilute and so the slogan we came up with was were dilute and proud of it\n[laughter] pretty defensive [laughter]\nLet's put that do back in the mood [laughter]\nSomething about diluted into loose [laughter] they can come up with so yeah they always ignored my idea [laughter] I wanted to have like a ...\nA sea monster whole like a like a like a Loch Ness the\nMole yeah you can still do that by the way [laughter] I was on my own [laughter]\nI wanted it sanctioned by the convention is going to be great for tourism and I'm up to lake Lake Superior and look for the monster he could be because the monkey hoax it'd be there you go\nAnd then shame to say that I was misled by the whole sniper can you see that jumping sniper a hoax for way into my\nTeenage [laughter] that would work [laughter]\nWell that's an admission [laughter]\nAnd what's the one the whole dog your whole the whole day yeah that is a rain lander isn't it home and do that because I Believe so yeah you know your shrugging over there yeah\nWe'll take logic you hold out hope leg up hunting some nowadays [laughter] open Ryan lander yeah you just need a sack in a in a stick him a little [laughter] so\nAdvisors that President Trump tried to persuade him not to come to Wisconsin where we can all do something we can all get behind this to campaign for Governor Scott Walker because they believe Walker is going to lose to twenty ...\n[noise]\nI use a schedule to campaign with Walker and uh let's see Wednesday but they're trying to talk them out of it so that that that was interesting 'cause they yeah they had a internal polling and stuff\nI bet they learned that you can't talk him out no I'm not coming here you know the more you try to talk them out of it the more he'll be determined to you know you're getting distracted and yeah something shiny hand ... or something [laughter]\n[noise] well there are a bunch of candidates coming or a fence happening I'm

I'm rarely if ever seen a conventional smile from Senator Cruz in a natural smiled the corners of the Moscow up these muscles we can control voluntarily as well but muscles circling the eyes are strictly under in voluntary control they make the eyes narrow\nForming crows feed it the old say corners um says even the Mona Lisa smile shows this um the eyes give away one game and help us tell a\nFake smile from real ones so but no matter what the emotional coloring of senator Cruz's outward rhetoric rhetoric is his mouth typically titans into the same straight line\nIf it deviate from this than the corners of his mouth bend down not up words the outside of his eyebrows bend down to something so a typical it disturbs\nMe [laughter] typically a person's\nEyebrows arch up as do the the muscles that that for all of the forehead um what is such a downturn face signaling down turning expressions usually signal disagreements this'll just agreeable nuts for discussed but I don't know because uh such an expression is rare in the context of public\n[laughter] I meant to win people over [laughter] and then there's that open all the senators\nOh at the photos or capture over and over again I don't I don't know what to make of it but he he makes it when he overly emotions he shows us as well as tells us that he's determined irritated or above or above it all whereas speakers who are angry indignant are rhetorically displeased push their mouth forward into a powered\nUm\nSo anyway he says it just it it's kind of like it doesn't make sense you know [laughter] it's almost like he's not human [laughter] he doesn't say anything about\nThe slanted pupils the slit people's and the little membrane that come down [laughter] does he [laughter] that in the flickering tongues\nSo how many how many subjects didn't look at me for him and he found trees and like I think I think he just ... specifically looked at [laughter] 'cause he heard people say boy that that guy makes me sad now and no seriously I think he he was like what what is it about him\nThat makes everybody want to punch them in the fate yeah aside from his horrific policies when there's that too yeah\nSo [laughter]\nBut I thought that was interesting about that the eyebrows going down and you know everything kind of going backwards to what our normal human reacts to these types of things backwards\nThese backwards policy and down the uncanny valley\n[laughter] it's in Texas or\n... or a Julian Assange who's been living in the embassy the Ecuadorian embassy in the u._k.\nSince June two

fessed up so tell me how this started last year this is the second one going on how did you guys put this together last year\nI've been booking lots of shows them primarily like punk rock and stuff I just wanted to do something that it was like bigger than anything I'd done before or something that I thought it would just get like a bunch of people out and have fun\nRight and how did you ... not known for punk shows but it seemed like a perfect spot for that\nYeah well it used to be called area fifty one now than they used to do like punk shows and things that frequently I guess\nThat's right and I forgot I forgot again or fifty one yeah\nIt changed ownership ... hold on I think I'm not sure why but uh yeah I Know he's\nHe's really well known forever like blue shows and stuff but I just like on to reach out to a venue like something that was a decent size and we can have a good amount of people of that food and the staging the good solve this I'm right on this happened or oh and he had a he had at all\nSo how did you pick the bans for this year you have a pretty wide wide diversity is it like you just contacted people and see if they'd show up or where people submitting themselves or\nLittle both actually I'm I hit up like the bad that I really liked in the area that I wanted to come to ... and I'm from doing that last year that I did it\nAlthough this year and that adds some submission so they all all of this kind of worked out and we've got a great line of\nSo tell me a little bit about six pack productions 'cause I Know you guys have been around looking shows for a while how did you get started with that\nLike they had in my living room with my buddy getting drunk and I was like hey let's just how a music instead booking shows like All right it's a kind of evolved from there and I've just been doing ever since I was probably about three or four years ago now\nI guess that's the way how most people do it independently they just say hey I really want to do this and and then it happens and people start calling you knowing that you have the contacts and so forth\nIt's kind of it's kind of weird 'cause like you know I'll I'll just get home from work and I'll check my email or something and I'll have an email from a bad for like the east coast or like down south or into the country they on that someone had told them about media that if I could help them booking these shows you're mad as in our area\nIt seems like independent Venus are really the way to go here in town now that uh live nation has taken over do you feel any competition from that I mean I don't think a lot of punk shows are booked by major venues but uh are you still doing well in in terms of finding places for people to play and so forth\nBut I I mean or heightened air and still like that kinda oh and by um and I just said that negative approach show there are a few\nMonths ago though right on yeah OK perfect but yeah I mean there's there's a lot of jobs out there you know like there's ...\nThere's always the ... go and make use of crystal corner of there's still like a thriving independent music scene here for sure\nYeah we've done we've done pretty well in the last couple of years\nKinda blossomed into into something that I I never thought it would be but\nYeah I've been here for over Twenty years and when I got here things are sort of winding down when okay that was the last venue standing and then there was a time period where there wasn't a whole lot of stuff and now suddenly it's it's come back and there's more space than there are bands now it

drove their personal car\nInto the company's workstation\nAnd they drove the same vehicle at the same tools to the same places then it's clear under federal and state law that they have to be paid for

apply to that so it could then not have to pay the employees in this particular case and the only way they pour it could do that\nWas to say that the law is really just clarifying federal law it's not changing federal up it's a change in law there that can only applied prospectively going into the future if it's a clarification than the law can be applied retroactively and that would help this particular employer\nVery similar case in in filed was filed in the Nineteen nineties was ruled in favor of the employees however in response the employer and was able to convince Congress to pass a law in Nineteen Ninety six and says commuting evening in employees vehicle is unpaid time\nWisconsin\nPassed that law the employers said well since this\nLaw just clarify federal law\nThan in Wisconsin law had the same concepts the law should also be automatically applied to a state law and what we were saying is that absence a legislative act specifically adopting the federal law than federal law does not apply I I was fairly encouraged by the questioning that the justices asked\nThey seem pretty skeptical of the idea that Wisconsin would be bound by the federal law what the

commutes where the employee for example he or she can't stop and drop their child off at school while they're driving the company of a can stop\nAnd in terms of personal business while they're driving this company vehicles so it's not they're tired basically because of all these restrictions reporters place under community\n\nIf the court would rule in favor of employees I think it would set a very
