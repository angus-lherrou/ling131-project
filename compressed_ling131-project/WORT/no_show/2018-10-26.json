T. writing this book\n... so he I I grew up in Michigan and I studied ... as an undergraduate at the University of Michigan and after finishing school I I took a job at Google and I when I was there I learned all sorts of it was about to seal the machine learning\n... but at the same time I I wanted to continue and more so I went back to school and studied machine learning at for about four to five years and then came back to the bay area and I started working in Pakistan and the during this period I had a chance to study machine learning and\nIn academia into a quiet and the real world and it was it was relieved that that experience that got me very interested in it and and really before that it was also some experience with programming from a somewhat young age that got me interested in that topic I've been interested in it for quite awhile\nMhm so where did your fascination kind of with robotics and automation began then 'cause then all of a lot of the book uh is sort of bases around some examples of uh\nHow am I applied to different technological aspects that people would be familiar with in today's world you know were you ever were you a builder and when you were a little um did you ever do anything with robotics or were you more interested on the software side of a of that\nGets the good question I I I always like to cook circuits together and things like that and I remember having ... where you could program a car to to drive by crushing for example forward forward forward right for things like that will give them a card to drive\n'em up after you've had fused buttons for example and we had some toys that we're a little bit like robotics like a robotic arm and things like that I don't think it was really until college I was an undergraduate that I really found out how much I liked it I took a class and robotics laundry graduate and ... it was\nAlmost down my favorite 'course yeah it was it did it around that time but I kind of realized that that was something that was interesting to me it's no different I don't work with robotics right now about the among the ideas from machine learning and robotics um have are are there's a lot of ...\n\nAre you there oh okay sorry kinda got a little bit [laughter] oh no no no no it's I I was getting a panic looks and Kevin [laughter] like oh no good um [laughter] yeah you can never predict technology I suppose um so so if someone else who\nCame you know we both grew up in saying we weren't like close friends or anything we just kind of knew each other in in high school but ah we will sort of been propelled on this\nThe academic track and have gone off to sort of things beyond what uh are I mean I guess arguably smaller town or what most people would would do so I'm curious to know about how ah because I talked to a lot of scientists about their stories and their experiences are getting to this point in their life I'm curious to know\nHow uh\nHow coming from a town like Saginaw has affected you in in your course for ah for better or worse\n... I that's a good question I I think that too I don't know that I was really as directed as um as maybe I could have done for example\nI found myself wondering this even though I had spent countless hours practicing and studying machine learning in ... and it occurred to me that if if if I couldn't understand these things than probably a lot of other people camps either because a lot of other\nPeople are spending you can last time that I Am looking at these topics ... and as I as I\nSpent some time looking at it and thought more about it\nI I I started to realize that part of the problem is that the field is advancing so quickly that the if that academia in classes that you might take about these topics are sometimes not keeping up ... now they're doing their best and they're doing a good job but the field is with changing so quickly that it's hard for them to keep up with another reason is that the\nThe specific topics you might find in the class are usually more like the lower level component so it's for example part works them and you took a class about materials engineering than you would learn maybe how how rubber works than you might learn about how how to make high quality steal that you wouldn't necessarily know how to put those together into her\nChain so yeah so I think that um because I was curious about these things and starting to learn about them as I read about him I thought maybe I should\nTry to share the suit formation with other people as well people who maybe don't have quite the background to read a paper about self driving cars and to um if maybe if even if they have the background they just don't have time to read the papers in things so\nThat it was ultimately to share this information with other people that I wrote the book\nUh-huh and I mean ... you always hear people talking about you know like oh I should write a book about this or tried to put my life but there is a big difference between thinking about it or talking about it and actually doing\nI'm I'm curious to know what the process was like for you or I mean going through their school or work I mean these jobs are pretty demanding of mental space of time um I mean you can write if you have a computer generated anywhere but uh what was the process that might be writing the book\nThat if you get crushed him so I\nBe on the bench I'm writing next week I'm ... so I I at the time I was commuting about\nMaybe forty minutes to fifty minutes on ... which is our public transit here no subway system and and that was each way so I could easily spend an hour and a half ... public transit rating just writing I'm away or reading\nA in preparation for the buck uh-huh the other thing was just like\nAbsolutely um you know I didn't create the initial covered designed although I guess we'll get back on it and um the so yeah and illustrator came up with the uh cover design and on the spur of the I guess for those listeners who may not\nIf it looks kind of like a space invaders\nWhich is the ... the old Atari Games a space invaders game except that there are things like there's an Iran that were kind of there's a film thing on it because I talk about the ethics challenged and a button and there are a handful of other things on a self driving cars things like that and it looks kind of like this this little ship at the bottom is treating a\nLot of things sharing racking up I'm so why don't we when we talk\nA little bit about so one of the um do several modules it involved the Netflix challenge and this isn't an example of a a very well crafted algorithm can you tell us a little bit about what the Netflix challenge was\nSure that the Netflix challenge was a competition organized by the company Netflix to find\nA better movie recommendations ... and this was important to them at the time because at the time they didn't really have their streaming service they depended on males based DVD tracked transfers essentially mail order DVDs where am I Am so it was important that when people\nRequested a video that we've got the video that they actually like the video and so they really valued their movie recommendation engines and the type of information people get it could get out of it so they they said we're going to pay a million dollars to the first team that can get ten percent better than our algorithm\nAnd it was a just a fascinating competition in which the whole bunch of different people competed tried to make progress they actually did better than Netflix within the first week and um but the competition itself to remember correctly about two and a half years\n... and the ... I won't give away the ending but there's there are multiple surprises within the actual competition and um the ending isn't quite what you would expect\n... or the other thing I should mention there's just that the reason I mention I talk about that movie\nBeijing competition in the in the book is because there are a lot of different themes that come out later in the book that our first surfaced in this competition mhm and want to be that organizing a competition to push a field of artificial intelligence forward\nIs actually something that seems to be a recurring patterns the same thing happened with self driving cars for example ...\nSo who are what is the primaries today what are the primary forces behind developing a high there's commercial interests there's definitely academic interested in using these models are for research purposes but what are the primary driving forces behind a a similar to to Netflix\nMhm [noise] that's a good question you know I don't know the numbers for example like how much is being invested but I Do know that companies as you mentioned commercial interests are um are investing quite heavily into\n'em and part of that is because it's working so for example we know that the these algorithms are getting better and better understanding of the content of images which is just a very valuable thing if you can do it automatically ... um I think it's I I still think it's a very mixed\nA combination of both academic and commercial and personal interest as well okay it's also something where a lot of people want to know about it so for example um you have individuals who are studying the field even if they're not in academia or mhm uh industry for example ...\nIs hot like a like a a hobby is kind of exactly definitely interesting yep yep\nYep so uh ... you mentioned a neural networks and machine learning earlier um the these topics came up a lung a long time ago neural networks were meant to be models are reflections are ways to study Roose biological interactions within the human brain\nA roof and then that's not what they turned out to necessarily be super useful for but uh when kind of was the the beginning of machine learning a neural networks and why didn't it only take off to seem like it takes on his only taken off recently\n... [noise] that's a good question so worm thing until they've been around for I remember correctly about the late fifties that it was near oh yeah yeah I had been around 'em or since\nBefore then if I remember correctly it'd be there but it's a proposal for a program that could play chess back in the late forties I think uh-huh and um and the ... at the time we we we're pretty excited about it and a lot of people were really excited\nBut well I mean let me actually described to the state of of the she already and and they are so right now conferences are us first thing at the seams with interest from researchers and we have things called ...\nAnd we had an increasing uh that is that spent improving as a very quick rate that's making it easier to train these models ... and we have 'em in addition to those things I'm near that works that are improving and very many ways now everything I've just said\nIt could actually have been set in the Nineteen sixties mhm\nYeah you got to be the case\nYou know the um that what seems like a lot of breakthroughs right now have actually I don't know if we could say the same exact thing about where we were in the sixties it's just that we're further along with no um but we thought that we were having a lot of breakthroughs affects them as well and I'm In some sense we actually almost over promise affect them ... ... ... people get too excited and\nThe after people get too excited and we're a little bit disappointed field months into kind of a winter\nAnd so funding dried up and people didn't study these things as much here on networks kind of became a term of Russian and it wasn't until the late nineties and and the two thousand students that Iran that works headed back up and up picking up for some of the same reasons where is getting much better known we have a lot more data that we can ease\nAnd I'm and I'm going to read I'm a little bit from one of my favorite books this is such a wonderful book it's ah I never thought that anybody could write such a wonderful a nonfiction book in our in our debt is such a wonderful book I'll say\nIt's a oh it's just I just go through it sometimes and I read it and I laugh and\nAnd I almost cried a and and I wonder and or the book is called educating as may uh buy as many Roger Goodell she was my guess twice on on this program a few years ago\nThis is the tenth anniversary edition of the book educating educating as may which came out in two thousand nine and I must have her back on the program if ah if I can get her she\nShe she was such a superstar then so I Hope she'll be able to make a a few moments for us on radio literature at some time and it's called educating as may diary of a teacher's first year\nAnd it's just oh just such a wonderful book\nUm and I want to read or to you or it's a she had her students that are this is the fifth grade class she had her fifth grade to the end of the school year right a notes for the incoming fifth graders\nAnd this is what one of them wrote a Melanie a fifth grader and I won't ah there's there's a lot of misspelling in here and things like that but I Want to dwell on any of that\nI Know what you're thinking you're thinking they're going to the fifth grade is going to be fun and not hard remember this is the fifth grader well I\nSomething to tell you you got to know everything you have to know your division your timetables ... know how to do with the dollar Dolly decimal system\nThere are a lot of books she have read this year like\nThe hundred dresses by Elena estimates Greek miss Helen Keller the battery powered by Randall Gerald and and you would find out the rest when you get here you cannot say shut up and you must follow the golden rule and you cannot talk in the hall and you must not talk back at the teacher\nWell I think that is enough to let you know about the fifth grade life ...\nThat was Melania fifth grader reading known to live here you go to convert to the great the following year and that if we have time which probably won't ah I'll read another a excerpt there are actually from estimate herself so now we have ah as you know we right now we have\nTo uh audio engineers are manning the the the control board\nAnd we're going to hear from 'em Dave Dave heart gr was the outgoing a controller in the studio and uh I I don't know which ... going to read for us\nI Am going to read my November guessed by Robert Frost okay\nSo Robert Frost things to be our featured author today\nYes yes I actually I read the poem and then so who was by um [laughter] and yeah it's it's just a wonderful read okay uh my November guest\nMy sorrow when she's here with me thinks these dark days of autumn rain are beautiful as days can be she loves the bear the with their tree she walks the sun pasture lane\nHer pleasure will not let me stay she talks and I'm saying to list she's glad the birds are gone away she's glad her simple worsted gray is now silver is silver now with clinging missed the desolate deserted\nHe's the faded earth the heavy sky the beauty she so truly sees she thinks I have no ice for the ... and ... me for a reason why not yesterday I learned to know the love of\nBear November days before the coming of the snow but they were in vain to tell her so and they are better for her praise Mm\n[noise] oh I just love Robert Frost is just a a celebrate 'em and give us the title poem again my November I guess my November guest okay you're as everything here today has to do with the fall\nIn some way or maybe in sometimes and maybe in a metaphorical way I mean I have to deal with the the season directly but anyway so we've had to Robert Ross porn or\nBy uh at this point and perhaps we'll have\nA third one before the few a few minutes are over so who's going next\nI'm Still OK I'm Kelly shorts yeah so ... and then and then and then we'll hear\nFrom a Kevin and um [noise] and I'll tell you his last name and the moment because I have a whole dissertation about his last\nName [laughter] I actually have two short one's a short while ago yeah good so one of my favorite poems is ah called often\nBy rayner Maria real America really okay I've never been to share how to sew nice name Reiner a writer Maria ... route you're a real real good yeah and\nSo this is often my so this will be a translation from Germany a translator man but this is this the same translation that I've seen in the past and\nAh\nThe leaves are falling falling as it from far out as his orchards were dying high in space each leaf falls is if it were motion and no and tonight the head of the earth is falling away from all of the stars and the loneliness we're all falling\nThe hand here is falling and look at the other one it's in the mall and yet there is someone whose hands infinitely calm holding up all this falling the autumn\n... by running or Maria ... ...\n... with us [laughter]\nAh for the other one I'm going to read is a bill Shakespeare so William Shakespeare sonnet Seventy three the time of year that I missed and maybe hold and I'm never heard anybody read this before so\nI'm In the home my naive interpretation of it is [laughter] measures up images of and millimeters [noise] um [noise] son at Seventy three that time of year the mast and maybe hold the time of year the means to me to hold\nWhen yellow leaves are none are few do hang upon those ... which shake against the cold\nBeer ruined acquires were late the bird sang\nIn me that the U.S the twilight of such day after as this through sunset fate is in the west\nWhich by and by black night do take away that second self that seals up all unrest in me though see is the glowing going up such fire that on the ashes of his youth dust lie\nAs the death bed where on it most expire consumed with that which was nourished by this style perceive us which makes I Love more strong\nTo love that well which dial must leave air long\n... son at Seventy three that time of year the mist and media hold\nYour and I've heard it ribbon I read it many times and uh so I still enjoy your your reading\nSo you know how do you see do ... is it does dust dust there\nWas an relatives in those but as a ... and ... was killed the shortage reading a Shakespeare sonnet or could you repeat the pardon my\nSon is Seventy three that time of year the mist in me\nOh yes and of course these titles were put on later by editors ... uh I mean there there are number I'm not sure even I think the numbers even were were introduced by editors to uh-huh yeah because I think you just had in fact I I don't I'm not sure if all the science work\nCollected uh in one place at the time of Shakespeare's death I think he did have a collection of but there were some that\nThat happened they weren't included in the election and then at some point some people some scholars decided they would just put them all there and they sort of decided ... given the stylistic variations among the poems and other things\nUm and some dates that were fairly certain they decide this must be the right order in which they were written but of course uh it's still disputed [noise] um and so now we come to Kevin Kevin uh 'cause he pronounces his name a lot of young\nIs that right or that is the American innovation okay I understand no I ... ah do you think of that I was going to pronounce the German way uh I wasn't thinking about that but I was thinking you know when I came to your name I thought you know the people here\nIn different degrees um because and I guess that's one reason why some people\nAre better at mimicking different accents than others why some people are better at learning to pronounce foreign languages um because their brains are may or may not make distinctions or you know they\nMay be if they work that they could learn to make the sanctions that other people find a to be easier to make\nUm of course he says a lot of young is that right\nThe time but that's OK

I mean approached by referendum and putting up locally based on this can solve a lot of funding solution [noise] eight our transportation more regional and that some of our\nAh um route distance there has to be resolved\nWe're speaking with Kathy Steiner of the Madison Sierra Club or about the new transportation report arrived together transportation access and equity in Wisconsin oh so it's very data driven the report or has some good overview information and then you delve into each of the the cities in areas of transportation\nAnd one of the interesting things as their stories throughout from interviews that you conducted\nHow much did those interviews disorder provide color and pull quotes to illustrate the data in or or did you learn things from talking to people that you didn't learn from the data\nUm a lot from the conversation is that we had with people and bending base there really on the house\nI just want to eat up in um we're impacting people in what ways and I'm a personal favorite\nAh example of mine or\nI should favorite butter most powerful example is the story that featured in Appleton where someone was good and have their life than taking away out so they couldn't drive\nBut the um meetings that they had to make or not uh located on a bus line\nQuote it's like a set up to fail um because if he misses it meetings he has to go back to play that have been these stories were hey from up north to not just understand the impact of our transportation system but also understand\nHow connected our transportation system is to\nRacism and the criminal justice system and [noise] um ... stories I'm In the owners in scope of this issue\n[noise] really so many areas of uh the common the public good who has been under attack as as we move towards more private position in the Walker administration\nReally a stick to a lot of their reputation early on in in maybe won that election partly by bashing the train and rejecting the train\nA project in ... losing many millions of dollars are doing that a ends by advocating for for cars and are riding around in cars and highways um what needs to change than it is a\nParadigm shift in this state to value of this kind of public good public transportation\nI think it's time for us to really reassess where our priorities are and transportation and his two young sons to own guns or adding lane highway and what's often\nMakes ... she was stunned to fix the problem that they say it's great effects on ads more cars the road I work for the our club so\nLucian concern on the equity\nCan sell 'em out of prioritizing even is one of those nice guy\nHighway projects and investing money into public transportation and enter repairing local roads and bridges to transform the system that we have um if you just prioritize them saying a lot of these problems you're dressed\n... are are there are moves to privatize a public transportation of course it doesn't you know there are challenges to making it highly profitable because a large portion of what public transportation needs to do as you pointed out as\nSort of people that don't have a lot of money who have um needs like you know for being able to travel or do they are disabled or need to be a travel with a wheelchair and such\nA ... so you know or their calls as there are for every other aspect of her life these days to privatize the system is a solution and if so what do you see is the role of a ... of a private business to help solve this\nProblem\nYeah I I'm having a huge amount of uh privatizing entirely public transportation system all because I think it's such a low priority for most people that it's not even consider a high a win transportation problem do come up\nUm a lot of especially in this city is that we featured on a lot of local leaders when it to or to last\nA our public private partnerships for business it's fun\nAnd took a bus routes or shuttles that they operate 'em I thought is in in all of those cases there is a there are barriers they are it's not good for people to get that the things they need a just a specific survey spoke one job or\nTo why care facility which is really inefficient and then we have a mortgage ...\n... ... ... no matter where we need to go\nAnd how they're going to be kept saying though I Am an access is shame um there are French uh\nLaws that impact people um who need much ...\nOr things like that are pending braid much to you great example of of not eating meat ADA requirements and and leaping out people to ...\n... so let's say in November which we're is almost upon us there is a major change in the government and attitudes about this\nWhat do you think you know what's your time line and let's say you you get a chance to show this report to the new people in power and suggest what should be done a right away what what are those things which what could come from this report and what would you want to see her upper\nFew solution set the record identifies are incapable specially the author or public transportation system\nI'm as well as across the alert terroristic Justin's about um\nIncreasing the Tennessee that I'm buses run\nOn increasing the hours not very many of our operation especially on in the evenings and weekends are a lot of systems that don't run past six pm on Saturday or Sunday on which really limit access around the state um\nOther solutions are making sure that I'm On a plan are are integrating a where development is happening so making sure that bosses are going to go where the new large\nA factory or job hop is going to be thinking I had to plan for these changes that we're seeing on our cities develop\nGrow up I can activity smelling especially to 'em suburbs or rural areas around cities were also solution a and then a lot of planning agencies\nHave all of us in a while but haven't been able to plant and so on implementing a plan that I'm planning bodies have spent years studying and creating I'm actually putting those into effect which would be a huge solution for public transportation\nSo many cities upgrade plans on the shelf which simply going to be implemented these all costs money\nTo me is that the regional transportation authority's that would could be formed that that ah if you're a doctor funding these new services are experiments are reasons\nWhy the regional transportation authorities or for an increase I ate a bang and I think there are a couple of different tasks to get there but one thing that it first started by regional cooperation and I think about issues a\nRegional transportation authority of the stock that's\nAll right well thank you so much it is the new study arrived together transportation actors and equity in Wisconsin you can target on wine and we've been speaking\nTo a draft the from the Sierra ... about ... and ... maybe give me your Web site where people compared to report\nIf you can download the correct dot org ... dot com crash ... together report\nThank you care if you start her from the Madison theoretical thank\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\nI mean they ...\nThey need to be there in ... in in each ... each ... each\n\n\n\n\nA new exhibition at the Madison museum of contemporary art consist of a work by the acclaimed Mexican artist Frida Kahlo called ... Patel you as the work is part of an international collaboration of over thirty museums working together to present to digital exhibition are free to ... work and wife\nThe project called faces of Frida is organized by Google arts and culture and promises a closer look at the many faces of Frida Kahlo through her life arch and legacy\nJoining the in the studio to talk about ... die as a exhibiting ... and the digital exhibition online is memorial curator a\nOf a I don't have the full title here it doesn't matter of the collection the collection yelled at your door selling the Internet you read the collection and a giant collection that lives mostly behind in rooms are behind walls and comes out on the walls and that you actually get around\nAnd now the Frida Kahlo painting is back up it comes and goes that's right I was visiting Milan I've never been to Milan but the painting has\nYeah the thinking just got back from a line so I was fortunate enough to travel with it in February so I got on this giant cargo plane me and the two pilots and free ... and a bunch of other unknown things I was worried there'd be like you know crates of chickens or maybe a lab tiger but we're okay\nAnd and flew from Chicago to him along with them\nIs that as sort of a security thing to make sure the painting is taking\nWriter yeah 'cause you just don't want to send it over there blindly it's good to have a person ...\nAm sometimes will contract to carry a courier but um this time I got to go and it was up as part of a large Frida Kahlo exhibition at their um contemporary art museum in Milan\nOkay now how does Google get involved in something like this putting on an art exhibition and kind of makes sense for Google because it's ... a lot of this um [noise] it's been so many different places so you may be in one place but the rest of your experience digitally for the most part\nYeah that's exactly right so Google has been really invested lately and sharing our two I'm with a wider audience\nSo for example um they decided to focus on Frida Kahlo and um they have a Google team in Mexico city that holds um and they were working with Diego were there as foundation that holds the rights to call those work\nAnd they decided to do this project and reach out to various museums across the world and curators across the world to write about their Calo paintings and sort of digitize then and Judy's close up like you can really see them in and get into brush strokes at this I'm On this platform\nAnd focus on um her work in her life and I'm Frida Kahlo as an artist and sort of shift away from just knowing Frida Kahlo for her you know\nFlowers in her had her hair and you know her unit brow and just get away from the physical features and focus on her as an artist because she was incredible\nYes you did you did paint a lot of a self portrait so did yes ah\nSo what did you find delving into this one painting so deeply let's not usually the exercise usually it's more about how do you connect disparate pieces how do you put them together contractually what are you putting extra walk right what you include what do you leave out but you're you're you're just like okay you got one billion or what what did you find things\nWhich was a great joy for me because that's what I'm In my previous job at the art Institute of Chicago that's what I got to do I got to spend weeks on one single piece of art and so when I came to an mocha we had this great Calo painting and I kept hearing\nAll these stories from people about what was in it and what it meant and different stories right or like how we got the painting like I heard oh yeah the donors went to Mexico City and bought it from Colorado\nAnd I was like I don't think so [laughter]\nSo um I really got to dive into what is called ... which is the collection history the ownership history of the peace and I love doing that because you get to be a detective to put up a good story it has a great story so it's not just oh yeah they bought it from ... in Mexico city and came back to Madison happily ever\nI was pretty good story a lot of water in an auction yeah I wouldn't be better than others you know what is it still\nI mean for me it's better the ideal obviously is to buy it from the artist 'cause you have authenticity right there\nBut um it started off with Andre brace on who is the father of surrealism so he came over from France and visited Frida Kahlo in Mexico city and he helped set up Kahlo for her first solo exhibition in New York City\nHer very first United States exhibition her very first solo exhibition as an artist like this is her making it and in that catalog he writes about the Thai is he talks about the ... fruit and the ... center and\nThen I go back to look at the history of when he was there he was there at the height of the tie a season he was there from a until October and the fact he wrote about that painting that painting was included in this exhibition\nI got documents from the Philadelphia museum of art work ... wrote the exhibition checklist and included are painting\nSo the journey starts with this great big name Andre ... father surrealism coming to visit Calo giving her first solo exhibition that exhibition travels over to Paris and during this time she is appearing on the cover of vogue people are fascinated with her as an artist and as a woman\nAnd then the painting comes back with her to Mexico City it remains unsold\nAnd distance when something fascinating happens so comes back with her to Mexico\nCity and she changes the skull there's a little tiny skeleton and the painting she changes the expression to a frown\nAnd we know that it was previously smiling\nBecause when it was being exhibited in Paris somebody took a photograph of it and we have the photograph and has two very bright Beatty I he's in a little smile\nAnd she changed it after the Patriot already been routed through after one would think it was finished yep well and she did that because\nWell the legend is according to the folks who\nProduced the catalog raised in a these are the scholars a steady Frida for like ten years\nThey suggest it's because during this time her husband and fellow artist Diego Rivera wanted a divorce he she got back from you know that her world travels being are real artist and\nYou know bringing 'em getting great success with her work she comes back Diego once a divorce and then Ga Ga leads to go to San Francisco to paint a mural so she's left alone with this news and her work and so she\nSo we don't know for sure that's why but that's a good there it's a good story [laughter] and we were just or [noise] okay so ... and then what did you find those you connected the dots connected this painting or to the other work in the Google arch project for our ... is very much international Roger\nI it's sort of surprised that unveiled itself and free to call us always up to something in her work she's very much focused on I cannot graffiti which is like in ... stories within the painting right so you have all these little clues and symbols that relate to her life\nAnd she always talked about how that's what she knows her life so that's what she paints and so as I you know do deeper into each section of the painting I notice for example that I started studying the fruit like how do you eat the fruit like how is it typically caught how do you you know open at how you eat it well\nI learned that you cut the end off and then you slice it down the middle and take off the skin and eat it for you\nCut it down the middle and your scoop out like a ... you read it that way so I signed the paintings she had one of them lying on the ground with the and cut off traditionally how you eat it right\nBut then there's one directly in the center cut in half and it sort of played open and maybe it's because I was a biology major but I was looking at it and it was like that looks like a dissect it sell\nLike you can see the spindle fibers which is when the chromosomes pull apart and go into two different cells you could see them stretched a cross between the two halves of the fruit\nFormerly in Wisconsin and so uh it's just been really really a devastating disease that than just fighting ever watch worried through North America\nIs this related to global warming you know climate change um\nPotentially um felt the fungus is definitely an invasive species on that came either based on genetics that came either from Europe or from Asia it was probably introduce spy on some sort of like on someone's shoe or somehow I brought over um\nIn some kind of contamination 'em up some kind of caving gear or something like that or they can certainly the climate change can definitely does after eight the effects of this where like these unpredictable shuts and whether or like how our last spring\nSort of got really warm and then there weren't really any bugs out on the skin definitely disrupt that hibernation and so it can kind of make things worse um on top of the effects that the disease house on the bats\nIs there anything is there any cure any way to address it\nOn there are scientists from all over the world that have come together from different backgrounds so people have tested being like a vaccine which is actually the tests or that you'd have the United states and uh people have tried anti fungal and ...\nAnd even a UV light treatment odd but so far there has been no real\nSilver bullet has helped us so people are trying to limit the spread and protect that while they're hibernating make sure that people aren't going in there and waking him up on but there is no there hasn't been a cure for it and so\nOn the bath or just sort of a continuing to be crying all across North America\nAll right well summer no ... and on but it does bring us to the end of the show and thank you so much Amy Ray uh from the department of forest in wildlife ecology at the amount of since she's a student there and joins us from about conference and pored over to Mexico a thanks that brings us to the individual costs rose\nOkay well thank you for having\nAnd happy that week oh it's bad

cities\nSo we have to change the conversation is not about well let's keep that little treaty I mean yes we should keep it but what's important to talk about getting rid of all the nuclear weapons [noise]\nThis is a twentieth century conversation about arms control will cut a little here we're ... we got to get rid of all of them [noise] and we've just been so\nLucky I mean like God is on our side because\nThere has been so many near misses and they're in now like twenty five hundred nuclear bombs on missiles in Russia and in America pointed at each other's major cities and we're just lucky that they never had an accident I mean they just made a movie the\nMan who save the world about colonel pet drive in the Russian silos that was watching his computers and they see something coming in and it looks like America's attacking and his job is to let go of all the missiles in New York Boston Washington and he didn't see disobey orders and it was a computer\nGlitch and he actually got in\nTrouble you know that he didn't follow proper procedures and then about four years ago we had a plane missing from in North Dakota where we keep our nuclear uh armed missiles a plane carrying six of them loaded with nuclear bombs\nWas missing they didn't even know where it was and they it would went to we see anti by mistake and\nThey found is thirty six hours later I mean we're just lucky I don't think anybody is going to make a decision no even that somebody is nuts trying that we're going to bomb a scam or\nThat Moscow say we're going to bomb New York\nIt's going to be an accident you know I mean they know like if we knew that we know that if we bomb Russia they're going to let all their weapons back at us I mean there's just no way that we can use them\nThat way so why spend any money on new ones or oh they're talking about small and nuclear weapons as a bill in Congress right now to build small and nuclear weapons and see if this isn't Trump this is everybody I mean the Democrats or Republicans\nThere are very few that stand up\nIt in a small a nuclear weapon it's as big as the bomb that killed ... that we dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki\nBecause since that time that became the trick it for the hydrogen bomb which is much much more powerful\nSo yeah so I\nI I really appreciate everything that you are present to you and I'm I very much agree with you that what we need to do is a polish nuclear weapons however I think um even you would have to um\nAgree that this isn't going to happen anytime soon and um again that specific treaties the mole as it is and a old thinking\nAs each eve I'm Still the the announcement the un let alone the action of walking away from me\nI think gives a very strong signal or both to the United states and Russia um to everybody else on of course that happens very shortly after John Bolton\nBecame a ... um national security adviser\nJohn Bolton has been um compared to Dr strangelove\nUm before that and so again you know I'm I I Would like to ask you about the\nSymbolism of doing it right now and what it signifies for\nOnly the whole world 'cause I I have been through and I I Want to or maybe talk later about the whole ... thing I was um in stuff always really involved in that\nBut um I Know that at the time there was I mean real huge for you about the possibility of a no real war and I can say that in the years in more recent years [noise]\nUm the the field hasn't been that\nUm you know there hasn't been a great few you're right the an accident could have happened in the ... the housing yes I suppose really but I'm also\nThough was um in ... oh I think global determination not to use nuclear weapons and and I'm not sure that we the this is how it is any more so if you can talk to the alleys\nCertainly well you know when we had the Soviet Union there was such a a dichotomy of power\nAnd after the wall fell and garbage chef let go of all of Eastern Europe I mean it was like a miracle right I mean that America became the sole superpower so people felt that there wasn't that kind of confrontation and the nuclear thing sort of fell\nAway but we saw I mean I saw\nClint we worked so first or Russia was the first to stop the nuclear testing the Soviet Union and comics on they had this huge\nMarch with the ... enough and the cars that people within the Soviets with testing in semi politicians were so\nUpset with the cancer and the birth defects and the radiation than they actually got Gorbachev to stop nuclear test\nActually Kennedy tried to stop the tests in the sixties and they wouldn't they only let him stop atmospheric testing where we were blowing up in the air you know in the\nMarshall Islands and the French Polynesia but\nThen it went underground and we did another thousand more on the west and showing the holy land in Nevada you know where they were there was sensing and radiation in the water with getting poisoned so anyway Russia stopped\nAnd then I was part of his lawyers alliance the nuclear arms control\nWent to Congress and we said look Russia stop we should stop they said oh you can trust the Russians so this very\nClever man who had to organize the lawyers and he was\nPresident in New York City bar association builds a win raised like six million dollars hired a whole team a seismologist so we went to the Soviet Union and they said yes\nWill allow you are a seismologist\nTo study and verify all around the test site so that we would know\nWhether they were telling the truth that they had stopped and then we went back to Congress and we said you don't have to trust the Russians we got verification and you know we'll we'll know though we were able to stop it here\nBut that Clinton comes along science test bad and make this deal with the weapons lives six billion dollars worth of\nLaboratory testing sub critical they were still blowing stuff up in Nevada but it didn't have a chain reaction so Clinton said it's not a test you know like you didn't inhale and he didn't have sex and he was\nSo\nYou know and then of course whatever we did Russia followed I must say you know but I always felt like we were the first round Russia and China right\nNow has been table in the treaty and the committee on disarm them and to keep weapons out of space and you need consensus that this particular un body to have a discussion and the U.S votes against it we won't even discuss a treaty to keep weapons out of space\nAnd after Obama boasted about the Stuxnet virus with us and and Israel Bonds and rainy and enrichment facility not bomb but did a computer attack so that they couldn't enrich the uranium\nPotent proposed to Obama that the U.S and the Russians negotiate a cyber war ban treaty which we have to do with so vulnerable to cyber attacks on our infrastructure\nPower plants in return them then so this is what Americans have to know that's why this small treaty that he's walking out or it's terrible that he's walking out of it but the answer is not to keep that treaty\nThey knew they were hiding in a cave in Afghanistan and instead of sending in special forces to arrest the guys and put them on trial like we did with newer and bird we bombed Afghanistan then we bomb Iraq we created so many terrorists in this I mean we just made it so much\nWorse for ourselves you know so ... so anyway\nWhen they were doing code orange and code red\nAnd code yellow after nine one one like the level of danger you know code orange and yellow or red says women came along said we're coat paying for peace to start this new conversation that's how they got their name and I thought that was great\nUh-huh yeah well speaking of Iraq and Afghanistan um we we've been saying I'm a ... a nuclear weapons of ... news than a nuclear weapons to saying we bemoan but depleted uranium is being\nUsed extensively including in these two countries would you like to talk about that\nI actually wrote a chapter in the book uh that Ramsey clock was a former attorney general and her um Johnson he put out this book is called natural of to sign it after the first Gulf War I mean it's absolutely\nAwful that we are using these weapons not only are we polluting this depleted uranium is radioactive it causes these patients you know the answer and birth defects\nBut not only on the enemy our own veterans coming home with it and having children with mutations\n'cause they're they're ah this this ... is is affected by the radiation I mean it's just like\nSo that it how we are doing this and we're really wearing a great moment right now I mean as horrible as Trump is everybody's awake because a lot of this was happening under Clinton under Obama Obama\nBelieve that the New York times had a front page story that he met every Tuesday with the head of the CIA and the and that's saying one of the intelligence\nAnd they picked out targets the drones right then they told this kid sitting in Chicago and Colorado at his joystick who'd kill on the ground you\nKnow a witness no evidence no trial that's just the constitution\nYou know all the law scholar and then when they finally got up on a solid bin Laden\nThey killed him and threw them overboard and posted about it I mean why don't we bring them back and put them on trial like they did with the nineties I mean it's like so undemocratic and an American the way this country has been behaving compared to our ideals but I think\nThere's a lot of truth telling now it's soda it started with the uh the Confederate statues and now we got the me too with the women\nAnd they're even now taking down Columbus Day around the country 'cause he was a terrible thing store engines people you know we made him a hero and ah [noise]\nI think you know Trump is making us look at things again and ah we have to start telling the truth about what's going on I think that's going to make a big change\nMhm six so we did it and if we take the Congress back in November otherwise I think we're in terrible trouble if there is no check on him\nYou know six or eight to five six two thousand and one if you want to join the conversation or more to talk on Twitter\nA probably a fair ... on on um Facebook um you know it's interesting I'm Talking to our listeners um some guy whom\nMichigan I think some other stations or to um plays a public affair um road to own the\nWar um Facebook page the um he loves it probably can fool made him think a lot of them so he started listening to war on line and um well he tell really interesting and you can read it on line but one thing he says these are the only thing that\nI'm disturbed\nSeem about a public affairs are hardly anyone calls on I Will add when people call it's usually those regular colors and he's I'm relieved\nStrange the I'm a sink keen\nOn politically active audience um just doesn't have anything to say anything to us so\nI'm encouraging you to call about this really important issue a nuclear weapons um you know world than their renewed fear\nAround them six so eight to five six two thousand and one I mean let's talk about the costs um\nWhat is the cost over um and I I Know times can you foods I Do a number but I'm the cost of having\nAll these nuclear weapons in this country and then the other countries or what could have been achieved blue this money if I'm that wasn't a priority for the American government\nAnd uh the cost of if possible new nuclear arms race\nWell you know I mean our infrastructure is crumbling I live in New York City subways are working I mean that was like the pride\nOf New York they're just not investing money in schools and infrastructure and teachers are schools cherry ratings so teachers are buying you know their own supplies and they're certainly not paid as well as the doctors or lawyers\nKnow what's interesting about\nThe education system because I was a teacher in Nineteen fifty eight you know and I got out of college and I was earning\nThree thousand dollars a year and my my husband at the time it got out of college was making like ten times so to all the teachers are women because that's what women did for women's lib\nYou had to be a teacher you know or a nurse now if you went to college and now I I had gone back to law school when I was in my mid forties after my children were grown and half the class was women\nAnd the same for medical school you're not getting the quality of\nTeachers 'cause we're still paying them less I think those teaches strikes in the west Virginia where wherever they were striking I mean now it's great that the the labor movement is coming back to life it all got killed off with the\nReagan started it and Clinton just did it more and Obama did it more even when he tried to rescue the country after that terrible crash in two thousand uh he rescued the banks in rescue the the mortgage owners the homeowners you know\nThey were like if he had the whole long economic team there's like a nail liberal agenda I remember I march in Seattle against NAFTA when Clinton was doing it they were all these labor unions and environmentalist and it was absolutely true although\nThe jobs went to China they were paying them three dollars an hour\nAre guys that were making good money and industry you know we're all out of work that became a rust belt and that's what\nTrump walked into you know they were so upset with both parts of the the political spectrum the Democrats to wear what they used to be you know when Roosevelt was president taking care of people\nMhm [noise] so I'm Talking about um the nuclear weapons the United states and NATO\nI'm have surrounding Russia and uh the nuclear weapons but Russia has um who\nIs in danger easy um United States um who um is likely to get paid you um something actually happens\nYou know that's what I'm trying to say we're all in danger I doubt that pool would say I'm going to attack America or even a nut job like Trump would say I'm going to attack Russia because we know\nBut what's waiting for us but the fact that they're spread around I mean India and Pakistan have you know bitterness between them and they have a couple of all they would take us a hundred nuclear weapons to like create global winter and you know and have\nSuch climatic changes in the earth you know like nuclear winter where crops wouldn't grow for seven years you'd only need a hundred weapons I mean to India and Pakistan could set it off\nBut it's not I I really feel that there's nobody is that crazy that they've been deliberately set off a nuclear weapon it's the accidents we have to worry about it and that gives us some a masters\nGather with Gorbachev show and there was so much hope I remember at the time that things were really going to change and you know they change some but um as you've been talking about the entire hour um they\nHaven't changed enough on things now my to uh get worse so I'm going to give you the last couple of minutes to um tell our listeners\nWell they can do to um try and alleviate and eliminate the terrible threat\nOf nuclear weapons nuclear will and really also just you know so called peaceful nukes [noise]\nWell I I I appreciate you are obviously you're from Russia and\nI I'm no I'm not actually him all the way or another nuclear country I'm from Israel\nOh Israel or ... or so anyway that's the one that doesn't admit it but\nI think he does the ... yeah I think he does it mean and yeah\nBut you know garbage half was saying he has an op ed in the times\nToday or yesterday right about what a mistake this is to help to walk out of this\nTreaty that he worked out with a\nWith a ... you know so um I don't know I just think that\nWe have to look at this as an opportunity I even look at Trump is an opportunity like even a broken clock is right twice a day yeah and maybe he's Boston this stuff up and he got this hiring John Bolton because nobody you know\nNobody is letting him do anything good on terms as disarming because\nHe's fine you only thirty seconds alleys\nOh sorry you know what we can do joined a check out\nWWW world beyond ward dot org you can work for the end the war on the planets very twentieth century war and I can W. dot org is working on the ban treaty\nAnd coat paint is working on military did that's in in America nuclear and the rest\nYou have any way that you can

aren't working but I don't need them hey you got here my phone rang\nVoting for federal and state representative takes place on November sex and number of laws passed in recent years changed the way citizens can vote in Wisconsin one key component of those changes as a photo ID requirement put into effect and twenty Fifteen\nValid photo ID is for voting include Wisconsin driver's license even if it's expired revoked or suspended\nOr Wisconsin state issued id and military ID or us passport of full list of valid IDs can be found by checking out the Wisconsin election commission's Web page a photo ID for voting does not need to have your Karen Karen address\nLabor radio spoke with angry rose\nCo chair of the bank county voter id coalition rose was appointed by the league of women voters to co chair of the coalition was honesty andme off from the N. double ACP of ... county the group works to help eligible voters vote\nThey began that work focus on voter IDs and now I'm working on voter registration\nRoss pointed out that problems with id deter people from voting and the last election\nWe found out in the last election that some people didn't go to the polls because they thought they didn't have the right id and they did take what you do that with you if you have questions before you go and you want to talk to somebody you can call this hotline number\nSix or eight to eight five to one for one if it turns out you don't have the right id vote any way you can vote professionally if you get proof of your ID\nTo Madison public library if you live in the city of Madison or to your clerk your vote will be counted you have to get to prove to them by four o'clock on the Friday after the election\nIn order to obtain an id you\nYou do have documents showing your name both stay identity Wisconsin residency US citizenship and Social Security number due to a court order Wisconsin must provide assistance and obtaining those documents\nRight now because of a court order you can petition the state to check on the existence of these documents for you and they will do that an issue you an ID so I encourage people to go get Wisconsin id who need one now\nWhen the state is required to assist you in searching for these documents that might not otherwise be available to you will also say that are that the state do this just by virtue of a court decision and that decision has been appealed\nRowse says that most election officials will help your vote and you can cast a provisional ballot if you find you out without the proper ID\nYou should go to the polls even if you're not sure if you have the right id because\nElection officials will try to help the person vote if it turns out you actually don't have a valid id and you're there on election day you can vote provisional way and that means you have until the Friday after the election to get proof of your ID\nTo the clerk's office and you can do that by taking a picture of your ID and emailing it to the clerk's office for I didn't take a copy of that id if you live in Madison into any public library of medicine and they will take a picture of it and forward it to the clerk's office\nAnd now the issues that comes up when voting is that the election official cannot find your name in the voting register roast gives advice on handling that situation\nIf you have voted there before and your name is missing from the with the first thing you should\nAsk the election officials to do is to call the clerk because they sometimes can see names that were not printed on the ... if the clerk can't find your name then you're going to have to re register you can do that on election day take some proof of where\nLive so you want your current address assuming you've lived there for more than ten days and your name on some document then I Can't just be any letter a government document or a bank statement or utilities statement or your lease and then of course you must also bring your ID so that you know\nWe'll\nSee how voting or getting ideas as how I vote id hotline\n... called the voter id hotline which was one of the things that we do the number is six or eight to eight five to one for one no matter where you are in the state we'll put you in touch with somebody who can answer your questions or drive you to the DMV or whatever is required to help you get a voter id\nAgain that number is six oh eight to five to run for one that was in the right rose co chair of ... county voter ID card listen\nTo you and then next week when we're also discussing number off the voter suppression techniques being used around the state to influence the election outcomes if you're interested in voting check your local city or town clerk's office to find out time and place to vote\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're a long time follower of labor radio you may have noticed our show in something like this\n\nSpecial thanks to me are the reader coordinator and to all our readers
