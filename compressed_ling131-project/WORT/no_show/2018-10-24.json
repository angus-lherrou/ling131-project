really looking forward to seeing\nOh wonderful you know it's been a while I haven't been over towards the soap\nOpera house since I did the central plank tour with ... killers\nOr yeah well let's get one more question out all the way before we told you about you and you're a cowboy work or what's become the Charlie Hough chocolate drugs as a goose do exist or is it in just sort of moral by\n[laughter] that's funny enough is that's the that's the million dollar question everybody asks me but I have no answer truly\nUm you know the the group was getting ready to shift gears into some other directions and especially around two thousand Thirteen and ah I just don't know what happened to the group I left him twenty fourteen and it was kind of like when you think of the story of\nLike ... we were doing what\nI originally thought we were doing it but no crime is with the group so I kind of ...\nAnd in and told me she would keep the kind of going in the group this experience for me so I\nI just don't know you can ask\nAbout that they are that's out of my dearest diction [laughter]\nOh you're you're from the ... oh you're from the west originally aren't you\nKnow yeah I'm a I'm originally from Phoenix, Arizona born and raised and I have also have roots in Flagstaff, Arizona in the northern part of Arizona that's where my father's family strong\nGrowing up there did were you in the cowboy culture that time or have you gotten ... yeah\nOh definitely I you know I never played a lot of cowboy music\nNecessarily when I started playing but you know an Arizona you can't get away from cowboy culture on south Phoenix is is where you have a\nTombstone where the famous gunfight OK Corral and yeah and then you just have just about every every type of\nOutlaw long man and then many of the Native American cheese and tribes they were all around Arizona also a Marty Robin Arizona is gunfighter valid trails songs out I was always a big influence and\nStill it's still a lot of people raising cattle out there to this is still it's still a big cowboy kingdom in a kennel kingdom\nYeah it's just it's just part of the culture in terms of exposure I've always been exposed to\nTo you know every aspect of cowboy culture is it just kind of like a and oh I don't know like a stone you know there's a very\nBig or a European population and there's a culture that just completely ingrained within the the town into it's kind of the same way in Arizona but the western cowboy\nOr the real or imagined stuff you know so many good combination of the the real cowboys and kind of the images of cowboys too\nMany many years ago I I was teaching at what is now Texas State University in Denmark and it was south west Texas at the time\nAnd I was just so that it is getting getting ... really interested in African American history\nAnd a book came out and I believe the all the writer's name was ... or something like that and it was called the black cowboys\nAnd Indians sounded me he said that they were something like according to his race or something like five thousand black cowboys who participated in the long drive and other aspects and cattle king\nAnd I don't think anybody ever imagined that until that that research came along and\nAbsolutely and that was what really got me on the trail too\nTo um to start this project was I came across that very same book when I was going to visit family in Arizona one year maybe about ten years ago and\nWhen I came across that book or you have the ... the cowboys show I was there I was really blown away to find out that\nSomething that kind of took for granted which is being an African American person out west ... I knew that was sort of a unique community but to be able to find the history that opens the conversation and to a far bigger world of American history and culture\nI thought that was intriguing and of itself yeah and then after that slowly it's deadly I came across an album called black chickens\nWhich was a CD I'm John and Allen Lomax is a field recordings most black cowboys and some of the the inmates in the ... the prison and sugar land that they recorded for library of Congress singing cowboy songs and then all of a sudden this history started to take\nA audio\nUh aspect to it that I just knew was indispensable since the bigger picture and so from there I just started collecting songs and picking up stories and and now\nI think we see the help of the national museum of African American history and culture Smithsonian Folkways my vision of this album has has come to fruition\nAnd do you know the the image of cowboys always was this this image of a pills skin blue and white guy probably Europeans extraction\nAnd if an African American never showed up big was the problem as a as a comic character maybe it was the cook or something like that but but but African Americans they they did well everything that they were called them they did every aspect of the long drive and those are kind of business\nAbsolutely what when you start really thinking about it in ... terms especially in the era of Atlanta\nPatients leading into the era of reconstruction you start finding that it's actually a very logical history\nAnd when you have you had the old plantation system um evolving into something completely different and especially when it comes to African American culture\nAnd many of the folks that were in the south and I didn't want to do the sharecroppers that was the work of their uh their forefathers essentially slavery or that they just moved out west and\nTried their hand it anything and cowboy work happened to be one of these natural extensions of this movement because many of the folks that went out they were used to working with cattle\nWere also in ... condition\nAnd physical physical shape to be able to handle that sort of work so many of these cowboys they became like the best cowboys\nAnybody had ever seen and of course even though it's not in the forefront of the story once you hear it all of a sudden you say of course of course they had like cowboys out west the we're working alongside the Mexican ... candles\nAnd the Native American cowboys along with the Anglos to uh you know to create this sort of interesting hodgepodge drill ... experience yeah\nWell exactly just 'cause it's a working class environment little everybody has to get there there's not enough as you around to to have a true despair motion like you would see in the east coast people by necessity listen to the other than that create a very good old show\nAnd were there a black or ... or I'm thrilled bosses people next actually ran the operations too so we're the we're the president every aspect of the\nI think it's a very good [laughter] oh was that Fred Fred Frank James yeah after Enron was after his\nBrother Jessie was was killed but they you know these guys like\nStill an era in which the mass media is brand new and you find this really interesting juxtaposition of what's real not reveal them and worse than she was ... it goes back and forth and you know but of course on the black cowboys out my tried to tried to\nShow the African American story of one and I wrote one\nSong referencing um the great ... her Jeffries was boom the one African American ... to make records in the records and films in the forties\nAnd I were which some of them a little bit about him which don't use it the jet song is oh the song is one dollar bill okay so ...\nYeah so I made like a kind of a new home and take action packed some about his when talking a little bit about bill ... who is the first African American cowboys it'd be a star on the\nGround it uh\nWell let's talk some about your your your tours the before we let you get back on the road a year playing here in ... no not here but down the road and stone tomorrow night\nAnd a year playing in Minneapolis or tonight is it to do that\nAnd then yeah I'll be playing [noise] that's right\n... how much do you make sense to have an issue you're doing altogether and you're\nWell you know I keep making sure most of the years so if people go on to my website the Americans ... and all the two on dates and I got this round them dates have about a week off and then I'll have another day throughout the world to Texas there's a part of a\nA cowboy gathering out there also go down to Florida\nAnd then I'll be making my way\nAnd into the north east toward the end of the year but ... yeah I keep about a week ahead on when it comes to having the gigs right ahead\nDo you play by yeah as you have a band you do you play by yourself or your do you have a banner he is just you\nWell you know I I'm I'm kind of done a little bit of both over the past several years coming up this time around on the plane so low for the most part and when I Do the show\nI'll be focusing on the cowboy material of course but also be showing different aspects of the music I've collected in my whole career so how old time string band as songs have harmonica numbers I'll be playing\nSeveral unique instruments including the rhythm bones and the coils which are a ... type\n... and so I'll just be I'll do it nice overview of of all the different types of American music that have been created over the years so it's a very diverse show you know\nI guess Mike Seeger was probably a big influence in your uh your your versatility there 'cause he he he could do everything played a\nYeah without a doubt I'm Mike Seeger was all new also introduce more the\nDo you hope so you know with the old time folk music it's always the hope that you can just find one more link on the chain of of folk music tradition and when I met my key\nYou know he kind of a\nYou know shook my hand and said All right young man please take it for a ticket take it to the next place and and I'm Glad to do that with anybody who has the interest in the music and and it's a it's a it's a great joy you know I haven't heard as a fan of the music it's great to be able to feed the music that's that means for so long\nWell if you're good
