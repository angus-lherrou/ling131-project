I. T. staff member responsible for organizing I pledge drive with the help of hundreds of amazing volunteers and dedicated staff I recently completed fall pledge drive ran like he's saying all the famous making sprinter\nThank you to every one of you who gave your time and energy to make our phone Dr ... there was an R A festive positive energy around the station during the drive and that was all you\nCome from yeah uh [laughter] it's a great question so\nI'm there does seem to be this long standing association um at least at least in the early modern period on\nI'm associating the direction that cardinal direction the north with the forces of evil and uh with the you know with bad forces where that comes from I honestly don't know I'm not I'm not sure that anybody knows\nUm but uh on the island of gold Lyndon and Sweden for instance island in the middle of the Baltic Sea\nI'm also churches there are medieval are a lot of them um there are essentially no graves on the northern sides of the church and the story that I've been told about that is\nUm that on judgment day\nI'm also you know good Christians would would rise from I'm from the earth and in a sense to have in um the churches are no longer be needed so they would topple over and they would\nFall to the north which means that anybody who is buried on the north side of the church couldn't get up and so you'd only very bad people I'm On the north side of the church he buried anyone there at all\n[noise] [noise] so um do we talk real quickly sort of about modern day which is er ... and there's lots of people who are you know a call themselves which is they practice or a religion but cold wiccan\nUm is that there is there a direct connection between that and what we're talking about in terms of witchcraft and in these folklore and these which trials\nI Would say no I'm historically speaking no um there's certainly no historical evidence that um people who were uh tried or executed for witchcraft in the early modern period practiced a different religion um practice some earlier form of of Wicca\nUm however to the best of my knowledge I Do think that modern we can see 'em recognize some of their own um practices in the past um and that's I'm\nNot a historical um linkage but certainly can be a spiritual one\nAnd and what kinds of people were accused of being which is a during these these which trials period\nSo again it depends and but\nGenerally speaking um as I said mostly women I'm not all um they tend to actually to not be the very poorest of the poor which I think is a stereotype that that we tend to have\n'em instead they were a little bit better off than average um in general\nAnd some of that has to do I'm probably with the fact that so much of a witchcraft belief accusation legend has to do with somebody who has more than she should um so the people who tend to be a Q as we're just a little bit ahead of of their neighbors were\nThere a ... was their mental illness involved I mean people are behaving in strange ways or things like that\nI'm sure sometimes um there was but um [noise]\nBut it was really just someone who had a little bit more than everybody else seemed to be the yeah\nBut and you know just just being sort of had economically or socially wasn't going to do it by itself and there had to be some other factors involved one of which was having a reputation reputation was huge in the early modern period um you\nIf you were accused of being a which um and you could gather some of your neighbors friends relatives around you and they could all testify to your good character and you're you know good practice of Christianity and so forth chances are you are going to get off pretty easily or completely\nUm if you had a reputation as a scold as I'm the kind of person who you know did annoying things that are neighbors that sort of thing then ah you were in big trouble\n[noise] now you've written that you want people to stop using the word ... if a as a justice simply of steroid with no factual basis in in what way do you think of the word myth\nSo when folklore is use the word mess we mean something pretty specific we mean a\nStory that is not necessarily factual but that is true in some profound sense a that typically involves God's or heroes um that is set in a remote passed 'em\nOr a sort of non timeframe if you will um so you know there was um a number of years ago I'm from New York City um and a number of years ago there was a bulletin\nUm excuse me billboard on a one of the highways into the city and around Christmas Time that and\nI had been paid for by an atheist group and it had a a sort of silhouette of the need to be um seen um [noise]\nAnd ah the slogan on it was you know it's a mess and I thought of course it's I'm [laughter]\nI'm it's that's exactly what a myth is you know but um the usage of that word in the colloquial sense to me and something that is commonly believed but untrue um\nNot helpful [laughter] I'm for people who study what I Would call true myth\nWell gene so what makes it a myth true [noise]\nIt can be profound ... I'm In an allegorical sense it can be true I'm right it can speak to fundamentals of human behavior at the society in which it's operating um cultural norms 'em and desire is um\nAnd to that extent it bleeds into some of the other forms of folk narrative that um that folklore a steady um but it's\nUm\nIt's a legend for instance which is what I focus on 'em it's told as if it's factual right a myth generally is and sometimes it is um but something can be um meaningful and profound without being factual\n[noise] so are there are equivalent to the sort of witchcraft legends or witchcraft or does it sounds to me what witchcraft as more of a legend in your terminology as are the odds are their equivalent to the kinds of witchcraft legends that we're being told in the sixteen hundreds that we're hearing today [noise]\nAbsolutely uh you've probably heard the term urban legend or an urban myth [laughter] um another misnomer in my opinion um [noise] but those are essentially exactly the same type of narrative type of story um so\nUm well this is an old one but you've probably heard of crocodiles and the sewers right that that sort of thing is is I'm a certainly in the same sort of broad genre of legend I'm\nTomorrow's Halloween some people will probably check their kids candy before letting them eat it um in case there are needles or razor blades are in the in the candy or if they if it's been tampered with boys and\nUm that is strongly connected to um earlier legends of of witchcraft\nAnd why do we keep generating these kinds of legends why are they so important teasing\nI think I think that legends\nLess uh give us a space to\nDiscuss anxieties that are commonly that are sort of shared but not necessarily parents on the surface a\nSo one theory of of legends is is is that it it um expresses anxiety is that otherwise are difficult to express 'em\nAnd having it in a sort of narrative form lets us communicate about those anxieties are in a way that's that's productive for this society uh although not necessarily on harmful obviously in the\nAir today for which trial and certainly we're not on harmful\nIs absolutely a yeah legends and this is another thing that I um that I helped to convey tomorrow in that I Try to bring up whenever I discuss folklore with um with folks is that folklore it's one of the deadliest\nThings that there isn't human society um it is a\nOften lie groups of people kill other groups of people not always of course but that is\nI'm a\nIt is one of the reasons why people do think they know certain things about other types of people\n[noise] All right we've been speaking with amber rose she's folklore PHD candidate in the University of Wisconsin department of German Nordic and Slovic languages that you so much for joining us an eight o'clock bus thank you will be back with some announcements or whether in song the week coming up right after this\nW O R G thanks with listeners sponsors and budget bicycles setters used bicycle showroom located at nine thirty region street used bicycle showroom offers vintage bicycles from ... in Raleigh improved show as well as refurbish bicycles for people of all abilities including one speed cruisers three feet up rights\nAnd bicycles built for two to five one one six six three Mm\nMm\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n... and it will add some more common space in the basement when taking down walls um and just improving the infrastructure overall so we'll have\nA much better Internet access and I'm just a more open floor plans so you can see you can really see the space and really um facilitate sort of more engagements between between organizations\nMe much funnier 'em and brighter and just the more the more active space we had a vacancy for a while I'm as we've so uh the uh former um for the Senate\nDuring homelessness storage which unfortunately that service doesn't exist anymore I'm getting replaced in different ways um at that they've been gone for a while um and that was one of the reasons that that was one of the non public uses that that that friend that that do they let us at least a\nCurrently blocked off and just storing didn't um W. while you used to be there they haven't been there for several years before that they had converted one of the rooms to a studio with green rooms so I'm very you know where the green screen so all those different uses a don't tend to lend themselves to roll over and say\nI'm a kid to a big public sort of a off as the space\nSo what has happened so far as we renovated the first half of the first floor and tenant resource center moved across the hall into a much bigger case\nSo tenant resource center has really grown and expanded and they really needed space to accommodate that and so they have a beautiful face now with the new floors and feelings and and I moved in and then the states that they occupied and other parts of the building um are now underway\nSo one of the sort of ... things about the current uh outdoor space of the social justice centers there has been an impromptu memorial to Tony Robbins and set up on the Williamson street is one of the William street engines is well that'd be maintained and what how will that change\nIn the ... the move then made permanence and I'm a hunting around in the family and friends are working on that and she\nSupport for a permanent location I'd never been looking toward that for a long time so that was the end you know this was a temporary memorial but they've also created some really beautiful\nArtwork um some some local artists including the people you've worked out in the Tony Robbins said memorial and others have made his artwork on the back of the building commemorating the\nEasily um unfortunately high number of people who've been shot by police in the neighborhood and that if you go check out the back of the Senate or the beautiful\nAnd um and they just attitude when was the added some um portraits in granite as the people who've week last year\nAnd um so that's that's one aspect of that a memorial and and then that creating another twenty ... twenty you're having a memorial and hadn't settled on a permanent location yet\nNow the the board that use or managers the physical space of the social justice center what connection goes the social justice center organization have with the tenant organizations that reside there or is there a connection between them or you pretty much separate entities\nSo that's what I was started in a few thousand as an experiment in\nUm in collaboration and cooperation fair and it was a the social justice center itself has a nonprofit that was set up so that first and\nSo the anchor attendance would share ownership as the building\nSo it with a you know it was a model or um you know trying out something that's not try the office and has always been intended to um experiment with that it's met with that kind of shared ownership um\nThe tenant leaves referring to is the main original anchor attendance and there's a lot to um work out about what what\nMight be considered for the social justice and it's been hot for us I think since the beginning as because we're going to find out about whether that shouldn't be a cooperative at some point but um\nIt's it's all a Nick fan and and you come in and and collaboration and that's something that we're open you I'm In the future is taking a further sales and yeah so that nonprofits as the collaboration at that time and to own age and then um\nWill be working through like how we bring in at ... at least structure and you've gotten ourselves to to be able to do more together\nSo or in your well you don't necessarily have a ... any deep insight into the inner workings of for example some of the board of the tenant resource center and\nNo okay I wouldn't say I do\nAll right and um so what will the new space in a while the social justice center to do that it can't do now\nWell it'll allow us to end by the public in a lot more um to have any of us that drop off and on\nAnd that is the author for a day to host a workshop for that too and ... and engage in my community projects I'm\nDebating tiny tiny ... is one of the court partners in the new face for the new faces the mutual aid workspace and and the\nSpirit of that space with his highlights I and that's my role and governing governing I'm\nOn the commercials that's the center bored if I met prevent and then he laid workspace and right now which way it works days court members are dating tiny tiny baby and six parts are collected um and a common common good bookkeeping cooperative\nAnd Madison encourage that Wisconsin empathy killed and that so we\nTend to host a lot of different projects to people who came and he said we're in the Gardening Guide to participate and gardening project and people can try and eat what thoughts are available for them and they can and offered to take it on and then finally Tyler it's ...\nAnd to get services for other people out in the states are more readily it should just be more of a hub\nWhere you can come in and engage and the and and find out how you could fit into a project that might you know how you use your own skills and talent and we also play on ... ... who didn't want to sort of informal apprenticeship\nAnd hadn't been tied to see if we come and learn how to use some kind of software a crime and learn how to do some sort of like computer programming or and help us out on projects that involve sunlight kept carpentry which we will have some that statue um\nTo be working on our space it out to do anything and a little bit of light carpentry work [noise]\nSo are you going to be making improvements for

G. forward slash weather and the graphic up at the top as that goes sixteen water vapor image of North America for the past twenty four hours you got a computer handy might have a look at that I'll mentioned some stuff on there briefly\nA it's a fairly uneventful weaken the whole coming up at least south through about Thursday or so so if you are sending their kids out to the street on Wednesday evening things and working reasonably hospitable I'm checking dry almost certainly in my temperatures in them\nLow fifties or sell it says about where you expecting this time of year on a an evening or you wouldn't necessarily get the\nThe question of a a common ... event full week coming up if you look at the twenty four hour water vapor image of North America and the W. or to other Web page which I was just mentioning\nA if you're able to pull it up you can see yesterday's quite energetic middle and upper level low come swirling through the area a very quickly on its way it's actually a way out over Cape Cod currently gives you an idea of just how fast that system was moving\nAnd it's brisk pace west to east across here friday night and Sunday friday night Saturday Night and Sunday over the weekend\nWas the reason that the strong winds associated with the surface circulation was that storm came up quite quickly departed almost as quickly\nWaiter yesterday afternoon in fact the winds came up and went down a couple of times ah first ah from the south west and west or early in the day yesterday that warned us to the days high temperature of forty nine around the seven o'clock yesterday morning\nThen the uh wins dropped off for a couple of hours under the central low pressure is that breeze the bias and then ratcheted up again quickly\nOut from the northwest behind the whole frontal passage which came through about ten o'clock in the morning and then after that the surface pressures were bounding up words if you happen to have a barometer you saw the rise of a couple of middle of hours per hour\nWhich pushed the wind speeds up north of thirty miles per hour at times during the mid day an afternoon hours yesterday\nThe rapid pace of systems west to east or will continue through tomorrow then slowed down a bit as we get towards the end of the week for reasons on my mentioned shortly\nNo water vapor image the primary energy of the jet stream is directed pretty much across the northern half of the country\nAnd generally speaking west to east there's a couple of major waves clearly carved out in the path of the jet stream one well out to our west with its trauma centered about over a southeastern Oregon and then another off to the east with a trough trough over about the Atlantic seaboard and\nIt's that trough within which that little storm that came through here yesterday is currently swirling up around the Massachusetts\nUh between the two ... and up\nRage with its apex over about lake Winnipeg\nAnd there's clear motion west to east with each of those features a trough origin trough so the ridge is going to be pushing overhead here through the day today and overnight with the trough than sliding in tomorrow morning or mid day behind a cold front of a passage\nUnlike yesterday's system in which and you can see this on the water vapor image if you're looking at it we were on the left hand or pull words side\nOf the main body of a ... that's where the air is fun leftward and therefore lifted in cooled that produced all the cloud cover some of the precipitation we had\nThis time they approaching system we're going to be primarily on the right hand side of the jet\nOr at least as the system approaches tomorrow or that's where I'm more sort of downward force tends to be created underneath the jazz\nAnd so that should limit precipitation production at today an overnight as the winds start to back more subtle Leon more moisture rides up into the area from the south and as we get into the midday hours tomorrow and the strongest winds in the jet stream get past this upper lifting will return and we may see\nI start to see some precipitation production in conjunction with a lower level convergence of wins along the surface ... which will be climbed a around that same time period\nAre and that won't be here are a service ones from South western North West in the afternoon\nAnd then after that the momentum in the upper level winds across the uh this portion of the mid latitudes is going to shift from ... west to east which has been moving these systems through so quickly too much warmer written Miller north south slow and that's going to slow down the incoming trough ah behind tomorrow's cultural passage\n...\nMid ... no\n...\n\n...\n\n... ... ... ... the ... the\n... the young man young dining out there on my machine a diamond ring on my mother's shaded not binding nothing\nThe\nThe ... the big blow the bus station de la ... maybe\nAnother one of those long\n[noise]\nBut I don't talk about ... ... ... ... ... ... ... men themselves in a little bit to the last bit those spots man I didn't know that the last bit la la\nAlong\nBut you\nLot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\nVinci round and round Tommy every way I\nAnd [noise]\nWell well the yo\nThe river Lebanon Nineteen Eighteen World War one came in\nThe in the world war one relevant today that we move past the Trump what are we still struggling with the consequences\nA hundred years later today it's a ... year will bring with a rock and roll history so that explores the conflict in the ... and now\nThe greatest war world war one Wisconsin and white film about the day and for each week until November eleventh debatable show but men and women and they have a growing number of people will join us to talk about the show and some of the music that will be\nOh right and woke him again to the greatest war thanks marching yeah so uh we have a lot of our regulars here or\nKevin and Brian and we have ... to ... as well so that's a house today yeah [laughter] but not as full as a defeat experiences will be on the show you how many other players playing with because there's that day\nTrue yes it'll be about twenty people are so performing that day\nSo yeah so I think last time trying to just remember what we covered or we talked a waltzing Matilda and the experiences of a a a sort of an Australian and a New Zealand or if you were put into a war and then just like many other young people slaughtered just within minutes ah\nBut yeah so we've been looking at the social aspects we've been looking not so much at the battle is what I'm what I've uh just gather from Miller\n... yeah right right we have this isn't a ... it's not a military history that the show is about it's it's it's about people and um you know when you're the\nI I I'm not a veteran I'm so from what I understand when you're in the middle of it you know kind of very little idea of what's going on at all um and so we're going more to the perspective of the of the individual with with and and then the bigger themes are less military base in more will say about uh the the greater\nConsequences and decisions that were that were made at the time\nAnd also I think a lot of the home front a lot of times people are really focused on where the the guns were being fired but also what I like looking at what's happening in society back home or what the changes are happening like women working as mechanics it's been\nA one of the things I I I think you mentioned a we have this image of Rosie the riveter but that sort of transformation of people taking those rules was happening before work too\nExactly it really started in World War one um and it was just for a shorter period of time because the United states officially was declared a war of April Nineteen Seventeen so about a year and a half\nOr so they were or we rather we're we're fully in it um and really only about\nRoughly nine months of actual fighting in the war but it's true the home front activity started to write down in April of Nineteen Seventeen um and that's a big part of the show and that's why we say ... Wisconsin is right in the in that tagline because\nI wanted to give an idea of what World War one was like from Wisconsin\nAnd one of the other things I learned with what's called them with known as a traitor trying to do at ... at all that we've covered through these things you know it had it for me because it had I mean I worked as a result of evidence I don't feel too keen on the ...\nRight right there was there was a pretty strong anti war I'm a elements are seen in\nWisconsin prior to the declaration of war and it was you know it was kind of a combination of of pacifist and so socialists um general people who are we're just moderate and just thought gosh you know getting to do with foreign conflict seems like something like a pretty big deal which you think about\nAnd then and then a German Americans who just weren't very excited to to go to war with their family members right\nYeah so what do we have one for this week but if you've seen what's on the place for\nYeah so I'm just a little to Tucson today I which we've we've been doing so far it's feels feels pretty good\nUm so last week the first song we played was a song called happiest mortal which is about a it was based letters and diaries of ... who was a nurse who grow up on the street here in Madison and then went to the war and that song\nCovered sort of her experience starting with this this big sense of adventure um the day she leaves she considers herself that the happiest mortal in town and um it it brings up this interesting point which is that America's\nExperience in World War one or certainly had similarities to the other countries that were in it but in some ways America's experience was very different than say that of England France and certainly Germany and in\nIn that um and in Russia and Austria Hungary and many other countries who are in it for a long time\nAnd that we're in a very short period of time\nAnd by the time the United states entered things sort of moving again so we have this this image of the western front just sitting there static for year after year after year and and it's affecting Wisconsin nights the nights and the United states in our view of the war but we're not actually in it making that sacrifice\nAnd so I think all the countries had some element of excitement when the war actually began in Nineteen fourteen\nUm there was you know there's lots of photos of people kind of celebrating the street I mean there was apprehension to do don't get me wrong but there was this element of you know it was this big deal and everybody's rushing to enlist in it it'd be part of it as quickly as possible and in Germany um and and I think some of that happened in England and I'm\nA and then of course it it starts to drag on and that that wears down but really an in Nineteen Seventeen in the United states is going to starting at that point at least that that's the feeling I get and so many people\nWere actually very enthusiastic to go and I think it's important to to to know that it's just it's just it's true right a lot of people with guns and didn't want your against the war and there were others who were very much willing and um\nAnd then and then I I think that they were very much inundated with the reasons why and why you should be supporting this war I mean this concept of making the world safe for democracy had as far as I Know never been used before by the United states to\nIt's interesting because before it was usually let's go civil life these places I I think that was one of the pre ... but you're right but the first time we're looking at more like a value in more like imposing this ideal as opposed to a\nCivil I think the people of the world who might not be following the project or you know food or other European powers for that matter\nRight right and and also the idea that we were going to a save our allies or or to help our allies to help England and France\nAnd you know up to this point I mean we we were getting along better with England but it's the first time we really like went and fought alongside England since you know I mean it was just over a hundred years before that we were getting England still off of you know North America\nUm the war of Eighteen twelve hundred [laughter] right [noise]\nUm and so so that was another thing and you see the propaganda posters like crazy you know the pictures of starving women and children and and and these these gruesome video a video images of of\nOf German soldiers would you know taking dragging women away and and and you know killing babies I mean they really late it on the deck and so people saw that and they\nAnd they believed at 'em and you know I mean not to say that there aren't atrocities and war on and on both sides and Germany included a but it was you know it was very one sided a course and and so I I think that a lot of people really went to that war feeling like they're you know kind of saving humanity um this is this is important\nSo Helen ... I think was one of those [laughter] and I know they're parades and bands playing all all all the time it's like every piece of art and music at that time was all for one reason support either go to war or support the war nearby liberty bonds um become a nurse joined the red cross\nA list so um so then\nOne of the themes of the show is to try to use the experiences of Wisconsin nights and just convey it and of course there's a lot of great world war when poetry right and there's um\nAnd and we're going to have some of the famous poems in this I'm I'm particularly a John ... a insiders fields just it's probably the most popular World War one up home of all time and um\nAnd yet I've had a number of people ask me not know what the poppy is about um and we can we can talk about that but I'm a I bring up the poetry because Helen ... wrote a poem\nAnd it it she called it might creed\nAnd I think it's not I'm not athlete policy but I think she wrote it while she was in France if not in France it was somewhere really close to her her service and so I thought well what better way to convey the feeling of of a of an American in Wisconsin I in the in the war then with her own words so I put her words\nThe music I'm so excuse me to take a drink of water [laughter]\nAnd push away the lottery [laughter] yeah that's right it was like this yeah\nUh it's it's it's a drama that they should say these are all dramatic composite so it none of these people are it's not technically just them it's really competing more than just them in fact is even a company more than just this event germs dust and the treaty but so you know given that\nUm Matthias ... Berger was the the unlucky German who got to go surrender Germany or to the allies and I say he's a lucky because he didn't actually wasn't actually in power he didn't actually waged the war [noise]\nUm he was a with the Social Democrats who were put into power about a month before the war ended basically saying you know hidden Bergen lived north put him in power and said well okay here you go it's your country now is is what you wanted [laughter] and made them surrender\nAnd that's what led to this stabbed in the back of myth in Germany that that Hitler used to say the Social Democrats and the and of course the the\nUh the Jews and there was one of the November criminals he was a November criminal right and that that was the nickname given to the social the Democrats are surrendered where he was literally in fact uh two years later or so he he get gets assassinated I'm so things didn't work out well for him\nUm then the other two characters in the in the um song or\nA Fernando ... if I'm saying that right I've never really ... tells you how to say the name but he's the he's the lead French general and the ... the Supreme Commander of allied forces so since World War one so Eisenhower was that in World War two but in wills I wanted to it's a it's it's the French\nUm and so Brian is going to sing his voice in the French want it to be absolutely as harsh as possible in Germany he said something like we want to bring their economy back to Eighteen Seventy two\n... which was when they invaded uh when Germany invaded France and the French come in with happening at that time has come in so yeah yeah so yeah right so that they were significant or to him and so\nUm so that's what fans want an end then and then he Norman a who is going to sing in the show and it's here with us today is singing the part of America which is\nI'm In this case Woodrow Wilson we're we're dramatizing\nAnd uh she makes an excellent job is right right yeah I can tell if you're on radio [laughter] definitely [laughter] um and uh and and what it was and had to had to fourteen points and and all of the fourteen points were certainly wanted to dismantle the army army and have Germany give up all these lands that they'd conquered\nWas otherwise really quite lenient basically just said you know take apart the army but then just let them be and let him be a free country and trade amongst the the rest of the world\nAnd and from what I've read the song doesn't cover this but from what I read it seems like had one or the last two other two arguments one out completely things may have turned out differently you know if France was completely Germany would have been just so crippled they even even Hitler couldn't raise an army\nOr if the U.S at one out that they're just wouldn't have been ah\nThe force you know the momentum that that that he was able to build on 'em but instead the end result of some sort of compromise that that really did serve anybody\nSo I'm so by the way I should say Katy would you like say Hi to the world hello I'm All right so this song is called why does it have to me\nThe greatest ... ever know not to walk out too and\nI had to hurry crawls France to the forest of coffee and\n\nThey came to power and his mom being bowed to surrender or we didn't weigh a\nOld being the mercy of Matt Rick how would you buy the vengeance at bay\n[noise]\nWhy does it have to be mean\nA long list of dogs do should be the Kaiser city here\nHad been very good in the dark [laughter]\n...\nFor the workers [noise] battery a woman and child in San\nAntonio ...

A. U. L. T. S.\nBoth parties have these and groups like the Koch brothers have got their own independent on a and B how have vast\nQuantities of data about virtually every voter and the non voter for that matter basically every consumer which means everybody right in America\nAnd I don't think there's much restriction on that use but not that I Know of\nOkay and so our our news organizations also making use of 'em do seem files\nNot as much but they're basically uh it's very expensive and it it takes a presidential campaign to do that and the the the information is really useful to her campaign which wants to find out\nWhere exactly\nAre who are the voters that it needs to register who are the voters that it needs to turn out of a lecture and they are they only do they only vote occasionally they only do they vote regularly and they need to know how do I get a\nGood message to every single separate voter in my constituency newspapers do have that same need basic or they don't write and then they're not going to pay for it they they might do it actually focus their\nArt for selling the paper trying to trying to find new new buyers and I'm sure I'm a ... a lot of newspapers they probably do use these lists but they don't use them in their in their poll what\nOkay again if you are just joining us you are listening to the Monday October twenty ninth twenty Eighteen edition of a public affair on W.
