there and um so it it you know it is the middle of October after all and um [noise] but if you know\nChillier that basically the that's the word of the day chillier\nWill chillier in the oh so there's been drastic fluctuations in whether it's thirty forty degree temperature changes\nUm yes is it that normal kid\nOh everything is normal we're all normal Raul winters I have no idea you know I all I Do is read this stuff on the computer um I I have yet to read a single book on meteorology so I'm not much of an expert\nSo are we going to let people know you're actually not I mean\nI Know I I I've never studied meteors ever and you were just the weather reader\nReader that's right the Tora Bora weather boy\nI Am willing to lead to less than a month now we've got to be a state wide elections\nOh absolutely and wait it will\nA a report that will uh in the yesterday's market Journal Sentinel um put together by the Campaign Media Analysis Group who ah they they track\nA campaign funding it appears that uh that Scott Walker is spending a lot of money in a Dane County market um ... why why do you think you'd they'd be wasting their money in this market\nThey can okay [laughter] I mean when you when you look for work when you have a a a billionaire casino owner in Vegas and a couple of billionaire brothers in Kansas\nRolling a lot of your operations you know and you've got more money than you know what to do with wind you know ... there's only so much airtime you could buy in the Green Bay market there's you know that's really the that's really the only answer I could say I mean they they're doing it because they can\nOkay well do you think that they also realize that if they ah keep the Dane County voted at a certain level that the that increases their chances I mean you are again we're talking Dane County speaking with my password is the chair of the Dane County Democratic Party was talking about the upcoming elections\nUm any importance I guess of of getting a huge turnout in Dane County um people talk about Waukesha county\n... county or for the last several elections has kind of uh uh what shall I say equally each other out even though we got more people in Dane County but ah the ... area they\nTurn out a Seventy to Seventy five percent of voter turnout also and\nUh it appears that a lot of that vote is a Republican\nOr I won't vote for first and foremost I Would not discount the efforts that the Democrats in ... county or doing um mhm this is there are some absolute opportunities particularly\nIn one would say kind of the suburban areas of suburban Milwaukee where there is um there is an increased voter enthusiasm or an increased\nUm desire to vote for Democrats to counter the president um and there are you know ... ... look just as we are organizing people\nAll over Dane County um Democrats in ... in their own as well and and and they have 'em from election to a lecture and done better\nSo I said well yeah there's so we can safely assume there's a lot\nOpposition to a Republican policies in in their strong though while areas if you will is at Waukesha a those hockey in Washington in town in yes so\nYeah it's going to be a tough one huh [laughter] yes it is are there any local I'm a ... a lot of the battles hear other people should be paying attention to the well\nI'm I'm before I answer that question I I certainly want to highlight uh one of the things is very different this year than it's been other years has been how all the state how the state wide candidates\nAre running as a team and how remarkable all of our candidates are I mean not just turning reverse but you know Mandela Barnes Josh call the ... the candidate for attorney general and Sarah got Louis ck either candidate for state treasurer\nThose last three candidates they're all under the age of forty ... which I think is a novice is phenomenal and should encourage a lot of younger vote to ten ... voters who tend to stay home in these elections\nTo go out and and and vote for a generational change in a in in in leadership in state government\nUm locally or are there are um you you know there are some\nUh uh you know assembly candidates that have their districts poke in a little bit in Dane County and think on all of our all of our Dane County candidates are are are looking very well on the local level\nUm um but we uh but\nBut yeah I mean we're looking at a an incredible opportunity to really change the face of state government\nWhat what is the significance of this election um um nationwide or what what is what is Scott Walker loses how would that affect a new public ... being in Wisconsin oh how it affects the national political scene well I'm I mean\nThe\nWell let's look at what happened in two thousand ten when Scott Walker one\nI mean it was the ... in a in a ... on a night that was bad for Democrats all over the country was one of the highlights of the Republican Party so much that they elevated the state party chair to run the RMC\nMhm so at me prints rebates are rents rents ... okay um and\nAnd and and so I Would I Would think\nThat uh\nYou know Scott Walker being voted out of office would have the same effect nationally I think it's going to be a great night all over the country for Democrats\nUm and you know the the there is a profound\nSpiking enthusiasm among our voters among people who want to go out and volunteer\nAnd again if you're interested in volunteering I encourage you to do it if you're nervous about the election I encourage you to work\nOff that nervousness by walking around knocking on some doors and just go to ... dot org to to learn how you can help out\nYes I've been hearing about this little way but I've kind of like hey you can't just expect it to happen it's no it's got to make it is exactly we are the blue wave\nAll right well Mike bastard the chair of the day county dams I Want to thank you very much for for being on the show this morning and hopefully we'll interview you are the Thursday after the election and\nAh I think it will be under ... out of out of town then are you going to be celebrating somewhere or what I was really just a just going to

uh the problem so he portrayed\nThat the problem is bigger than it actually is he even says that we have started to a you know drug lords country\nWhich is not true and she has bloated the figures so he's all the all the government's own dangerous drug barge has said that there were\nOne point eight million a drug users and by drug users it could mean occasional use this necessarily mean drug addiction but he'd loaded that ... years somehow who spent announcements to\nFour million hard core drug addicts\nAnd then he proceeded to make that a a big issue\nIt is an issue of course because drug addiction in any country should be addressed but it should be addressed not by killing drug addicts but by offering rehabilitation services and also addressing I'm deeper\nCautious of addiction particularly in the Philippines the deeper costs poverty and lack of opportunities\nThat should be the approach instead he has a kill them all approach and even that you know killed him while approach is\nBiased against the poor because the two of the matter is that it has to be in the pool who has been getting killed so the um [noise] the police the sleeping national police bites on its own report it count\nHas reported an average of six or killings of drug personalities in the course of police operations a day six people killed a day in the whole country\nOn top of that they there's a statistic called debts are homicides under investigation which went up to currently plenty plenty plenty for almost twenty four thousand people which is reaching that's under investigation\nReaching an addition on top of thirty three people killed a day and a substantial portion of that\nWord drug related killings and there was an earlier count by one of the reputable news reporting agencies in the Philippines Rappler that says about one out of five of\nDrug that's under investigation actually drug related killings\nSo there's been this um extrajudicial killings of people without due process there are also being thousands of people ... or ... with no charges um\nAnd and this is the basically the dead this pet project to the exclusion of other projects that you should be attending to such\nAs the biggest project you should be attending to is corruption in government\nAnd he's not tending to that in fact the the uh a survey by conspiring see in the nice you know recently showed that Filipinos or that that not not not Filipinos but I'm international agency raided\nThe Philippines in terms of corruption it went down several noxious from its previous rating under the previous administration in addition he has to be an ... political allies\nIndividuals and families who have been very well noted for corruption including the family of the former dictator\nMarcos where he has supported the the ... of that dictator in to the cemetery of heroes and he has\nManaged ... people who were former charged with corruption have now been able to warm themselves back into into power including for example the um [noise] the current speaker of the house\nA lawyer who was the former President Bill had been jailed for corruption under detectors government\nThe which released from jail show this this person to tell you that he's not a fighter against corruption in fact\nThere's even I'm not saying he's guilty because you're innocent until proven guilty even allegations that he's all sat wife are involved in drug shipments and that billions of dollars of billions of pay such have somehow slip through customs\n[noise] yeah I think there's there's a ... a university a model and I think although there's also a a wide variety of specific city or in each country and I think the universal pattern I think it's composed a couple of elements wind is [noise]\nWhiny some some form of disaffection on the part of the population\nAnd it's like a long standing you know these affection I think for example in in the U.S that disaffection last fall are the you know middle middle America having lost its economic\nStanding with with the result of sweeping changes a little bit of ... around the world [noise] and [noise] that's in the Philippines it's\nIt there was an immediate these defections from the prior administration who made it a lot of dumplings and seemed to be\nThe defense from the masses of the people and because of their elite elite kind of reach 'em they come from the rich elite and so\nAnd so there was that kind of a disaffection and also disaffection of the middle class to long standing corruption so that's that's the basis for an opportunity\nTo come in and take over the discourse and cry a certain reasons for why such state of affairs excess and promoting themselves as the new show\nDo that kind of a problem I think that's the common that's the common ... you know properties but I think each each country so it's a different and uh\nAnd and so the the strong man\n... of all sorts of trade you know less democracy for a change stinks and in in my view which is a dangerous prescription to turn over our\nOur ability to influence government um to to a dictator of a dubious stress you know I don't trust dictators\nIt's ... it's probably had experience which is probably a good good basic principle yeah you know of course of course it it it wouldn't repression state violence and attempts to curtail or eliminate a democratic institutions\nOf breeds popular opposition let's talk about the you know I've been on mine of course this past week or just going even Googling doing Google Images for the Philippines in protest or whatever with this massive demonstrations that appear to be taking place periodically\nAcross the country talk about the growing up positions movement of for democracy in opposition to marshal on dictatorship\nYes [noise] so um [noise] first of all\nI'd like to say that a opposition ... or that their administration is not an easy task and the reason why is because there is popularity\n[noise] and um we are hoping that and we are confident that\nThe actions of the dirty government will catch up on it and with it will eventually be exposed because\nFundamentally there's really nothing bright about what the government is doing some people ascribe to him properties like that of decline yo Singapore he's\nActually not even close one might even argue that the fine you really dealt with corruption in Singapore But he's nowhere close so we're confident that his actions will catch up with him and he will be slow to expose that in the meantime\nShe has popularity and we have to but that shouldn't be stopping us from registering opposition even now because you can't wait for tyranny to\nSecure its anchor before you post it because she can you can actually be effective in preventing you from making games so in that vein there are a lot of uh opposition is in in the country ranging from the left\nTo the liberal Democrats who are um registering their opposition\nUm and they are out in the streets that's true and some issues got two more more people in the streets than others but there's also a difference between the organized opposition which um\nYou can count in numbers right now maybe you know you they could put out thousands in the streets but there's also the spontaneous opposition for example that manifested\nI'm most dramatically for example when a two million people took to the streets spontaneously back in Nineteen eighty six to oust the former dictator\nHave one small manifestation of that took place two years ago when they're they're\nUm facilitated the heroes very all of the faith in favor of the former dictator where\nUpon thousands of university students who had not been involved prior to the streets in protest of that that action so\nWhile we are building to organized opposition we are also eventually hoping on the stump genius opposition that can ... not only in the streets but also in the elections so there's a timing may election\nUm where we have hope I hope that the debt that continues to expose and the opposition leaders will get elected in the may twenty Nineteen election this is the same election that but that to any satellites have been trying to ...\nYou know it's very interesting of course because I'm I'm ... and some liberal glad to hear about this\nEnds in inside outside electoral mom electoral movement building because it's so central here\nAs well that you use the institutions in the procedures that are still available a well organizing people at the grass roots are in various organizations suits and ... you know that's that's historic\nNo I've loaded already of course yeah go ahead now\nYeah I just wanted to say one more thing I think the the importance with us\nAnd there's there's one important thing to say about the opposition and that is that especially at the time well actually anytime the opposition as to try to find its way to unite\nBecause from the left spectrum to the liberal Democrats it's not always a United Opposition\nIt sounds very familiar is yes so yeah so there are liberal Democrats for example who thought like actually similar dictatorship\nBut they were associated with the former elite governance of the prior administration but they're nonetheless opposing the story of ruling the country\nAnd then they they might have for example um [noise] and I left there aren't that combination attitudes towards the left and on the left we have people who\nAre very uh ... percent that there are problems in Philly being society aside from the absence of democracy um which is you know the ... of the poor and the question of exploitation of the poor\nAnd they are taxing those issues but at the same time sometimes they have\nSuspicions of the um liberal Democrats and don't want to be associated with them I think they have to rise above the combination of solace or anti liberal Democrat sentiments and we need to come together to form a United platform again\nI'm against detect I because [noise]\nWe have a common to fight to uphold democracy despite maybe are logical different is we have a common sight to uphold democracy because democracy will set the basis\nFor fundamental transformations in our country we have to fight for the empowerment of the people to elect good leaders they empowerment of the people to affect legislation and the environment of the people to put pressure politics in the sixties and sort of government to set them right\nYou know the ... we got about ... fourteen minutes less ... Thirteen minutes left in the lower um [noise]\nAlong I keep thinking as you as they listened to humans they've read over the week the similarities between ... Donald Trump in Rodrigo are due to the uh the contempt for all opposition\nThe um on dismissal of any criticism whatsoever or the attacks um the media the ... the ... the ... of course I'm ... and the reality or at least insinuation the threat of constant violence\nAnd ... as some of the room public remarks of ... has made in ... where he is a it's not just sexism it's a hatred of women it's it's the object to vacation or a or\nA Ninety five percent of the uh increase in income and the United states went to the top one percent so largest transfer of wealth I Know\nThe threats of not done much better job on this than the Republicans have\nWe could argue that's why we have Donald Trump I think it's true I think is true I think if the Democratic party rarely stood for something visibly different uh we might not have him as president and hotel thank you for being here well thank you much\nIdaho shield has been our guest his latest book is called lessons from a dark time it's a collection of essays again part of the stars in the San Francisco bay area\nAnd ... will be appearing at St john's Presbyterian Church in Berkeley on October twenty fifth at seven thirty PM and that does it for that or some politics the show's produced by deanna Martinez Christian Thomas's the engineer\nI'm a church and I think you've been listening [noise]\n\n\n\nW.
