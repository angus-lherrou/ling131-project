Walker I think to get the furthest um and it was also the most noticeable because Wisconsin did have this progressive passed\nAnd in fact he posted in his book and intimidated that you know if we can do it here we can do it anywhere so yeah I think it was a deliberate target\nAnd and how much of a role do you think uh the Democratic party including um governor don't oil and some of the center of the policies of the Democratic party at the time how much did that play on the rise of conservative power during\nI think that it had a huge part of it and more um you know [noise] governor Doyle in when he was campaigning and I'm In two thousand to promise to cut ten thousand state workers um and then when he was leaving office\nIn two thousand ten I'm In December after Walker had one he told a reporter I've cut more public employees than any governor in history so I think this rhetorical attack on the public sphere had a huge impact hum and ... abandonment of\nPublic investment which had been so deeply rooted in Wisconsin really set the stage for Walker's you know much more significant attacks\nUm on organized labor and the other you know Wisconsin progressive traditions but particularly with lever um there was a real abandonment of the public sector and I think that was\nYou know Democrats were part of it to one of the um [noise] one of the union leaders in my in the book they poke when ... ... many of your listeners might know he's the head of the ivy W. um\nLocal in Madison she said she called a you know walk her son of the oil I think there was a real sense that this was the continuation of of this policy\nSo now a in her book the politics of resentment Kathy Cramer or use of the divide between urban hands on rural have not really the reason politics in the state and and also by extension the nation as well do you agree with that analysis\n[noise] definitely and I think one of the things I deal with in my book is what is the source of this and I think there's a wonderful interview and the New York times today was Wendell Berry\nA farmer and writer and and really deep thinker about rural economies and one of the most profound thinkers on this subject without the Leopold [noise] and I think if you look at what has happened to rural economies since the late\nForties there's been a real hollowing out a corporate agriculture has really sort of devastated these communities in Wisconsin for example in the late Nineteen forties you had a hundred and fifty thousand dairy farms now there's fewer than nine thousand so if you go to a lot of these towns\nUm the the main streets are are almost entirely boarded up and there's a lot of ... struggling and its aging population young people are leaving and that does create a context for resentment um a lot of these people voted for\nUm ... in two thousand eight in two thousand fourteen much more two thousand eight and I think there was a sense that um that he might address some of these issues they also a lot of them voted for Bernie Sanders\nOffered the same reason and then I think um you know one of the people in my book is a former Republican state senator Dale Schultz who said you know in his rural district\nSanders really caught fire and as soon as he was out a lot of this anti establishment anger got behind Trump\nUm and that that was his assessment I think there's some some truth to it I think there is a lot of anger and there's a lot of economic and security health care and other issues there is racism to end sexism but I Do think in a time\nThe economic insecurity this kind of divide and conquer mentality that Walker\nYou know really uh really used\nIn the Trump as well with different victims and perpetrators are caught fire you know especially when there wasn't a strong counter message on on the other side\nNow in other parts of the country we've seen a unapologetically liberal or even socialist candidates including people of color like Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\nWent up ... congressional races you see that kind of politics playing well in Wisconsin and do you see those kinds of nontraditional candidate playing well in Wisconsin was not the kind of thing like Nancy Pelosi has said that it's just for New York city\n[noise] not at all I mean I think look at the results of the twenty sixteen primary and Sanders won by Thirteen points and then you have you know Randy prices insurgent campaign that did I think contribute to Ryan a Paul Ryan deciding not to seek reelection\nIt's hard to know but um [noise] I think that kind of candidate she has a lot of potential in Wisconsin um [noise] that said you know it's it's it's tough there's a lot of money in politics now and um\nYou know it's it's hard because and also you have a split in the Democratic party between that kind of insurgent wing that is a challenging the establishment for power and it's unclear\nYou know um how it's going to play out but I think you know you look at the ... campaign and other um efforts in and Sanders victory I think it has a lot of appeal particularly in the industrial Midwest maybe more so than in New York um because of these\n[noise] the the the kind of co option of see certain um [noise] the\nTriangulation that the Democratic party has pursued a particular round free trade agreements and other things I think that really alienated a lot of um ... you know working class voters um and and maybe didn't cause them to switch sides to Trump although some of that did happen but\nThere was a lot of disaffection you know when you look at the two thousand sixteen results Trump\nActually got last few fewer votes than Romney um did but Clinton got far far fewer than Obama did and I think that's a big part of it not to say that voter id and other things can play a role but it was also people not being excited by that that message of very tepid message\nOptions to people here we have a very small dedicated staff who ah ah earn every dollar that they are in here are ... and and then some and then supplemented by\nYou know hundreds of volunteers so six to eight to five sixty thousand and one in ... and we are responsive to our community in a way

D reply to the federal government or with President Ford for ... relief and bankrupt right as a foreign to city drop\nDead yeah exactly yeah and so that's part partly why Carter one New York city is because he was saying he said I'll never tell you to drop dead which of course I'm as small businesses try to recover from the looting once President Carter was president he wasn't helpful at all [laughter] but you know he was already presidents I guess you didn't need New York anymore\nBut um so yes it was both my family stories but doing a lot of research to sort of what's the context behind those stories\nNow you write about how uh not only the federal during the city government was one of the biggest obstacles to reopening the store after the looting why was that why wasn't the city and briefing use these sort of mom and pop operations\nWell I mean I think that's a question that we've been able to move and asking forever right like wide just city's not think it's in the public interest to support their small businesses you know so now they're sort of the beginning of my dad and other small businesses realizing\nThe city isn't going to put muscle into us or staying open they the city put together they got some philanthropists together and they put together a fund so of the I don't remember the exact number but at the two thousand small businesses that were destroyed I think they could get a twelve hundred dollar grant from the city\nUm which many bad yeah my dad liked to call it well it's better than a kick in the head you know how he described it um and ... and so the city you know maybe talk to a good game people were sympathetic but in terms of whether\nLike my dad and lots of small businesses that you know if you could give us a moratorium on our July taxes while they try to recover that would be great but you know didn't happen\nAnd a reader clinic because it's still there\nNo it's actually became our CIA in the seventies sort of a owed to the fact that um\nThey don't really repair rate is much anymore and that actually also one older woman to come in once\nAnd when I'm the person helping her told her how much it because she said oh no I've met a care you know [laughter] I'm fine [laughter] and they realize you know let it maybe we should Jean Janine so it became I see I in the seventies and uh it went under in two thousand and four team\nWhat what you put it under water to what was that in our country\nSo uh for is for people who aren't familiar with Upper West side there when the ... in the late Nineteen eighties and so that was the first wave of sort of closing the mom and pops and displacing people who'd been there for many decades\nI'm going to match twenty dollars to the next few pledges that come in here uh so you could pick that book up for a twenty dollar a pledge are we likely to donate more donate as much as you can I'd donate early donate often\nYou can afford a dollar or a thousand dollars would you get the same kind of\n... thank you from our listeners sponsors are volunteers that are answering the phone six\nTo eight to five sixty thousand and one\nUh and support great community radio here on W.

R. T. F. M. dot O. R. G. but if you're interested in seeing what's happening or this morning and it's been happening in the past week or\nGo to W. R. E. F. M. data orange a dot ORG forward slash whether you can navigate it to using on the menus and blow up the feature graphic this morning it's right at the top of that weather page is mostly a series of links on that page and the top one is the seven days satellite image\nWhich will give you a download a seven day review looking at the entire continent in the adjacent oceans\nAre just a review how's the weather has been changing the past week and why it's gonna be a little bit different this week there was last week\nWe end of the month of September of course just a few hours ago when a despite the last minute cold surges past weekend a month still ended up significantly warmer than normal\nBy a to point seven degrees Fahrenheit and as you might have guessed the month ended up wetter than normal by a good tool when a third inches of rain that Seventy five percent more than normal\nThe wet theme is going to continue into the first week of October at least until the first week it's looking in the a half inch of rain we've picked up since midnight is already putting us in good stead as far as that's concerned [noise]\nUh and we see a good bit more to before the weeks over in fact we could see a good marine for the days over I'm afraid the cold weather on the other hand at least the kind of cold we saw Saturday is going to be a temporarily shelved anyway I mentioned actually last Wednesday on the forecast that if your coverage or tender plants for the overnight period from\nFriday night into Saturday morning past you\nI Will get another week or ten days or gross out of them and it's still working very much to be the case in fact that we could hit eighty degrees on\nWednesday this coming week so your plants might get a nice verdict growth at that point especially with all the rain\nAnd although the too sensible whether trends I just mentioned that cold a trend that we had a few days ago and this wet one upcoming would not seem well most people will be particularly related\nIf you look at that featured graphic this morning the seventies satellite image or hopefully I can provide some explanation why those two things are actually related\nAs we got some midpoint of September or so a lot of the medium and longer range forecast models the ones that go out the Fifteen and thirty days that the climate Prediction Center uses to predict the weather over the coming months\nThose were indicating that we're likely to see a period of strong amplification in the upper air pattern in the region from the Pacific ocean across the north American continent meaning that we're likely to get a series of these deep north south waves to set up up in the steering winds up in the upper atmosphere\n[noise] and that has turned out to be very much the case then is ah quite evident if you look at the continent and adjacent oceans that is portrayed on the seven day satellite graphic looking down from the satellite\nOr at the beginning of the loop this past Monday you can see a big ridge build out over the Eastern Pacific up into Alaska I mentioned that last week\nThat's what helped dumped the cold in air rain here at the end of the week out of Canada this past Saturday\nAnd you can see that ridge or that building rich producing almost mirror like downstream trough over the center of the U.S is that builds over the days of the last week with a picture that trough then it's cold they're descending just passed a friday and Saturday\nWell I just want to amplify something I'd Bob's comments earlier I drove in from my home don't in green county this morning and I'd crossed branches of and the sugar river it's self several times\nThe ground is saturated to begin with a nurse standing water in the fields oh yeah so we had in excess of an inch and a half\nRain last night and the sugar river's bank full and it's brown is coffee with ... minutes so it's eroded ... seriously yeah um this morning I don't know from where but er it's a mess wow\nYes the heaviest rains did fall last night south of Madison even though we got a good inch here was heavy ourselves\nAll right well thanks for everyone's attention to the the weather or forecasts and description or today that number again is six to eight to five six two thousand and one or W.

W are the first time Fletcher who becomes an evergreen donor you get a very stylish a T shirt a long sleeved T shirt great for this upcoming whether by Leslie numbers or if you have been at all to the library\nOr any of our workshops Leslie numbers I have to say full disclosure I work at the library she was our artist in residence and does great screen printing I'd just designed she is a master of the craft\nA and has very generously put together a very a like a tree of life type illustration with a woman playing steel guitar in the middle and all sorts of creatures\nAre up this tree it's just amazing so you can check it out on the website if you want to know what it looks like you can stop by the stations to see what it looks like live\nAh but yeah we're hoping that you will contribute at any level or you can do a five dollars a month you can only do a one time five dollar donation because that is a lot of what the way our T is built on it's been built on the five dollar donations that people gave and have given throughout the last forty three years those\nAre just an outsized um and it's what I started\nYes I ... that's an interesting side I started with a five dollar donation is\nWell and because that was all I can afford at any given time but now if you can afford you just five dollars a month or not a lot to paid any one given time but it's that are\nDoing it in the evergreen a program that the monthly donation program even a small amount like that really helps us out it evens out are\nBudgetary flows and helps us with our planning financial planning on here at the station and it's just an easier way for most people to give money frankly and um people are used to making a small donations to cover their bills and things like that so it's a\nAnd those are involuntary donations either voluntary donation which is the beauty of the double your it to you if you decide how much are able to give\nAnd just yeah you put a finger to what you would like to give to the station so it's one of the most ah I guess act that you can personalize it and you can make it fit within it and as we said any level is just great and very welcome and very well received\nI Want to tell our listeners about the versatility of our volunteers here I'm In the last flurry of called there was nobody at the desk so Dan ran out to the desk and answer the phone and took a pledge\nAnd not only that but the coffee pot was empty so either before that are after Dan brewed up or ...\nAnd in addition to the stellar performance behind the microphone ... as I can make\nCoffee and answer phones to yeah yeah [laughter] and plenty of that era hired ...\nWell that's the thing is is that I keep promising people and nobody ever takes me up on this as a tour of the station a free cup of coffee and doughnuts while they last a but if somebody did walk in and ask for that they're better be coffee [laughter] so that's what we did yeah he's a pot of coffee so yeah five\n... two six zero eight to five six two zero zero one on one other premium I'd like to point out is there's a Madison in the twenties if you've been listening to Madison in the sixties that has been a fantastic podcast and also a segment on the evening news\nOr that is offered by ... who also wrote Madison but says ... history or the graphic history\nIf Madison so if you enjoy that and you want to know about the twenties when the ... were here when the Klan marching down I Believe regents street or that will be a fascinating talk with a lot of pictures and you can get that at the Seventy five dollar level to go with someone there that would be\nSix dollars and twenty five cents a month um and if your first time player and you want to be the ... around there and they'll get it right now has spent so ah ... anything over the fifty dollar level or if or an evergreen anything over the\nAt evergreen subscriber [noise]\nOr we want to thank John sure shark\nFor generous pledge\n...\nReally is ... it's just wonderful and she's got to the premium in part because of the au upgrading of her whatsoever\nWell her premium level thanks to her double generous contribution I'm drawn is getting a work T shirt so\nFantastic through a minor loves\nThe um the real jaguar tropical rhythms and Mel employed and\nAnd yeah um I Know that my weekend isn't complete with all of those that were mentioned in that in that a list there and others to yeah\nAh so yes I have to go to a couple of quick announcements and thanks to all the colors to have a called us all and to the one person who's gone online we hope we\nGet a just a handful of more pledges both online and on the phone we I think have the possibility of making gold this week which is a better territory than we were in last week so yeah we hope that you will be one of those people who steps up and uh helps us get closer to that goal that uh has been there\nEver since this morning that we came close last week but didn't meet so if we were able to meet at this week and maybe going a little bit over that would just because it's\nGot about forty minutes left and and we really need six or seven more pledges to make our goal and and maybe get back a little bit of what we were short last week so please be the next person to call a zero eight\nTwo nine zero zero zero one yeah so now would be the time to do it if you were planning and just got a busy signal now's the time to do that have a couple of announcements one is about the Stuart ... Madison in the twenties talk that we've been mentioning that will be happening\nOn January twenty six or so yeah let's say if you want an idea of what that will be a here's a trauma that tells you about it also some information about the cheddar revolution album so we'll be right back after a couple of announcements [noise]\nLogan friends do live ten here with a special awesome for word donors during this pledge drive a unique presentation on medicine in the twenties [noise] the most interesting decade in Madison first century Frank Lloyd Wright designed a hotel in country club the ... Klux Klan came to campus\nFor more information into full manmade Wisconsin [laughter] [laughter] oh I see a nine point nine Afghans they're sponsored community radio [noise]\n\nAnd indeed this is listeners sponsored community radio we've had ah some very generous calls are happening I think\nUh we're safe to say that we've done what we or should have been doing for the past two hours which is getting a a just a a nice number of pledges to cover for those we still have about thirty eight minutes on this hour and we're hoping to get\nJust a maybe six or seven other calls because that would just put us in being able to make the goal being able to make our contribution to the station and also yeah hoping to leverage\nOr the goodwill and the community if you've been enjoying the show and other shows on the station or that would be a find time to pledge to support double your AT T at six zero eight to five six two zero zero one\nOne of the things that I've enjoyed quite a bit is or the ability to listen to a lot of shows outside of when their broadcasts through the W. R. T archives that you can find on our website I've also enjoys the possibility of having melon Floyd delivered regularly to my listening devices are my laptop computer so\nThose are all enhancements that were made possible because\nAh someone donated five dollars fifty dollars a hundred dollars to twenty dollars a about ten or Fifteen or Twenty years ago and that built the base for all these great innovations that double your AT T has been able to do to keep up with the times\nAnd also do it in a way that responsible to the community in a way that provides an alternative to listening platforms and things like that so ah yeah give us a call at six or eight to five six two zero zero one or go on line at W. R. T. FM's out at work we also still have the brick cheese which has yet been on claimed all the\nAged cheddar has been an adult up very handily\nAnd I'm with you you you hear us talking about evergreen a evergreen program is a monthly contribution program and it really\nBenefits the station a bit more than the\nSingle of dollar pledges that uh we have been more traditional\nAh for example last year we had forty five hundred donations or received from many individuals and of course we're very thankful for those but but those individual donations or the cash level or a require a\nThank you notes to be a send out with postage uh they're processed by our accounting department that takes a labor time\nAh their deposited in the bank and you know we we appreciate all those donations but the evergreen donations require a lot less handling and more efficient use and and transfer of your contributions straight in the program a operations here at the station [noise]\nIt was the more predictable cash flow that we know is coming in from your five or ten dollar a month contributions or perhaps more\nUm W. R. T. is able to to maintain focus on filling our mission and we have the ability to plan a future projects better without worrying if there's enough donations to uh come forward to a finance those um [noise]\nYou maximize are giving a buy\nIn a in a sense making it easier on you because you know the cash flow as well or breaking something up into five or ten dollars a month is a lot easier on a lot of people's ah monthly\nA checkbook balance a than a more sizeable one time contribution and it's easier to track and it's just plain easy uh everything is done for you and um and it really benefits the station that's why we are uh have goals not just in the dollar amount that we\nA raise in our program here this morning but we also have a separate goal on ...\nThe number of evergreen a monthly contribution a program increases either with a new pledge or with an increase in your current evergreen so if you are already giving five dollars or a a Moscow consider raising it to ten dollars a month and\nAnd um you probably won't even notice it's just a few cups of coffee a month for the uh for the station ... in equivalence\nOr write or some other you know [laughter] hypothetical and arbitrary Ike a comparison\nOf ... and uh it it's easier on you and and it it it gives a great benefit to the financial stability and sustainability of W. O. R. T.\nAnd it's every grain of a sense that it is renewed constantly and so is your ability to get thank you guess from the station as you are sort of like reach again that milestone and are able to accumulate again so it's not like you do it at one time and then you're cut off from getting premiums\nYeah it's ... somebody picked up by one of the twelve year cheddar blocks ah because it's been a year since there last ah thank your guest and and they're just maintaining their evergreen\nAnd uh and so you could if you know you play an extra income man and a pick up a couple of CDs or or a nice a book or a T shirt or a T shirt so\nAnd I want to say one other benefits that a cruise from increased a numbers of people doing the evergreen\nPledge and that is um the more we get the less we have to ah abuse your ears on here for\nOur periodic pledge drives so the more people who\nMm [noise]\n[noise]\nThe next line some metal realistic Cody I never took the tea and you will maybe watch a nationwide from raising the word for the fires like some\n... or ... entertain the groups are in the new start time let's\nDo lunch there is no water district should be it'll proceeds will funded any grand or they would support that\nHaitian and advocacy involving schizophrenia\nAnd bipolar disorder major depression obsessive compulsive disorder severe anxiety disorders company ... and families are encouraged to organize teams of water for information goes to the two for nine seven when the state or is it works dot org\nKeeping us informed of opportunities for promoting wellness in our community this is W O R C nine point nine FM Madison\nOh right and we are back ah we didn't get any calls in the ... we were playing music I Believe but are we still have an opportunity to to have that happen we are\nJust twenty minutes away from the end of the show or will be having a great Patti he'll take those uh come on next after the b._b._c. is\nTo have her show which is one of my\nFavorite hours of talk here on W. R. T. or talking about things that I care about talking about bikes talking about local food systems transportation or just a very nice variety of topics a and a mix that's just very personal that draws from her experience\nAnyway that is what the tea allows us to do it allows us to have great voices a great community voices he joined in that dialogue with authors and people who are looking in analyzing policy about we also like to look at it and analyze music in the show we hope that you find that enjoyable\nWe just heard a couple of really eclectic cut starting with me to kind of ... sold by Bombay Ricky a song that was made a popular by you must know Makin thinks both for the correct pronunciation and that which had escaped me from their album electric by Robby\nOn cowboys an Indian label then after that a very eclectic band with people for many countries playing now in London that was the turbans doing\nHalf ski holdover from the their debut album the turbans on six degrees records both of these uh songs that I played all releases from this year so we'd like to bring you a bit of the old a lot of the new or a lot of the old and a bit of a new depending on what the show does and we hope that you ...\nShape that and you appreciate it all the other great things that W. R. T. brings to you and\nThat you will put a a just a monetary amount to what you think this is worth to you to keeping this going to keeping the idea of work and the actuality of work going or you can do that at six zero eight to five six two zero zero one are called WHAT offended argue\nThis is fascinating and educating broadcasting and programming and we hope that you do enjoy that oh I Want to let everyone know that we still have six\nUnmet challenges for the twenty five dollar upgrade on your pledge you if you pledge it to five dollar per month\nMinimum or more on the evergreen program you will be qualifying for twenty five dollar upgrade to your premium level the same thing is true if your first time pleasure of all of the same conditions apply\nAnd we'd like another bingo like the one we had earlier where we had our first time pleasure who also pledged evergreen program and so ah got the double in has got a double enhancements so please take this off the table we don't want to let it go to waste\nAnd one of the things you can do it by getting in at the five dollar a month level or the sixty dollars a month or a one flat payment as you can get their radioactive W.

Bennett who is head of what we now call the natural Resources Conservation service\nWent to coon valley and instead of say here's what we'd like to do for you they went in and listen to farmers who had seen the kind of flooding you're talking about this year\nBut background that really created deep going fifty to sixty foot a goalie and a ... a a wound send the slopes\nAnd uh people were literally losing their incomes because they were losing their soil and rather than a Leopold ... Bennett bull bright and very accomplished scientists\nTelling the farmers what needs to be done they had these dialogues over a coffee at breakfast in a little cafe and sometimes in the late afternoon over a beer\nI'm the same place to see not only what they thought she should be done but how they could collaborate to get it done and that's the really the ground zero of collaborative conservation not only did the farmers and their families peach pitch in and healing 'bout\nA land or a healing the wounds of the goal lease and planting trees and doing a ... tour a a farming and terrorists is\nBut a thousands of units\nOf Wisconsin students and other volunteers went out into that landscape\nAnd really renewed Its Food producing a capacity tens of thousands of people that man hours were involved in that and I don't think it's um a a\nA coincidence that um health valley the co-op words from from that very landscape because people had already found ways to work with one another\nAnd so now of course uh the co-op this the lights in the United states and goes well beyond Wisconsin farmers and who it serves\nBut it shows that there's a ... and if we uh collaborate heat all the land and bring back Its Food producing capacity through rebuilding the soil managing the water better and managing the cover so that we hold as much of the soil\nIntact as possible\nSo if you're just joining us you are listening to the Monday in October first twenty Eighteen fall pledge drive edition of a public of fear on W.
