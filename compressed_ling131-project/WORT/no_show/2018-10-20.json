and Senate messenger off to fetch back his son\nBut even the rush of today a journey of a hundred verse take some considerable time and Katherina ... and I was already beginning to feel that she could not live another hour without Sergei\nQuite suddenly the full force of her newly awoken character burned out and she grew so determined there was that there was no stopping her\nShe found out where Sergei was spoke to him through the iron door and rushed off to look for the keys let's Sergei out of their father in law she said\nOld man turned fairly green with rage not an all his born day is

to put Katrina levels now to shame let him out of there she said I Swear to you on my conscience that nothing bad has passed\n...\nNothing bad he said fairly grinding his teeth and fury nothing bad what have you been doing with him all those nights putting new covers on your husband's pillows the cat arena love that kept up the pressure demanding that he do that she wanted let him out and go on let him out\nVery well ... if that's the way you wanted when your husband comes home will hall you off to the staples with our bare hands and I will personally see to it that bad villain goes to go tomorrow\nWith us did Boris ... decide but it was a decision that came to nothing\n\n\nFive\nBefore he retired from the Knight Boris Timothy edge ages supper of pickled mushrooms and caution and consequently began to suffer from heartburn\nAll of a sudden he was taken ill when the pit of his stomach terrible heaving rose within him and towards morning he met with exactly the same kind of death as that experience by the rats in his greenery is rats for whom Katrina ... and I was in the habit of preparing a special kind of food\nContaining a noxious white powder that had been interested\nTo her care\nKatrina loved a ledger ... out in the old man's storeroom dungeon and without stopping to worry about what people might think she put him to bed rest between her husband sheets so that he might recover from the beating he had received from her father in law\nMen Boris ... was buried according to Christian ritual and no one suspected a thing it never occurred to anyone to wonder whether there might have been anything unusual about the affair Boris ... had died and he died as a result of eating pickled mushrooms just as\nAnd the others had died before him\nThey buried Boris ... in a hurry not even waiting for his son to return and as the weather was warm they took no time in any case the messenger who had been sent to bring back soon there'll be bar shifts had not found him at the mill\nSupernovae Bush of had happened to learn some timber was being sold off cheap at a place some hundred versus away so he had gone to inspect it and it told no one about his precise destination\nOnce you get a tended to this matter ... completely the letter herself go\nShe was no coward and there was no knowing what might be on her mind she started about giving orders to everyone in the house and will not let Sergei out of her site\nAll of this was much to the wonder amend the servants stewards and work I'm In the cab marina ... lavish with her tips and the ... quickly faded away\nThe mistress and Sergei are having a bit of a ... to gather that's all people would say with a nod and a wink it's their business and she's the one who will stand to account for it\nMeanwhile Sergei grew better straightened out and once more stocked around Katherina ... like a Guerra falcon\nOnce again they resume their cameras relations but not for them alone time Rwanda after a long absence to nobody border shove the wrong husband came hurrying home\nSix\nThe heat was sweltering and the nagging flies unbearably irksome Katherina ... closed the bedroom shutters and draped a wound show all over them and then she laid down the side Sergei on the merchants bed rest\nShe does fit fully but was so tormented by the heat that her face dream with perspiration in her breathing was hot and shallow she felt must be time for her to be up and about again time to go into\nThe orchard and drink tea but try she would she could not get up at last the cook came to the door knocked the some of our under the apple trees going out she said was an effort Katherina ... turned over on her side and found herself stroking a cat\nThe cat was rubbing itself between surrogate and

our fingers as that were made of thin air\nAware as this cat come from Katrina wandered in her nightmare we've never had any cat in the bedroom before and just look at the size of the one that's got in once\nAgain she tried to catch hold of the cat but once again there was no camp there what is this is this cat or isn't it she thought she was suddenly overcome by a sense of confusion which completely ... out of her state of drowsiness and just spilled the dream altogether\nKatherina ... looked around the bed chamber there was no cat anywhere to be seen and only the handsome Sergei leave

innocence the time of confidence is [noise]\nLong ago it must be and I have a photograph preserve your memories they're all that's left you\nSuddenly a essay begins it was Nineteen Seventy five and I was twenty three year old a graduate from Miami University of Ohio\nI was living in Toledo working at my first radio job when I decided I needed a change I needed mountains ocean freeform spirit that Ohio didn't offer I think Eugene Oregon from ... an hour from the ocean and our from the mountains and halfway between\nSan Francisco in Seattle\nIt also had and still has that for a progressive\nFreeform spirit although I didn't know that at the time I applied to graduate school there and I was accepted I put everything I owned into the back of a pickup truck and cross the usa to land in paradise and he talks about a Eugene being a special place in the mid seventies\n\nClear rivers while psychedelic mushrooms vegetarian restaurants in a free form radio station called ... E L was the back of a it was in the back of a trailer park in a building that was\nFormerly a laundromat and the basic format was um\n[noise]\nThere were fifty thousand albums there\nAlex days there and then there's a ... that does some vocal and Rainier or is it just ... or ...\nOr just she'll do the Philadelphia ...\nYeah yeah so when we do the vocal ... I think it's important for everyone to sing like alive group like they did\nIn the sixties and seventies you know um when I when I write up the demos that kind of do it gladiator style like acoustic gladiator style with all the harmony so we go into the sessions that it's really important that everybody kinda knows their their spot and we use different vocalist just to get different tonality on different colors you know I'm so we have Alex\nOn a on pretty much all the backing of vocals for the for the album um I think I don't know if you didn't vocals on the phone rock stone but I think he's on pretty much everything else in a non wherever they aren't you put some colors on there and John ... from the expand or is there um I don't know for for ...\nBut it's a very they do all the backing vocals as well so they were\nDoing for part harmonies sometimes it's three part harmony sometimes it's two part it just really depends on what the song but like ... that was like a four part harmony between Alix John Chiquita myself you know\nAnd uh did you write that one in particular who wrote a ... I\nDid and uh how um how heavily we listen to Bob Marley in the winters when you did that early Bob Marley\nOh man I I I'm getting everything I I did back everything on the grades as far as\nOJ reggae I mean I'm a big all now that span Cornell Campbell dobie option ... bleachers mhm they bark or in the upset or is it I mean a treasure all the Treasure Island stuff declaring donations Peter Austin I mean you name it there's so much influence and I think people only big as far as the ... but\nThere was a lot of groups that influence the way ... there was a ... the way there's influence while the other group so I I just think it's cool to tune into those sounds and and and take a piece of history and I try to recreate it make it your own what you learn from those those those records\nWell that tune a chin up as a animal is going up for you it's one of the best ah ah well one of the better selling tracks or from the album I speaking with Jimmy Thomas from junior Thomas in the volcanoes they have a brand new album that was released yesterday\nOr on the coal mine records label out of Chicago and there is excuse me out of the Ohio or in a way that shouldn't have son when I first heard that I have to tell you I've got some I've got some chills man for a minute there I thought I\nMet him some early whale there's I mean seriously that's\nHow beautiful that is will play that little bit for those of you who missed it a couple of weeks ago will definitely play that again I'm also a big fan of uh the song Mr Harriet looking at my notes here I Love what a shame I loved chin up uh I Love\nA chill you're gone a rock stone the title track a second time around which\nYou kicked off I'm a ... interview with hearing about ten to twelve thirty something or other and the other one that's under my voice right now phony one you want to talk about that for a little bit and then we'll we'll bring it up a cause that is definitely one of my favorite oh cool\nYeah it was a it was a fun arrangement um you know I wanted to add something like sound dimension type orange to the tune so we got Tom cooking Brian Wallace a to do luge or Saks and trombone I'm\nSo we cut that those those horns than I Am about an hour um and that was pretty much the only over do the horns of the strings in the end the horns of the only over does it really did everything else is pretty much track live and you know I I have to have the songs already when I go to the session sorry I write as many as I can and then I just\nYou know we have about two days to do my band and then we have two days to do vocals and then um\nAnd then that's the one I thought we've always done it like you guys don't know the songs until I get here I like everyone just to react instead of like listening over thinking and whatever I think the best the best found is that raw found them people just react to what they hear and that's that's kind of what you hear when you hear volcanoes record it's just a reaction from\nThe one that they might have heard Fifteen minutes ago\nIn which to deal with that that you recorded Sony won\nAll we recorded all the songs in uh Los Angeles at the volcano lounge it's Bryan Dixon ... studio mhm I'm it's no more but um\nAre you actually just moved to Seattle but uh he did a lot of recording era Brian used to be\nIn the band the agar lights and then he did so recordings or perhaps carry it when they're kind of pushing into that pushing talk show there are like I think he did on the region like the original region mix um that was burned diction so I I think he's kind of a staple in LA ah reggae and uh I think he's a huge asset to the project\nYeah I I see that you know you can and credit for giving us some engineering work and mixing and he also contributed some guitar to that as well yeah All right let's listen to the wind yeah go ahead yeah it was going to say Lou let's listen to a phony one but you are going to say something about right\nNo I just like love the way Bryon played man 'cause a lot of guys like they they play their um rhythm guitar so spinning Brian hits it real hard like a studio one guitar player and\nOh it's it's hard for people to get that or I Would like you know like how do you get that sounds like that I looked at a dream that he's got like strings all mixed up there in the different uh we'll find out about their\nLives to listen to forty one from
