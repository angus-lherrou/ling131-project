had been working for the pope in Rome and for a whole series of interesting political reasons or things got hot for the pope in Rome and defy left smart musician um he spent actually a little bit of time and and the Dutch have some way [noise]\nUm this is a civil way is currently sort of the\nBorder area of Switzerland and France are sort of just north of the Alps\nAnd ah this became actually a place that defy worked uh for several several points in his career but by fourteen thirty six he was actually back in Italy are working for the pope pope Eugene IOUs the fourth and he at this time the pope was not living in in Rome purple\nComplicated political reasons\nBut in Florence and to defy it made it to Florence in time to witness and take part in what I think was must have been one of the great artistic events of the early renaissance\nAnd that's the Consecration of the dome of Santa Maria del Fiore a Florence Cathedral this enormous masonry dome or one of the great sort of engineering accomplishments of the early renaissance\nAnd it's sort of dominates a low dominates floor and still dominate dominated line e photograph you've seen a flood right\nYeah this this is designed by feel equal Bruno Laskey one of these great sort of renaissance\nArchitect artists and you find wrote actually not only a piece of plane chance for that ceremony which was obviously a very lavish ceremony\nA hosted by the pope but also a very famous mo tat this is the most had called ... and if\nIf I have a greatest hits a this is probably it uh this is the piece that everybody who teaches a music appreciation class if they mentioned you fired all of this is the peace they do um\nAnd also say it's a piece it's probably the piece about which are more scholarly ANC has been spilled\nThan just about any peace in the fifteenth century and a lot of the uh\nSome arguments about this piece center on the relationship of the piece that defy wrote and the\nBuilding itself um there was a theory in Nineteen seventies I was very exciting that actually traced the proportions of this motel at which has four large sections which are related rhythmically but there have different lengths\nI'm to the actual proportions of the cathedral a safer\nPortions you mean the width and the highest\nIn the high end and the height of the downright so forth um what about twenty or twenty five years later\nI'm music colleges named Craig right came along and actually came up with a counter argument that in fact what if I was emulating was not the cathedral rather the proportions of the ... the temple Solomon ...\nUm what most people think is these days is it's probably a common combination of both um but you know do you hear these proportions when you listen to the ... now of course you know but you you get the sense that if I was well aware of the import of this and actually sort of included that\nSomehow into his his peace\nAnd actually that is true and I have a lot of music that was written in the renaissance that there are\nA lot of mathematical things going on that only other musicians would recognize if they sat down and looked at it you would never hear you know and I so written make\nA piece unless you were really really heavily into that kind of music you would not be able to hear the fact that some ... making some a lot of patterns repeated in sunny ways\nA similarly the promotions and this is you don't hear it but it's there and so other main composers other musicians would look at it and say wow this guy's really clever as well as being right a good writer and\nAs I as I always joke to my students that say you can imagine them sort of in the choir nudging each other and the ribs you know pointing that out to one another this sort of secret meaning ...\nThen that's true even like to Johann Sebastian Bach shrill writer [noise] okay so I'm Sorry\nInteresting I I go to Alan beforehand that I have nine recordings of how this happens to be my favorite this is the recording to marry him\nAnd then they a little bit of a plot to marry him will be coming to Milwaukee in December for the music now not that I'm sure to sing this it's Christmas

I watched it on the air the American mind Arab Americans mind in Dearborn asking what will the Arab festival look like when he returns to um Dearborn remember last year there was a cancellation due to conflict in Ramadan\nBetween Nineteen Ninety five and two thousand and solve thousands of people did it at the capital of the Arab America right here in America [laughter] as a substitute for their homeland for taste of their homeland\nOr in Dearborn, Michigan the three day Arab festival has been called the largest gathering of Arab Americans it drew in three times you're born population of nearly Ninety thousand it was also kind of a celebration\nWhere Arab world superstars and Mediterranean Food vendors coming from all over the U.S [noise] promoted the richness and the beauty of the Arabic culture and the musicians we came from all over the world for that matter not just us the food was us vendors\nHowever the festival was canceled when American Arab chamber of commerce faced um higher level a liability insurance costs because of drawing tension would ah intruders that we're fighting Muslims right there at the door\nAnd that was a for the better [laughter]\nYou could explain that like this if that's where the Arab Americans are and you have something to say to them good or bad you go there and you will get a license\nTo your show show show showing one\nShow was what was so groups with anti Arab Muslim declarations began to visit frequently and protest or\nI'm yelling at people parked right there at the entrances [noise] ah so um they couldn't just to help them with the gym need to drive them away or the Arab Americans you mean mhm all it's a high concentration of them than if you start throwing things you may hit your own people\nWell collider enough they're outside you know defend it like a world for for a while it became a loud and public\nA demonstration of who wants to hate Arabs more marriage jak or Riley told the Arab American news about the numerous accommodations made to keep the festival going for years prior to his cancellation\n[noise] ah quotes for any festival and so on you can limits an area of space for people who wants to give voice to whatever and create the practice of free speech and of course that's what the mayor said yet the only reason they came is to be disruptive and we dealt with it best\nAs we can [noise] of I Believe we're reporting this story about somebody walking in with a\nA a pig's head on a stick you remember that [laughter]\nThat was one of my the funniest stories I heard [noise]\nBut there are few court cases where the city is being sued and the judge said that uh if the places open for other things aside from the event like business owners and vendors than the whole event has to be open and he couldn't put a limitation on who can walk through\nA he emphasized the mere emphasized his concern about having these intruders chase children with disturbing signs are that have a food that shouldn't be on them\nLike a pig's head [laughter] once important decision was made\nThe festival would have been held on to warn avenue and open for everyone it couldn't be used as a station to limit access to other people so we hope that in a in time the when Ramadan doesn't coincide with the timing of this festival that I Would come back and now\nSome of the biggest biggest in American a hatred as a as we did simmered down a little bit of it and the next few years [laughter] [laughter] well you know I'm I'm optimistic when it comes to that\nMirror Riley why we're on the topic talks about representing air but America or Dearborn over the past few decades Dearborn has become the United states most densely kind of a concentrated Arab American city\nUh one defining metaphor is melting pot of immigrants from around the globe\nBut what does it mean to city officials to represent Air America this missing mirror Riley is not in their hands the last lame yeah you'll Risch ish it's okay [laughter] he uh he has represented the ...\nOr just woke of Arab American wholesale the concentration in a way without\nThe fence outside [laughter] here why should we\nFrom I'm going to talk to Mr

same aspirations\nAnd then we get we got applause here to me [laughter] is it going to see it on and lewd [laughter]\nOr we do ah but I mean we're we're we live a couple of minutes of the ... and ...
