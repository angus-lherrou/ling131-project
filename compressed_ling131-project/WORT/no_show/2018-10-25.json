Walker gun got the courage going in a chance to Tony taxes will cost jobs what uh I I don't know about anything that I'm I'm proposing there will might cost us jobs\nI Know this is just the thing it\nThe problem is that everything all the problems we have in the society are boiled down to\nMoney being taken out of ... you were my pocket and will I have a source of livelihood now these are important issues but we got huge other issues that we are looking at at all\nYou can you speak a little bit to the the movement if you will um\nThat Dan is talking about yes what what is\nWell I mean I mean or bonding in Hungary is part of it I mean he went to the Oregon too it seems like he's really promoting or that sort of nationalist approach to things about you know keeping\n... each nation having its own right and um there was just this big a thing in the ... you are about sanctioning hungry for its immigration\nPolicies and there was a big debate in Italy about whether they were gonna indoors with the European Union parliament was saying that all hungry\nAnd to basically sanction hungry for for taking these for adopting policies of preventing any immigrants from coming in and and not I'm not respecting the the definition of what asylum um means within ill allowing you know the way Germany did\nThe ... more and more refugees in Hungary and saying no you know we're not going to do that and uh that that's going on at the Austrian government now too as a fairly right wing Nate sort of native of national as a guy in power Kurt ...\nAnd and he is a sort of saying the same thing you\nKnow and that's going on a across Europe right now\nAnd um and the the left here in Italy anyway which I'm seeing more than understand a little bit more than other parts of Europe you know is trying to\nTo push back against that I mean there's supposed to be rallies across Italy this weekend um concerning immigration\nI'm not sure they're going to come together because it depends on the activists in each\nOf these coming from the last year region up yeah this is coming from the unions and from\nSort of the the local of people who are part of of non government organizations and leftist political groups like we have in the U.S that are are trying to that are welcoming immigrants and um [noise]\nAnd so they're pushing back against that but but there's still I mean they're they're I think they're able to get people out into the squares but they're not able to affect policy\n... now what what can you see 'em a similarities between what's going on there in this country are you seeing that there are also studying to attack a labor laws are the\nKind of yeah but I asked him a little bit to me right it's a little bit\nMore complicated I mean the the unions in the union he\nAnd then there's like three big unions here than a much larger majority of the of the workers here in Italy or sell organized but they they have\nIncreasingly less power and the the government to power right now are limiting their ability I'm not sure it's somewhat capability that to bargain as the ability to\nUm to enforce the contracts right that they have already um by passing laws that limit\nThe ability of hum of employers to\nHire people on a temporary basis then you can go get union um light so there's that and then there's this whole welfare we're kind of welfare reform thing going on with her like welfare to work we had in Wisconsin\nWhere they're claiming that they're providing a I'm a guaranteed income to people who are poor but actually it means that they have to accept any job that the government off or something and if they don't and they don't get the money\nWell wherever I heard that before Steve Bannon in Europe are organizing and a push in some sort of agenda there I guess we'll just have to keep a close eye on a deal I Want to thank you very much for your report I'm Sorry we couldn't make the connection earlier um\nYeah okay well we're well next time if we do it again won't try to get it cleared beforehand man\nTake care of your house they are by thinking in a crisis Milan, Italy intimate I'm going to speak with Arnold Gonzales and then we're going to talk to Randy Bryce a first congressional district candidates\n\n\nOn a\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nNo no\nNo I'm On the\nNo no\nNo no\n[noise] say forty three and your ...

yet we're playing that Latin fast on\nWhat we're going to be able to put some checks and balances on him that's what that's what it that's why it's so important to take back control of Congress because right now Paul Ryan has been speaker of the White House he hasn't been speaking out on behalf of the house of representatives\nAnd and I can't believe what is going on and what Donald Trump is being allowed to do we need to stop what's going on and and we can do it it was written in the ...\nThan to have checks and balances so that Congress can put an end to having you know a president like we have now [noise] um so that's that's the first thing we're going to be able to hold them accountable um and then stop the craziness\nMm okay I'm speaking with Randy Bryce first congressional a district a candidate\nA people are wondering well why do you got 'em in Madison we can't vote for you here in Madison but our listening audience goes all the way down to northern Illinois and uh south

had had they not tried to shut us up through gerrymandering [noise] um or through redistricting or taking away people's you know the the votes mhm I'm\nThat's what it's about it's about wanting to be hurt so\nI I got to meet some of the best people in the world during the during those times I mean we've all stayed in touch and and now we're seeing more people\nBecome active as a result of Donald Trump getting elected trust and and um but it's about being able to get people together listening to people and getting our voices United to send a message that you know what's going on is unacceptable this is working people should be able to be taking care of we need\nWorking people to represent us and and that's the whole reason why I'm running a because we haven't been we haven't

[laughter] yeah\nAt a you know the tradition of having multiple choices and people actually being more ... more honest and who they're voting for a results in a lot of concerns and so right choice voting was sort of a natural fit for me so in ...\nSixteen or a group of Maine activists got rain choice voting put on the ballot or they voted for it a majority of Maine voters voted in favor of having rain choice voting and they used it for the first time this past June or its run into\nSome opposition which ultimately led to a legal challenge which then led to unfortunately the governor and state legislature contests being stripped from it so when voters go to vote in Maine in November they'll get to rank their choices for Senate and for their house of representatives district\nBut unfortunately there still be stuck having to just vote for one for governor and for state legislature even though the ... will have many many contests so I'm hoping that something they'll be able to fix after the twenty sixteen election so that they can apply right choice voting to all the contests\nThat there will be ... interesting experience and experiment so people have a chance of seeing what rink to his ... he was like on the scene bell for federal offices on the same boat as the ... officers do the traditional oh more than ...\nThat's right and that's that's not totally uncommon a most places that use ranked choice voting you would be voting for something else the same time so also in June this year California held its primary elections and the city of San Francisco at the same time was holding a special election for its mayor\nAnd the San Francisco is one of the cities that uses wrong choice voting so voters were ranking their choices for mayor in San Francisco\nAt the same time they were participating in California's\nTop two primary race which is where all the candidates are listed you vote for one and then the two but the most votes will be the ones that proceed to the November election or ... another system that uh uh is used in a minority of places um and\nWhat we saw was that\nActually more voters voted in the mayoral election in San Francisco then voted in the Senate and uh uh that the Senate primary concern that was the top ticket item and voters\nSome voters I mean I I ... I don't know exactly how many of those\nBut some voters actually skipped the Senate race to vote in the city race\nOr an did not participate in the Senate race we also saw more ballot errors\nIn the Senate race that in the rain choice voting race one concern that people have with rain choice voting sometimes is that uh because voters are asked to rank their choices and there may be not used to ranking their choices that they will make mistakes about what we see when we actually\nLook at the results is that they they don't not at not in any higher rates than UC and vote for one contest grin California's Senate primary had a huge number of candidates and that that is something that leads to\nBallot air if you have a you know twenty plus candidates on the ballot um voters sometimes think they're voting in two different contests and wind up making two marks [noise] um but more air\nIs much more errors in that race than in the brain joy sweating raised in San Francisco specifically\nInterest so drew can you walk us through a typical much like for example paper ballots being really essential for these people are belts typically um what's the bill will quick\nYes everywhere that uses rain choice voting do so with paper ballots [noise] um what the ballot will look like is essentially a grid\nSo you'll have the candidates listed on the left and then you'll have a column of bubbles for your first choice and you mark one candidate for your first choice and the next to that you have a column of levels for your second choice you fill in your second choice your third choice and so on a for however many candidates there are\nAnd uh that's it you you take that paper ballot after falling and I went to Penn put it in the machine a as with other ballots if you have made a mistake the machine will alert you you'll have an opportunity to fix it but\nOtherwise you you put it in and then uh\nYou know it gets counted and you'll see the results the results are usually also presented in the form of a table where you've got the first round results and if somebody has a majority that's it they win if\nNobody has majority then you'll see that last place candidate eliminated and you'll see where you know who that can that its supporters ranked second seals\nYou bet the vote totals change in the ... and the subsequent runoff around one after the next we present it's a little difficult to to to describing just words but one thing that we find in our messaging is that if you show people an image of the ballot they immediately say oh okay\nYou know that's a ... you get this accusation that it's going to be confusing but what we see is that when people see the ballot when they use the system they have no problems with it right ranking things is something we do every day as a normal part of decision making so it's it's really not hard\nAnd in by looking at the those results after the election I Would imagine it's no possible for people to see sort of how would break stone support by parties and who the winners coalition partners essentially are\nThat's true although uh none of the places using ... and right now with the sole exception of the state of Maine are doing so in part is elections\nSo these are all non partisan elections it's still there still is absolutely helpful to see how those coalitions breakdown because you know people are not partisan elections disagree with each other to San Francisco was actually a good example of that where a San Francisco is actually fairly divided not between Republicans and Democrats but between\nA a centrally a group of people\nThat believe that we need that uh San Francisco needs to do a lot more active development and a group of people who believe that those resources should instead be be uh put into a sort of\nAddressing problems with homelessness and poverty in and that sort of thing and those are very you know there's\nThere's real tensions between those two communities but what we saw in San Francisco's mayor or race is that you could have more than one candidate from those factions and that didn't result and vote splitting or rather the vote spending was resolved over the course of the rounds\nWow so we're talking about ... a year to the ... we're talking with drew in rules law and policy director of fear votes if you don't know ... to ... dot org it's a great organization and I urge you to check remote tomorrow rink choice sporting another way of ...\nElections both democracy um\nSo drew I I was noticing all the\nEditorials in favor currently of of rink choice voting um the capital of journal from Topeka, Kansas the daily ... out of New Hampshire\nEven USA Today the Connecticut near Boston Globe and perhaps the only time you ever hear me I'm indoors David Brooks David Brooks editorial with the New York times um in many many more harm it seems as you said ... when he was having a moment\nThat's right so if you look at for example the David Brooks piece the title of that piece is the one reform to save American democracy and that's kind of the tone that we're that we're hearing from people as people are very concerned\nAbout what's going on at American democracy today or in a winner take all system there's not much room for different ideas to come in and make changes so when you start seeing people being fractured among different\nFactions in a winner take all system that creates real tension ... uh and that can that can be a a real problem for our politics are and also you know when you're only allowed to vote for one when you think of what that means for candidates\nOr they don't care about the voters that aren't going to vote for them there is no rain right second uh for them to care about\nThe low\n... I think we just we just lost drew we're going to get drew back in the moment ... got dropped and many is this you\nKnow\nWe are having below below this many many many um we're we just accidentally went to you and dropped drew I guess some of 'em [laughter] so you know my ... so let's talk about rank towards voting many um\nGood well I'd had questions ... ... errors if there were errors in the process and I wondered what would what I just didn't know whether there were different rules that apply like let's say someone who\nWanted a candidate could they vote for it that candidate as their first and second and third choice or is that one of the errors that would get knocked out\nOh you know then it's an interesting question because I think ... or [laughter] why that\nWas blocking it but they got a new election administrator recently and and the new election administrator said you know we can do this and so they were getting ready to implement it and then the city council suddenly said well I'm not not so sure about that and uh they've done various things to try to delay or kill it\nUh and ultimately Memphis voters they're going to have a three\nBallot measures to vote on for their city or in two weeks one of them is gone\nAll of them would eliminate bring choice voting and keep things the way that they've been doing it one of them would eliminate ranked choice voting and also get rid of runoff election so that those are both to separate kill ring choice voting bills\nAnd then the third one would actually lifted their own term limits\nSo as sort of the sort of the city council pushing back against um the will of the the uh the term limits also were implemented in two thousand eight when the city passed during choice voting so the the city sort of pushing back\nAgainst their own voters and the things that their voters were trying to do so I I ...\nThe they and they did lots of kinda sneaky things too so if you look at the wording of the ballot initiatives it's very confusing\nOr the the term limits one for example if you were to just read it blind you would think it was imposing term quit when our moon posing a longer term limits than the one that is currently in place so I'm at my hope is that the the voters Memphis see through that I\nRealized that uh\nThat that this is you know this is this is a shady business going on and just vote no on all three ballot measures will find out in November but but uh things have been pretty positive otherwise you know the the attempt to\nOne of the attempts to kill it in Maine resulted in being back on the ballot in June so voters used during choice voting and then immediately voted on whether they wanted to continue using ring choice voting and it easily passed a majority voted in favor of continuing to use\nRanked choice voting so I I'm optimistic but there are there are efforts to to try to stop at one thing I Will say is that once it goes into place a lot of that drives up so\nSanta Fe use strength choice waiting for the very first time this march\nSanta Fe had also fought it being implemented for awhile including going through the courts and ultimately going all the way up to the state Supreme Court to fight it they lost the court said the voters passed it you'd have to implement it they did and the results has been really nothing but positive\nOr read the people elected under it the voters there's just been in a sort of outpouring if you read the report from the city officials who are some of the most ...\nThe coal ones the city staff ... uh it says you know we had concerns we tried to push this off and make it not happen this year but ultimately we did it and ultimately it went really well then that's that's the report from their own city staff\nWow well do we have a caller petty who wants to join the conversation soon will come petty to the conversation I birds hey how are you I'm fine how are you good he's got a question for drew ticket a week\nI Do um and my question is if your your work with um ranked choice voting if you're also doing any work into hurting voting day into a federal holiday\nThat's a great question so\nFair vote has taken the lead on some of what we call access reforms\nSo that is to say reforms that help people actually get to the ballot box and help them be able to cast that ballot or\nWe have for now sort of past that work on to a lot of other really great organizations so the Brennan Center is out there doing this the lawyers committee for civil rights\nAre a whole bunch of common cause a whole slew of other really good organizations um we have become much more focused on making sure that when you cast your ballot that ballot conveys real political power\nSo that's become much more of our focus that said we still care about access reforms absolutely a election day holiday is is sort of a sort of an easy yes uh from the way the way that I see it I mean it's\nIt doesn't impose many costs on us as a society are a lot of places now are doing more and more early voting and vote by mail which is almost more of\nGetting rid of an election day altogether having sort of an election weaker in some cases it's almost like an election month [noise] um but different communities have had different approaches a to giving voters greater access to the ballot and absolutely we support those measures\nRoute you before lunch thanks Burt oh You're welcome any other questions petty\n[noise] um well kind of going back to um the design of of the ballot Ken Ken the ballot\nAnd if you follow it universal design so that there would be no incidents like we had in Florida I'm with you know the design of various ballots being so so different\nOh my goodness yes absolutely so ah we work with a group called the center for civic design that does a lot of this kind of work and they work with lawmakers in various states on trying to make their ballots better and\nWe asked them you know how what is what is the approach to rank ballots that will make sure that voters understand what they're doing that they're able to cast a kind of vote that they want without making mistakes and the center for seven design what their approaches is to ask people to basically ... drop a bunch of different approaches to balance\nA go into you know community centers or or outside of churches or if there's an election going on you know outside of polling places or something like that and just have people practice with them you know said these are the candidates\nSo usually have sort of ... names and queue made up to that\nPolicy positions and uh the voters actually cast the ballot and then they ask them you know how to where you're trying to vote did how did you feel about that is\nWhat they identified was that there is nothing really special about ranked ballots voters understand how to rank things so long as the ballot follows all the other normal pieces of advice\nFor ballot design and that's and none\nOf that's like uh all that magical it's just things like you know uses and Sarah Fontaine ... you know have have the tax be big enough to read and have visuals when you're talking about uh the the ballot instructions\nAnd all that kind of thing what they found is that if you do those things\nThen voters generally get uh the voting machine vendors are a little slow and picking up all of these tips but things are absolutely getting better or we haven't seen anything quite as agree just as the butterfly ballot from from Florida\nUm since then help America vote act the election assistance commission those have all sort of become forces that have made things a little bit better in the area of ballot design\nUh but things generally have improved a lot there\nI think you have anything else you hurt your ... or it's always good to have you on me or [laughter] ... so so true um Deuce some pleases eliminate primary elections do the ... most of the older one election\nYes it's the cities that use non partisan elections waiting now using ranked ballot there's\nYeah they're they're usually they're ... usually three approaches you can take to a nonpartisan election one is you just have every one vote for one of the candidates and the one with the most votes wins another as you hold the primary election where people vote for one and then the two candidates what the most votes go on to the general election\nWhich is the Madison ...\nOkay yeah ah and then the third is is sort of the flipside of that you hold the general election between all the candidates and then if nobody gets a majority hold as a runoff election a little while later\nNow the trouble with the system that you you described Madison is using where you've got that primary is that a while there's a couple of difficulties with that one is that the primaries tend to have very low and on representative turnout ... so we've seen that in places that had this system that the primary turnout is usually about half\nOf what you get in the general election turnout and it also tends to skew more towards\nA older whiter wealthier voters in general um and that can create problems the other is that even though two are going to go on to the next election you can still wind up with a split vote spoiler type issue\nWhere both of the two that make it to the general election or are not ones that would be very representative of the community as a whole ... so we've seen that in places for example of a black majority cities\nUh with racially polarized voting you'll see a maybe five or six black candidates run two or three white candidates and then the general election is only between two of the white candidates because the more you split too much\nAmong the African American community or not that kind of thing really happens you know so ... can help resolve that and and yes one place\nDoes that have that system have gone to rain choice voting they've typically eliminated that primary election which adds another benefit terrain choice vote in which is that it actually saves the community money\nExactly so making making the change they're able to eliminate an entire election including all of\nThe costs associated with that and then they don't have that low turnout primary elections so they have greater turnout at in a decisive election and they don't they don't need to worry about vote
