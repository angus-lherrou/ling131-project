the bad news according to some in the right wing there is a fatal flaw in our constitution majority rules that here's the good news we are the majority well how to report on a new book that looks at why the rate is trying to put democracy in chains\nAction team members may be knocking on your door right now this weekend to Madison and all across the state progress as are working to get out the

all these stories and more on the October fourteenth twenty Eighteen edition of her attorney\nWe heard her we saw her we believed her\nStatus Toronto ... founder of the me too movement saying why she and other advocates wrote a love letter to Christine Blasey Ford doctor for described her sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh in detail to the Senate Judiciary committee but Kavanaugh was sworn in last week to the U.S Supreme Court anyway\nThe letter also says quote you showed a world of discounted people what courage looks like you showed us that survival is ongoing and that the journey well fraud is essential you reminded us that we are neither powerless nor alone because we have\nTruth and each other unquote if you'd like to read the entire letter and sign it go to meet two am the T. dot org\nSon people including the president of the United states call Brett Kavanaugh a victim of false reporting of sexual assault these so called victims are now known on Twitter as hash tag him to\nThis is similar to the black lives matter movement being countered by all lives matter when the me too movement started to was used to describe the one in six men who were victims of sexual assault [noise]\nNow it is almost the opposite studies show that false reporting of sexual assault is rare but that hasn't stopped some people from saying men must be retracted from these lives\nIt seems inevitable that the voices of the many women who have really set up and said to me to would now be drowned out by people who worry about men's lives and careers being rear end\nStatistics show that over a twenty five year period men are Fifteen times more likely to be falsely convicted of murder them falsely convicted of rape\n[noise] it's all connected taking over the Supreme Court enacting voter suppression gerrymandering congressional districts\nMaking people think Social Security is bankrupt calling Medicare socialized medicine these tactics didn't come out of nowhere her turn reporter Orleans out to talk to an author who connected the dots\nAnd all started after brown versus board of education the Supreme Court decision that mandated all public schools be desegregated\nRather then integrate the state of Virginia closed all its public schools in the kind of missed James Buchanan saw his opportunity for the next six years in a strategy called massive resistance\nThe state of Virginia used the cannons idea to issue tax funded vouchers so white kids could go to private academies instead it took more court action and public outrage to end this scheme\nAfter court ruled against the massive resistance school closures\nAfter there'd been a massive mobilization of white parents particularly mothers\nAnd liberal clergy against the school closures Buchanan a colleague came out with a report urging the privatization essentially of schools using tax voucher so it would affect us was to PHD economists making an economic space case for what they are most states most arch segregation us we're seeking\nThat's Duke University history professor Nancy McLean all through the book democracy in chains she had intended to write about the history of public education\nI ended up on a research trail that led me to Charles Koch\nWhy Charles Koch guy to learn\nThat Charles Koch and James Buchanan had known one another at least since Nineteen Seventy and that Buchanan\nHad worked with many of the organizations that coke had subsidized including the federalist society that Kato Institute Heritage Foundation and many more and also that coke in his quest to transform our country knowing that most people don't want\nThat kind of world he's tried to bring it to being decided that you can ends ideas his school of thought could be weaponized\nCoke and you can and libertarian philosophy includes free market fundamentalism and property supremacy\nBefore becoming involved with the Koch network you can and took his ideas to Chile and it's nice the Pinochet dictatorship to be can in all things public are in an asthma he scoffs at the idea of the time and good are U.S Constitution according to the canon has a fatal\nFlaw it supports majority rule\nFor him it's all about individual rights says McLean but only certain individuals\nOnly minority I ever saw him being concerned with what is the wealthy minority and corporate interests that didn't share the public's understanding of what the common good was and resented the fact that they would be taxed\nOr regulated for the things that public wanted whether it was cleaning up the our air and water or providing drug benefits for seniors or having anti discrimination laws or any of these that the libertarians perceive that to be a threat to\nTheir economic liberty and kind of outrage\nThat's not how most people feel about our schools our roads our libraries and the clean says these men no that\nCharles Koch and James Buchanan in particular but other top architects of this cause have adopted the stealth strategy\nThey have it because they understand there are a permanent minority their ideas are not popular most people would never want to live in the world that they are trying to create and therefore they cannot openly say what that world looks like because people will try anything to do anything to stop it\nIf they don't have an annex by her driver's license or id than they need to register by paper form and they can go to any public library in Madison to do that and they need to bring proof of residence in order to get registered to vote\nA next step is to have a picture ID when you cast your ballot currently explains how that can be used as a voter suppression technique but it's not insurmountable the department of motor vehicles can issue\nPicture ID for free for the purpose of voting yeah we only have\nTwo offices in Madison you know once on the east side one's very far west to just move farther west and not very convenient for buses and so it's um again\nThat's a barrier that's been put up by the Walker administration to make it harder for people to get registered there is an organization called the voter id coalition they will give you a ride to the DMV they will go in with you if you're not sure if you have the right\nPaperwork they will be there with you every step of the way if if you're feeling really overwhelmed and intimidated by that process\nMe so early is part of the north side action team here in Madison\nWe are in a moment in time where we don't have all that many choices when it comes to voting and my feeling is I Want to cast a vote that is going to win [laughter] I really want to win at this point in history we need a when\nThere are Seventy action teams across the state if

around me and how to be a he's an international communication intercultural communication or the researcher a PHD candidate at Edwards educational leadership program so a Romney what brought you to Madison's\nWell you know I Am from Madison has a great friday reputation and the uh off it's not only I agreed to city for educational purposes is like one of the safest one of the most beautiful so you know it's cold it's\n[laughter] it's so far I've been up there [laughter] how how was\nThe transition from a climate similar to or like Saudi Arabia you're from the northern part of my ... radio which is a little bit more tempered tell us about your origin in an area of to book\nI'm a you know he was born\nIn a taboo and\nUm it's a beautiful little city I'm\nIn the northern part very close to Jordan ...\nI'm On the red sea so ah it is a I grew up in a a sort of a smaller family than average Saudi family and\nUm yeah I finished my undergraduate degree in Saudi Arabia in English and um came you decided to come to Wisconsin right\nEnough program right now and I can see when you told me what you're studying I said to myself initially we really need a quite a bit of intercultural communication primarily due to\nAh the lack of trust that has happened is taking place not just between countries around the world right here in America I think people culturally speaking\nAs we become more polarized polarized over some issues it's a typically black against white or vice versa or of the conflict is often between cultures\nMad at thirty this woman [laughter] more of an ... like I said to me\nBeing a cultural communicates war intercultural communicator that means you're familiar with the culture that you represent they use the euro part of\nAnd you have transition you've you've studied here for the last uh six seven years and you have become aware of some of the political shenanigans here in the U.S and a foreign policy and how some people on the streets feel about\nUh who we are as Arabs and as Arab Americans are part of this culture here in the in the west so still is a little a little bit about what you're studying specifically a in a maybe we'll move on to measure the bigger in depth analysis of [laughter] the Saudi a plan twenty thirty sure\nWell it's I'm I'm a\n... or in different cultures says the same thing ... uh like in our culture are staring at someone on there is\nNot a life [laughter] and here it's like you have to look at someone to show respect right now so [laughter] it's something that you have to learn I guess the [laughter] the different but\nWe are here today discussing something called the vision of two thousand and thirty vision\nOr where the uh Mohammed bin Salman acting prints the practical king a says that the Saudi Arabia is the heart of the Arab and Islamic world the investment power house and the hub\nConnecting three continents and it's uh I'm quoting him here saying it is my pleasure to present Saudi Arabia's vision\nFor the future I'm In the very ambitious\nOr as most of the bishops are yeah yeah you have a ... as a twelve years a little bit under twelve years and um\nIt's a big plan and in some cases somebody may say love yours is nothing compared to the history of humanity or this could be a hundred year vision we don't know\nWell let's look at that a little bit more yes well it's not\nOh a a hundred years you know it's you know the what a what you have you'll belch your project based on the resources you have the facts that you have fifty percent of of\nUh citizens under the age of twenty five or I'm Seventy five percent under the age of thirty five that's a very young the right it requires a different kind of approach to to uh\nUh your project so it's not a normal you don't have normal circumstance where you can just I'm a ... a plan according to\nA uh the older generation right so this is our changing rapidly and from what you see you think uh the what is the premise of this plan\nWill the premises to move forward it's just to to simplify it to make it just simple and the uh the\nIdea is to have a ... a prosperous society where you you young people have jobs you have problems with jobs you have a lot of them were just so the idea here yeah you'll have problems with the unique to compete in the vision is to can be it in a global international market so\nUh in order to do that there is a a a lot of work you have to move uh I'm from uh depending on oil money or welfare checks two\nCompeting in the international community and I'm\nSo there's a lot of that who you're trying to change that well there are a lot of things have been cemented and it is going towards the that a lot of 'em work it has been done people believe are which is the most important thing people believe in this and they're you know it's helped it's a\nUm a new vision that are at ... ... in every way not only economically which is the main um element but it's a um culturally too so you see a lot of uh uh you know women empowerment\nAnd when you talk about rising allowing women to drive for the first time in Saudi history happened last year right\nHow about when it comes to like the art and music and\nArt and music and all ... they have in fact the culture a culture ministry of\nAn industry is in charge of the party\nOf entertainment and but I like the Senate and the minister [laughter] what do you have to kind of plant based\nOn on a cultural what are the accepted and yeah I mean on cultural norms and and value so you can just a plan parties based on American values to me so [laughter] it's a and that's why you have to uh that's why the ... work it's been a\nVery very um\nEvery step taken his very a thoughtful because you have to lead\nSaid well can easily upset some people yeah you're right some of the young prince like this who had ambitions and ideas and well realizes that the wealth of Saudi Arabia in addition to having\nA the oil underground and natural resources and the site of the top of a ... a in mecca to the holy site to billions of Muslims around the world in uh the hydrogen the pilgrimage season\nA well those are all important elements that he recognizes that as the number one resource well all\nRight but in when you have this unique situation when you want to be a Muslim or Arab world sort of center in the middle east you know\nOn a political goals [laughter] [laughter] well you have to or have a\nA um ... you are you are have a unique situation so I ... the prince NBS or not we don't want to lose our identity but we want to merge with the global a culture so\nWhich is I the safe way to a joined the international community it's not like we can\nAll have the same um party\nYou know I Know I I feel like you've got to be willing to kinda like be a little bit more open and acceptance and you know I got a lot of the aisle you will you know we have a serious issue\nThe dust and like you know ... again with the distribution of values between genders you have women with no basically your rights so uh belittle or political or or other or ... or maybe social because you know uh it's\nUh I I'm not something that has been um\nWorked on it and that's why you have this vision there is a ... like prospect of goals that are um a place where you want this society to you know so it's better than just moving in a in a direction um\nAnd ... like everyone in I feel there is pretty excited about about about moving forward in fact I was just back there and you know I'm One of the biggest or ... or the biggest project\nFor the vision twenty thirty is really very close to my home town and it's like forty fifty miles an soy drove up there to see what's going on and\nIt's a village that is at a town or village or what are the compound\nOf Neal yeah what is Neal Neal means the city and you see oh so well with Andre ... where they're trying to do\nIt very global that it is a little ... yes it's a lot of injury industries ... ... ... the main goal\nOr it ... it kind of a ... economical support for you know a different resources of revenue [noise] um so it's a\nThis is in line with the second um pillar of the vision that was mentioned by is a a ... and cinnamon is that the second pillar of our vision is or determination to become a global investment powerhouse mhm\nOur nation hold strong investment capabilities which we will harness to stimulate our economy and diversity and diversify our revenue streams is are those are pretty powerful word it sounds like he's done some homework\nYeah yeah because the oil revenue may not last forever or the global market right now we're using so much of it the mid ... sounding the alarm that we have burned so much fossil fuel that if we stop now it'll take tens if not hundreds of\nYears I mean how big would area by a truck that she has idea behind it too is environment I'm On the environmental protection which I think is I mean well they they want to be a global leader\nFor ideas not just conservation but also creating alternative powers or solar power the beginner power over there inventing the the the power of the sea
