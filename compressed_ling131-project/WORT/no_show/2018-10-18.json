FM in Madison, Wisconsin your listeners sponsored community radio station my name's Tony custody on that stuff or the Thursday October the heck day does it today Eighteenth\nEmbassies are probably bugged back and forth between the states they had surveillance and they had audiotape and more and more is coming out\nAbout what was on them in one report said that somebody had cut off his fingers because showed his fingers or before killing him\nI mean the the details are absolutely grizzly they're horrible and I think in some ways this is what shocks people so much because it was such a ... in your face attack I mean this is an American residents with many connections to media\nPeople and and organizations\nAll over in the middle east and the United states and Europe are so he was not some he wasn't an unknown person who if we heard his name wouldn't Nina think anyone uh he was known and then these details about his fiance waiting outside for two hours which turned into eleven\nFirst um and that the Saudis changing their story two or three times first they said how he left\nYou know they didn't have any surveillance footage to show that he left it was all turned off the bond that day um which is you know this is such an enormous blunder by the Saudi regime that there's a part of me wonders what on earth were they\nThinking you know what what would inspire somebody to do to carry out that kind of an assassination and such an obvious and reckless matter\nRight which is okay well I mean ... to talk about it now if you you said that are most likely turkey does have some sort of recording because that embassy was bugs don't you also think that uh possibly other governments or maybe even the CIA\nIn a ... a had bugged the ah the little so\nYeah well one of the reports of course is that U.S intelligence had intercepted Saudi communications and which I'm\nCertain Saudi officials were trying to lure cause show have you back to Riyadh the capital of Saudi Arabia that this was before his um capturing killing in Istanbul but there was clearly some intelligence the fact that he was wanted back\nReasonably to be killed on President and\nSo we know that's true\nI'm sure there's all kinds of intelligence out there that exists cruise a lot of what is being said [noise] um\nBut no we're not going to hear about that we're not going to get the inside details of the Turkish surveillance system I mean there was a report recently that\nInformation about such that show gets death how'd you do you know it was retrieved off his apple watch and now that sympathetic story but the number of obviously and\nYou know there are lots of there's there's a lot to sort through but I think that the main story line is very clear skies\nInto the embassy was murdered there by a Fifteen member hit squad the Saudi Government the the top leadership NBS knew exactly what was happening is probably almost certainly commanded it ordered it one of the top level uh one of us Fifteen\nUh men hit squads I'm from Saudi Arabia was a close a security guard of of\nM. B. S. more security official he was part of the security detail another person who is in this um hit squad which is really kind of chilling was if there was one of the top\nForensics doctors in Saudi Arabia who arrived with of bones sauce\nSo he knew how to cut out bodies he was an autopsy expert\nAnd you know this is an old road group going over to a standstill as Trump is trying to suggest now who is not real security member of\nEnvious and the detail atop forensics doctor or a number of other people associated with security system and the police in this\nUh hit squads that's not a ... those are dot rogue elements are coming straight from the from the top and this was a very carefully coordinated even the planes that carried them or to assemble we're a state owned you Saudi owned [noise]\nMy personally own Saudi planes one of them went back to the UAE eat which is the United Arab Emirates very close ally of Saudi Arabia the other went back through Cairo the other very close ally of of\nSaudi Arabia and the whole thing is is just it's chilling it's creepy and I I'm Glad that it's getting the media attention that it's getting because it's showing its giving us an image of the kind of government and person uh that Saudi Arabia has\nBut I Want to say one thing and that is that as much attention as this is get\nIt bothers me that\nThe war in Yemen which has cost tens of thousands of lives and put twenty two point two million people at risk for starvation has gotten less attention and the last three years then this murder of a show he has gotten in the last ten days\nAnd will this Wallace had the ... will this help with the murder of cars show your disappears will ... will this help bring a light to ah the Saudi behavior into Yemen\nWell that's kind of what I'm hoping because\nYou know this is getting I think I don't think NBS ever counted on this kind of attention I mean he's not getting any attention when you refer starving to death or creating a famine and yeah and then\n... there's been no attention on the cholera and diphtheria uh epidemics and the ... I mean the the famine marathon unbelievable we don't know anything about that and\nThese are much greater crimes in a certain sense I mean I'm not going to say one thing that you know in a scale of it it's a horrible\nAnd it's an unbelievably awful situation in Yemen yes oh yes yes what I was\nGoing to say just quickly that I Hope the attention on she could show the and the way the Saudis the have does bring other crimes of their to light especially the war in Yemen\n... now what does a Donald Trump being president in the relationship is Trump family has with the Saudi regime um in NBS as you as you are calling him\nThis is kind of given a green light a to a ... did they give a green light to the Saudi regime that they could just go ahead and murder of a U.S resident to uh actually actually was a correspondent for the the official paper of the of our nation's capital of the Washington Post\n'em right what what about that\nWell I don't think that Trump\nGave them a green light from murder to show the what I think it's that Trump has given Saudi Arabia a green light for doing just about anything\nOnce a long time ago and there was no reason for the Saudis to assume he would object\nTo the killing of the show is publicly yes of course she said I'm very strong language it's a bad situation but now that sounds exactly like Trump now he's saying he's talking about you know how people have to be innocent until proven guilty\nOr not guilty until proven innocent like a Cavanaugh I mean literally his comparison yes I don't have it yeah there's no he's\nNot the relationship between us and Saudi Arabia will not change significantly in any way publicly they will be more open condemnation especially in Congress\nAnd over time I you know it's possible that the image of Saudi Arabia will a road even further but most people don't know anything about Saudi Arabia if they did they would be horrified that it was that\nIt's our number one or two ally in the middle east\nWe're speaking with Jennifer Lawrence the news they associate professor of Middle Eastern studies at Penn State university also the before that a long time\nActivist from a member of the ah was rough a sister city projects here in Madison, Wisconsin and speaking of which is where all all of our eyes are are turned towards the Saudi consulate in Turkey a\nThe Gaza Strip [laughter] what what is going on there ... meanwhile\nMass and the rest of the middle east is yes\nUm and that's interesting because a lot of very important and\nScary whatever you want to call it\nEvents are happening right now in the middle east almost every day and they're being obscured by this particular event\nThat's fairly typical of a sudden you know it's it's not a good idea for us to take our our attention off what's happening in Syria on God's Iraq or he ran for that matter the Gaza Strip is it is\nA you know it's hard to put into words what the Gaza Strip\nPeople call it the greatest open air prison in the world I think that's used very often I think it's accurate I think it's also a Turkish shift every every Friday for the last six months or\nAnd so it's a very traditional focus on on TV and the technology allows this company that we get the data from what's called the ... to ah to capture those spots when there are and then we get the big sort of data set that tells us when\nAnd how often the different sponsors aired ads and so we can see exactly what you what your referencing which is set I'm Scott Walker's out advertising Tony Evers\nBy a fair amount and that remains true all the way through the middle of this month based on the data we're seeing\nNow I've noticed a ... a month ago or so Scott Walker was trained\nI mean he was my ... depending on which poll you were looking at anywhere from a five to seven a percentage points\nIn that time in the last three weeks ago he was caught up a century where we are in a dead heat if you will um I have noticed a well many more ads for Walker and four who were in the Republican candidates on TV I'm On the Internet also um\nIs it is a ... is it difficult to track digital advertising in political advertising\nIt's incredibly difficult to track digital advertising and in part because it can show up in so many different ways\nYou can see Facebook ads Google Search as you can see when you're listening to hear as you're listening to streaming radio um ads when you're watching streaming TV banner ads that can go on and on and on and because there is no single repository\nOr to keep track of that we just don't know how much is being spent in various various places a Facebook which has been a center of huge controversy in in the last year over the Facebook ads that Russian interests purchased and the twenty sixteen election\nHas released an online archive of it's paid a sponsored posts and so we're able to see some of that\nUm but that's still a very very new archive on which we haven't quite figured out how to track it effectively but we are seeing advertising from Walker and from Tony versus on Facebook as well and so\nYou know to the extent that ... might be trying to close the gap on the TV side with some digital spending that's not something we can quantify very easily but it might be part of his strategy\nRight in a radio advertising naturally I've noticed a listening to sports games and things like that it seems like the Republicans are really heavily into radio ads also what about the effectiveness of radio as a for political campaigns\nYeah you know there isn't a tremendous amount of research on the effectiveness of radio ads but I think we could probably make it analogous to the effect of TV ads which would just be that the ... which there's a tremendous\nA research and political science and what we found is that um advertising\nIs persuasive and the sense that it can move\nPoll numbers it can move up people's perceptions of candidates but it does so in very small amounts because people's opinions tend to be very well set a and they don't last very long those effects don't last very long\nAnd so you were citing simple numbers the show the race to be tightening a little bit and there's limited polling in the state as you know but that's one one recent poll suggested\nAnd that would make sense given the advertising advantages that Walker and his allies have had on TV that what may have allowed him to close the gap slightly\nAnd if he continues those advertising advantages whether it be on TV radio or both he might be able to sort of over ... versus pulling advantage and so that's one of the ... the concerns I think that the Democrats should have in seeing these and seeing these numbers um advertising doesn't change huge amounts of mine's\nBut it can alter people's perceptions of the ads are effective and if the other side is an offering a counter narrative\nMhm now you guys have been a study in this since two thousand ten when in fact\nA um a broadcast advertising whether it's TV radio or whatever when did it start to become a real big a bigger influence I guess in political campaigns um ... everybody talks about Citizens United but\n... even before that ... was it starting to become a big determining factor who had the most money you can put up the most ads yeah go ahead yeah that would\nYeah sure sure no TV has been incredibly important TV advertising has been in front of the important to campaign for [noise] you know for decades um and and going back twenty or so years there were still plenty of advertisements on on television\nUm however we've seen increasing amounts of ads on TV over the course of the last Twenty years\nAnd this cycle is probably the I'm seeing the highest volume a midterm election cycles seeing the highest volume of TV advertising that we've ever seen a now one of the reasons why and this is sort of an interesting puzzle because people are watching last live television than they used to\nUm but the one reason why that might be happening is because you know for one at a it's still in a very effective way to reach a large number of people quickly\nOr the people who were fleeing live television the greatest at the greatest raider younger people [laughter] and uh and older people tend to watch a lot of television and those older people tend to be very reliable voters and so campaigns know\nThat in order to reach the most reliable voters they still can find them on TV [noise]\nBut they also know that people are paying less attention to the TV or ... you know their their attention span is is um [noise] uh is there are many things happening in front of them at one time so you almost need to air more advertisements in order to reach the same number of eyeballs that you used to in the past\nAnd so it's a it's a it's the changing demographics and its people's general sort of business that has\nInspired campaigns to air more and more uh television ads can we do expect in the next ten or so years that will hit a plateau and we'll see TV ads sort of fall off a cliff [laughter] as basically live TV [noise] ah it continues to accelerate and change and people even older people move to streaming and online content\n... was speaking with Michael Franz who's a political science at a boat in college in Brunswick, Maine and um I had to look that went up a were born in college was a\n[laughter] small college yeah somebody sit next to me\nBelieve it or not uh uh at the bar last night says oh that's in Brunswick may and I believe and it's a private liberal arts college and sure enough hitting a Michael is a part of a team of scholars at the Wesleyan Media project and they study campaign advertising in spending\nOn not only a round of the political candidates but also around um\nPolitical issues like one of the things that you guys I just uh studied was the Obamacare act and\nAnd um something that you looked at now um you were talking about the differences in the age groups in terms of who watches TV and how they use\nGet a lot of their news and uh I've noticed on uh if if you're on YouTube that there's a lot of political advertising on YouTube a is is that expensive advertising\nTremendously expensive um it it's it's a\n... it it online advertising in general tends to be very cheap compared to the television advertising TV ads can be their expense can can range significantly depending on where you're advertising and win but um but they tend to be more at tends to be much more expensive than online\nAdvertising one of the trade offs though in in buying that cheaper online advertising is that you get fewer people who see it so YouTube is a great place to reach\nI'm younger people who might be looking at sort of any number of things on on YouTube in any given point in time and you can basically say anybody in Wisconsin who's who searching on YouTube a show them this advertisement before they can watch videos\nAnd um you know depending on how extensive you want that sort of a advertisement to reach will be more expensive but um you can also targeted you can say you know anyone searching for um uh the brewers highlights on on YouTube or who want to see any of the highlights from the most recent games on on you to show them\nShow them and add if they're in Wisconsin so you can target sports fans you know on on with you too bad you can do all sorts of interesting things that will change the cost um but because there are fewer people at any given time watching YouTube than watching\nUm the local news at six o'clock or five o'clock then you're gonna you're gonna have fewer people who see that at\nRight now how does negative advertising affect affect voter turnout\nWere oh what a what a question that question has been debated the most political scientists for for Twenty years\nUh and I would say that the the consensus coming out of this research is that I'm against the popular conception that negative advertising turns people off I knew everybody hates negative advertising\nUh but the research suggests that if anything negative advertising has no effect whatsoever on turnout and may in some cases have a positive effect on turnout it may inspire people to sort of understand more clearly the stakes of the campaign\nAre the issues that are activate uh and so on and that may motivate them to\nSome extent to come to the polls now there's been subsequent research that has looked for the types of voters who might be de mobilized by negative advertising and so it's not simply a turnout goes up turnout goes down story um but there's very little evidence that turnout is overwhelmingly negatively affected\nBy a negative negative campaign ... ...\nThem so that was kind of the common a relief that well or the more um Republicans or whatever would put out negative advertising more people would say forget it I'm not even going to vote because right when he's on negative and all that but you're kind of saying that that's not necessarily the case\nI got pretty nice weather general eighth out there or the possibility of snow on Saturday morning anyway today it's supposed to get up to almost sixteen be very sunny\nA tomorrow I step days but there is a possibility of what the computer call shower in pots fried stay out of a spot stay dry a much cooler on Saturday in the mid twenties\nThe possibility of snow it ain't going to stick around because it's going to get up in the mid forties [noise] about fifty on Sunday and sunny almost sixty on Sunday on Monday on ... the all next week looked sunny and not used for like figuring it's late November October so yeah\nThe only real mess I think we're looking at is friday and Saturday that might rain might change in the snow early Saturday morning other than that looks really nice\nBut a temperature for the Milwaukee Brewers are very important playoff game on friday night when we're going to have the ...\nI Would guess it it's going to be chilly they'll have the stadium closed I Would guess if it's doesn't matter if somebody is doing in a dozen Milwaukee what it's doing in Madison it'll ... you're probably looking at a temperatures in the low forties with with the possibility of rain and Milwaukee on friday night\nAnd what's the weather up there and who to four hours north of Madison directly straight\nUm sunny and Chile I think it's just right around it's in the high twenties uh we've had we finally started having your heart for us yeah the treat the leaves are basically down the folks\nAre still beautiful the ... are still

listening to W. or T a nine point nine FM Madison up next a public affair with Alan Rough\n[noise]\n\nFreaky and afternoon Williams\nSaudi Arabia Israel and the United states are more or less on the same page down I mean I think there's people within the Trump Administration who are a little more wary of the idea of war with Iran or going you know completely a hundred percent behind some on but Trump himself and his inner circle\nAre very much committed to the Saudi regime in in their objectives and so uh that's where we find ourselves with President Trump making a you know ludicrous excuses for the regime are hoping that this moment of focus and criticism will pass and and you can get back to business as usual\nYou're listening to William ... director of the arms and security project at the center for international policy a nonprofit research and advocacy group doing work on U.S foreign policy issues um will be opening up the phones\nAnd oh boat ran around the half past the hour or two five six two thousand one\nSo if you want to get in with the question or comment joining the discussion today give us a call again to five six two thousand and one\nNow oh William Hartung Saudi Arabia he's the U.S is largest foreign mused foreign military sales customer what does that entail of course um Israel receives a probably far more but that's an us quote unquote aid\nAh but the Saudis pay for it talked about that to talk about what they get in and what it entails set is not just a a ... you know cash on the barrel head for a military material um there's so much more to it\nWhile yes I'm Saudis are the biggest us arms client and I'm a lot of the biggest deal recent years are actually made during the Obama administration there was a huge deal a sixty billion dollars in total for dozens and dozens of that Fifteen combat aircraft\nAnother huge deal for attack helicopters and everything from\nBombs to missiles just small arms or packages for all of those combat ships and stuff it's so there was already a lot of the pipeline when President Trump came to office so ironically he's actually\nTaking credit for things that are bomb has done which he hasn't done any other realm than where up um but anyway it you're right it's not just give it some money here's the weapon you know there's a U.S contractors and military personnel have to maintain that equipment on behalf of the Saudis\nAre in country\nUh you know we provide spare parts\nA U.S is refueling Saturday aircraft that are doing these bombing runs in Yemen there's U.S officials in the targeting centers where the Saudis are picking the targets and allegedly their role is to get the Saudis not to hit civilians but uh that's been such a\nHorrific record of hitting weddings funerals a school bus\nMarketplaces et cetera it's pretty clear that Saudis don't care whether they hit civilians are not um but anyway so that the ... because of that relationship which is more than just\nA you know with a cash exchange the Saudis depend heavily on the United states to keep their military up and running you know it's not just this or that weapon system pits communications it's maintenance spare parts training uh and that's one of the reasons why\nTrump's notion that on Russia or China or ... and ... still huge amounts of business in Saudi Arabia doesn't entirely add up because they would have to\nRuin branch reorient their entire military in order to buy the kinds of amounts of weaponry from Russia or China that they buy from the United states you know they might buy a system here system there just to send a signal that the fact of the matter is it's not an either or that there's no way for the centers to replace\nThat what they get from the United states in the u._k. and if our two countries took a firm line uh about not supplying them while they're killing civilians in Yemen or we would have a huge amount of leverage which President Trump seems uh\nTo clean them only to use a talk about the u._s. uh arms trade weapons treat\nThese packages of through the broader region I Know I Know for instance that uh the u._s. has carried a ... arms sales are contracts over an extended period was costs are in the United Arab Emirates and so on so talk about that that that regional role\n[noise] well yes um it's been ... deals for combat aircraft with Qatar interestingly right in the middle of the uh Saturday cuts are a conflict or you know the the attempted blockade Qatar and so forth um ... made a deal\nUs fighter planes and the UAE he gets a lot of not just aircraft but also we helped train their special forces or the main um ground troops fighting in Yemen um we have bases significant bases in cuts\n... ah which are used as launching points for us uh interventions in Afghanistan and Syria throughout the broader a region um and although the numbers are not at the same level as\nA two Saturdays is very ... to ... a brisk trade with that particular cuts are you a Saturday or some cells to Kuwait a Yemen and before a the Arab Spring was mostly getting aid um and a lot of those weapons that were given to the solid regime\nAfter it foul ended up on both sides of the conflict ... army strike a split some\nAre fighting with who tea or some fighting again so uh that's another thing that happens when you start throwing weapons and developed as ... as\nYou never know where they're going to end up some Saudi Arabia who decide has access to us weapons as do the Saudis and there's also some of that leaked from a military base that apparently\nAre being used by al ... reading peninsula so every possible player at some level of us are on that um intentional here otherwise\nTo five six two thousand one again in a few more minutes to open up the line if you want to join the discussion today with her gifts of William Hartung at two five six to ... thousand and one\nLet's say the the complexity if you will all of that of the U.S Saudi partnership the alliance the ah sometimes referred to as the other a special relationship in the middle East I'm\nReading reading again in preparation for the program ah I read about how it's been these longstanding congressional majorities\nThat has backed [noise] excuse me ... ... ... ... ... I'm Sorry backed continued ... arms sales weapons sales to us power um partners in the Gulf region a including obviously Saudi Arabia [noise] uh but there's all sorts of reasons one\nThe different blocks different groupings with in Congress or or um or on the bandwagon here [noise] [noise] well yes I mean I think you know one element is an anti\nKind of argument um I Know Lindsey Graham for example\nHas suggested that although he doesn't think it's on my misfits in rural Saudi Arabia given the murder of cars showed he um he thinks that the arms sales are separate matter because it's our national security at stake were fighting\nIran and there are best ally along with Israel and being able to do that and so there's that kind of element which is\nHeightened recently um there's the economic argument you know if you live and\nRepresent Ohio where they make tanks and her soul to Saudi Arabia Missouri where they make fighter planes that go to Saudi Arabia or any of the number of other places Pennsylvania where they make how it's there's being bought by the Saudis and aircraft engines that could be in Ohio or Connecticut and so forth [noise] there's um\nA kind of an economic rationale for a backing the Saudis and and defending um says to the regime or because it represents jobs for people's\nConstituents um [noise] then there's that there's the energy element I'm you know the energy companies and that sort of a commitment to a carbon economy um\nSaudis are among the biggest oil producers in the world although their share of us uh\nOil market as much less than it used to be and it's no wonder ten percent a but it's not all good news because some of that has from fracking and shale oil environment that harmful things that they've done to\nIncrease the U.S energy resources but in any case and then there's various commercial real estate deals are they spend a lot of money at us universities um [noise] they uh ... think tanks\nA they have various charities that they support so Saudi money is is spread all over the place and buys goodwill and all a variety\nWay and that you ate has similar strategy or they're not as well known a and they're not uh seen as\nPerhaps as dangerous or they're seen as the salaries but in many ways I'm there all the time because they're the way is is among the you know this is the partner in the awful killing in Yemen and also has been affiliated with um [noise]\nThat appeared on Monday the jobs should not be an excuse to arm and murders regime that not only may be behind the assassination of us resident respected commentator ... for thousands of civilian casualties and it's three and a half year military intervention in Yemen\nThe majority killed with us supplied bombs in combat aircraft in us refueling and targeting assistance of that was one of the things that I wasn't familiar with the one thing they are in that paragraphs\nAnd that is that the actual logistical or you know us You're born tankers refueling Saturday or Sunday jets that are attacking uh\nCivilians basically are largely due to some extent um some important significant part in in Yemen um the school and we we touched on it before you touched on it before but I wanted to go a little bit deeper\nInto the human story especially because it's barely covered in the mainstream media to begin with\nA ... in it all but this has all but disappeared from the current um Saudi story\nI'm Talking about it a little bit further if you will the um\nWhy why\nThis move against him in one of the things of course one of the arguments is that it's that the conflict in game and as a surrogate conflict for Iran or but I ... I read in various sources is that uh that Iran is basically planning a minor role there ... what's your read on it\n\nWell the Saudis have always wanted to control their border with you in a ... for many years they were doing things like proselytize\nOffending people you know of their persuasion of Islam to proselytize in the parts of Yemen and there were occupied by the who the\nUh more I'm a\nPracticing a variation of Shia Islam but different from the one that's ... you're on and so ah the Saudis were a financing centuries Sunni extremists to proselytize in multi areas and hopes of developing kind of a core support there so it was already a lot of\nDead live I'm In a\nYou know conflict before this big war broke out and to pass a Fifteen Idaho to themselves and find numerous awards against the central government uh of their own accord and our support from Iran because they had always felt that they were\nUm on the short end politically and economically of corrupt regime um and so when the fellow regime which had been at thirty or dictatorship fell during the Arab Spring a there was an interim government\nIt's a ... a\n... vice president uh and so it was supposed to be in Iran but it's still exists in the form because the Saudis are still supporting the government or the former celebrates president [laughter] ah but in the midst of all that the who the aligned with some defectors from the south forces\nTook over significant parts of the country and once that happened the Saudis counterattack and so in March of two thousand Fifteen\nThey started the bombing campaign they started the blockade a\nCommon didn't tell them I knew was the architect of the war said it would be a few months and here we are three and a half years later and it's it's a disaster as we've discussed for ah almost everyone involved so I you know I think in terms of motivation alive it has to do with\nThe Saudis wanting to control the politics of Yemen Iran eventually did come in and they do supply some arms to the tea but I Hope you're not by no means a puppet of the wrong they've got their own agreement says their own issues your own history and they'd be fighting whether or not um\nYou know ... who's backing them so if anything Iran is benefiting from this in the sense that\nEvery time the Saudis drop us bomb us going in the area they're making more and more enemies\nAnd if Iran is perceived as helping protect them against the Saudis if anything they're stock may rise higher in Yemen that that would otherwise but the who the are independent and they don't actually or listen to what Iran says Iran has urged them for example not to\nUm you know a lot of so many a missile strikes against a over the Saudi border and not to to take potshots at chips or you know surrounding Yemen and so forth uh and uh the who the\nSenate did with the police so it's a you know the the um standard argument is it's it's a proxy war you know you've got to run on one side and Saudi Arabia the other and you got to choose sides but really it's primarily a savvy war for control of of the Gulf and Iran has intervened because\nIt's perceived that it can undermine the Saudis\nUm by making them basically\nExpend more resources on a has a pointless war that might otherwise be directed against Iran and some other way\nYou're listening to William ... uh enlist on the middle east we have what they call ... waiting for a little bit ah Thomas Hi you're on the year\nHuh Hi thank you all for the program I my question is we have is regarding nine eleven says the Saudis were involved in that George Bush let 'em go home\nWithout the inter\nInterrogated and you know it seems to me the same thing is happening with our little eight off in a White House now they don't want to do anything because they're the rich people making money and actually I Believe the poor people even in this country\nAre paying a good price to the Saudi where we could just cut off color\nOr assets in this country and and you know threatened unlikely threatened Iran then so I'll hang up and Nassar listen to your answer I think for the program\nSo so they understood the question why or why this continuation with this so the relation relationship if a ... pills back certainly to you as the caller suggested to a September ...\n[noise] well I think\nIt's mostly about money uh and it's also I think it's skewed world view that says somehow Iran is a bigger threat in Saudi Arabia and that therefore we have to make a deal with the devil so to speak and stick with the salaries\nUm but you know there are also part of the personal connection or you know Trump bragged when he was a campaign trail about\nHow many of his apartments were bought and rented by Saudi nationals\nAnd Jared Kushner a is very close a friendly with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and there's no doubt various business still didn't discuss that were benefit him\nDirectly so there's this kind of a personal corruption element I don't think that's driving but I think it's an added element in in the Trump era to it already because in many ways a corrupt and I'm dysfunctional relationship\nI Know I'd be surprised to really ah William if there was some serious breach because well because there's so much is inter locked into the inter connectedness said it's economic or political strategic interest\nOr that I'd be a ... you know maybe maybe I'm just a cynic I don't know some people say I am [laughter] but my read on the situation is that the u._s. is not about to a a force of rupture uh with the Saudis over and certainly not over a\nOver what's been going on this past week or so\nWell I think to me not live as how is that\nWe can focus very clearly on stopping your support for the war in Yemen or there's growing opposition in Congress even people like Marco Rubio and Bob Corker the Republican Senate Foreign relations have said\nYou know this is not the time of the army Saudi Arabia I we had forty seven votes to block a bond jealous of the Arabian when Trump force came in so to me you know\nAfter that fundamental change in the relationship I think using leveraging pressure to get them to stop that wore a and to to come to the peace table a and to stop the suffering there wouldn't be a very worthwhile\nObjective ah and I think it could be carried out or whether or not you could disentangle all the other uh relationships political economic and otherwise\nWe could just him were getting towards the end of the hour or so if you want to get in with a quick question here to five six two thousand and one or give us a call and I'll Try to squeeze union you know in in the\nFish will statement to Congress\nBack on September eleventh coincidentally\nA secretary of state Mike Pompeo stated that the Saudi led coalition\nIs quote undertaking demonstrable actions to reduce the risk of harm to civilians in civilian infrastructure that of course was in relation to Yemen and this I guess gets back to you know the earlier question about the ... inning ...\nKind of rationalization covers\nAnd in that case acted with a combination of bureaucratic incompetence and total disregard of civil liberties against whether and there are people\nPeople should be careful about making the FBI anti heroes now just because they're going after people dislike the FBI I'm always cuts corners or just in that culture hasn't changed now probably get a visit from some guy in linked to shoes\nYou'll let me know I'll let you know yeah [laughter]\n... know\nOr the extent of enjoyed our conversation thank
