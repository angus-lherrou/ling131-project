O. R. T. by email she's at Mali at W. or tea I found out [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nFrom all of us now to universal appears in the future of this is the cultural notion machine for Thursday October eleventh twenty Eighteen I'm your host Jeanine Schaefer\nSo many diseases conditions and health issues so few treatments since yours some are just painful debilitating and annoying some like cancer Alzheimer's Ebola and heart disease can be life threatening\nCures and treatments take time medical research is a long slow tedious and painstaking process at the expense of the people suffering from these diseases so the national institutes\nHealth has developed a program to help accelerate the research and improved general health it's called the all of us research program they're asking for volunteers to give them information about their health physical condition and lifestyle and you W Madison school of medicine and public health has become part of the effort\nSo joining me tonight is Kevin Kiley from the all of us research program but I also want to mention that the team from the EU W Madison has organized several sessions at the Wisconsin Science Festival which started today through and it goes through the weekend\nWe'll talk about that later and during our conversation if you have a question for Kevin please call us at the station at two five six two thousand\nAnd one someone who will be here uh answering the phone and that person will be writing down here a name in question and I will ask it on the air so Kevin welcome to the show hey thanks for having me\nWell let's get started I'm first off how and why did you W Madison or become involved in this program [noise]\nUh Madison has a long history of interest in precision health which is a looking at ways to find\nThe right treatment the right prevention for um the for the for each individual person\nOn the other thing that um it'll be medicine has been involved in historically is a health equity um and the the all of us research program is highly interested in getting um underrepresented groups are such as the Latino community are African Americans\nAre involved in health research which they have not been in the past um the all of us program a is highly focused on that [noise]\nUm so the ah University of Madison put into a grant application for this and uh it is one of ten sites nationwide to receive a grant for them to roll up the program\n[noise] yeah that's right um so um you're searching for volunteers to get data or what kind of health information are you looking for [noise]\nOkay so um I can just walk you through the the um process here [noise]\nUm so when someone who is interested in and joining all of us than go to join us dot org or then go to all of US DOT ... which is the local website um they sign up there they provide consent to participate in the research program um they provide access to the rich are [noise]\nUm and then they answer health and lifestyle survey questions um and then they need to book an appointment in person um that can be done at the hospital that can be done at a school of nursing on campus uh there were three\nYou know be health clinics east to west and the American center that are in rolling people and that that appointment um they provide a sample of blood and the sample of urine and they have a measurements taken height weight and I'm a waste\nI'm could you give me an example of or what kinds of questions that they ask is it's been very specific to to the person I'm it's yeah it's um you know\nUh how much do you work or how many hours a week do you work or where do you live um you know what ... what sort of activities you involved in exercise level things like that yeah it's a they're all health and lifestyle questions that are in that first\nSo they don't aren't ... aren't necessarily specifically geared toward any ... any particular kinds of diseases correct yes correct if then you said that uh that um that uh uh you come in and you give blood and urine correct it is there a physical exam done at all by Dr\nUm is that people get a physical exam little or no they uh it's it's\nJust general I'm a height weight I'm waste management these are all done by a by nurses I'm On staff but uh it's not an actual physical exam are but the person when they sign up for the program they do get their own portal on line so all that information is returned to them within their portal [noise]\nUm but it it doesn't count as an actual physical exam\nOkay um you probably won't and then it gets to this question I'll ask it anyway [noise] uh what you know you take blood and urine um then it gets specific down to the person do what are they are they looking for anything as a DNA or anything specific\nThat you've I don't know if you can answer that or not but well at this point I mean I Will\nMention that I'm not a researcher um and we are at the very early stages of this program it's a five to five year program [noise]\nUm I I can I mentioned that uh when the samples are collected uh the blood in the year and um they are separated from the information that's provided by the person so every everything gets assigned a number and they are separate numbers and they buy\nSamples are stored at Mayo Clinic um they actually created a bio bank for this um initiative and then all the health and and lifestyle survey data is stored it in a database at Vanderbilt\nYeah you answered my next question what happens to the data so there is a common database where all the data cuts but yet there's a portal that specific to the individual as well\nCorrect to have a username and password and they can go in and and see their um um basically the vitals that that came out of there in person visit\nThere should be concentration on what keeps people healthy as well ... so that's why you know they they're also I mean this this study is open to people who are are sick\nUnfortunately but it's also open to people who are healthy and they want to make sure that they're looking at ways that you know one of the lifestyle factors whatever the environmental factors\nThey keep it keep someone healthy um and that's also big big part yeah what what are people doing right exactly exactly it\nYou know and and I know uh some of the people I've talked to a ... as an example I'm a last last year at the book festival there was a nice\n... author with with one of her subjects that was about his family and the name of the book and the family I I Can't think of right now but they were doing a study of this family and they were doing up front a research on the uh ... you know grandchildren and in there and in fact one of the persons that whereas there was pregnant\nAnd she was worried because he thought that Alzheimer's ran in the family so she was worried about that you know her you know baby might end up with it and she's in the study\nAnd it's a long term study to try and do you know pick out the you know the markers the biomarkers early enough to come up with something and then you know like what we know what are they doing right I mean this is a genetic thing but you know what are people doing the right\nTo live longer you know and and are you know a wink of age uh is growing or maybe not so much in this country but people are living two hundred a lot lot longer you know or more people so what are they doing right you\nKnow he's honest [laughter] healthy eating [laughter] an exercise I'm sure it's not and there I mean there there will definitely be examining genetic factors as well I mean that's that's a big part of this too but um yeah I mean they obviously\nAre there are certain cancers that they are and for the environment has an effect and yeah like yeah All right no smoking for instance ... is obviously a big like um but\nUh yeah I mean there are a diseases that are heavily in you know involved in genetics and I'm part of this this effort will be looking at that as well\nWell one thing I wanted to ask and I'm pretty sure you're not going to be really answer [laughter] it's\nA research question does that all his dad is going to be coming in\nAnd I was curious how they're going to use the data is is there I'm guessing that you know maybe epic or somebody else\nThey're not not personally I'm there I Know there is interest um in in this program ... and I will say that ah the an age has launched a ah research portal a for researchers okay uh they're the data has not been loaded there yet frightened\nBy a anyone who is interested um in in the research can go to um [noise]\nI think it's all of this research dot dot org don't quote me on that but if you if you Google all this research portal uh you'll find it you'll see the website and you can actually sign up for a newsletter that will go out and update researchers on on the progress of the data\nWell in the east you said that um that you're still in the gathering a stage who how do you know when you've got everything you want [laughter] [noise]\nUh in ... in my follow up question I asked this right away is that well if you've gotten some why can't why can't that information to be accessible to early on\nIt it's going to be um it's there it's not a wait and wait for five years and get the million people on it is okay uh like I said they they are looking at opening up access um spring it twenty Nineteen\nUm the I can say that nationally uh we just crossed a hundred thousand participant a milestone [noise]\nUm the great thing about that as an aside and I don't think it's really an aside I think it's something to boast about is Seventy percent of that of that sample is from underrepresented groups really yeah now oh man that's great yeah so it's often are really really great start\nThem yeah I was going to ask you about how many are volunteers have you gotten so far you said a hundred thousand\nA nationwide nationwide it's over a hundred thousand now yes I\nDo know how many in the Madison or ... Wisconsin I don't have that state wide but I I don't have a number of\nMy head I will say the goal uh within Wisconsin is three hundred thousand by the end of the o five years now and in Madison itself a hundred thousand um by the end of the five years oh man so sloppy\nI'm Glad that you mentioned that the majority of people or\nFrom you know minorities and stuff\nAnd it's great yeah and I think uh what that higher\nRate at Seventy percent I think even at the national level there are very very surprising very pleased about that and we we were as well\nOkay I'm In a me ask you another question later but I mentioned that Wisconsin Science Festival you have a session you did one this morning where you at that one\nUh I was not there today my two colleagues were there if\nYou could you elaborate about what that session was all about\nSure um so we're at the discovery Ashville which is a discovery building it's from a non am until two PM ah will be there tomorrow as well so please stop by and say Hi I'm\nSo today was actually a lot of school kids um I think they said they are about fourteen hundred that came through there today wow I'm so what we like\nTo do because it's such a big part of the program a genetics is such a big part we have a big a DNA\nModel that kids can play with\n'em it's probably about three feet tall says on the table and they come up and they it's like a puzzle sort of thing they can play with that\nAh we've got a they're called ... tubes um we're a various liquids can be stored in those in in a lab um and we've got the brightly colored and the kids will make bracelets necklaces and stuff out of out of those um [noise]\nThey they really like doing that um and then you know whenever there's an opportunity to talk with a parent or with a teacher I'm a ... to participate in the study has to be Eighteen and over okay um but uh it's it's great opportunity to teach kids about the environment or how the environment affects your health\nUm how genetics is involved\nUm you know show them DNA a lot of times they tell us more than than we're able to tell them which is great um\nAnd then uh yeah just the kind of like the indoor activities is kind of a fun thing for them to to to engage where you signing up a people participants oh yeah yeah I'm again if it's you know parents that are that are interested or um teachers yeah absolutely yeah we can we can send them up or an instant\nAnd there you have two more sessions yeah I don't know if it's tomorrow in Saturday or Sunday\nSo they were going to be there tomorrow night at you and then Sunday as well I think Sunday it's tended to\nI'm OK and Sunday is more a more families um uh today and tomorrow is kind of more of the school kids sort of thing but uh yeah I Believe they get a lot more families on Sunday and I'll be there Sunday so step down side [laughter] [noise]\nAh that's great um I guess we got some more a little bit more time\nI'm\nA I was thinking that it started in twenty Fifteen but you've started actually gathering information the spring this last spring\nYeah they um they rolled into an phases so uh the history the history of the program a it started out as the precision medicine initiative that was um it's just for the Obama administration yeah I'm ... and it's been branded as all of us I'm so you'll see\nA we're going to start or actually more um advertising within the community um so you'll hear radio ads\nComing up okay um and you'll see a hopefully you'll see the logo a little bit more on on buses and things like that um but yeah it was introduced to the bottom of nutrition and it's been rolled down phases and ah you know be Madison\nOh we we started collecting um or recruiting people I should say a late last year um and that was that was the basically the beta face\nA really awful phase I should say um and then a nationally the program was launched in May of this year so we're it's still still pretty young\nOn the razor that threatens the throat\nIt is an unnecessary in so that is the beginning of Maya Angelou as I Know why the caged bird sings and this was Melvin\nEnter your host for radio literature

if you know the answer so much the better uh and the ah there's a point called if they're famous porn or so who is the author of that point\nAnd there was another famous porn called trees and um who

person has two parents are tickets were giving away\nBut please please don't take the tickets and sit at home on Saturday and Sunday and not use them when other people could be using them so if you know definitely that you're not going to be able to go then you should leave the tickets for someone else but the numbers to five six two zero\nZero one and it is a Kelly you want to read one of your points\nUm what I think a favorite song\nThere is obviously too many to count but the ones that kind of came to mind to me especially this is national mental health awareness ... a month\nAnd I'm so one poet that for me was really really helpful and working through some really hard times a few years ago I'm a poet named Dan Smith he performs in a band called listener they've since then kind of become more of a musical act with the same sort of lyrical structure\nBut um butter it again at at the basis of it is the spoken word a talk talk port [laughter] if not spoken word\nSo um I've got a couple of his poems that I wanted to read\nUh the first one is called seatbelt hands and it's from wouldn't heart poems are released in two thousand ten\n\nShe's the kind of lady the calls everybody baby honey sugar sweetie she's always making friends and she keeps us all locked outside or sick leather skin\nShe always starts with a smile small and butter yellow easier than a handshake doesn't like her hands touched she spends a lot gets burned a lot smoking through the cartons but then gets put out so much she's considered a bargain\nShe was born on the fourth of July with her hand on her heart loves America and being patronized\nNo one ever told her to guard her heart Susan Angell once for Halloween but never again and every Christmas she's haunted by demons\nThey always tell her that lover she used to believe in innocence until she spent a long summer riding the trains she's cats and collectors plates to keep her saying watching TV and her favorite chair both of which are rented she's alone she surround yourself with loners her life is alone let out to anyone who owner\nWaiting for the night to sweep or offer feet while she mops the bathroom floor hoping for winning ticket or a man to treat her right but they are both a gamble and she's been a loser all her life\nAnd if she had a nickle for every time she's been punched and kicked she put it together they're Campbell cash and try to buy some happiness they always tell her they love her but then they take something from her she used to show us your dreams crumpled up like leaves from holding onto tight\nScattered in his shoe box coughing on the cardboard walls covered in butterflies\nShe's got loving her heart for her babies\nAnd hoping her mind for tomorrow and blood on our hands that only she sees holding the last bit of time that's borrowed but you never know where that heart is Ben and we'll never know just how hard it's been I Want to cut open my chest and let her in but that won't fix what needs to men so she stands there on the cigarette in hand\nFilling up the empty hole with anything that will pour inside hanging out like a flare warning\nThe beauty in that pain can you see it she's crashing through life with seatbelt hands one accident away from a miracle and there's an honesty there but I Can't take it all in she hides the worst of it and the wrinkles\nAnd that's the ache you get when there's nowhere else to go and she's got nowhere else to go she doesn't want to go there so I promised her I'll go with her I promise I'll go with their seatbelt hands ...\n... well [laughter] that was a [noise]\nKelly Schwartz reading seatbelt hands I liked the title and um and we'll hear another one from Kelly in the moment I'm I just want to go back to the tickets were giving away that we are free for\nYou to you or let's two pairs of tickets were giving away and um I think the location circus world is located in the circus world is a\nA a type of an entertainment place in the barrel blue and it's for those who are who knew was Barry boots or five fifty water street circus world in barrel boom\nAnd uh this is a gathering of roads and refused I think it's kind of a renaissance fair and it's sponsored by Shakespeare on the edge where our guests here about two years ago\nThere is a bluebird in my heart that wants to get out but I poor whiskey on 'em and inhale cigarette smoke and the horrors and the bartenders and the grocery clerks never no he's in there\nThere's a blue bird and my heart that wants to get out but I Am too tough for them I say stay down do you want to messed me up do you want to screw up the works you want to blow my book sales in Europe is a bluebird and my heart that wants to get out but I Am too clever\nI only let 'em out at night sometimes when everybody's asleep I say\nI Know that you're there don't be sad when I put them back but he's singing a little in there I haven't quite let them died and we sleep together like that with our secret packed it's nice enough to make a man\nWeep but I don't weep view Mm bluebird\nYeah and this is also ... Rogalski yes okay and what was the ... bluebird bluebird yeah okay yeah yeah oh do you regret when the gym before too long sure yeah well I I like them home\nBut when I was lucky I literally I actually like to hear you read this kind of interesting to see how it sounds and other people I've never heard it read out loud and until like I've read it I think if somebody else read it to that changes it as well\nYeah okay so we have a few seconds left\nSo I think I have time to read this a short poem actually it's I think it's a an excerpt from a longer porn called America\nAnd um it's the title given here's the foreigners by James M which field and are are just might say well maybe I won't have time because I must say the next week our gas will be jet Wilder and making Monday\nFrom love Wisconsin stories from the place we call the home so pleased to and then next week\nOr for that well maybe I Do it's very short\nAmerica it is to be about both the land of liberty is to the I raise my song the land the blood and crime and wrong\nIt is to be my native line from which has issued many a band to tear the black man from the soil\nAnd force him here to delve into oil chained on your blood ... sawed cringing when neither tyrants rod stripped of those rights which nature's God we used to all the human race bound to a pet who tolerance nod because he wears a pillar face genes and with field\nAnd we'll see you next week uh started to end on such a note but they are cyclical sticks [noise]\n\nYou've been listening to radio literature I collectively produced weekly program on W.

O. R. G. eighty nine point nine actually I Am here in Madison and further out W. O. R.\nT. H. D. [noise] let's see here it's eight or six and our crew is a is a little smaller we ... are a DJ is their way out assignment once again\nWe have a\nChance I really on the board Charlie tipping our producer\nAnd filling in for a car we have three Charlie Hough Patty Lou on the phone and that is the crew the show what are we gonna talk about this a lot of art it's the weekend weekends are are told they're more focused on the work week I think\nLike them that way\nUp first there'll be fermentation fast an arch detour [noise]\nWe'll have a diner new worse the executive director warm farm Institute and Peter Chris go one of the artist who's made a ... and it was the crazy is made a wildly creative large interesting instrument that we'll talk about\nIt all the things going out that way at fermentation best that you can see the intersection of farming in nature and arch led by traffic report with Rick ... card from scramble careers\nWill have the bus team picks for your weekend and then we'll talk about\nAnd there's no more\nYesterday and I think actually when I when I think about it more I was thinking of leaves and that kind of blended subtlety but ah there are things that pop out in the environment if you're looking more for Morales if you're looking for a\nA an exotic bird in your bird watcher there are things that really do pop out in the environment still so it it does seem to mirror that you know the way that we can look into nature deeper and notice things ... what does that look like what are the\nFarmers think of a this project or I mean I Know I asked this every year we generally talk to you every time but ah you know it's got to be good for the the economy there I'm guessing everybody's basically into it\nBut ah it's not the kind of thing you generally have out in an agricultural area\nUh what what difference our seventh year during this and um every year at surprise attacks on how much more interactivity and interest there isn't participating and every farmer different of course then or as we all are but everybody's got a different angle or or\nDifferent level of involvement for example one of the farmers\nAre McCluskey brothers not only hosting artist on their property I'm a therapist Simon's as an artist Madison who who has a work called builds catches on part of their land it actually happens to be the same spot where Peter was a couple of years ago I'm\nSo not only do they hosting artist very graciously\nBut they also feel what we called farm forms which are the um artist and the landowner um creative contribution um that don't go to a jury process they do whatever they want to do and every year the McCluskey brothers have done something and this year they've built the great pyramid of farming\nI'm On a property down the road on that um I don't have the number handy right now\nUm I think it's number Thirteen or fourteen on the map so um\nAnd then there are farmers that just allow the um artist cheat to use that um I lean shoots the farmer on highland avenue and she has allowed I'm uh from ... up that's a very gentle correction to your description it's not just regional artist\nFrom kids from Bordeaux, France so we have a local regional and national and international I participate in this and so I lean shoots has has allowed this is will be the third year for her allowing a spot on highland vote to be used by an artist\nSo I think um you would like to speak to them but I think that there's some\nThere's an enormous fascination an interest in complexity in that kind of collaboration also we read from one of the reasons we do it in the late Paul in the early fall if that's the last the last uh cutting a pay has been taken so hey fields\nOr the farmers don't have to get into the hay fields anymore so we like to think of this is the final cutting on a hay field\nOh All right well tell us more about ah now actually probably peaks and people's interest about what else they can see him on what schedule and how to experience the website is quite a comprehensive so recommend to anybody that wants to find out more fermentation fest dot com or but it's also so ... so comprehensive that we need you to kind of\nBoil it down as\nWell but classes in the workshop you have to ... to register for and so if you're interested in classes there's still some openings in um Saturday and Sunday classes if you're interested in the detour just go to the detour tag and um\nWe advise you to purchase a map and they're available in several locations but the best way to start is to come to the beach area chamber of commerce\nAnd that is stop number one on the map\nBy a map and go in order uh if you go counterclockwise which is the way the relatives laid out\nWon't get lost if you go to the other way you just might um all the ... can be great fun as well I'm a do it if you take your time and really experienced all the the art installations as well as the food\nChain stops we have to what we call food chains marketplace food art in ideas and that's where the\nFood truck dog and we have campfires ban or is that the place to warm up and visit without a\n[noise] um if you do it right I think it takes four to five hours\nAre sometimes people will do have one day and half another half one weekend and\nAnd the other half the other weekend this is supposed to be very nice that Chile weekend or in the fall colors I don't think it's ever been brighter uh we had a lot of challenges with flooding recently but those challenges are behind us\nGood and we welcome everyone to come to the ...\nAnd some people looking at fifty plus miles are going to say that looks like a very ... some people might say that looks like two weekends or biking or or not but uh but that is a good way to take this in as well right\nAbsolutely yes and there's a bike a there's a cue sheet there you can also pick up but at the chamber and you can also download it off the website or depending on who you ask is either very challenging or not so challenging but it's very this is the drift area so it's very hilly and it's it's ... experienced riders\nNo we haven't talked to a lot about this aspect of fermentation since you mentioned in the beginning but it it can be mind altering some very popular fermented products in Wisconsin are you taking advantage of any of those\nOh ... what you mean beer and she ...\n[laughter] yeah I was thinking about your primarily but uh yes\nUm yeah I'd I'd have to look at the schedule and I don't remember what classes that still available bits weekend but we know we I Know we have a ... or um\nI I got my spirits case came by little bank who had been several years and around he has a relationship with them within the next ... in Mexico and he brings ...\nSpirits that you can't find anywhere else other than in Mexico and that's the thing I think they'll have some room on Saturday evening\nAnd can you simply find places to drink a few beers and get a black hole absolutely\nYes referred has um what at one time was known is that the smallest micro brewery in the state have enough that still the case that the corner pub a is right on main street and bruised excellent wonderful local beer and they've been around for at least Twenty years\nUh and ... and across the street has some great selection of Wisconsin beers and it's also doing a hops in her ... and this is one that you don't need to register for it you can just show up a Saturday again check the website ... not sure of the times you can just pop in\nTo the hops encourage tasting at touchdown tavern\nAnd Peter ... let's let's ask you about as we are as the artist or wind or what you've enjoyed seeing and what some of the highlights of the art work out in the fields\nAll he says the art work I Would like to also mentioned that as a as for the oddities the or the farmers that amazing a research resorts a\nLong term Institute is great in awe of completing the audience to be the local ... owners and farmers and that is amazing resource in terms of enthusiasm and creativity and ideas and\nAll the machines and in supply and all that stuff and you know also when you mentioned the mind altering I think that's a really nice metaphor for ah\nAh for everybody's might be out there in terms of learning about radio for this coming from you know so I think we should we educate ourselves where the where the food is coming from and people are coming to the festival\nIn their eyes are gonna get open\nThey see right before the is coming from and I think that's a good mood the way how to ah keep ourselves healthy ear and out of the planet you are in a much healthier\nAnd in terms of the artworks I you know for me personally I think the one of the most amazing venues or rains nationwide that I ever being part of in terms of a building at the end and making new friends from all around the world and just\nWorking with oddities owned their projects and helping each other um I've been hosting tool odd using in my studio\nUm you know I moved to the area as a result of a fermentation festival a couple of years ago and now I'm happy to host the oddities and it's just amazing to see my drive eight oh two weeks before the festival like the stuff that is happening doesn't even have anything to do with the installation us on the beach or bike so creative [noise]\nAll right ah well good recommendations to check it out yourself fermentation vessel Daniel celebration of life culture\nIn all its forms and uh they're in their seventh year now we've been speaking with Donna knew where the executive director of the worm farm Institute and Peter ... one of the artist in the\nEvent I'll call it an event it's almost hard to to know what to call it it's so large any all encompassing thanks for joining us this morning\nThank you John then yeah [noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\nSo and that's that creates many historic trees out there and I became fascinated in that concept and began doing research and writing books which were published by the Wisconsin Historical Society press on those trees that stand as landmarks in our\nUh in our landscape to be able to remind us of things that have happened before\nI find that really interesting the intersection of the forest and the trees because uh when I was thinking about it we usually just think of trees as being a stand up trees a forest trees and for the most part um we might have an individual relationship with a tree that there was a tree house\nOr a for instance for our community who likes to ... uh at art and parked fest that oak tree that they swing from is a very important trait but in general trees are sort of thought of as you know ah in groups of trees and so how do how do you single out remarkable trees\nWell first of all every tree in and of itself is remarkable in a way that do the science allows us to understand now it's a complex but dig more deeply connected we've\nUh vowed from a common source if you take a look for example at the green enclosure Phil [noise]\nTake a look at molecular level it's the same molecule as the humor in our hemoglobin with one exception is that the center of that molecule\nOf Cora feel is magnesium at the center of our hemoglobin molecule is iron other than that they're the same so of course we call them up and I think that explains this affinity disaffection we have for trees\nThey are as Carl Sagan when he started his cosmos series he started that by sitting beneath the great oak tree and he says this is my brother oh\nWe're connected to these trees in deeper ways than we first might think\nAnd he talks about the fact that we both had DNA that and then he brings out this concept or a feeling hemoglobin\nSo there's more going on here when you scratch the surface then you think when it comes\nTo you know what that confidence ancestor looked like\nWell it'd be kind of curious but [laughter] no I don't but it may be at some point we'll just\nTake it or not to the interview but very interesting to think about what\nThat organism might have been ah so what are some of the trees that you're going to talk about it you're talking what makes them remarkable\nWell there's so many remarkable trees that are either still a ... or um have\nBeen cut down or just simply died through old agents in essence the one that I think really stands out is the one that inspired John Muir to become the great naturalist that he did and of course John mirror was so important to developing the national park\nThe service that he was a student in engineering student in Wisconsin\nUm he stepped outside of north hall and there is a a a button the student he called them over by the immigration wall and he said John come over here take a look at this tree and he did look at and he said well but trees this and John goes well I I don't know I'm an engineering student out about these students\nAnd ... said well take a look at the ... hour 'cause it was in June it was in bloom it was a beautiful flower and mirrors said well it looks like a pie flour and of course mirror was a farmer so he understood what the flowers looked like\nGriswold knew he had him in that learning moment to trust them\nAnd he said that's right it at the same as a pie flour and then you explain taxonomy that connection of all living things one to the other that somehow this great black locust tree which is ... could be connected to a small scraggly little a pie flower\nThat a rose plant might be connected to a crab apples and they're connected as ... as the great ... attacks on a missed from Sweden was able to make the connections more often than not through the shape of their flowers at that critical connection between different species out their\nMirror remembered that in his book my boyhood in youth as the epiphany moment to moment when the scales fell from his eyes\nAnd he was able to see the world in a different light he gave up engineering and became the natural is writing about these stories that connected us to the world around us\nAs a result of that particular tree so that tree was a very critical moment in the history of John Muir but also became one of the history of Wisconsin and really the history of the whole world trees can do remarkable things\nThere were other trees around the same time the civil war trees there was for many years a tree growing by camper Randall ah called Harvey OLC that OLC was planted at the death of our governor uh Lewis Powell\nHarvey who was our second civil war governor by the way do you know who are for civil war governor was did you not Randall and that's why we have camper ... was named after him and of course camp Randall is not always a football field it to for many years and during the civil war was that civil war training and campus at her\nAnd sick not Eighteen sixty two I'm Lois Lewis Powell\nAfter battles Shiloh recognize that there were many Wisconsin soldiers who were in you know terrible straits fill out the Tennessee River after the battle of Shiloh so he decided he would go down there and give them comfort in let them do the people of Wisconsin were supporting them and they're great effort [noise]\nHe unfortunately passing a on a barge fell into the Tennessee River his body was found sixty miles downstream but his wife Cora Delia a hearty um who became in my eyes one of the great heroic women of all time\nAt a moment when women couldn't even vote decided that she would carry on the worker her husband and she went to the generals and said well why don't we get a hospital in Wisconsin where these soldiers can come back into the general said oh no if we did that they would probably go a wall\nAnd uh she said no you know they're they're volunteers they would they would go back to it they said the general said they'd read all that um died and bring them back here\nShe carried that message all the way to Abraham Lincoln and after four or five days of trying to get to see him he finally relented and he then allowed at those young soldiers\nTo come back to hospitals government hospitals being built in Wisconsin the first\nUh government hospital built in the mid west so that the civil war soldiers could come up was the act tagging all house here on Lake ... near the shores of lake Madonna in Madison core Delia Harvey was her role in that sense\nHer husband got a tree for him I just hope that at some point and I'm working hard on it we can have a tree for kids\nThe only Harvey and where's that tree or how does that have been named\nThat tree the the plant remains the tree because he was planted obviously at the time that he died in Nineteen sixty two was red oak no longer there but the plaque remains so now's the moment to to recognize what she did carrying out the work of her husband against all odds\nSo this is a I don't know if this was a good question or not but you say you love trees and and it's important for us to love trees and when I ask you if you said you liked trees right [noise]\nUm you know we we love dogs are they seem to love us back well she loves cats and they seem fairly indifferent if we love trees what happens on the other side of that equation how do they feel about us if anything at all but we\nClearly have a symbiotic relationship with trees there's no doubt about it as we breathe out we we we let out our carbon dioxide the trees take that carbon dioxide in 'em and they add water or they had oxygen they had sunlight and they come up with carbohydrates\nAre and they release oxygen back which we've and breathe\nI'm the quality of the air improved dramatically with the presence of trees around there\nWe have terrible flooding going on the Mississippi River floods on a regular basis why is that\nThat's because the tree cover that had protected the land when rain falls the velocity of the rain is slow down by hitting those leaves in the canopy if a tree it's absorbed and held like a sponge up there it goes into the soil the roots retained that moisture\nA and keep that fast moving water from eroding the soil and filling up our rivers\nAre so it's not the fact that our levees weren't high enough on the Mississippi when we had that terrible flooding the fact was that we didn't have enough and trees we cut down all those trees\nDo you see a similar problem certainly a lot of flooding in our area as well do you see a problem with not enough trees is\nLiterally absolutely not only me but did those engineers who were building are great\nCities recognize that now in a way that they didn't before they know that the public works has to incorporate urban forestry they've actually establish a forty percent canopy cover is the standard that every city should have because\nNumber one if you have a canopy cover you don't have all that sunlight being built up as thermal baths in the soil which heats everything up\nYou have shading so that houses don't need to have the same energy draw that they would otherwise the reason we have such large power plant is because we have peak energy use\nWith the youngest or you'd bring\nA ... if they can sit through a movie and you think they're they would like it you bring that\nMovie was about\nEight minutes ago a little bit longer and you I mean there is no age restriction on it we encourage families to come and experienced this together and ah you know if you need to leave us\nSo they can if you need to step out for a moment you can but I think having the experience like this at a young age at any age really is something that we can treasure here in Madison and not a lot of places can say that\nYeah great well check it out it is duck soup cinema the film this time is the kid brother\nAnd a a few different acts for you are also live acts around the movie this is tomorrow there's two shows one or two o'clock on at seven o'clock the organist is Clark Wilson a so see a movie fuel entertainment here some of the grand old Oregon played\nAnd uh and it's a fairly affordable again we will go but it is\nA and that brings us close to the end of the show so let's give away some tickets let's do and we've got three pairs so I think we should just give 'em to the first three callers it to five six two thousand and one and we can start taking those calls right now a petty can take your calls to buy six two zero zero one the first three callers will uh each get a pair of tickets so\nUh hang on be patient keep oh what else you got sir I got one more thing\nTo say yeah so this year it went up to ... hundred and twenty fifth birthday as well so we have to have that I found this in the line wrapping up our sleeves and that kind of celebrated his birthday he would love it especially because this was one of his favorite sounds everything\nAll right the kid well thanks for joining us there I think\nFor having that does bring us to the end of the show or keep calling to five six two thousand and one again we've got three pairs of tickets to give away\nOr want to thank everybody would help that was a show Patty you're on the phone shall we our producer John our engineer occur away on assignment and up next we'll be insurgent radio chaos and Chris Bowers with mud acres and all those great things that follow into the weekend here I'm W.

I'm monster storms every day uh oh every year and um there's no way to ... raise food any mall and so on and so forth so\nWhat what kind of world can you imagine that would be a good word that that would be\nOne that we really would love to leaving and that we really would appreciate that may be may be these these world but do we do have our first call in and so I'm going to go to him and I invite you to join us do six to eight\nTo five seats two thousand and one and the ... not sure um have you on the air for it or not\nI just wanted to say that it's a shame that those people who suffered so much up there but there's two ... two reasons not good reasons why they're suffering got oral to turn the car question after America will never see a drop of it all for export other countries right\nNow about your wider beating up all those people up there because of native America they're helpless but those\nFolks parts of that happened nowhere to send in the south and these people up there are used to just dropping off outlooks on a victim helpless victim ended people it's a shame we all look at this year down the central part of the United states and say well we\nShould have satellite way back to the Eighteen hundreds and giving these people opportunity at least ... hurt consider what their salary saying about the people in the future\nWhen it's oil pipeline box people all down the line to come forward to buy their oil and stop the winter and his children it's just disgusting with all the weapons of mass destruction on it bought it at all they do is go to a club or people that are sitting down trying to protest peacefully\nVery much so wait wait wait wait a minute I'm since they don't have another caller yet what what kind of a world can you imagine and um how can we get to the world that would be livable and um [noise] good good full of uh\nPlans until everybody else\nMy response to that we have to first get over this president were anything until we get rid of this president is just somebody in charge of our country we got nobody in charge of our country if your goal to get to those foreign countries and articulate intelligently like\nPresidents and the patch that this guy is like a gang in his life dropped a mobster or January ... or ... you wanna do something like that and I don't see why these newscasters are not a high thing about that he's not even up to the lady himself like a president he disgusting\nTend to up the factories or racist his practice gets women and there's so many discussing things about it and nobody is calling him out there should be so all of those things should be ... or at least spoke about the patient\n... and how how can we get to that\nWell we have to do a mass voted I see all these people when they're demonstrating that demonstrating is not a demonstration yeah it's a great big party there laughing jumping up and down and I'm looking at this program on TV last night\nThere with Dr ... and how these people were protesting the laughter do go gassing up and down they were serious because they're looking for something\nFor the intercept that put into this protest it when I see these protests if people are laughing jumping up and down and all this crap I think the police and the authorities are laughing\nBecause they're just ready to get to work to go out and break them up and I think that they're they're what they're going out there I'm sitting so positive all pop pop pop pop pop our response when they start you know there'd be a lap that they have to take these demonstrations that serious\n... [noise] well um thank you and that means but um yeah we should do calling and and that is another thing that I'm I've been thinking about recently made to ease I'm\nEve [laughter] um the Democratic party when actually democratic\nAnd um he allowed for relations with Indian strengths and I'm Bernie Sanders when elected to run for president he would have been in the president I think there is no question about that\nPersonally know some people who are going to ... because of what happens they voted for Trump old lady and go to a lot to do but I'm imagining what a different world the he um would have been easy when the president and\nI mean really we will just um few steps away from that that could have happened so um what's going on with the Democratic party if they learn anything from that let's go to Mexico to handy alone\nHigh I I\nI wanted to just talk about oh I just wanted to to bring the focus to the their their message which is\nIs water is life mhm uh and I was I was at the screening\nThat was a wonderful a movie made me proud to be\nLiving in Madison to have an older person go out there and yeah and uh and represent our community in such a good way right um but I mean I and I guess I was disappointed there too that no one no one talked about our our lakes\nAt that type of screening um and that's something that really affects me and that's something that is very tangible something that's very we we can we can do something about we can we can work to make\nStop these algae blooms ... million so that when we when in the late that we feel clean and not that we have to go and take a shower or worry about our health immediately after a going in the water\nAnd and also I mean the big fan of the would be if you could go there and and actually drink that water but I don't I don't know if that would happen in in my lifetime but\nYeah so I didn't even make\nIt a wonderful wonderful lake again yeah why why didn't you talk about that [noise] I don't\nI don't know how I should of I I Would have waited longer but then it kinda it kinda and it at a certain point I was just being patients or listen to listening to people um but it it just didn't end up coming up I I just didn't end up getting returned before before the end\n... though my I don't know not and I'm not so great\nFor something like work where I can voice my opinion and that and they were talking about that\nYeah and I appreciate you calling in anything else\nNo that's all I wanted to say why water is life be grateful for the clean drinking water we have\nYes I Do indeed these life we uh eighty percent water ourselves then there was a lean water we would not be able to me it's it's really that simple thank you Andy and I'm Mike snakes ...\nOh my yeah my\nHere we go money is the root of all evil we've all heard that it's true that oil gives a lot of people jobs money\nThey are how are the Saudis were able to\nBuy one hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of a nuclear type what weapons from our power\nCompanies in the United states that's why we have a seven hundred billion dollar defense budget which really off ... ... you know hey I'm it's because people make money off oil because everybody flies\nBut jet airplanes every where\nThey want to go it's time for a vacation happened the jets are they drive you know\nThat I don't think fuel economy of cars has gone up much higher than I was Thirty years ago it doesn't seem that way I mean everybody buying ... su police\nI wrote a bicycle my entire career in Madison here um winter long sometimes that take the bus but\nWe've got to get back to that I'm\nA electric vehicles are fine as long as you have so or or on your roof and to somehow but still you know I'm not I'm not in favor of I'm raising the gas tax like\nSome of the um climate [noise] I'm concerned people are because that's a really aggressive type tax is going to hurt our poor more\nAnd that led by indigenous people and I've got to say that you know I think we need to look at um\nThe value system that we have and and what is really important and we need to demand\nA that our government makes sustainable options possible like mass transit you know someone talked about the gas tax yes would we be so concerned with that if people had alternatives to driving and you know got an aging population and and we're doing nothing\nHere I think to serve people so [noise] um [noise] I don't know just let a random [laughter]\nYeah [noise] um you know I just lost my train of thought too [laughter]\nYeah we always you know was in a trial and and the one good thing that happened this week I don't know if it was covered on ward is that uh the valve Turner's in Minnesota had their case thrown out um\nYet those ...\nI'm there were two women well this was a national concerted action that took place in North Dakota Montana and Washington and Minnesota\nAnd there was a group of people that\nGot together and decided that they would shut off the flow of Canadian tar sands oil into the United states in a on a certain day and it was October of two thousand six king they did it in solidarity with the people in in Standing Rock and I'm not a lot of us were out their various times\nI'm so they they did it the ... I I didn't know a lot of the details about it but I read some of what they did they they did it in a very\nThoughtful and careful way and they let the um company know that they were going to do this um and it was an bridge in Minnesota was it was I Believe what was one in three where prices in Minnesota\nUm that they were going to shut the valves and stop the flow of oil and the company could do you know whatever they thought necessary to avert you know some an explosion or something\nWhich is what the company did mhm and then these two women and their supporter were arrested and they face criminal charges in Minnesota and they had climate necessity defense they were going to put on\nAnd the judge was going to allow some of their climate experts to testify including James Hansen the name of the scientist you said you know if we exploit the Canadian tar sands game over for the climate he said that\nI think it was five or six years ago [laughter] um and a Bill McKibben you know the founder of three fifty yeah we're both going to testify or but\nWhat happened was they started putting on their cases the closest states evidence the defense counsel such you know they haven't even established that they damaged anything and the judge said yeah through the case out so they were um they were all the charges were dismissed yeah didn't even get to put on their climate experts\nBut um there was the center for climate sense out of California Center for 'em with civil liberties defense center and people from the national lawyers killed representing those with three people and they all got acquitted [noise] [noise] you know we didn't have such good luck up and superior\nI'm In April in August we had several people convicted of disorderly conduct for shutting down construction on line three up there last\nYear and a ... for\nA while uh most of the only two of them um showed up to be sentenced and I'm One woman got\nTwenty days in jail and she got about an eight hundred dollar fine um but one young I'm Ojibwe chip or a man from Minnesota He got he got a couple of weeks in jail but\nHe was ordered to pay forty four thousand two hundred dollars restitution to enrich for shutting down construction for a few hours\nAnd um that's currently being appeal we're trying to get the lawyers to work on it\nBut uh yeah they ask for eighty thousand dollars in restitution for the four incidents over a\nThree month period when people stop construction on line three and in Wisconsin because Wisconsin gave Enbridge their permanent with very little discussion\nAbout comments or concerned [laughter]\nUm it is it is one thing that I said to him ... when he was usually movies a mixtures that\nI'm really we had to ... to Trump right dealing in Wisconsin because I'm ... been doing all these things that I'm Trump is doing on a bigger scale all alone right\nSo for me the first day in ... he's been doing exactly what a Trump is doing\nWell right it's it's and and there was a PBS special about Montana a lot of the same things happened up there yeah the limits of of the limits on democracy the voting rights\nThe voter ID laws um the public that the investigation of public hearings where now you know the corporate interests all get to go first and they get to speak for hours and all the citizens who might've bussed in from\nEau Claire or red cliff for our sat ... are forced to sit there all day long before they get there two or three minutes yeah and I'm In the redistricting and you know it it it strikes at the heart of the democracy that ... that we need if we're going to survive we need\nWe need community control of what's happening here\nYeah that would be one a good solution thank you so much Patricia ...\nThanks sorry your guest shop [laughter]\nYeah well it happens\nBy and um again we have Darryl on the line and then we have time to hear from you about any of the things that we've been discussing anything else that these O'Neill mind would like to share with us hello Darren you'll on the air\nSo Steve for taking my call should I'm happy to see the\nThe people around the world are trying to defend the land and keep their environment healthy [noise]\nUm I Want to know what the status was about uh the tar sands in Wisconsin because I thought I heard\nThat these companies were going to shift their operations to Texas because the sand was much finer Wisconsin says so I was wondering\nHow is that going and then the of the law the ... ... ... what does this go what's going on with that right now I'm since that goes through\nIt's a beautiful parts of the state was just wondering if anybody is about about those things are it's\nOkay thank you and I'm a little spoke with people who can talk to these things better than me but I can say the same thing is not about\nThe tar sands oil it's about fracking so because fracking has become such a huge industry in this country and that's one reason we still have cheap\nGas [noise] um\nThey need full fracking they need sand the make sand with\nWater and chemicals and that's how they ah um\nExplode the rock to get to the shale oil that's unbelievable understand correctly and you're right to most I heard that um it's because\nI'm a much cheaper\nTo do a ... with the sound of Texas because it's closer to ... actually fracking\nBut I also heard that they probably will continue that didn't sound familiar because the quality of the son who is different from the quality of the some there they'll the Texas ... of course we have\nFind some them they they have useful both kinds [noise]\nSo um [noise] the continuing to usually however\nAdhering they have they have a fracking and um some mining here in Wisconsin [noise]\nThere was a lot of a new companies that will just created to do that to mind sand and because of the slowdown\nIn the industry many of them all struggling now so they're all being bought by bigger companies and yeah sadly it's not the and who I'm Sam mining\nAs full a Enbridge and\nThat Patricia was just talking about a bunch of eat 'em if the if we have other listeners who can enlighten us\nUm with more information about that\nPatricia was saying that um the part of the Enbridge line that these I'm going through Dane County is mean negated no\nI'm old is being appealed I suppose because a Walker decided that was not allowed to get to the demand\nWell I mean no solicitation and I have no interest in talking to people who want to sell anything to me be Jesus or whatever else\nAnd then a couple of minutes later someone was looking on\nMy side door and I went to see what was going on at the same woman [laughter] so I open and I I figured if it was so important to have an eye open and um then she was I'm like you I'm\nKnocking on doors and asking people that were voting to fool the Democrat you know the Democratic party candidates and I said yes yes yes yes\nAnd then she said well it sounds like your good Democrats and I said I'm I'm actually no I'm a Democrat or but I Am voting for these people because it is so important this time around\nSo um even though in a sense I didn't appreciate it to kind of forcing himself on me I also really appreciated the ... um\nShe worked so hard to um you know to convince me of the current events me to a vote to the people that she thinks they should vote for her so anyway thank you to you under the woman to all of the people doing this work to do so important right now\n[noise] thank you bye Kevin and them we out of time and I\nCan hear the funny boys laughing I'm behind me and I

Clark he's a lawyer he's the he's one of the lawyers who defended a BP after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill he's going to be the assistant attorney general for the department of justice is environmental and natural resources the division of course he is\nExcellent excellent news [laughter]\n[laughter] well it's like those movies where the higher the the criminal to to work with at least catch me if you can yeah yeah yeah exactly you get the the fraudsters to teach people how not to deprive people yeah it'd be depressed so that's the whole administration yeah we know you complete all all fraudsters yes and\nIt's a little violence in say they're just a peak so they found a solar powered drug tunnel in or how does that work\nWho well [laughter] it's on the Mexican border that something a wall would not stop [laughter] just a little aside their water and burning coal [laughter] it's like a double whammy [laughter]\nSo uh dozens of drug smuggling tunnels had been discovered in recent years a and mostly they do it in California and Arizona okay and said you know food serves no purpose in Nebraska say\nUh but uh uh\nThey discovered an incomplete they didn't quite get a chance to complete it cross border drug smuggling tunnels without ... track and solar powered lighting in a ventilation system really yeah\nSo you could live in it if you wanted I loved it at solar how I Do I Do too\n[laughter] it's like a little area yeah [laughter] I Know ... sounds like just yeah oh man yeah I wouldn't be a home with a railroad in it you know [laughter] railroad [laughter] and [laughter]\nAnd it crosses the border and they like to do it in like this one was in\nA ah [noise] where was it how to me in a bar\nSo it's right across the borders you can cross into the United states they're warehouses there where you can\nCome up and ... and do your little exchanges ...\nAnd then uh yeah we should just hire them to be border security you know they would probably do a better job than we are [laughter] and they probably wouldn't separate families and with children and cage with children cages asked five year olds to sign away their rights\nWhich is where we are as a country today just a gentle reminder folks\n\nDoctors use of Syrian section to deliver babies has nearly doubled in Fifteen Years and has reached alarming proportions in some countries according to a new study rates surge from ... from about sixteen million births in two thousand to an estimated twenty nine\nIt's seven million that's a report in the Lancet the nature of the highest rate for using the surgery is Dominican Republic with fifty percent while until recently the who the\nThe ban surviving okay [laughter] that was [laughter] we just\nHeard that the Syrian section the rates of more than Fifteen Percent were excessive because there is an over reliance on Syrian procedures when surgeries used to help with the difficult births in more than half of the world of the nation well\nBut

cut social programs like Social Security\nHalf Republicans remain in a governing majority for longer eight large cuts to Medicaid and even some cuts to Medicare had been put into recent Republican budget proposals they haven't become law\nBut they had actually passed the house of representatives the Trump Administration put out a budget proposal each year last year it had some large cuts to those programs I think it is definitely a desire on the part of\nA lot of conservatives to shrink those programs pretty radically they're so popular that it's going to be hard for them to do unless they can come out scare or trick or controlled Democrats into going along with them so I help the Democrats stand firm on that but if the Republicans are in charge for long enough I think you're going to see a full frontal assault on those\n... the Republican line on defense is a false narrative\nThat's political discourse around deficits is really bad and then you've got the Republican Party who all during the Obama administration claimed to be doing\nPlea worried about the debt and that was why they oppose to almost everything the Obama administration proposed\nAnd then as soon as they come into power they have no problem at all at one point five trillion dollars to the debt solely to give money around solely but eighty three percent to give money to the top one percent and then some of the Republican claims that they care about the debt and that's why they're against things that could actually benefit working Americans that it could not be clear hypocrisy\nMany in the public can fall into the trap of fear mongering about deficits and he notes the demographics the Democrats' failure to frame the Texas you in a progressive manner\nInstead of just coming out with a pure fairness frame of the top one percent doesn't need any more money or an opportunity costs frame of if we at one point five trillion dollars to give mostly to very rich household why don't we have that for infrastructure why don't we have that for health care\nInstead they kind of fear among or about the deficit it doesn't mean you could spend as much as you want without taxing forever but it it's really amazing how really whipped up on base fears about the deficit have really staunch to any sort of\nProgressive progress and economic policy in this country and how it's just been so weaponized by people who want to stop the spread of public investment and safety net programs and yet it can't be weaponized at all to stop tax cuts for the rich\n... believe that you're seeing a shift in the

bit confusing and we could spend hours unpacking the nuances of all of the certifications and labels\nWill start with organic at the Dane County farmers' market if someone's products are labeled as organic\nThat means they're certified by the United States Department of agriculture and have to meet their standards as well as undergoing and you own section and re certification process it is the D.C FM's rules that if you label your product as organic you must be certified by using\nThe word be operating under their one exemption\nWhich is for producers were selling less than five thousand dollars in products and still keep all of the records necessary to verify their organic production organic certification can be applied to produce meat cheese grains even maple syrup [noise]\nThere's much more gray area when something is labeled as pesticide free [noise]\nThis is typically a label you'll see on produce\nThere is no certification or higher body which regulates what it means to be labeled pesticide free and indeed it likely means different things for different people [noise]\nWe would encourage you to talk to the farmer behind the stand and find out more about his or her growing practices and if they align with what you're looking for this advice also holds true for products that are labeled as knows right\nSome folks assume that nose spray means that products are organically grown but in reality they're organic sprays so once again this label means different things to different people and has no universal standard grass fed is a term applied to meets grass fed
