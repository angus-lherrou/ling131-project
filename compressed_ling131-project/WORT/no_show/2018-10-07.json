has to deal with any anybody that's human human 'cause that's when a quality comes and you can be equally if you're not understanding\nWhat a person is going through and then you're not using separate in your own issues so that's why they have the Dane County jail or the county jails Dane County in particular because I Know I've been there and I hear the stories\nAnd how they actually push people to make these are these are bills and that's why Wisconsin has a Ninety five conviction rate and not just Wisconsin but you know the United states as long as a Ninety seven conviction rate\nBecause

[noise] like we find much love\nMy Kindle is is that as well [noise] thank you so much\n... and other one eighty nine you alive soda hello hello\nBy that happening now that they're stuck in bondage with that contracts or our agreement we have to still vote for them unless we want to start our own thing and and which is out there for us but we need to be able to unite together to have that happen\nBut we can do that every subject ourselves\nTo a a a nation that really done a except us and we supposed to have our own band gone but we don't know how to get to that because we we we've been lost well\nAnd I think and correct me if I'm wrong but I think like what your first thought was the electoral votes so you're thinking on the presidential scale that you got to read\nThat which I Know what I also think that even though all of those like the educational that like the fact that you do okay we were voting but when you got in trouble let me give me his late\n... that the governor mhm he managed to twenty five years at your house and balance out right mhm\nAnd go up to a new a new that and I got Wachter is kind of like well why don't you tell a little bit\nThat meant where you've got like like got to stop it right now in the higher lay O O black incarcerated people yeah lung aren't\nBad it's forty percent and and it's it's a weird way or the or in a quarter percent of\nThe population and a ... with the United states hold the quarter percent of the population in prisons and that's a what is it five percent in the United states are so call African American but forty percent of them are actually\nIn prison in the United states how does that work\nWill be able like Johnny Carson idiotic like each still got it all worked with everybody that I'm kind of like mhm no I don't have\nSponsoring them or is it what that moment that money didn't go nowhere though ... um ... or ... million on atrocity that never came up and it was part of\nIt\nI mean this is like I always get a date yet still looking to go\nRight but you know this is about this is a thing right it is and then\nJust about voting also you've got to understand the vote how you vote what'd you voting for\nBeing educated on what you're voting for and being educated on where you stand in society as a home point blank period I'm advocating for voting because those ones who stuck who stuck in bondage of that and can't get out of it\nBecause they don't know how voting for them and their rights otherwise if you don't want to vote China drawing joined a different nations\n... or ... or a read on the uh the rights of indigenous people in ... and understand who are business people are so you can operate as their own person and then there is\nThe age is is one of the sacred and get it all I ain't got all the negative but we're all day long with what we were studying\n\nWell you should we used to the mall they\nBeing familiar with the process you have to remember that you know there's there's like you said there's multiple different society so if you have a whole society that's being oppressed right now but you have also a society that can make that change\nThe more you talk about it the more you get educated and more you let those people know and those ones know that can make the difference what's really going on you you're branching out and you're letting those people that can hold a vote 'em\nProsper they can they can then take that and and I think that there is such a disconnect between one society and the next society that there's a lot of people that aren't aware of really what's going on out there\nSo even at the drop in the bucket that you can get somebody else to say hey hey you know you know really what what's your voting for and as you say like this you know as a as a white person that's never affected by this you know really what this means\nAnd explain it to those people who can then take it to their people who are also in the position to make that change you know what I mean so you gotta you gotta start small and you got to be the seed\nAnd and get definitely start returning your own thinking to say well that's not going to work so you know what it can it's just about\nAll you know what should you should write like all of you know all of this or did you ever read it and we're in a number of cars over in a generational cars\nBecause we have been on educated you\nCan also thinking of rubber a person's over here like with the ... syndrome that when we were we were on my way to monitor the\nBody and you know just as education is going to if you look for in a rice ... asking the questions inside and you go and search them you will find what you're looking for are known to and if you have to have our any down\nConcerns man I mean\nI'm On a blog a lot of people don't even know about the ... law about the whole like those in the salt for me ...\nI mean if you bought the best you can actually get a little bit easier to get your life all I can move the ball is you have is\nThe only like you know what you mean it it it it makes you feel like OK all overwhelming ... while I was a lot of ... ... ... ...\n... which then yeah I didn't like it is that why\nAre you in a one percent of of of black males don't even try to get your kids or if you want to marry a neutral judge\nBut I never got a I I Am I doing quit but my my mom were nobody was really glad that out like why people who\nAre right you're in you're in the ... and that will work for me even though that's not gonna work for the general population of life\nBut you are using your use the same tactics is what I was trying to say as as far as you you have to somehow include what is working for them\nIn your process to get it to work for you so would by doing that that's you know that works for you in the same thing worse when if even if you can't vote informing other people who can vote so that they can get that over to that process so you're ... you're listening to write the men and women are actual\n... comes in because of what I did it for years they shouldn't have to be right or maybe you've chosen that it used to write heard about future you know what each each you know I just knew I knew what about like what what's your story\nYou know what I mean it was like look I struggled heart represent you back home and you hear me okay now\nWell we're never going to be true if you leave tributes or is it that way by the rules and districts the\nBushes\nCertainly here in the ... you know where to go ahead and there's a bandage why why\nWhy are you this what I was sort of red\nBull Connor ... not good you know you're like really both but we don't go to church but he was\nRight but see that's where you look in the how it works and like you said working by their their process find out where the primaries are to see who it is and it's running to make sure that you are voting for the right people to get into the finals and the way that you explain it\nWith with children you you you have to still be honest and explain it in that manner you know what I mean let them know what's really going on\nI'm so that they can they can see that here's the problem is that people forget I feel like if you can explain all day with the situation is or what you went through or whatever but you forget that last staff of so here's what we need to do now\nAnd as long as you can explain what happened or how you got to where you are what they're going through now but follow it up with\nSo here's what we need to do now you're arming them with the tools that they can then proceed but when that portion isn't good if given out to the community or the children or to the adults that really haven't learned it or people who have been locked up so long they don't know how it works or whatever the case may be\nThat portion of what do we do now um those that's your arsenal right there and that's really important to take it to the next step so that you can then say okay I see what you're saying like yeah we're stuck here but what's next and and focus on that portion of it so that they can say well you know my dad he told me blah blah blah blah blah but\nI have power but I go in and then that's how you're going to move forward and you're right it's generational is going to take a long time but if you don't start somewhere it's not going to go anywhere\nFrom ... you got it from the ... when he tried everything go towards older reddish color light it makes it\nLike some guy in central model that ... socks off me and it's certainly

Consuelo scenario and Eric Miller so welcome thank you thank you Renee good morning and you are doing a concert next week\nOf a variety of as you say of unknowns or even some composers who are well known like ... you're doing a piece which may be less well known so let's talk a little bit about how you put a program together and why you chose these pieces and then we'll hear some of them\nYeah we we always like to highlight composers that I'm not quite as well known as a box and and tell them on and uh the way we put our programs together is really you buy a collaborative effort all musicians bringing\nPieces that they'd like to perform and then we try to massage them into somewhat co errands for ...\nAnd uh we started out right away with um a robber unusual piece it's in a short come tighter\nAnd we don't know who composed there's two dueling a composure as you might have been posted the first one is born on ...\nBut we don't know which bone genie this is it could either be Antonina or Giovanni mhm ah so that's the first on your own and then the second manuscript that is a still survive is by ...\nOr a manuscript ... says ...\nMhm [laughter] I have er and he just German and ah both manuscripts are a collection of of ... I was an arias or by different composure sure it was very difficult to to say you actually composed well we don't talk what'd\nYou say it is more in a an Italian style or a German style I Would say it's Italian or is it in a in a trance alpine style [laughter]\nIt's it's for a soprano Alto recorder show officer continue and I would say to tell you made in my stomach\nAnd I'm Talking about unknowns or none of us could find it in our libraries or the meals music library so you'll have to come to the concert to hear it right right okay so you're leading off with that and then uh what comes next\nA next is this a variation set by August Coup no he was a ... a virtuoso I'm born in Germany and I'm probably\nSixteen forty five and then probably died around Seventeen hundred but he studied in Paris and he published this sets I'm In the late sixteen hundreds of ... not as there's fourteen of them this is number ten\nAnd it's based on a core al I'm\nHarry gays to Greece to do ...\nWhich um the tax was originally written in Fifteen eighty eight and we have an unknown composer we don't know quite who wrote the melody maybe it was the author of the text or tell them is rain vault but\nOnce again it's an unknown thing but as a melody that Bach used in pocket values so it it captured the imagination of several German composers\nAnd uh we unfortunately do not actually have that particular sonata on record but I can play a little bit of a two now a sonata just to give our listeners that taste okay\n\nMm\n\n\n\n\nWe've just heard a motel ... by ... and please forgive my French but I got a few nods over there\nUm we heard his ... less than the average for the holy virgin and it was performed for is by the ... spirit too well directed by heavy McKay and the soprano was Veronique and guns\nAnd you can hear that performed live this coming friday and Saturday with our guests we have members of the Wisconsin baroque ensemble including soprano Consuelo son you know who will be singing that these although she says a little faster perhaps a\nBut also ... and a Eric Miller\nAnd we should talk about where and when and how these concerts are coming up\nYes are we are doing to concerts next weekend the first one is on friday or the first one will be in the morning of eating chapel at seven thirty\nMhm so our friends who are in the southern part of our broadcast area and go here that\nThat's right and then uh the second promise Saturday Night at seven thirty and that will be in St Andrews a fiscal church on region street\nRight which is a wonderful venue for this kind of like it alive here is itself friday night and Saturday Night you can hear this program\nAh certainly encourage you to come out it's been impressive to me to see how much your ensemble has come together and improved over the years and ah it's really a treat to be able to get to your concerts thank you\nAnd I'm\nThe next piece we have queued up this multi verity and Consuelo where why don't you tell us a little bit about the motor verity All right um this is one of those pieces where at first sight I thought so\nRosie in yours here we go again a piece about a nightingale na da da da da Silva much more than that and that's always the surprise with wanted at least that there is so much content in such a such a short\nLength of time and I won't live this one down but I Believe the main attraction for me and for many people in months they've actually\nIs how manic it can be about topics like love and death\nSo to me I I enjoy it as much and sometimes more as listening to Wagner to something like ... I Believe it's a very similar source\nFor the for the emotion mhm um and of\nCourse ... well known for being that composer who led music really into the baroque style this is a very early pieces from his medical book number three on I think that came out and around fifty Ninety or silly Ninety two which is about that right\nAnd uh\nSome of his later books are better known and some of his later pieces are better known but you can certainly hear some of that new style\nAnd miss so\nIs there anything else we should say or should we just go ahead and listen oh let's go ahead and this is okay so this is\nA performance by a group they'll let\nYou see a music K under the direction of Marco wound Jeannie we'll hear over ... and you'll buy motivated\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nNo\nWonder when la la la la la la de\nLa ...\n\n\nThe\n\n\n\n\n\nNews to me the phone\nNumber\n... ... ... ...\n\n... ...\nUh did\n\n\nYou um during the\n\n\n\n... to ...

I moved to Madison with my family when I was around seven years old and then lived in Madison till the end of high school\nWent to west high school so I consider myself a Madison native even though I wasn't born here I have always loved doing art and being involved and creative projects that when I was a child I like to draw and write stories and it kind of evolved\nInto music in middle school and early high school and I've just been really passionate about music ever since then but I consider it kind of one long creative process I think everyone is is a creative soul and it's just chopper you express at the time so how would you describe your music\nWhat I've been saying recently is I write in a pop style but I Love exploring lots of different genres so sometimes the music turns out being more like a folk\nOr new indie folk modern folk and then sometimes it\nBecause like it goes more into a electronic pop and then just anywhere in between as well so\nI play piano and ukulele but\nI like experimenting with different genres and collaborating with other people who play instruments that I don't play or ... yeah I just have a different skill set or different mindset to bring to the table do like collaborating yeah I Do like collaborating my writing has tended to be a pretty so low process\nJust because it's happening in my mind whenever I'm Alone\nI Would love to collaborate on writing but I mostly collaborate in terms of performing with other people or working through songs with other people recording with other people\nAnd that gets actually into the next question I have which is what is your song writing process and what inspires you and you're right oh that's\nA good question my time writing process it usually starts with melody and a few key words\nInserted into that morality but not whole phrases which is kind of strange because since I've always loved reading I focus a lot on lyrics and my songs I find where it's really important I care about other people's lyrics it's hard for me to\nReally love or listen to an artist if I don't relate to the lyrics as well as all other parts of their songs\nSo but the lyrics definitely are developed later\nI'd say my some writing process is also very spontaneous I don't sit down to write a song I write basically any time that I Am not directly working on a specific project unrelated to music or when I'm not with other people so the main times\nI write are biking to work going for a run taking a shower going out and walk literally just all the space in between when I'm doing other things\nSo my next question how does your identity influence the music you write and that can be\nMuch broader as specific as you want it to be well yeah I think I'll have to answer that in several different ways so one thing that comes to mind\nIs I tend to write songs about my personal experience as a career person I'm very out in my songs my we're ex\nContain pronouns of different genders and that is important to me to be true to my experience\nI've heard from some ... artist that they intentionally make love songs are breakups arms for example I have\nThe you pronoun instead of any gender pronouns and I think that's a really cool concept so that every song is universally relatable to anyone regardless of gender or race regardless of the gender of the people are attracted to but I find personally that\nI Want people to know intentionally no this is a love song about a woman or this was a love song about an ... person in terms of other aspects of identity I think that growing up and listening to the music that my parents listen to when I was young\nCompletely influenced the type of\nJohn Rose that I explore and\nThe music that I write I don't think that that can be divorced from identity I think it's interesting I feel that if I was somehow\nBorn and raised in a completely different contacts I'm sure that my creativity would express itself in a completely different way I don't think that writing in this genre of style that I've developed is a given\nIn terms of content of songs something that I've been thinking about\nThat and then also perhaps release stuff in the future that is similar to the CPA a little bit more\nProduced I think that this is really an exciting project for me because\nBy the end of a song writing process months a song it's finished I sure exactly what I Want it to sound like in my mind and I felt limited\nTo a certain degree by the instruments that I play myself\nSo I Am looking forward to fully realizing these songs in terms of the name change\nSpecifically it's something that I've been thinking about for several years and it's more about basically allowing myself creative freedom and not feeling bound to my\nName or the identity that comes with my given name I waffles about it for a long time because I was wondering oh man I trying to hide behind something or\nAllow myself to be a different person or have a different artist persona which feels strange in some ways because my music is so personal and I want to be held accountable to what I write in what I say in my songs\nBut basically I Want to facilitate my own creative process and creative freedom and using an alias\nIt's like it will do that and it's also I intentionally chose line because my full name is Madeleine I never go by that [laughter]\nI only go by Matty but I realized at that second half of my name could be a bit of an alter ego or a different presidents that is still held within myself so I think it'll still be me basically [laughter]\nBut just a different side which kind of relates to the\nConcept of my new eat peas it's called choosing sides and it's about ... and internal questioning or even X. journal questioning and\nThe debate between one side of an argument and another and each song is about a different scenario but they all carried that same tension of the difficult space that we occupy when we're trying to make a decision or choose between things\nSometimes knowing what the answer is totally the best or the healthiest and for some reason we're still drawn to the other the other side or the other possible action stop and sometimes it's literally not knowing what's right or not knowing what to do feeling conflicted in some ways\nI'm really intrigued by that duality because I think as I identify as\nPretty empathetic person and I try to understand both are all sides of most issues and sometimes that can feel\nDifficult when it comes time to actually make up my mind about my own beliefs because of that empathy I think that that can be a point of growth or a problem sometimes for me and other times it can be a positive quality of being able to listen to others and\nRespect their viewpoints even if I'm also respecting the viewpoint of someone who is completely in disagreement so music\nI originally wrote it as kind of a I Would say an unreal quite a lot of sun but a song about someone who I knew it would be a bad idea to date them but over time it's turned into and catch leading the struggle of working through\nBisexuality or pen sexuality and feeling forced to choose sides and that you don't have to so I think it's become more empowering for me over time\nBecause they said was written at a time when I was really struggling with trying to label myself and put myself in boxes and I think it speaks to that struggle almost more than\nThe individual person I was writing about\n\n...\n\n\n\nAnd\n\n... may may na\n\nNa\nNa na\nAnd ...\nThere's\nNot going to say that\nThe\nMain\n\nWould be\nOh man\n\nCould\nDo the ... in\nMe I have a right\nTo the ...\nThe main\n\n\nReason\n...\nMeaning man maybe then\n...\n\n... ...\n...\nIn the\n\n\nBook on\nThe ... who the man I\nKnew I Belong to a\n...
