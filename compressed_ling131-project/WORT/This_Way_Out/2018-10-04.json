{"month": "10", "state": "WI", "station": "WORT", "content": "We wanted to write some specific songs I'm for that event for that crowd and without consent would be a good one um and just you know basic glee\nRespecting people's boundaries in cases like that or you know everywhere but um [noise]\nYeah that's I knew a son and we were like a little nervous about maybe playing it live on air but it felt like the right time to play it and it ended up being like the best time we've ever played it that's far so I'm really steps that we played it\nYeah it was to prevent as they do you know with all the news is going on too about\nAll of his consent that wasn't given in the past you know and just the need for us as a society to grow out of that infant see as a people and respect each other on a new level and\nUm it just really resonated we need to know when you played that song um um and what a golden opportunity to express that at a place like freaks us um\nI have went to many many ... I was I was born here in the sixties so I I was there even when it wasn't an official party um back when it was kind of\nEven more crazy um it's good to see that influenced come into that particular party because I Know it hasn't always had a really positive reputation yeah um so that's exciting\nUm I definitely like in the middle of that song I I've been\nSaying like things like I I Believe Christine for it and I believe Anita Hill that's what I was screaming and like I I Believe all of you [noise]\nUm I think it's it's crucial to to stand with survivors of sexual assault but then also you know part of what that means is informing people what consent actually is and how it works I think that like consent is is always revoke a ball you know consent is not\nUm something you've given now than it is it is the law of the land it as always we're both full in an active sense and so I think that's like\nI just think of ways will like interact on to her like when we went on our tour the last time and be like hey are you still okay with this like even like are you okay with driving or something like that for the next like you said you were like ten minutes ago but you seem tired now so like maybe you're not and like they require that sort of like\nI'm checking in an active participation in a relationship with somebody um which I mean obviously has as much wider impact but yeah like we weren't we weren't going to play it at first but I think that given everything that's going on politically right now it it made a lot of sense I\nThink is so much for playing that [noise] um one thing I always ask artist when they come in here is what advice would you give to a young person or or a younger person if they wanted to start playing music or start up a band or start expressing themselves with music um how how would you tell them to proceed\nDon't worry about sending that good just just say say the things that you are hearing a I think that so much of what we like in in your scene like write songs about the things that you want to write about and actually are not seeing other people write to them about 'cause like we were talking about like how\nWe want to write songs about loving our friends like not a lot of punk rockers around here write songs about loving their friends is unabashedly as we do and we think that like just as much as like justified angers important like\nI like actual like radical softness and like radical friendship is I'm absolutely essential so a yet and be be brave and\nYeah it said don't worry about being gators sounding good just do whatever you want and don't care what anybody thinks I guess\nThat is really great advice that phrase a radical sauce [laughter] that that's really cool I Love that so much a little bit through\n... and so you mentioned something kind of important talking about\nThinking about you know advice given to younger listeners maybe up and coming artist and one thing that to bring it back to the pledge drive for just a second I'm growing up in rural Wisconsin for me outside of W. R. T. signal um I had no idea that this place existed until\nProbably several months ago and as soon as I did um immediately got involved jumped into the news team um spoke with Doug shattered here for ... an hour here pledge wrapping which is kind of a terrifying experience um but like\nYou know to query is able to bring you the kind of content whether that's artistic you have performers you have people I'm doing things that you W with different sorts of studies\nWhatever that is I Believe that W or tea and query are very special things that we have in this community you can look at other noncommercial radio stations and they may be you know from twelve to six am or something like that it's the b._b._c. or some other syndicated program I Believe\nFor the most part here um we have people around the clock involved at W. R. T. bringing you the sort of content that you know that on the one hand is very entertaining um but also educational and I think really empowering you know I the demos called queers of joy I'm and you're bringing music that\nIs just able to help people process all of this nasty stuff going on\nWithout feeling to way down so if you appreciate that if you appreciate the kind of content going on tonight I'm calling at six to eight to five six two thousand and one or pledge on line at W. O. R. T. F. M. dot org\nTo make a donation we really appreciate it\nI wanted to let our listeners know whether it's some of the things they can get let's say pledge at this hundred and Seventy five dollar ... I'm I'm level you can get tickets to something rock\nAnd this is um\nLike the ... said at the top of the hour um it said the overture this is hard tickets sat in on Fifteen Ninety eight it's at the bottom brothers are trying to write a hit show that will take ... take on we'll Shakespeare today right the world's first musical\nAnd I know how much our listeners loves musicals\nAnd uh yeah this is supposed to be a cross between the producers Pamela in the book of Mormon\nSo I think anyone with a twisted sense of humor and maybe a bit python esque could probably enjoy this production of it is a touring Broadway production as well I just wanted the hostage home pretty sweet fees at the hundred and Seventy five dollar level\nYeah it's a um it's a two hundred and thirty dollar value so that's kind of a discount forty if you want to call in and make that pledge right now lead to five six two zero zero one we want to hear from you shot in gym out there are probably stuff to the gills with um with gas flats nickels [laughter] the gas\nGlavine ...
