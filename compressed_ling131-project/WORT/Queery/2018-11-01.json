I've been performing for about twenty eight years ... ... yeah right here in Madison and a native of ...\nThen how I got my start at the hotel Washington oh I Know that one yeah mhm\n[noise] and I think you know I met somebody when they used to hold ten percent society support meetings down at the union down on Lincoln straight back in the early nineties yeah I'm forty six\nAnd um [noise] it was a Tuesday night because they had Eighteen and up night on Tuesdays and Fridays and I went out and I saw this ... she was in the purple ball gown on a Tuesday night mhm and then I saw this boy at this meeting and I thought there's something about that person\nAnd it wasn't just an energy thing and I recognized the eyes mhm and from that time on we connected and that's how I started doing drag with meeting that person\nAwesome oh ah well I'm ... I have been performing for just a little over a year um\nI first got inspired by doing drag I went out to plan B when I was like Eighteen and\nWhen I was around the closer on society out [laughter] ah [laughter] so I've been for for a year and when I was going out to plan B I solved charisma mirage performed for the first time and I was like\nOh on me and I wanted to do it so bad and I had them theater in the past and I just didn't like the limits of theater and drag it's limitless I was like going to go into it and so I've been doing that that presents\nFinally my name is Regina when Taylor um my eyes a hairdresser in high school from all clear with God's new drug green um and just speaking with him and talking about it and he gets to do every weekend\nI'm kind of inspired me and I moved to Madison, Wisconsin then became very good friends with a couple of the local drag queens I'm at play it'd be a gun as well I'm trying to just got brought up into this group of people that became my family and I just kind of got souped up and I'm One day my mother bee article in brief gave me my first booking\nI Would say I'm In Madison here I'm a lot costumes they have that kind of our in mecca for the local performers yeah is there a theater makeup to cover up this double and I'm having a nation and\nTone in their color ... or ... is there um yeah they have everything other than ... than a yes or then that we don't really have a lot of um\nPlaces to get it in the mid west though Amazon dot com is great yeah on the Internet reunion writer now personally order my ... personally order my heels from Europe um still they can fit my twelve and a half wide feet\nThey um they have the steel reimbursements you'll look nobody break\nAnyway [laughter] [laughter] yeah I order\nA lot of my stuff on line or um I have a designer in Chicago at least ... he's amazing\nHe is very\nAmazing scene stress and you know you just ask around who made that where did you get this you know and you make connections you know and that's\nReally part of the dry communities making those connections to help you get there because when I first started out I was just going to like raw stress for last\nGood well just trying to find anything to put on me and there ain't nothing wrong you know there are some really sickening queen still today from resale shops and I'm like OK and we love a bunch of green [laughter] my first\nPageant that I competed for I was Eighteen years old and my friend John in cloud put me in it it was in Milwaukee it was called dot pageant in my first countless from good well at ... town would guide us church plume feathers on the shoulder how yeah that was my first aid they go nuts\nAnd that kind of proved a drag drag is an art if you want to go to a thrift store and get a whole outfit or if you want to contact a little bit designer designer across the country to make you a four thousand dollar down you can have either one you want to lose and\nThank you for cats for bringing up the designer thing is that's another are artistry part of drag on all of us know designers that are either drag queens or they make things for a non performers they\nJust stood there and do things for drag queens yeah um we had a list of homeless people who make us jewelry and taught him from hair and ... the artistry that some of these people have in the past and that they put into their work is incredible\nYeah at the amount of it later and so you just get in touch with these people through making\nA million of could actually have like a contest yet cast gives me all my connections like tells me where to get stuff too but I have like I'm a newer greener on the scene so she is like trying to help me get the jewels get your hair is a process you have to talk to every one that hit harder drag you can't be afraid to talk to people\n... you cannot ... you can't be ...\nI mean like they're shy queens but you have to be willing to make that sisterhood or that friendship with apple because if you're just not willing to talk with people you're not willing to learn and grow as a person\nYeah so one other question I still had to you guys talked a lot about um\nI'm kind of it sounded like you guys had mentors and ... as well is that is that a very common thing\nOh yeah I like a ... ... you know ... family yeah yeah yeah gay family dragged family drag mom is of course the person who puts you in drag for their first time is what my understanding of it is yeah the nineties overtime things can change\nBut I was always taught you know the first one that puts you in drag drag mom yeah you know right\nYeah I had I had a missile drag mother who put me a drug for the first time and we just went up there on the bar for nine um and that kind of evolved into a different relationship\nAnd now I have my drink whether it be ... um who gave me my first booking and she just kind of that person that I look up to like if I'm trying to buy something off the Internet is is going to fit it was right for me um she gives me pageant advice he gives me just advice in general about my career and where I'm going\nUp so she's kind of just a mentor motherly figure for me um but I Love her like a best friend so it's still that intense connection that my mother would have\nAnd she is very much a mentor to to help me out a lot and I love my sister be [laughter]\nI first started out I had a very different experience I had known to put me in drag I put myself in drag so I just watched Youtube videos and kind of asked around where to go like I cast mirage who's a local queen here told me how to get started here and so I started out here\nBut then as I started in the community everyone started giving me a ... and like I consider these people in my family now they're my\nLike I have my biological family and then I have my drag family because they like are always here for you as Regina said earlier we can get into fights but we all love each other at the end of the day because we're all doing the same thing mhm mhm because your family what family is perfect\nRight you know like what why should have had to go on and on [laughter] [laughter] and we are here on Halloween and we're talking about family\n[laughter] [noise] oh well oh now I lost my spot where well\nWe wasn't attempt to get people to call in I just really was that the jury yeah do you want\nBut on the guy is that the phone number either say the phone number yes sorry\nWe never said the phone number no wonder no one's calling in Madison\nAnd the the round in community we have a phone number that you can call pleased to give us the question of you have any questions for him is cast Murray deeper myself\nWe've called six to eight to five six\nTwo zero zero one it was there any question you get within reason and we have a long list of words that we cannot say don't force\nThem to help me [laughter] carry on the [laughter]\nAll right well while we're wrapping up hoping that people call in right fingers crossed hoping okay\nSo um I wanted to ask\nIf you're going to give some tips just some brief you know a couple of tips that you were going to give to people coming in to they're either they're first show are just getting started on the track seen what would the chips be\nMy tip is going to be um don't be afraid to say Hi I'm a lot of us are very busy um reaches to reach us to reach out to us on Facebook um come up come up to us at the club introduce yourself and\nNo matter where you're Drake rear takes you or where you find yourself\nDoes always be humble because I'm the latter can be a hard thing to climb but it's even hard to climb the second time\nMhm I'm\nRegina had a lot of good points but I Would add on to that and said just be yourself do what you're going to live and what you're going to live for and drag\nYeah absolutely you know I think follow your heart you're going to have your own unique individual\nIs um is that even a word [laughter] pretty bad [laughter] yeah you know\nI'm just follow your heart and do what makes you happy you know take your path\nThat's what I found that stay open to learning you look at hand ... always you'll never know\nYeah you never will know alright well\nGot anything else you want to say about Dr over waiting for people to call in otherwise\nIt's so eight five to ...\nThe bureau one [laughter] yeah we got to do that again\nAnd again you guys call in sick so eight to five six two zero zero one um\nOh I did have one so far well the big thing too I forgot to someone you have to choose a drag name right oh how do people choose to drag name oh my gosh [laughter]\nHow many different ways [laughter] like your first\nPet's name and your mom's maiden name that's one\nThing [laughter] yeah yeah mine was um the very first time putting makeup on my face I was a sophomore in high school me and my friend where sitting up eating drinking her parents vodka and her room on a Tuesday night we had school the next day\nAnd we were watching mean girls and this girl named Regina came on the screen and it all just kind of fell into my place\nWhen I Want to be heard I went from being around the red orange right here in Georgia [laughter] yeah I live and I'm going to drop out you guys bad [laughter]\n[laughter] I Want to do with it [laughter] yeah you're right on the air and\nThen tailor came on a later in my life and then we added the Wynwood from my um grandmother Bianco in Greece yes\nNice what about you got a little bit of a family tradition or\nSee I'm a comedy queen so I wanted to make it funny and mine's like you have to think about it a little bit but uh it\nIt's de de Pere is some of the first words they said deeper deeper\n[laughter] I Know I might [laughter] bless\nYour heart [laughter] bleeds [laughter] for you [laughter] so\nI'm Sondra ... was the first queen to ever put me in drag and she might have something to kind of go off of her name at that time Sunderland domino so we were thinking and\nUm she said well what about cats because then if you put cash and standards like Cassandra and I'm just thought of Maria\nSo they came up with cats
