doing I'm\nDoing well yes I Am I'm Charles what's all like [laughter] like you said I Am a uh an algae beauty activist I'm a boy scout 'em and artist I'm doing my best\nOr in the Trump here [laughter] that's me [laughter] aren't we all [laughter] well you are of\n... lots of things like I said and I would love to hear more about what you have been doing this past summer um I don't know where you see yourself\nUm and just wanted to kind of back up all the way to you know you're talking about your photography so you can you do like freelance photography you have your own\nDo yeah so I I got into photography I'm probably freshman year of high school I Would say is when I really sort of fell in love with it um [noise] and uh yeah I guess since then it's kind of snowball I I Do I'm a contributing artist at our last Maxine\nI'm and I'd I'd do photography for them um I also do a lot of freelance portrait Cher I'm so portraits and head shots and that type of thing\nUm and I also ah the ... this summer I put on a a a a portrait series in title light light Lyon heart um and it was a it was a series of algae beauty activists and leaders\nI'm In the greater sort of Wisconsin area [noise] um and I I what I wanted to do with the series is sort of portray L G ... leaders as um as royalty um so I I sat down ... and ...\nAnd all sorts of other amazing of the beauty activists I'm based out of Wisconsin and I took took their portrait and then I uh print them out real big twenty four by thirty six and I put them in these giant gold frames\nUm and then I had them they were hung at um a medicine at the maps and library um\nChildren's section really high up I think it was like seven or eight feet so they were kind of like looming go down at you [noise] um yeah so that's that's kinda my artistic life [laughter] I guess I guess recently yeah\nWell it so I the reason I was like I Need to interview Charles is\nYour name was popping up in our lives I saw this project to the working on that I'm going to ask you more about and what else I see oh and then uh from outraged that we're getting this award a and they're awards banquet I'm just like\nWho is this person you may think things I must find out more [laughter] and thankfully you agreed that helped me more hours for sure yeah so you\nGot this ... and it was really I'm just\nYeah I I don't know much about photography but the impact of the lighting and you know I didn't get to actually see it in person with the frames but I can imagine like the impact that that would have and it's just really cool to think of\nYou know what you can do and how you can portray some you know\nNumbers of um you know the algae to community in a way that's like these are people uh you know to be admired and like we need to create our own um have her own heroes in our own um leaders in our community and so and you can do that through you know through art\nFor her yeah and I was the kind of the catalysts for the for me starting the project was I was touring all sorts of um schools out on the east coast when we were we were talking a little bit before the show about college at the college application ... yeah [laughter]\nYeah but we were my family and I were touring all sorts of schools out on out on the east coast out on the east coast and um [noise] you you would walk into their admissions office offices and sort of these big I'm sort of academic hubs on on campus there would be these giant pictures of university presidents and donors\nSort of like looming a looming over over the campus and I was like\nWell that's cool um but uh\nI I kinda thought how can I how can I take this sort of feeling pork but these giant classical portraits are giving me I'm kind of applies to my own community\nRally yeah and usually it's a lot of like you know old white ... and you see an hour you know ... yeah [laughter] that kind of treatment and so yeah that's great I mean\nAnd it's something you don't even think about like when I go to a an exhibit and um I don't want stated somebody who was a an art historian who said like you know they also\nYeah so I uh I had no I had no idea I was I was up where I was actually a volunteering honesty Senate campaign I'm Chris very she was actually on the radio on W. arch yesterday on but I was driving back from um a campaign of an event in blamed for example um when I got when I got the text\nBut I was texting and driving [laughter] my parents are probably listening [laughter] um\nUh but I I I I read it and it was like I was in tears of film and gosh this is crazy like [noise] yeah so uh and I'm pretty I'm pretty excited pretty stoked [laughter]\nUh so did you do you have any idea of like how like did somebody nominee you\nAre yeah I I I'm not entirely sure yes see I don't really dominated ... entirely no if I'm if I'm able to say or how okay eventually yeah but yeah um yeah but but again it was like you know now I Would not on my radar and write was on\nMy right [laughter] well that's a pleasant surprise [laughter] yeah and obviously like totally warranted and deserving so yeah so you're working on the speech for that I Am\nYeah kinda it's kinda crazy I can I've done some public speaking at a time but whenever I uh I sort of get into these uh like\nI ... I don't love writing speeches or sort of preparing things for for public for we're preparing for public speaking engagements um but but I'll ... I'll sort of in the days and weeks leading up to a public speaking engagement all sort of fall down these uh these like rabbit holes but like\nThree or four hours just like randomly on a Saturday morning like typing away yeah yeah so [noise]\nSo it's a it's a lot right now\n[laughter] yeah well that's awesome obviously something to put on that um college application last time the wars in recognition fill out that second now yeah [noise] uh so uh how did you find out that you were the youngest person did somebody tell you that\nI was in the it was ... which which again it it kind of some kind of surprises me like I'm there are a lot of Madison is amazing amazing place to be an activist generally but I think it's an extra awesome place to be a a young high school aged\nI'm advocate um there's so many resources like like gee safe even a kind of will help foster that that leadership that type of show yeah yeah\nAnd um I remember when Michael Pollan was in town and my dad like yeah my dad brought us to all sorts of Michael Pollan stuff so what I was there was a rape thing are we on the one that called the coal center out of the one of the call so [laughter] um\nYeah so my parents have always been sort of I'm excited to include me and things and I think um I think that is\nSort of their older more experienced people around to include younger high school age people um that we sort of take pretty naturally to tie activism and the more I guess sort of adult things [laughter] um [noise] uh yeah so I yeah [laughter]\nYeah and it's that easy to I mean the the way you say it's like well obviously that makes sense if you you know if you are if that's kind of your life growing up and that's what you see around you then that is you know that some that the model that something to aspire to and\nUm I I think when people get apathetic about you know the\nDirection we're headed or about like millennials\nOr whatever you know generation that\nIs it's like yeah but you know all you have to do is look around you and um you know you can do something about that it's yeah it ... there's there's always an opportunity I I feel to\nUm to make change and you obviously are finding your own unique ways to do that and\nThat's awesome and and you don't you know there are different ways of doing it and I I just think that it's it's cool that you found ways that have um connected with like your strengths who you are and\nUm and then just like going with it and so\nAgain like I was really I was really lucky to have parents who are so [laughter] so sort of excited and ready to to fight for me um yeah yeah so um yeah I've I've been I've been pretty lucky [laughter] yeah\nWell I ... I Hope that um [noise]\nYou know I I work with young people as my job but I also just hope that like you know as a future parent at some point that that I ... yeah that's that's what I Want to do is like take my kid to cool speaking engagement yeah I mean and you don't make it or just a regular thing you know it's\nNot um it's not\nYou know even the way you see it to ... when you talk about young people like that's just what we're up to it's like that is you know that's just a part of the time\nSo [laughter] I I and as long as you have someone sort of more experience when you sort of giving you permission for her to speak your mind and participate and get involved um that that can really be the the catalyst yeah for things like Mark for our lives for example\nYeah absolutely a so just to see a little bit more about the um outreach awards so their next friday or tickets are still on sale and ah where is it\nIn at the ... known a um it's a ... okay alright tickets are still on sale you can get them into um October fifteenth I Believe is the deadline\nUm yeah come on your mark I think mark Pocan speaking and that Baker I'm of the charge yeah giving the keynote Yahoo it'll be a whole it'll be whole thing over here to be exciting [laughter] awesome\nPlus or you're sixty five dollar ticket is a donation to an amazing Gertie writer [laughter] it's outrage\nRight you're talking about [laughter] about Richard [laughter] I was like wait is there another charity you know getting a right we definitely want to support outreach\nAnd um [noise] I guess then\nMy final question for you is where you know where do you see yourself like where what do you kind of what's next for you even even like even in the next two months or in the next five months what's next but also like where do you see yourself\nYou know what to do so I like like we mentioned I'm a I'm a I'm applying the college is the moment so that's ... I'm I'm a I'm a standard high school student in the in that way um uh but I'm kind of\nUm that's kind of the most a permanent thing in my life right now but I'm I'm kind of looking at um at getting more involved once I once they turn Eighteen getting more involved in I'm In sort of\nThe the administrative end of scouting um so I Would I Would maybe you'll have to start a troop ... in the in the near future but again like that's that's a few months down the road [laughter] so so we'll we'll see um\nHow how that turns out [laughter] well I feel like you to be the perfect person to do it yeah and I think I think Madison could really use because there are so many communities with scouting doesn't reach right now I'm not not just like the LDP community but I'm more urban communities scouting is still a very sort of rural\nUm real organization I'm a so getting more I'm getting a a large are scouting presence in the in the Madison land area I think would be really really great\nYeah I yeah and I think yeah I think that just overall um and that and maybe this may or may not be true but um you know just having like a a diversity in general across a race and then obviously are and [laughter]\nI'm across all kinds of backgrounds um you know ethnicity um different religious backgrounds and all of that so um yeah I feel like this will be a great place to start that Madison and with you and yet they're very exciting", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Queery", "city": "Madison", "day": "11"}
