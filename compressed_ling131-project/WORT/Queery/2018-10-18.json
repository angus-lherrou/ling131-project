I have a lot of feelings about that uh I don't think comedy it needs to be offensive to be funny I think that's cheap humor and\nLike I think about what I thought was funny when I was like Fifteen and super troopers and grandma's boy where like my favorite movies I watch them now as an adult and I'm like this is this is not okay um so it took a lot for me to form my own\nKind of feminist and woman is kind of lens because we grow up in this world of patriarchy and think that humor is a certain way and really it's it's degrading in it and it puts women down it puts clear people down\nAnd and that's not okay so um I Try to\nSpeak from my own experience as a queer woman in my comedy and uh I think I'm real funny what's like can I say hell I think I'm funny as hell hell is not on that list [laughter] there's a limited words we can't say site to refer back to that\nSo I I think that comedy does not need to be offensive comedy does not need to be racist it does not need to mention um dudes\nGenitals is not on the list either against their genitals on so there's there there are a lot of things that people think are just like\nComedy and if you're easily offended don't come it's like there are many many other ways to be funny like figure it out right [noise] I Try to go\nWith the punching don't punch down kind of idea but um you know and I've actually been challenged by this thinking recently and watching panic as these men at re you guys have seen it so she even talks about self deprivation has sort of um humiliation instead of being instead of humility\nWhich a lot of my humorous self deprecating so that has made me pause but I'm In general I think if you use your own experience and can find humor there there's not really a need to lash out at other than it is cheap it's um\nI've had people ask me I've had men asked me why they can't why they can't tell rape jokes because I have told rape jokes\nBecause I've experienced sexual assault and I feel like that's a much different perspective than it dude who haven't and I tell them if you are going to go there it better be the best rape joke that I have ever heard was and it's not going to be so just All right [laughter]\nI like hearing I like hearing that story especially in light of the fact that are coming out day was just last week so um that's that's interesting uh Shawna shot so uh my identity\nAm a fairly certain from my memory is my first girlfriend with the ... Barbie when I was about\nSix [laughter] cold hard um but I Would like to hear [laughter] I officially it came out um when I was twenty four I just turned thirty one a couple of weeks ago so I I my thank you my\nI I most identify with lesbian gay or clear\nI'm a date women I mean one woman not honey one one woman I'm engaged to [laughter] I'm gay\nSo and so that's that's that I'm [laughter] I also identify as a white woman I'm\nCyst gender a\nAnd you know all all of that I did date guys and uh have sex with guys before I came out and when I came out people are like well doesn't that make you buy sexual and I was like well no not for me\nUm some sometimes I can be a confusing process I guess for everybody but for for me it was pretty snooze\nThat's kind of like saying I used to eat meat but now I'm a vegetarian where you kind of like on the road since you ate me before I Know that I Know\nAnd then having a lot of dreams lately a ... never mind we won't get into\nThe cause you can't say I can say I can say steak and I can say cheese\nCan you [laughter] um I learned my lesson [laughter] awesome though a\n[laughter]\nWhere to go from that and she like where to go where to go I'm I'm considering becoming began um just after that especially like I Do [laughter]\n\nSo\nOne one of ... me is I think it's important as\nQuickly or ... you know trends by lesbian to be visible\nAnd vocal about who we are because those stories need to be heard because a lot of times they say oh you're not really a lesbian or oh you're not bisexual that doesn't exist\nAgain [laughter] thank you educated me yeah I'm here for the I've totally gotten\nThat like um people mostly straight white dude saying but you don't look like a lesbian\nAnd like what does that mean that I don't I don't look like someone who wants to have multiple orgasms in one night like I don't understand what\nShe thinks it's it it does happen and now like well it did happen and now I luckily I'm have a a good group of friends\nAnd people who I surround myself with\nWho I feel safe around and don't have to experience a lot of that but going back to what you were talking about you know in the beginning about like attending open Mike nights and things like that I Do shield myself from some of that and I I purposefully don't go into spaces where I have concerns that something might happen and that's not fair and that's not right\nUm I Am thankful for some of the spaces that have been created like your Sunday night open Mike's\nWhere um they do center ... and women and um some other like lady led\nA comedy shows and things like that out there that have been very valuable to me so it it's not right that I have to not like to go to certain spaces because I'm scared something might happen or somebody might\nIrritate the ear just irritate me\n[laughter] referring back to the chart and I'm really watch and I love the church thing but we can't sell them so they're so there's\nThat my yeah I think that's a really good point and it's something that I'm so grateful to you dean afford to create that space where we can feel comfortable I think the first actual show I did that wasn't an open Mike was lady last\nOh my God yeah so just to have that space and know that you're not going to encounter that because there are some places in town where you go to an open Mike and you don't know what you're going to get I've been called the some of the words on that list um\nAnd I'm assuming it's the worst [laughter] oh yeah and the I don't cute yeah charming ... super cute\nUm and I think that that's not fun I I I sometimes joke that it's so nice that we have safe space where straight\nWhite man can tell their best jokes mhm right right but in reality we I I Do feel like there there are more safe spaces for comics who are not that straight white man and I credit you a lot for oh God thank you this does not while you're here they\nJust want to have you on how you look blow to smoke on my ... [laughter] you can do that in an office [laughter] can I say ... on on late night okay good can't say [laughter]\nUm and I like Margaret saw me in the middle of summer or the beginning of summer when everything was just going to ... how in a hand basket and I was just like we were doing a show and\nI was like around me right now women are so frustrated [laughter]\nAnd um and so thank you so much for being that person [laughter] oh I Love being that for my stretching sadness and the anger and um\nAnd listen to me so I I Am like I'm so excited to see what's happening with women in in the city\nAnd especially comics like finding like you guys are funny you know and and your amazing into our big hearts and your real and and I just find that so inspiring and beautiful and I I Want to thank you guys\nFor doing what you do it again thank you thank you\nKnow again you know they may say All right sorry and I find that they think\nOh I'm Sorry to say where [laughter] so yeah [laughter]\nWe're failing our feminist energy like seeping out of a woman a woman in energy and I love that I mean there are spaces\nWhere you know like as a trans woman people get angry that I'm there and I'm just like I Am a woman I Am here like we're we're facing the same stuff\nYou know face the same thing every day that you do and sometimes to a greater level like I'm so women don't think that we're women men don't think that we're women they just want to have sex with us and then like and then my family just think I'm going to help you know it's kind of\n[laughter] it's\nJust one of those things that that's so interesting and I love being a part of women um who are so inclusive and an amazing and that brings us all in and go altogether forward into the harsh harsh world you know and and with comedy even now more than\nEver and we were talking about this before the show was a main um before the show um we were talking words there are um\nAbout how now more than ever we need to laugh now more than ever women need to have the forefront in comedy\nNow more than ... people need to be able to be on a Mike telling their stories and telling jokes and being visible and and that's important to me and that's what really matters and I love what's happening with women or so in ... where women were women women where people here in Madison\nAnd not taking the status quo and saying we're done you\nGuys were done to thank you so much for being here how can people find you if they want to find out more about where you're going to be what you're doing do you have a public persona that you're willing to share with with the world", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Queery", "city": "Madison", "day": "18"}
