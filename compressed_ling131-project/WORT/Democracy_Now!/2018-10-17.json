this radio program into welcome to this radio station veteran journalist Didi gotten plant duty gotten plan is editor at large with the nation magazine he covered very closely to two thousand sixteen election and he's the author\nOf a book that's called the next Republican the rise of a new radical majority did he got unplanned good to see the thank you for being here good to see you again three weeks away from the mid term election perhaps the most highly anticipated mid term election\nMaybe ever certainly in my lifetime what what are you thinking about what are you looking at while I'm looking to see how our site\nDoes and by our side I don't I don't mean Democrats per ... per se I mean we saw in the cabin a confirmation hearing that you know you could have a Democrat like Joe Manchin who's pretty worthless politically\nSo I'm not interested in whether Joe Manchin gets re elected because he's just shown that there's really no point like even if it means and I do we say about his role is to have it\nYeah control the agenda I think you think well why don't you get confirmed to judge ships well except that's right that's the argument that they always make that you've got to vote for any Democrat hold your nose no matter how bad because then\nIt determines who gets confirmed for judge ships but we just saw he's already a Democrat\nI have voted he voted the wrong way so why are you going to vote the right way of Democrats control the Senate now we need to we need to make sure that the people who get in on our our on our side I think that's one lesson we can get into this later that's one lesson we learned from the Tea Party on the other side is that they they were willing to lose some racist to get rid of some people who they felt were never going to vote their way\nA lot of people and they say well I I don't want the government controlling it I don't want 'em it if the government control did we'd be rationed in a very\nDifferent way well that's true it would be rationed in a very different way 'cause the way it's Russian right now is it's rational on the basis of wealth and you know if you have well that works for you so why would you want to change it I mean I I live most of the year in England so I I\nI have had two kids born on the national health service and uh the bill for the first one of those was a hundred pounds because we decided to opt for a private room at the hospital [laughter] uh the bill for the second one was zero uh you know and I'm getting older I I use the health service all the time\nAnd uh yeah sometimes you have to wait you know because but the funny thing is and the thing that Americans who warn\nWho warn people who are born Americans at all if you're not careful single payer we'll give you a British style national health system where the doctors worked for the government and health care is rationed\nThat's true most doctors do work for the government they they work for the national health and health care is rationed on the other hand in England if you have money you can jumped the queue you know you can go private I mean if you're tired of waiting for your hip replacement operation you don't want to wait three months which is probably what you'd have to wait\nAnd you want to pay for it pay for it you you can being richest justice [laughter] it's just as advantageous in in Britain as it is in the United states is just to being poor is not punished yeah\nIf the Democrats win the majority in the house of representatives do do you think it's a different kind of Democratic majority\nAnd we hope so that I Hope so I mean I feel like a you know this is where it says you came in the first question which is\nHow is this different and how how does how does the right and left to respond to elections I mean let's go back to ... to two thousand right George W. Bush stole the election\nHow did we crafts respond to that we shook hands and said well better luck next time good luck with being president um you know how did they respond to Brock Obama's\nElection by refusing to accept it was legitimate from the very first and by you know obstructing every action he took his precedent so what happens in our system and has been happening for a long time is that when the left wins the right questions not our tactics or a strategy but our fundamental legitimacy\nAnd we have only woken up now we have only potentially reached the point and I hope that this will be the case with this house if the if the Democrats take over the house when we realized that we have to fight fire with fire that you know I I remember at the end of the cabinet are hearing I was listening to NPR\nAnd I heard somebody talk about the impact of these hearings and polarization on the Senate and Wynwood civility return to the Senate and look I I Believe in civility I'm the kind of guy that lets the other driver got going in front of me all the time [laughter] but um and I think the world's a better place for it\nBut if somebody's coming after you with the two by four there is no point being civil\nYou know and the Republicans have been coming after us with a two by four since ... since two thousand at least so\nYou hope to how do you respond to that though ... what they should say there is a new Democratic House majority how would you want it to respond if the Senate is still potentially held and the Republicans hands are you still have Trump in the White House well I Would\nWant them to respond by every means available so that means you know every procedural delays that you can delay to make sure that there are no more right wing judges confirmed not just on the Supreme Court\nBut at every level or I Would be able to do that in the house so well\nYou can do what you can put pressure on people you can put pressure on people and also there are procedural things that the house can do not about judges but about other things I mean you know these all these parts you were in ... interconnected and if\nAnd the Republicans know how to use all the leaders and they're not shy about using one of the ... and the Democrats oh we can't do that that's not decorum that's tradition to heck with that you know we've gotta we've gotta fight fire with fire so I Would say obstruct delay and also\nBecause and I say in the book it's no it's not enough I mean I'm not much phrase that's not only clients for it\nIt's but it's an important point we can't just be obstructive we can't be Mitch McConnell we have to say\nWe have to say this is our yes this is what we want to do so I Would expect Nash you know single payer health care to be moved and you know passed in the house and put for the Senate to turn down or to amend or to pass so that you put these Republican senators on the spot so you can say next time\nYou're you know you were offered to say you were the there was a bill that would have taken away healthcare adaptive of taking away the threat of bankruptcy to your family and you know the senators voted against it you've got to get rid of them if you ever want to have financial security in this country\nHere's a bill that would have wiped out your kids to hundreds of thousands of student debt when I Would have nationalized\nInnocent when he bailed out the banks spent you know billions been out the banks\nIt is perfectly possible to nationalize an socialize all student debt and offers an offer people who went to college a chance to you know get out from under that incredible crushing burden\nSo we should be doing that we should be passing laws to do that and we should be passing laws to stop fracking to protect the environment and again to cause yes it's true that you can't\nThe house can't control who gets confirmed to the to the bench but it controls the purse on everything else you know and they've got to use that power of the purse not just creatively but aggressively\n[noise] this is letters and politics and we are in conversation with Didi guts in plan he is\nEditor at large of the nation magazine author of the book an extra public the rise of a new radical majority for listeners and the San Francisco bay area the gum line and we'll be speaking tonight and Berkeley at St john's Presbyterian Church\nThat's tonight at seven thirty PM St john's Presbyterian Church twenty seven twenty seven college avenue in Berkeley will give those details a few more times before the uh our is up\nDuty gotten plan and again the title of your book the next ... public ... let's talk about what a Republican is how do you define\nRepublic well so okay um my book\nHas two different kinds of chapters that has chapters of their profiles of activists like Jane ... Teachout or Jane club or in Nebraska the Keystone Pipeline pipeline opponent I'm Chuck ... in Jackson, Mississippi the mayor of people who I think are doing essential work\nAnd who hopefully our who who are perhaps not as widely known as ... you know prophetic voices like nah me climb or Michael er and er or or Bill McKibben\nUm but who I think should be more widely widely known but then there are also these ... historical chapters and\nI guess and they're each about what I call a different last republic uh and by republic the best definition of a republic I've ever heard was Abraham Lincoln switches government of the people by the people for the people that you had in England you had people who use the word republic to essentially mean government without the king\nSo that you know when they when they cut off king Charles the first head they instituted the commonwealth that than England became a republic but then when they restored the monarchy they started to use Republican odd ways but the the original meaning of republic meaning\nYou know a government by the people not by a social class or a hereditary aristocracy\nWas incredibly influential in the colonies and among the people who Became Mark ... founding fathers so that\nA ... when the constitutional convention was deliberating in Philadelphia a Benjamin Franklin was leaving one day and a woman stopped him was on his way out ... the deliberations were secret\nAnd she said tell me doctor what have we got a monarchy or a public because they didn't know you know ... and it never been done what I mean it had been done Venice was a republic ancient Athens was a republic Sweden had been a republic there'd been a Dutch Republic\nBut you know the idea that you could just have a government without a king was pretty radical and and Franklin's reply was interesting he said a republic madam if you can keep it\nAnd part of that is because all of these other republics I'd mentioned these historical republics from the Roman republic forward at all at some point collapsed\nAnd so part of what people knew about republics was that they were potentially fragile and how do you keep it and that's what that's what the sort of early constitutional convention was about deliberating how to make sure that we have a republic that would in door and then\nAs I write in the second chapter the book the whiskey republic question of what kind of republic are we going to have are we going to have a republic which is in the interests of the masses of people are we going to have a ... a republic\nWhich is run by an elite whether you call it a marriage to a meritocracy an aristocracy please talk receive which means you know the government is run by people with money\nOr and\nYou know the ordinary remember if you're a Philadelphia shoemaker or Boston silver Smith or you know a Carolina farm subsistence farmer\nOnce you're fighting to get rid of the British and their rule\nThe question is what are you fighting for and\nYou know we history when you look at the past there is a sort of condescension that we have implicitly because we think ... things had to turn out the way that they did turn out\nBut when you were fighting at the time you didn't know where you were heading so people didn't know where they were stopping you know in other words they could've they could have instituted a republic where everybody had the same property they could have been to the republic where you know\nWill be speaking tonight with Michael Lerner at the St john's Presbyterian Church in Berkeley that's at seven thirty tonight\nTwenty seven twenty seven college avenue St john's Presbyterian Church again did he gun plan will be speaking with Michael learner tonight\nI Want to dive into it and this is something we've been paying on a lot of attention to on this show is the Eighteenth fifties and when Trump first got elected I went to cover the first couple of months of the administration in Washington DC\nAnd I remember I met with the official historian of the Senate her name's Betty coed very very nice person very knowledgeable and I'm I looked at her and and I said I Do do you know of any other time and that is crazy is is this one right now [laughter] and she laughed at me he said of course the Eighteen fifties right well you said before\nThe civil war and so we dive into Eighteen fifty is which is probably the most contentious moment besides the civil war which people\nWere shooting each other and and massacring each other and Kansas and Nebraska and in Congress and on the floor of the Congress you know the south Carolina Senator was beating up the center for Massachusetts on the floor of the Florida Senate nearly killed him\nAnd this is the period of time that we get the creation\nOf the Republican Party a party that was formed to take on\nThe slave power you know I was just out the party that was now you know it wasn't a unified party had different factions within the party but but a party that was acted favorably towards immigrants white immigrants at the time basically given away native land but um I mean a party you would not be able to recognize today well\nYeah there's lots of things that are interesting about the Eighteen fifty ... and I suppose the first thing to say is that slavery as the original sin of our ...\nPublic and the main\nPriority of politics American politics from Seventeen Seventy six to Eighteen sixty was to avoid talking about slavery\nYou know I there's a point in my book where I ... I talk about a John C. Calhoun\nAnd John Quincy Adams walking home together after after the compromise of Eighteen twenty which is when the Congress agreed that free free state admitted there would be a slave state to keep the current balance of power which was\nFine if you like the current balance of power which is essentially in favor of slavery or and you know they they fought it out on the fourth Senate and they walked home maybe Italy together because\nThey had essentially found a way to put off this issue although Adams wrote in his journal that if the if the republic should should fracture if there should be war which it should come over this and so the question of how to make it come over this and of course\nIn the beginning the only people who objected to slavery with any force where the slaves who objected from the very beginning you know they they revolted they they thought they objected and freed slaves started the abolitionist movement with white religious allies like Quakers and other\nEvents ... thought that uh that slavery was he knew who knew that slavery with people who are willing to admit that slavery was even since I suspect everybody knew that slavery was evil [noise] um\n[noise] but it didn't become political it was a it was a moral it was a moral fight it didn't become a political fight until the Eighteenth fifties and in the fifties made a political and part of that was because the slave power so the oligarchy of its day a\nKind of like oil companies now you know they're they're they're strangling us they're killing the planet they're pretty they're polluting\nA but people think that being an environmentalist is some kind of a you know a hobby or immoral position rather than a political position so it became a political issue because the slave power overreached because it it it it felt that it had to make sure that slavery could spread\nAnd and that hurt in spread not just so that you have slavery so that but they said that they have more representation in Congress more representation in political power\nIt's also about minority rule well it's about minority rule political power and also it was about ... it's it was about crowding out remember that once you take the Native Americans out of the picture\nThen there's this big empty country and so the question is what kind of what kind of countries are going to be as it is it going to be a country where you can take your wagon and farm and keep your crops or is it going to be a country where if you don't own slaves you're nothing because any any free labor is going to be under cut by slave labor so\nYou know that was an essential aspect of the Republican coalition was people who wanted freelance people who wanted open the west um but they're also north an industrialist who felt that\nYou know their their ... their market was being restricted by slaves and their products were being undercut by slaves and they wanted protection they wanted a tariff\nTo to shield them from cheap competition in Europe um but the\nThe ... states didn't want tariffs to hurt them you know is it hurt them and the ... states dominated Congress so you know it it was a political fight was definitely political fight and in Eighteen fifty six the Republican Party was formed a nominated John C. Freemont to California and\nUm and his slogan was Freeman free labor Fremont\nOr the free soil free labor Fremont that was his slogan but the interesting thing is that around the country\nThe Fremont supporters groups were called wide awake clubs and they had an open eye as their emblem and you would see these parades through the streets of like fifty thousand people in Pittsburgh will be marching in these with these torches and these big you know banners of open eyes um of course they lost and Eighteen fifty six\nBut that was that was when Republicans were ... that was their slogan was you know if you wake up to the evils of slavery then you have no choice but to join us\nAnd and just the transformation of the Republican Party is is because I I think we talked about this off air but but I look at the Republican Party today and I look at it as a party that is\nReally become a refuge for folks that would have some type of lead tent sympathy for the confederacy I mean just the complete one hundred and eighty degree turnaround that that this party did I mean you just look at it within support of Confederate statues well\nFirst of all a I'm not sure that simply a so late and particularly in the south where I grew up uh but I Would say this that the book I wrote before this uh it was called the nation a biography and it's a history of the nation\nMagazine and in in researching that I realized\nAnd I became acquainted with when the Republican Party started to turn and there's there's a chapter about it in this book as well which is what's interesting is that the Republican Party\nOkay so let's let's look at it this way what is the biggest asset class in the United states in Eighteen sixty it is the bodies have been slave to people there were three and a half billion Eighteen sixty dollars\nWhen England abolished the slave trade it compensated the slave owners when America abolished the slave trade when Lincoln\nSigned the Emancipation Proclamation and in it promised that slaves would be forever free and then saw to the enactment of the thirteenth amendment so Steven Spielberg wasn't wrong to make up the center of his movie the thirteenth amendment\nWhat he did was he X broke rated and then liquidated without compensation the biggest single asset class in the country that is the most radical economic act in American history if we today said\nThe government is going to nationalize and liquidate every major oil company\nBased in the United states that would not be as radical as what Lincoln did so\nInteresting I I found fascinating but what you had done was you had um\nWas the result of this Republican coalition of northern industrialists and and uh immigrant farmers and you know\nAnd and this is something else that that got me interested in this so I Lived part of the year in Vermont Vermont's the only state in the country where slavery was never legal and yet it's also the state in the country that had the highest rate of participation in the union army more more of a monitors per capital enlisted than any other\nState so what is a Vermont farm boy who's never seen a slave fighting for he's fighting for his dignity as a free person he's fighting for the survival of a Republican not not an oligarchy not a country where the slave power with its money controls people's lives\nSo the civil war is over\nThe slaves are free the Republican Party is triumphant the radical Republicans are trying to deliver on this ... on this promise of freedom\nRight Charles Sumner the man who was beaten on the floor of the Senate and Thaddeus Stevens together put together this ambitious program to give the slaves land and to you know not just gives them the vote but to fully and franchise them as citizens\n[noise] at the same time you have this body of soldiers who have now been de mobilized but who fought for their own freedom so just like after World War two when you see the the incredible radicalization that African American participation in the army\nAt and the result of added civil rights movement in the Eighteen sixties you have all these northern soldiers working men artisans farmers who fought for something\nAnd Carl Marx called so after the after the uh the civil war the state of Illinois passed as an eight hour law marks called the eight hour law the first fruit of a civil war you had the sudden movement for workers' rights\nAnd that scared the hell out of the northern industrialists and that's that's how the Lincoln republic began to come unstuck interesting yeah", "show_name": "Democracy Now!", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "17"}
