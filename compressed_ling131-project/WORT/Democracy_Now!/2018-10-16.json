Matthew de ... he is the Harriet Johnson ... fifty six professor of twentieth century history at Skidmore College\nAnd he's the author of a biography is called then they came for me Martin anymore the pastor who defied the Nazis Matthew how can this is my very good pleasure to welcome you to this radio program\nThat he's not here\nFans and so for much of the four hundred years of Lutheran history meeting up to a lot of time or the Lutheran Church had been a very very strong proponent of the state um [noise]\nWe often talk about um the marriage of thrown an altar in the process in church so the process insurance was extremely nationalistic\nAnd felt very much that he owed allegiance to the states and the state\nOr the so certain sort of privileges on Protestants and\nYou know mostly the people who led the various ministries and obviously the Kaiser's themselves were Protestant\nAnd Martin emailer was brought up in a very conservative Protestant household his father was a champion of one's own a monarchy and um he instilled this in his two boys um Martin and Jill how\nBoth of them ended up serving in World War one proudly and then after the war both of them took up I'm just a a\nTheir father's a career and became pastors yeah I mean I think what's interesting about Martin Luther and the reformation and Martin Luther in some ways was was a very radical\nFigure of his time he broke off from the power of the day of the Catholic Church\nUm but that said uh his views toward civic life what was very different because even in the work of Martin Luther would cause other adults to happen including the president revolt but he never supported those those other things that do more with with politics and civic like\nMartin Luther was always a firm believer in in top down I guess a type of role\nYeah there are also you know other sort of um [noise]\n... churches would in Germany they were kind of relevant here in ... Lutheran Church is obviously the strongest and uh the largest in Germany\nBut Martin meanwhile or live in ... and all the impression is very Lutheran they had a uh something called the United church which combine some industry to qualities of a Calvin as I'm Lutheran is I'm ... and there was also a small reformed movement or columnist moment in Germany as well\nAh and certainly the Lutheran sort of dominated the Protestant Church and their nationalism and their love for the father land and their commitment to uh Germany\nExpanding its power across the globe was I'm a very central component of German Protestantism during the second empire or a period of Kaiser's\nAnd this is key and understanding people's world view at the time especially from from the right in Germany just after World War one and then after World War one and the defeat of Germany people like Martin emailer are just absolutely destroyed by by uh the law's not not only was Martin ... destroyed ... soldiers\nAnd upset about it so it was Adolf Hitler\nYeah so the first World War and the first World War\nMost people went off to the war fairly enthusiastic although not everyone did obviously a lot of workers and a socialist or would not have been as enthusiastic as said in the middle class about going off to war in Ninety four team but a lot of Germans are believed that the war would be short\nThat they would achieve an easy victory you know they were going to play the ... plan and take out France quickly and then turn around rush of botched um and it didn't go that way as we know the war was\nIncredibly deadly both on the home front and the battle front\nIt lasted for horrible years and when it came to an end um Germany was on the losing side at last on the battlefield it simply run out of men and ammunition they could no longer sustain the war effort\nOr even though Russia had been knocked out of the war in Nineteen Seventeen and the Germans were able to transfer the vast majority of their troops to the western front they still couldn't defeat the French and British and the addition of the Americans and Nineteen Seventeen and Nineteen Eighteen\nI'm just overwhelmed the Germans sooner war came to an end Germans were sort of shocked\nI'm no one really had been warned that there was going in this direction the leaders of the war all on a number and Eric ... a new door had not been on\nIt's the population and they had insisted that they could win the war it was up until the last minute Germany um believe that they had a chance and so the workings of the end of the war of the last king as quite a shock to a lot of Germans Nemo ruler was just devastated by it on the end of the war was accompanied by\nA socialist revolution and the spread throughout Germany and overthrew the holes or a monarchy\nMill how in the second was forced to fleet Holland and a moderate liberal socialist government came to power\nThese were um you know ... or in the process and churches enemies a lame them for the loss of the war yeah the the far right in Germany establishes idea that Germany had been stabbed in the back at home\nBy socialist communist and Jews and that they in fact had really lost lost on battle front in part they sustain that by arguing that very few\nBattles or foreign troops were on German soil the Germans had defeated the Russians on the Eastern Front and they still\nOccupied territory in Belgium in France at the end of the war and so they could argue inaccurately by they could argue that well um we didn't really lose more on the battle front we were stabbed in the back by these international s abs and Jews on the home front this is the Weimar Republic\n[noise] yeah so the Weimar Republic uh comes to power Nineteen Eighteen were the fall of the monarchy and it remains in power until Nineteen thirty three when Hitler comes to power it starts off as a sort of liberal socialist oriented government but over time it moves to the rice\nAnd by then by the end of the republic there are a lot of 'em right wing conservative nationalist who are um dominating the government\n[noise] during this period of time especially after World War one but really leading up all the way to the the rise in the final takeover of government by the Nazis in Nineteen thirty three it's just a a wild political scene that turns oftentimes violent threw out Germany this is a period of time when we see the rise of the Spartacus\nLee against people like Rosa ... on the left in Munich you had the rise of Kurt Eisner and a democratic socialist who they were actually overthrown by communists\nWho were overthrown by other communist after that because that's how the left usually operate so I guess I'm into where in in Munich him of areas where were you get the rise actually ... of the Nazis I'm\nOriginally but but you you see these pitched battles in the street between the left a and the right during this period of time is\nMartin ... involved in that at all\nWell he returns on his um submarine when the war was ending was in the Mediterranean or as was in the ... and he had to say on it through the Mediterranean Sea with the Atlantic back to the ports\nI'm In northern Germany and when he arrived there the socialist revolution was already underway there were different factions as you pointed out in the revolution there were socialist and there were a communist [noise] um and\nHe was not directly involved in any of those pitched battles at that time he had returned home on his ah\nFiance was at home in um near where he Robin Westphalia so he returned there for a little while he was disgusted with uh what was happening obviously um each child that Germany was just falling apart [noise] his first plant actually was to move\nTo Argentina and become a sheep farmer because a lot of sort of right wing naval commanders were doing that they just could not stand living in\nGermany under a new government he decides not to do that and eventually uh takes off farming himself a in West failure\nIs during this time that the communist movement in Germany um is trying to um influence and overthrow the socialist government and meanwhile are on leaves a brigade of sort of freak war these are\nDeemed militarized around being mobilized are soldiers who maintain their weapons and\nSome sort of a paramilitary force\nNow they certainly did not want a necessary to send the socialist government that they wanted to see the communist movement so Nineteen twenty and there was a big battle in the rural between a communist and the right wing freak\nFreak work anymore led one of those battalions defeating the communist or in this battle so he was really on the far right at this time these paramilitary groups known as the free core\nWe're in many ways precursors to the Nazis in terms of their politics and in terms of their militarism are so even though the Nazis had not really gotten um you know their movement going by this point I'm\nJoining a free for was a sure sign it where you stood politically\nAnd he joined them did he fight with them\nWell [noise] um [noise] you never actually officially joins any particular freak war but he does fight with them and the battle of the I mean he was getting married he gotten married recently I\nI think a child was on the way and I don't think he felt that and joining the free core and sort of you know a full time basis was was sort of a husband and father could do but he certainly demonstrated to support for the I'm On a couple different occasions\nAnd so he's opposition is primarily I'm\nDeveloping an opposition movement to the German Christians and in a September of Nineteen thirty three key and Detroit bond offer a young Lutheran theologian\nAnd some other like minded pastors founded the pastures emergency league and the pastors emergency league had um a four part pledged ... centrally stated that\nAs ... ministers we are going to preach the gospel as we were taught to do and we're not going to allow foreign influences like not to use them into the church\nAnd we're also going to defend 'em our co pastors who have Jewish heritage or and Jewish ancestry\nFrom attack by the German Christians and the Nazis so the founding of hell or pastors emergency league is sort of is a ... a turning point I'm In Yemen there's opposition\nBecause from this point on he is a leader of passage emergency league which eventually will develop into the confessing church [noise] and I'm an art into opponent of any attempt by the German Christians to influence the direction of the church\nYou mentioned a Dietrich on offer he he would die in a concentration camp [noise]\nUh D. drew bond offer dies in April Nineteen forty five he's um killed by the Nazis or two weeks before his concentration camp was liberated and this of course was to try to eliminate um any potential future leaders of a non Nazi Germany\nUh so did your barn harbor was born in Nineteen oh six cent he's murdered by the Nazis in Nineteen forty five or just weeks before he would've been liberated she was um\nDifferent mindset than me more although they joined together and the founding of hell and they're both major uh players in confessing church teaching wrong on offer was liberal cosmopolitan anti Nazi on every\nPossible position the Nazis took\nHe oppose Nazi foreign policy not to eat domestic policy Nazi racial policy you came from a liberal family um is a sister was married to a a Christian and Jewish descent and his best friend from around was also I'm a Christian or Jewish descent\nAnd so he had a very different outlook than ... named Moulder remained nationalistic conservative and even a supporter of analyses on many levels here's a good example\nIn September of Nineteen thirty three they found the pastor's emergency league in October Nineteen thirty dream ... joined together with a lot of fellow pastors\nTo said Hitler a telegram praising his withdrawal from the league of nations and from the disarmament talks clearly you know any more by this action and the actually in many other members of pal who joined in and sending this telegram are indicating their support for not see it as often um\nAnd they actually believe that Hitler truly understood what was going on a church and he understood the difference between the German Christians and the conservative Protestant establishment\nThat he might even um side with the conservative Protestants they think that he is simply not understanding the situation and it's one of the reasons why they can continue to support him because they see him as just being misled\nBy the leaders of the German Christians a man by the name of a bishop with the Mueller was the leader of the German Christians and he had frequent contact with Hitler\nAnd um [noise] for this reason uh you know the men who would eventually reform confessing church can still remain and feel feel comfortable calling themselves either Nazis or at least supporters of the government\nWhere you are leading me very nicely into my next question Matthew how can I ask because in your book then they came for me Martin Nemo over the past\nThe fight the Nazis your account of when Nemo older and some of these other pastors finally get to meet\nWith Adolf Hitler as Adolf Hitler as is learning about their their resistance to what the Nazis were trying to do your account in the book of that meeting is just just a hair raising [laughter]\nNow you are so Hitler was just both confused and a irate at\nThe church problem the church problem was is actually that there was a struggle going on within the church between the surprising establishment and German Christians and Hitler to certain extent couldn't fully understand what was going on [noise] um and he also felt that it was just a bad sign in Nazi Germany\nTo have Protestants are fighting it out um international news coverage was covering the church struggle when Germany and it just seemed like bad press the Hitler so he called for a meeting\nWhere some of the leaders of the conservative establishment would join the leader of the um the German Christians live the Mueller along with some Nazi leaders and they would have a meeting to discuss the issues\nAre the concern across an establishment was ecstatic about this as was name or I mean they just couldn't believe they're forging how fortunate they were they were going to get to meet with Hitler and explain what was really going on [noise]\n[noise] so for weeks in advance and the meaning they prepared and prepare and the meeting was scheduled for January twenty fifth Nineteen thirty four they were supposed to meet Hitler and his um entourage at the right ... [noise] and they show up there\nAt one o'clock in the afternoon I'm thinking of this is going to be a big turning point for them\nAnd Hitler Greece and along with his um\nSome other government ministers including Herman ... who was there\n[noise] and they walk in and they shake hands and they're standing around and sort of a semi circle looking at one another and Hitler glances over at a Herman grain gr in polls piece of paper out of his brief case and he read the transcript of a full in Congress\nStation that needle or I've had that morning\nWith a fellow pastor the fellow password called to ask Awni Mohler how prepared they weren't the meeting anymore we're saying we're all prepare um we know that Hynden bird president pulled on him or who is still alive is going to meet with Hitler at noon and then we're all going to meet with Hitler at one\nAnd he sort of ends his conversation with this past year by saying and at the meeting with Hindu bird uh the president is going to read the last rights to Hitler\nAnd as green as reading the transcript of the conversation every body in the room is silent and kind of paralyzed by it you know I mean\nI mean it was sort of the worst thing possible first of all you know that ... had been tapped in that they had ...\nYou know had the transcript from that morning's conversation and an evil or had said something so sort of foolish was meant as a joke that that since ... was kind of supportive of the church establishment and not a German Christians the reading of Hitler in the last rights men I think that he\nWas basically in a towel Hitler how he should\nAct in the church struggle by supporting the conservative establishment so when when during his finished reading the the transcript everyone silent um Hitler asking him to step forward and he does anymore um he's asked students\nIn fact take place anymore says yes in fact the conversation took place as you heard but let me just explain to you that are you know the pastor's emergency league and the\nThe conservatives in the church are not anti state and we certainly are not anti Nazi we simply want to return the Protestant Church too it's free to the reformation confessions\nAnd the German Christians are I'm trying to bring foreign influences into the church and that's where our opposition as their opposition is to these foreign influences into the church not to the state and not to you\nAnd is not long after this that he gets arrested a ... ends up in a concentration camp and and this is this is a conversation I feel like we can actually go\nFor two hours unfortunately we don't really have fifty minutes so I'm going to win a speed us up a little bit here\nObviously being held in a concentration camp where so many people are being murdered he survived as a transformative experience for better or for worse um what happens to him during this period of time that he's being held for what I what what is it eight years\nSo from Nineteen thirty three I'll tell you the late Nineteen thirties rape until Nineteen thirty seven nickel or is really a thorn in the side of the Nazis he's constantly I'm doing battle with the German Christians over\nA theology and the politics of the church\nAnd what they were correct direction of the church is he's giving sermons that are considered or inflammatory and\nUm she is more and more becoming sort of an ancient of church resistance a by night team in Nineteen thirty six she and some fellow pastors in the confessing church or send Hitler a\nA confidential memorandum\nWhere they are say some pretty strong language um they demand that the Nazis and the German Christian stop trying to de confessional eyes are being Christianized Germany and they even have some language in the statement where they um call into question", "show_name": "Democracy Now!", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "16"}
