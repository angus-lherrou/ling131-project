bachelor party\nBut our guest today Jason Stanley ... professor of philosophy at Yale University argue that fascism is a tactic\nAnd that fascism exist even in a non fascist state points to the history of American racism has their own version of fascism\nJason Stanley is the author of the book how fascism works the politics of us in them and he now joins us via Skype Jason Stanley this is my very good pleasure will come into this program\nIt's a pleasure to be on the program thank you much\nIt's good to have you [noise] we've talked about fascism a lot on this radio program and I think just people in general actually talk a lot about fascism but it's always difficult to succinctly describe what fascism is now you've written a book about how fascism works but\nThrough this process were you able to come up with with some type of a working definition to describe fascism\nWell how fascism works is a working definition dark ten chapters and and I describe ten properties of ... politics and in in my way of doing things it's a scale so you can be more or less fascists depending upon\nHow many of these different can elements your ideology involves so for example all fascist movements involved a glorious mythic past where the nation where the chosen people of the nation ruled Supreme ah\nIn bashes politics weaponize is notions like purity\nAnd discuss so that foreigners are you are are treated in this politics as a kind of a impurities that's entering in and threatening the traditions of the nation\nYou know that fascist politics has taken hold when the dominant group feels like it's being victimized by minority gangs or so for example the Heritage Foundation recently sent out a letter saying well\nIt unless we we all get to the barricades the United states will not have any Christian judges anymore you know so when you find the majority group in terror about it\nIt's enormous power in the country is going to be displaced\nLet me ask you to dive into that actually because I think that's an interesting point isn't always the dominant group well and I guess what we mean by ... yeah when ... ... what do we mean by dominant group\nSo ... what it means the group that dominate culturally for instance so fascism is based on an us versus them politics that works the a national or ethnic or religious identity\nSo so the dominant group would be the group that generally has\nHeld cultural sway had how political power in the United states are\nLikely all of our presidents I've been up the Christian faith or ... or all of them have been men\nAnd that is a fundamental threat and it's also a fundamental threat to the ... leader because a group of people mobilizing together for their own interest is a potential power source that Kevin vey against ah the dictates of a party\nIn power or leader and so labor unions you know it's not for nothing about the palm on the in the Holocaust museum by Martin Nemo her\nSize first they came for the socialists but and then they came from the trade union\nMulticulturalism is is a threat to the fashion is\nAbsolutely because fascism is based on an ultra nationalism\nBased primarily on ethnic identity so multiculturalism multiethnic democracy is anathema\nAnd trade unions trade unions make us feel economically more secure economic and security is of aid to bash his government because when we feel in hunter rents words itemize\nThen we feel fearful and we need some other identity we need we need we need help from someone\nAnd then we look to demagogues\nWhat what did on a rent mean by Adam eyes\nShe meant that fascism thrives\nWhen individuals feel alone when they feel unsupported and fearful and they feel that there's nothing there that they can trust their fellow citizens they can't trust institutions and they're fearful about their economic wellbeing\nShe means they're individually Adam eyes and then they look for an artificial identity a fake identity like an ethnic identity like race race as a construction so the fascist leader offers people a fake identity\nThat does not address their material needs or their material and try and ultimately the fascist leader offers themselves at all\nLoyalty to the two that leader after all committed out but\nI Am covered some of these far right groups and one term I constantly here especially it really is another term for multiculturalism and now that would be cultural Marxism ... what does that mean\nCultural Marxism has a long history or in one sense it means Jewish [laughter] so uh so uh it does it mean Jewish\nSo it's really important for people to read the protocols of The Elders of Zion to understand what's happening around bum a so when when\nUh the protocols of The Elders of Zion says that Jews are behind Marxism liberalism capitalism\nAnd you know ... minutes I'm as well you find that trope as well ah homosexuality that Jews are behind these movements that seek equality for religious ... neck and sexual minorities\nAnd cultural Marxism is used as a smear for movements that seek equality for minority groups\nSo you find people using cultural Marxism to talk about\nA movements for a gender equality movements for a gay grade gay rights movements for a four to recognize traditionally across groups like African Americans you find them Tartus cultural marks us and the idea is\nThat it's kind of a conspiracy theory the idea is what they're really seeking is to take power\n... where did these protocols are The Elders of Zion come from\nOf The Elders of Zion originated in a\nScience pick a work of fiction in the mid Eighteen fifty is I Believe I talk about this in my to tell the history in my book how fascism works ah and then they were taken off in Nineteen oh five by St Petersburg newspaper or as a forgery\nSo initially there was a discussion that in in the ... and I think is Marie ... and his book it was a discussion between\nA a between a\nUn un I forgot exactly the two characters bought a an evil person and a good person and the evil person is talking about using liberalism as a way to to gain power\nAnd so in the protocols of the ... ... this speech is put in the mouth of the so called ah elders of Zion that is sort of prominent sort of a shadowy conspiracy of global Jews and the idea is they're\n... they're going to spread liberalism they're going to use the media they're going to use education to spread liberalism to spread freedom and once you spread liberalism\nOur Marxism to the dominant group and they will willingly give up their power to you\nWe're in conversation with Jay substantially he is the Jacob ... professor of philosophy at Yale University author of the book how fascism works the politics of us and them\nJason stand that I found that that explanation of the protocols of The Elders of Zion interesting so so thank you for for doing that I I don't want to lose sight of the American civil war because you do write extensively about the American civil war or in this book and in particular\nAbout W. E. B. to boys and and his work called black reconstruction can can you tell me about that\nMay be no more important book to read right now than black reconstruction in the American contact\nBlack reconstruction was published in Nineteen thirty five at a time at which it was widely believed that the reconstruction era the era at which a\nBlack Americans in the south where freely allowed to vote and indeed voted on math and occupied many offices from Senator from the Senate\nTo the house to state legislatures\nRecounts the reconstruction era was brought to an end because\nAll of a myth\nOf black corruption so this was widely\nTaught in universities and schools and even I I'm forty eight years old and even I I learned that reconstruction came to an end\nBecause black Americans ran corrupt governments in the south ... voice destroys the Smith and he shows that in fact\nReconstruction ended because white\nPoor white laborers in the south and poor black laborers were starting to band together in a labor movement and this unified the interests of wealthy whites in the south\nAnd uh and ... wealthy northern adopt white industrial sewer threatened by this labor movement and in this book and black reconstruction\nWhich eventually by the late Nineteen sixty in the late Nineteen sixties was finally recognized to be the true account of the end of reconstruction of what happened during reconstruction in this book\nDo Boyce simply gives us so many of the tools we need to understand fashion\nHe begins the book by saying you know in the beginning God created this world that it was wonderful when everyone got along and then he threw a black man in the midst and fascism broke out so it explicitly uses the term fascism for American racism\nOr so he talks in the book about the psychological wages of white miss about which which is the crucial thing to explain why poor whites will vote against their own material interests\nIn accord with rich whites against people are like against poor black Americans with whom they share material interests so it's a big mystery why will poor whites vote to like slash their own health\nCoverage why will poor whites boat to slash their own a food stamps and government benefits uh when it hurts them it hurts themselves they're hurting themselves and\nTwo boys explain this this by this concept of a psychological wages of white and is\nJust being white gives you a kind of priceless dignity and that's what the policy\nJust politician dogs the fascist politician prompt makes this empty promise they say uh you have a special dignity that non whites simply cannot have and not dignity comes from being just from being white and equality threatens that dignity\nSo equality will make you lose the psychological wages of lightness so not only does do Boyce there give us a lot of the tools we need to understand why people throw their own\nInterest under the boss their own material interests onto the boss you give us a lot of the tools to understand fascism\nHe also he also explains the role of the labor movement the tension\nBetween fascism and labor movements why labor movements are such a threat\nAnd it gives us a lot of concepts we need to understand our own American ... contacts for instance our chapters in this book like a poor white\nAnd you know we have our newspapers talking about poor poor whites and working class whites all the time as if there is no history to these concepts and voice gives you a crucial history to these concepts\nThat is impure that are raped threats that are criminals that are law less against which the people\nUs need to be protected so it always lay the groundwork for math violence against that group and given our own history a mass incarceration and president of mass incarceration and harsh rhetoric against black Americans were especially\nProne to that and now we're seeing not directed against immigrants against the media\nAgainst liberals against cultural Marxist\nFeminist so so it has these human ... element and the and the second thing is they argue in my book is it\nThere's a temptation for politicians to make the rhetoric into reality so the president when he ran claimed that there was a epidemic of violence sweeping through the quote inner cities unquote now this was wildly\nIn contrast to reality I mean there's been a slight uptick in violence but we're still at historically low crime rate so\nWhat happens but it's going to be conducive to such politics to create crime because the more crime there is the more panic you can run on\nThe next election and so you know it's going to be like this is what you know Hitler talked about about this when he said people doubt that Jews are lazy and disease or we're going to send millions of Jews across borders disease hungry in need of support and then they'll see what we mean\nSo there's a tendency to make the rhetoric true and that's a danger over and above the dehumanization\nJason Stanley is our guest he is the Jacob ... professor of philosophy at Yale University he's the author of the book how fascism works the politics of us and them Jason Stanley that\nThat's really interesting to think about because I guess\nWhen we think of fascism we think of Nazi Germany we we think of World War two I'll also obviously think of of Italy during this period of time we think of the Holocaust um in major major huge global events [noise]\nUm and maybe we we have this expectation for didn't think about fascism for fascism to exist you have to have that kind of major global event but but but that's not so\nNo that's not I mean well my focus on ... politics and to have fascists politics be successful\nWhat you need to do is destroy your democratic eat those you need to destroy a the eat those that makes people want to live in a multi ethnic state I'm unique to destroy the east coast that makes people want to feel loyalty towards a multi party democracy\nRent talks about the the dangers of the sentiment the\nParty over parties when people start thinking well I don't care about a multi party democracy I just want my party to rule out the labor have all the leaders of power so when people start to lose the Democratic eat those when they start to lose their grip on reality and replace it with power and loyalty\nThen you need to worry because the literal liberal democratic eat those takes a long time to create it took us in the United states a long time to create and eat those or we had a public culture\nOf anti racist and that seems to be very quickly that seems to have been very quickly dismantle a public culture of\nAnti racism we ... we had a we had a public culture where open racism was disqualified tally Mandelbrot discusses this ah and her up and uh the ... the Princeton political scientist and\nThat seems to have been very rapidly dismantled where you could invent openly or engage in quite startling racial integration and not be politically punished so there's a that shows a failure of an ethics\nSpeak will respect which is crucial to democratic culture and we very clearly have a failure of respect for troops which is as\nA scholar of authoritarianism of uh anti fascist social philosophers have always warned us when you see a sick Web of allies and contempt for reality as such as around what's that that's a sure sign\nA of a fascist culture taking hold\nWill you write about the the perceived the war on corruption or even draining the swamp this this also has and you know corruption obviously and then stopping corruption is an important thing\nBut but you write fashion is used for Russian in a war on corruption anti corruption campaigns for their own ends\nWhen fascist politics ... takes hold things mean they're opposite the news becomes the fake news the news become the ... class at a and an anti\nCorruption means corruption\nCorruption doesn't mean why it ordinarily do what I discovered and I was very surprised by that is that\nAll fascist campaigns are anti corruption campaign the Ku Klux Klan achieved power in the Nineteen twenties by running against corruption look at ...\nA lot of me up shooting constantly runs anti corruption campaign by some accounts he's the richest man in the world enriching himself off of state treasures I\nThe the uh I discovered it in the literature on national socialism that the national socialists ran an anti corruption campaign but yes stole looted Jewish property art and a lot\nSo I Do boys as I talk about the book I mean we've already discovered that in black reconstruction reconstruction was supposed to have ended because of corruption and divorced said what does corruption there I mean what corruption there Matt means is that it was corrupt that black Americans were allowed to vote at all\nSo corruption for the fascist means ... that the\nCorruption of the traditional order as I said earlier in the interview\nFascism weaponize is the most the the the feeling of purity so corruption means infuriated so ... so when the fastest runs an ad in fashion politics politician runs an anti corruption campaign they're running\nThe what they're saying is that\nThe traditional order a bit of subverted or people who are not members of the chosen nation have too much power are loud and positions of power is Kate man argues in her\nBook down girl we saw this dialectic unfold in the twenty sixteen election when Donald Trump of all people was able to run an anti corruption campaign against Hillary Clinton\nAnd as Kate man rightly size or what happened was a he was representing women ruling as president as a corruption of the traditional order\nJason Stanley's we moved to wrap up here um [noise] people will say that we use the term fascism too often and in in a way to even smear say right wing politics\nI'm In the New York times you've got an overall favor favorable a review by Peter Beinart and then in the New York times\nBut he did say this and he said that the approach that you had had its costs and he says is quote\nThat you are Jason Stanley or emphasize the similarities between myriad fascist parties and regimes without adequately acknowledging their differences nor do you adequately distinguish between conservative or right wing politics\nAnd fascism how how do you respond to that well\nOf all my book isn't about fascists regimes at all so as I said earlier in the interview\nOr there isn't uniformity between fascist regimes I'm focusing on fast toxic and there was clear uniformity in fashion stocked you see muscle leaning Hitler the Ku Klux Klan or\nOr ... or ... you you see them at our Mr Trump employing the very same tactics and so there is uniformity on tactics and my book just isn't about fascist regime so that was just a non sack with her uh\nIt's part uh about the point about conservatives well I think he missed the ... that in my book is a ten parts definition a fascist politics than fascist ideology so\nA fascism is the end point of\nOf right wing politics it's the most extreme version of right wing politics are there are many so there's going to be many overlaps then it says I set a sliding scale so of course a\nFascism has elements that we're familiar with the point of my book is to tell people fascism has elements you're familiar with that [laughter] and\nThose ... and many more of those elements are present in us politics then you realize a because fascism is the endpoint of right wing politics or that it's not to deny that there are a that that are are\nPerfectly non fascist\nA conservative right wing position fewer libertarianism that does not pure libertarianism shares with fascism social Darwinism and that's a very worrisome about libertarianism but the ... but the consistent libertarian will reject racism or jak group\nA group identification ah so that's not fascism a social conservatives will accept the patriarchy elements they'll except the uh the some of the authoritarian elements religious conservatives\n\n\n\n\n\nMm\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nW.

going to have read it to be rather and then also she went on\nTo tell Dr believes before but she did not know what she was talking about and there's this Republican line that goes well we believed not lose if word\nBut we don't think she really knows what happened to her and he says is not the definition of trying to knock someone I don't know what is it was deeply deeply painful really I'm\nReally I mean I I Want to turn to um\nUh the I Wonder at church to the fact that neither blouse a Ford for Kavanaugh was interviewed by the FBI a very different situation\nThan ah being questioned at the Senate Judiciary committee this is what Dr lousy Ford had called for an FBI investigation the criticism at the beginning once it was going forward is don't just interview the two of them go beyond that but I think very few people thought maybe Mitch McConnell did\nThat the two of them weren't going to be interviewed and it's particularly significant when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh because he would be under oath\nIt wouldn't be a the Democrats asking questions and he could attack them for being Democrat and then the Republicans simply supporting him he would having to directly answer FBI questions can you explain how it was possible\nThat the FBI investigation didn't include interviews with these two primary people\nJune was controlled by the White House in conjunction with the Republican side of the Senate Judiciary committee and they decided to gather what would happen in the investigation and literally there were people that were\nThat were done the FBI was not allowed\nTo interview and among those were cabinet and Dr Palese part ... do you have a situation where Kavanaugh\nWho Lied under oath numerous times outside the scope of this issue of the sexual assault on many other issues was not being put under oath by the FBI\nAnd if you watch the hearing when he was questioned repeatedly I\nI think it was by Dick Durban and several others would you\nCall for an FBI investigation he remain silent so he clearly did not want to be put under oath and he did not want other people to be interviewed and let's face it she spent the better part of the two weeks before the FBI under investigation in the White House with Don McGahn so\nThere's no way there was going to be\nA fair and through FBI investigation because he was part of the group calling the shots I think the key thing here to realize is if you wanted justice and if you wanted to really\nUnderstand if Dr Palese for ... and credibility and her claims were credible than you would want to do a thorough investigation and you would want to remove any question but the reality would have to grapple with as they did not here and they did not want to understand and that\nIs what's so\nWell barely clearly they deeply cared about putting him on the Supreme Court\nI wanted to bring in a democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren who spoke on Thursday making a new claim about content says the FBI documents on Kavanaugh that we're viewed by senators and the Senate basement one after another not being able to bring in a pan not being able to take any out any notes this is what she said\nSenators have\nMazel so I Will now said three things that committee staff has explained are permissible to say without violating committee rules statements that I have also independently verified as accurate one\nThis one's not full and fair investigation it was sharply limited scope and did not at war the relevant confirming facts to be available document do not exonerate Mr Kavanaugh\nAnd three be available documents contradict statements Mr ... made under oath\nThat Senator Warren and this is extremely significant Jody ah because people don't know what we're in those documents that these senators reviewed and she's saying they were not exonerate ing\nRight because I think it was very critical for her to see it clearly and loudly because what you've got is being on the other side of the on out saying well these documents show that you know there was no evidence for ... for\nBut the women are telling the truth and if women are telling the truth and it's not just an indictment of a few bad apples but an indictment of the entire system an indictment of the treatment of survivors and the women by a man with power particularly on the on the right and so this idea that\nPeople are lying which is absurd on the face of it because no one has anything to gay and ultimately by coming forward with the stories I mean look at the outcome of this Dr Ford is hiding because of violent threats and Brett Kavanaugh is about to become a Supreme Court justice so\nYou know I mean never again should anybody here that this is ruining a man's life that boys are in danger and in this case obviously it's young white boys um because that's really the only way you could interpret what the president said\nUm you write in your book Shariah jak rages hard for women to express and I was wondering if you can talk about that and also Senator McConnell characterization of the mob ...\nWell you know I think that um it's useful for McConnell to\nTo talk about a mob these are citizens they're articulating their needs and there are defending their rights they happened mainly to be women which means that they're associated with unhinged emotion 'em and you can see that in multiple forms have commentary coming from his party but\nI think that we all understand certainly as women that anger and the expression of anger comes with the penalties for women were socialized to put others first to restrain our expressions of negative emotions because it causes discomfort\nAnd even his little girls are rewarded for being nice and pleasing a not for being assertive or aggressive neither of which implies that were angry by the way it's just that the assertiveness and aggression and anger are are not separated and the behavior\nAnd and responses to girls and women are so I think that what we're seeing now in this explosion of women's feeling\nIs is clearly a pent up need to be listened to and believed that the demand that this stopped at the gas lighting stop that the doubting stop and that the disregard for our rights as citizens or come to an end\n\nYou wrote about Kavanaugh's range marshes bossy storage and testimony\nYes well she she was so composed\nAnd um to me or and actually her she was deferential right she she went out of her way to try and put others it is which I think is a fairly common for women um in her situation certainly knowing that\nAnd she she not only once a a witness but an expert witness so she was testifying but she also a has studied this her entire life she knows what these dynamics look like\nI Would say that the saddest part actually of her whole testimony to me was when she used the word ... because it showed that she really I'm considered that these\nThese people that she was appealing to and on the right of course it was all men are three of whom had been participants in the Anita Hill\nA judge a Clarence Thomas hearings\nThat that they considered her appear that they would treat her with mutual respect that they would act now acknowledge her professional expertise and that is simply not true she could not make that assumption\nAnd that kind of as a rude shock two girls and women all the time that we believe that we are functioning as equals a with equal dignity and with the knowledge that we have accrued some expertise and then\nWe're sort of slapped in the face with the information that our male pairs do not feel that that way at all\nOn the other hand came in roaring and indignant and patch of land and um his emotion\nThe ... overwhelmed everything else in the room and he could do that because in our culture there is in the central core of rationality that is associated with being a man it it actually didn't degrade the idea that he could think clearly whereas if you're a woman\nOr you don't have that some ... people don't presume that about you you are all emotion Holiday Inn if by chance you'd think clearly um that's sort of a layered on top of this this um feelings\nOrientation that we're supposed to naturally have as women which is of course nonsense that men are no more rational logical than women are and women are no more unhinged and emotional and men that was very clear from from the confirmation hearings\nShow on a lot of the discussion has been about the mid term elections innocence galvanized the right um many Republicans are saying\nInterestingly shortly after Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court Republican Congressman Steve king tweeted a photo of a sleeping in synch and said quote soon babies like this little angel will be protected in the womb by law\nOf course referring to the overturning of row the weight I'm as we wrap up you since you've just come from this book tour around the country how\nPeople are continuing to organize or do you think that stops women in their tracks\nOh gosh no I mean very clearly I think that may be one of the most formidable um confrontations of of what we have been living with is about to come I think that\nThis is this is not stopping anything in its tracks\nIf if if we're looking at a twelve hour\nA clock we're probably at second three or four I Would say I mean the the truth is that a lot of people would like me too and any suggestions that me too it's failed or come to an end to go away and it's really not an end it's a beginning this is not a\nA movement that is I'm\nAbout to come to a
