politics I'm it's just rich it is interesting to observe the Republican and democratic parties have basically switched sides on most issues not all but most and now that switches largely attributed to race and how it can be argued that remnants of southern democratic tactics used during the Jim Crow era to maintain southern white power\nCan be found being used by the Republican Party today\nToday

Skype John ... and this is my very pleasurable coming to the program thank you for having us are can you won't talk to me about\nThe development of southern and northern politics and and where where they differ John ...\nThe first difference in the principal difference that lasted through a very long and it has a residence today of course is that the south was where slavery could take route and be economically viable force it\nAnd very productive and therefore something of\nOf value to southern whites who wanted to build the society around\nUh the the slave culture whereas in the north Bob ... every state had slavery and no state no city no town is immune from a racial resigned as it did not have as\nPossible for African Americans to participate in politics to vote\nA until the Nineteen sixties uh it was a way they recreated up politics where they the southern weights\nOr could keep control of the political system in the face of a large number now of African Americans who in principle were eligible to vote thanks to the civil war amendments letters in\nPolitics and we are in conversation with John H Aldrich and John de Griffin John ... says the fights are Pratt\nUniversity professor of political science at Duke University John Griffin associate professor of political science at the University of Colorado Boulder together and they have written the book why parties better political competition and democracy in the American south so so this is the story\nJohn Audrey said that's very important in understanding reconstruction in the aftermath of reconstruction\nYes yes this is one of the key moments 'em and looking ahead when we when our conversation it has certainly residences with a contemporary politics but let's go back to that this this was a a very important formative period\nThe system had the civil war head so fundamentally changed what was possible in the south that there was a reaction to as I had said ... said earlier it through to try to\nReplicate as close as possible under under a new constitution that got abolished slavery to try to retain that system so what is now a minority of the white is they were saying before the civil war the plant or class has ever known afterwards the\nBourbon and the white turbans as to say that's what they drank rather than beer that a day where they have control over the political system and be able to keep charge of politics it was completely shattered in and be able to be reached formulated a variety of ways and this is the way that ended up winning out\nI'm a big concepts are because of the end of reconstruction in the ... inability of the north\nTo continue to impose on the south\nAnd he says as they refer to themselves they're redemption of southern white democratic politics\nThe senators reticence to contemporary politics\nReticence yes there is a in a couple of ways I think\nOne of them is that the period of the creation of the Jim Crow south was the period of of our desk through a revolution a major transformation and it was recon sugar in society not unlike the information and a social\nThat the Facebook revolution and all that kind of stuff that's happening now is reformulated our economy it's also making possible a different kind of politics and it also it was associated with very big\nFor American history periods times of great inequality in wealth\nThat one's kind of similarity a second kind of similarity is that the\nWay the ... south the southern Democrats were able to exclude a African Americans from exercising their their new freedom under the civil rights amendment ... or was that the use of various kinds of\nElectoral laws that were\nArguing to be designed to make sure that voting was proper and that done legally without without you know manipulate it on the part of the voters and that has a residents to weigh on the left today are called book suppression acts\nThe voter ID laws that reduction in a in a mountain of a early voting and those sort of things that are alleged to be reducing the\nAbility of the the poor and the minority populations to be able to participate in politics quite like literacy casts and poll taxes and those sorts of things that are the same thing in the Eighteen nineties\nAnd looking at voter ID laws and and other voting last today and looking at redistricting which some people refer to as gerrymandering and these types of things it's hard\nTo look at the Republican Party in the south today basically replicating what southern white politicians have have done since the civil war but but before obviously under the Democratic party before the switch occurred I live in\nCarolina we did not have a Republican Party of\nIn the state control of the state until two thousand and and I think it was the first time they hadn't unified control of the state legislature and so forth and so we had this transformation or by the Republican Party eventually for the for the first time since ... and the reconstruction the power and they didn't win it\nAll politicians do when they come to power and say look for ways\nThat they can presumably legally because otherwise the chart challenged in court and\nA look for ways in which they can maintain man came to hold on power\nAre phase divided almost evenly between people who are likely to both Democrats and people who are likely to vote for Republicans\nUm it's a nice balance state or by because this is the first time they did in power bases on all these opportunities and indeed they were taken to court quite regularly are still are being taken to court quite regularly on these measures so one of the many times that the\nGerrymandering cases from North Carolina made it to federal court\nA was a racial gerrymandering of the uh from the two thousand and ten cents is\nAnd the judge described it as they in the gerrymander they need to be a non\nAfrican American populations like a laser and we're\nOpen at overt about it there is a current case it still I'm not completely resolved um that's partisan gerrymandering and it's just supposedly Republicans taking advantage of the Democrats so for example we have Thirteen members of Congress\nTen of them are Republicans three of them are Democrats even though her books are essentially ... the person who designed a system they introduced it to the legislature\nUh was asked why would he picks\nTen Republican congressional districts in only three for the Democrats and he said and this was also on the formal record ended up this is a paraphrase of course as close as I can come to it he said\nI didn't do tend to three distribution because I couldn't find good way to do a loving it too [laughter] so it's just it's it's it's open and above board in an overt that there are they are saying we're going to use the rules to try to shape of a system that will help us when we election\nWe should expect that the general problem lies in the constitution where it says the state governments are responsible for elections and laws governing elections in less than National Congress chooses to enter into it that is it said\nRead one of the people who we elect\nTo decide how they should be elected if there was ever a time that an instance of saying toys here's a where their self interest will come in conflict with that potentially the voters this is the case is not unique to the Republican Party is not unique to the south is\nAccentuated within the south because if it's unique historical pear dressing sick that X exaggerate said but it wasn't until\nUntil all your very recently that your state of California had one of the best example of some democratic\nGerrymandering politicians if they were allowed to write laws about how they how they got themselves reelected are going to figure out ways to do with most effectively that gets them able to be reelected and not somebody else\nDexter where everywhere in the south had a very special resonance because of the of the long history of race slavery Jim Crow and so on John Griffin do you want to add anything to that\nYou know I I guess more broadly speaking it seems like it can't you know just be a coincidence that every passage of a voter identification requirements that has happened at the state\nA whole has occurred in a state that are controlled by the legislature is controlled by the Republican Party again I Would say not because\nThe individuals that make up that party or less virtuous but rather because at least there's a perception I Would argue in the party that that that option of those identification requirements will\nAh on balance and exclude or discourage\nPeople who are likely to vote democratic from participating in the election\nOne of the reasons the Republican Party accuses the strategies that however you make\nVoting more difficult for complicated you buddy to reduce the participation of those who have the least resources to be able to deal with those difficulties and complications the Democratic party up until relatively recently has drawn disproportionately out of\nPoor wife as well as a poor whites as well as out of a minority populations um that the Republicans now have the\nAnd where you know in Nineteen sixty eight let's say after the Tet Offensive in the midst of a horrific war in Vietnam\nThe Paris Peace negotiations began which ultimately led to a you know an end to the war but today we have Donald Trump breaking the treaty\nThat band intermediate range nuclear missiles in case people aren't aware of of what this means\nThose intermediate range missiles at that time meant that the USSR and the United states could have a nuclear exchange in which all of Europe western in Eastern Europe would be destroyed without either the United states or the Soviet Union being hit\nAnd the European disarmament movement and the American disarmament movement that woke in that period right around Nineteen Seventy nine to eighty\nReally had a profound effect because it assured Gorbachev\nAnd the Russian leadership that Germany would not invade again and that therefore the Eastern European buffer states we're no longer needed they were becoming increasingly costly for the Soviet Union particularly after the Nineteen sixty eight invasion of Czechoslovakia\nWhich you know the movement of sixty eight in Czechoslovakia had been an important part of that global wave of uprisings that occurred\nSo Gorbachev then relaxed his grip on Eastern Europe and publicly declared so prior to that disarmament wave that swept away Soviet regimes in the east so it's interesting\nAnd and the importance of of a social movement and again as you pointed out now we're we're pulling out of that agreement\nWell you're being very polite match because actually were breaking the treaty it takes to to to let's say ... ... ...\nWhen I make a deal yeah and then we hold it for twenty five thirty five years\nAnd then I say oh I'm going to break the deal you have to wait a minute shouldn't we talk about this\nButton said Trump is simply declared he's going through now some people say it's it's a bargaining chip of some kind but I think the bottom line here as we're moving away from nuclear disarmament and back towards a whole different range of missiles being introduced into the world\n[noise] George kept you if you can tell me more about your reflection tier of fifty years later of Nineteen sixty eight ... what stands out for you\nWell you know the title of the of the symposium tomorrow's as so many levels true I mean I\nI'm remembering I'm Still trying to figure out who I went to ... talk with and I you know I remember I went with my title ... Rick synergy buff and Bucky have recording howdy Morgan\nThe latter three are dead and Mike and I sat down to a you know celebrate their lives and we settled but we were there with three more people on who words I\nHave one of these people who've ... everybody's phone number is an email and everybody we both thought ... wish I was nope wasn't me and we still don't know so I think\nYou know I I finally figured out who I went to the Panthers revolutionary people's constitutional convention with in Philly not September Nineteen Seventy that was David ... today has blue French fear\nA oceans work has fighting point in ... in Richmond from being made into a casino [noise]\nBut collectively this phenomenon that Russell Jacoby name social amnesia\nWay suffered greatly from it so much as I admire the athletes Tommie Smith Juan Carlos to raise their fist in Nineteen sixty eight Mexico ah during the Olympics when they had won medals\nTo ... to\n... yeah and I was struck by the clothing of Martin Luther king and the tremendous character these individuals have maintained over these fifty years\nBut nowhere in the mention of this anniversary where the four hundred students who were killed in Mexico city protesting the Olympics because of the cutbacks in their education system and this was in ... plaza\nOut thousands of people had assembled peacefully the police without warning open fire snipers shot the speaker on the podium in the head killing them and then all night police killed people went into hospital rooms and killed wounded people\nUh it was at a tragedy that Mexico still has yet to fully deal with because then minister of interior Luis active area who went on to become the president stifling any subsequent investigation on there's never been in full disclosure about what happened then what we will never know\nHow many were killed and what became of their bodies we we may forget that the global reach of what was happening in Nineteen sixty eight yes in fact and this new edition of my book I added I went from Seventeen to fifty five countries\nAnd I added the number of students killed between Nineteen sixty seven and Seventy three protesting students by the forces of order and it was over two thousand two hundred students were killed in the world\nWe have for at Kent State too at Jackson State in Maine Nineteen Seventy there were three it Orangeburg and sixty eight\nAnd there are many other students around the world thousands a couple of thousand who were killed and we we simply somehow have\nThey have vanished in the in the wind is if there is an amnesia that's the piece of the um the Asia and not just the students but I'm In the thousands of martyrs in Vietnam and uh you know the\nAmerican Soldiers who were killed\nOur immortalized at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington DC and various you know important but what about the other martyrs I mean we know Martin Luther king and Robert Kennedy\nOr killed in Nineteen sixty eight but what about Allison Kraus and James Earl green two of the people killed at Kent in Jackson State\nOr what about Sandy Scheuer what about some of the other victims of these atrocities that occurred at the time so you know the\nKent State university major to point to build a new gymnasium on the site where students had been killed so that the place itself would be raised\nAnd I I see you know we can talk about Trump doing away with many of the reforms that have happened since sixty eight are trying to do away with them\nBut in fact our collective memory of those events or has a huge gaps and that's\nWhat ... what ... is so so you're talking about the martyrs with who you like to call them martyrs people were killed people who were killed during that period of time\nAnd by the forces of order during political protests are demonstrations or because they had been involved I mean the twenty eighth dead Panthers some of them were killed opening the door of their houses when the doorbell rang\nYou know the the martyrs include to me that political prisoners languished behind bars\nYou know who questionable they were convicted and even if they were convicted Mitch\nHow long are we going to keep them in prison man ... all of the German Red Army fraction people have been released\nIn South Korea even North Korean infiltrators who were caught armed actions against the south Korean state have been released and given the choice to either go north or stay south\nI I just can't think of another country\nThat has been as punitive as vindictive as the United states has do you think it's because the United states ...\nDoesn't see it it's a as a political struggle [noise]\nI think it's because of the ruling class was terrified in this period when Martin Luther king junior was killed there were more riots than ever before in us history in over a hundred and fifty cities rose\nHundreds of millions of dollars in damage were done in Washington DC more damage was done to the city then the British had inflicted when they captured and burned the White House during the war of Eighteen twelve\nAt the time the Pentagon estimated they did not have enough troops to fight the war in Vietnam this was after the Tet Offensive in January thirtieth that year\nAnd to maintain order in the United states so there was a huge a fear that rent went through the ruling circles of this country\nAnd uh I think they will never forget that the institutions that they have built you know the rise of swat teams the building up of police departments with submarines and helicopters\nThe militarization of the country\nOf it has happened since two thousand one have only contributed to this entire mentality or you know every day on the news it seems like we see outrageous actions like eight year old mentally handicapped boy is handcuffed by the police for leaving school\nAnd his mother has to come to his rescue and it takes time or you know any of the atrocities that daily what's the daily average of young people killed in the United states by police is three like three a day every day", "show_name": "Democracy Now!", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "24"}
