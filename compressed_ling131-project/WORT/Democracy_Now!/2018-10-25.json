I suspect that many of us intuitively believe if not\nThrough experience you know that race has played a major factor in how people identify with the two major political parties in this country the Republican Party and the Democratic party\nMy guests today Alan Abramowitz it actually crunched numbers over the decades and come to the conclusion that it's racial resentment particularly by whites that has driven this realignment between Democrats and Republicans and white conservatives towards the Republican Party\nOn number on which joins me to talk about this he's written about it all in a book\nCalled the great alignment race party transformation and the rise of Donald Trump on Abramowitz is the Albany W Barclay professor of political science at Emory University he blogs that Larry ... crystal ball this is a website that is dedicated to looking at polling data\nAnd how in the room which is also considered one of the top experts on election modeling Alabama run which is my very good pleasure glug me this radio program well thanks for inviting me\nI I find it remarkable um the think about\nHow the two major political parties have changed over time we we've done a number of shows on there's even going back to win the Republican Party was first created a in the Eighteen fifties\nUm and I think subjectively we we know that the parties have changed we can even look at particular pieces of legislation for example civil rights act with Democrats\nGovernment and taxation uh and it's also strongly correlated now with partisanship among whites um there's a growing divide between a white Democrats and Republicans in their views on race relations or and particularly on this a racial resentment scale\nYou write that and I found this fascinating and interesting to think about that racial resentment has actually grown over the past what twenty Thirty years\nThat's right uh you know if you just look look at these scores on the scale I'm among white uh respondents in the ... survey you find that there's been a modest increase in in the overall and the level of racial resentment among whites but what's even more interesting is that there's a growing party divide\nUh that uh what we see and and this was especially striking in twenty sixteen\nIs that a racial resentment is way up among ... for Republicans and my white Republicans are and it's actually gone down considerably among white Democrats ... ... if you go back to the Nineteen eighties when these questions were first asked\nThe differences between white Democrats and Republicans on these questions were pretty small um\nBut now I just didn't start and twenty six team but we ... we say it kind of reaching a new level or in twenty sixteen and one of the biggest changes is that white Democrats are much less likely to I'm a school much lower on on racial resentment and I think\nYou know it probably is in part a reflection of having had a an African American president who was a Democrat\nAnd so we're seeing that a white Democrats are now have um a more um but we used to quit cold liberal attitudes on these on these issues white or a Republicans on the other hand have grown increasingly resentful\nA and this was something that clearly work to the advantage of Donald Trump\nI'm so he by the time he entered the two thousand sixteen presidential election\nThere was over already these very high levels of racial resentment a among a ... a white Republican voters and ah and if you look at\nTrump's support in the Republican primaries um it was strongly related to a attitudes on racial resentment um those who scored highest on racial resentment we're we're the most likely to support Trump and the Republican primaries and those who scored lower the least likely to support him\nThere's been a debate since the election of Donald Trump to the presidency over whether these election was more driven by economic issues or or racial issues and and and you you say from the data\nMaybe talk about this date a little bit and it's clearly much more of the racial and economic issues\nThat's right ah there's no question that there's no question I don't\nKnow I mean the racial resentment has a much more powerful influence on attitudes toward Trump\nA among whites than any any economic attitude you can find um it's not economic deprivation are in security ah in fact many of Trump's White supporters although they do tend to be disproportionately ... ... you know non college educated\nI hate to he does best among whites who have not graduated from college and there's a pretty big divide there um but that's not based primarily on a economic insecurity or or or economic discontent\nA because in fact it's unrelated to economic and security and discontent\nUm it's overwhelmingly based on race or something which also is highly correlated with it as I mentioned earlier our opinions toward immigrants\nOn and not just undocumented illegal immigrants but all kinds of immigrants so uh uh you know of course ... attitudes ... race that immigration were issues that he ran on you know he this this is hardly surprising if you go back and look at what he focused on\nYes he did talk about economic issues\nAbout trade a about the loss of manufacturing jobs and things like that but he always kind of tied those issues in with a sense of racial resentment Rosina phobia\nOr so immigrants or you know are taking jobs away from Americans for example a and you know so he he put himself on the map politically and and really I think came first to\nThe attention of a lot of\nA ... Republican voters way back in two thousand eleven and twelve before he ran for president you know when he became the most prominent ah advocate of the birther lie [laughter] you know he started talking about Obama's birth certificate and how\nYou know he was he kept ... was raising the question about whether Obama was in fact a citizen and whether he was a ... a legitimate president well\nYou know that that issue has a is clearly a\nTaps into this sense of racial resentment ah and he just ran with that and uh you know it it it worked it worked for him a it got it got picked up in the media and uh uh and and by the time he did run\nFor president in two thousand sixteen are actually starting in two thousand Fifteen or you know those sorts of attitudes were were key to his support\nAh and of course he started off when he announced his candidacy the first thing he talked about and really really focused on heavily were the threat posed by immigrants from Mexico\nA about how they were criminals and rapists some and their Mexico sending us there ... you know bad people and again you know those sorts of attitudes are closely tied to race\nUm so it it it really is not surprising that racial attitudes were were key to his support now the other thing that that really worked to his advantage was that he was running against a very divided field of Republican candidates the the establishment\nYou know he had no support virtually no support from the Republican establishment almost no prominent Republicans elected officials are party leaders endorsed him\nBut um but they they were very divided um there were you know they couldn't unite behind anymore it looked like it might be Jeb Bush for a while but then his campaign to block\nA and so he didn't need to have majority support\n'em and they never did he never did have the support of a majority of Republicans in during the primary season but he\nHad more than enough against a divided fields you know to to emerge as the front runner and and and and gradually uh you know knock off his ... his opponents they're one by one\nThis is litters and politics and we were in conversation with Ellen I Abramowitz he's the album W Barclay professor of political science at Emory University renowned um expert on the election on election modeling and he's also the author of the book that we were talking about called the great alignment race party transformation\nAnd the rise of Donald Trump\nElena ... there are many things [laughter] his book that I found fascinating then I think sometimes they intuitively I suspected were true but\nBut again providing the data to back it up I found was interesting but one thing I never really thought a lot about was the Republican\nPrimary itself and you found a very close correlation or now no even of correlations the correct term here you can correct me uh but between racial resentment and support for Trump but not just that but but Republican primary voters who had who scored lower and racial resentment\nWould end up voting for I guess people like Jeb Bush\nRight a subject generally um [noise]\nThe Republican voters who are lower on on the sense of racial resentment we're ... we're much less attractive to Trump or or more likely to become negatively and and opinions or Trump at that time\nYou know we're talking about now during the Republican primary you know I was opposed and now where Republicans have have United behind Trump but at that time um there was a lot of division over Trump and and the overall opinions on him or not\nWe're we're we're we're very mixed um and uh so yes they they they voted overwhelmingly for other candidates but they but there was no one candidate who got their support\nYou know ... you know that there was there was Bush um there were Rubio um you know there are a whole bunch um there are about Fifteen other candidates and um\nSo they they were kind of splitting\nThe anti Trump vote 'em the party establishment just could not come out you know you're not behind a A N any any one of those kind of I think it was good Jeb Bush was such a flawed candidate you know early on it looked like he was going to be the establishment choice and and he was ... actually considered the front runner\nFor the Republican nomination at one time but that was before anyone started voting\nA and it became very clear very quickly that Republican primary voters did not want another Bush leading the party they had enough of the bushes\nUm and so he he just fail spectacularly and you know he he raised more money than anyone else um but he just could not you know translated that into support in the primaries doesn't didn't matter how much money he had\nTwelve that's right yeah and plus a couple of special elections so that's right so it's\nThirty five feet started twenty six thirty five seats this year are currently held by Democrats if you ever seen anything like that before where those numbers\nAt it as one sided um you know a at a distribution as I've ever seen and and it's a reflection of the fact that\nFirst of all this particular group of states the the uh happens just you know by chance to be till till more democratic this ... ... if it's called the ... than a class this set of class tilts more democratic than the other two Senate classes do [noise]\nUm and in addition the Democrats have done very well\nIn the last two elections when this class came up to two thousand twelve was a good year for Democrats in the Senate elections and two thousand six was a very good year for Democrats and the ... election so\nUm so what you have right now is this a group of states\nThat are overwhelmingly democratic and and that just means that it's gonna be hard for Democrats to to make any inroads and an eight year I've kind of on the defensive and just because of the numbers two years from now it's a much more Republican group of states Democrats will have\nYou know a lot more pickup opportunities\nSo if they can uh you know there's a pretty good chance of Democrats hold their own this year and you know don't lose too many ... maybe ... stay within you know one or two to don't lose more than one or two um they could win a majority of seats in in the Senate two years from now\nHuh maybe had the house and the the White House\nAs possible you know I mean we don't know of course we don't know what's gonna happen in twenty ... twenty yeah ah but you know it's possible that if you have an unpopular President Trump\nRunning for reelection 'em in twenty twenty and Democrats do well that at um they could not only you know hold the house and maybe even gain more seats in the house but ah but possibly taken a a majority when a majority of seats in the Senate\nAnd Democrats are very aware of this new leadership then they under says oh maybe when you hear for other reasons I guess as well but maybe when you hear somebody like Nancy Pelosi say do not do not talk about impeachment right now they're they're they're they may be they're looking at twenty twenty\nOh sure yeah yeah I'm ... and they're also look you know being realistic uh because the fact of the matter is that um even if the Democrats were saved Democrats can't control the house\nAnd a with a narrow majority of Senate\nThere's no way they get ever get to a two thirds a vote in the Senate to remove\nTrump from officer and I think that's just extremely unlikely um you know there there would have to be some pretty overwhelming evidence of criminal conduct by the president and even then I'm not sure that it would be able to get to a two thirds vote\nAlan Abramowitz is our guest is the author of the book the great alignment race party transformation in the rise of Donald Trump is the open W Barclay professor of political science at Emory University is a contributor to Larry ... crystal ball and he's also considered one of the top experts on election modeling I'm\nAs we as we reached sort of the the last portion of our interview here I I Want to touch on with you professor I broke Abramowitz they are very clear\nThat well what we're seeing happening right now concerning racial resentment and sort of driving the ... and you're right there are other things as well like abortion and same gender marriage needs thing oh sure um and of course I mean I I guess I guess it probably wasn't any accident\nOr maybe it is we don't know for sure but but oddly oddly the the New York times reported yesterday about um the Trump Administration wanting to change the declaration for gender I was in the administration uh try title nine um\nStrong ... there's an important cultural and and kind of religious last cultural ah aspect to this as well\nUh uh in addition to the racial aspect a ... and because ever since Nineteen eighty when when Reagan was elected in the Republican Party for the first time a put a plank in the in its platform to overturn roe v Wade um\nWe've seen this uh and and and the other part of this alignment that I'm Talking about is involves the a growing alignment between a partisanship and I'm at her religion\nA ... and particularly among among white voters so it's it's not just raise a a you know there definitely is a religious or cultural aspect to it and you know again we're seeing that the country overall is is shifting in a more liberal direction on these cultural issues\nUm you know we're seeing a ... especially for example or on the issue of same sex marriage and and uh issues relating to a gay rights I generally a gender\nOr a issues a ... but the at the same time the I'm a religious conservatives or you know white white evangelicals and other religious conservatives have become\nYou know we had been pushing back very strongly against these trends and are becoming increasingly important part of the Republican base\nOr and and Trump ah we've seen that very clearly with Trump I mean he he uh uh sees the religious right as a key component of his coalition\nA and a play to them very strongly during the twenty sixteen campaign and continues to ah and we're seeing this with I think that's what this transgender\nA thing as is all about a\nNo accident that happens just two weeks before the midterm\nNo not at all I mean I I I doubt it I I you know I don't know how long this has been in the works but I think this is clearly playing to their religious conservatives again trying to get them out to vote because there's there's concern I think there has been a concern a among Republican strategist that um you know that a lot of ...\nAnd voters are a lot of conservative Republicans these days um if Trump's not\nOn the ballot if he's not running may or may not be that motivated to turn out and vote so they're trying to transfer support for him to\nSupport for other Republican candidates down the ballot and and this is you know part of that\nAlan Abramowitz um\nPerhaps we could say that with the president CNN campaign of Donald Trump we've seen this realignment ... realignment and again we'll get back to racial resentment here because because you do say that's the number one you look at the numbers this is the number one cause for for this realignment\nI'm ... and maybe it's accelerating\nDuring the Trump years but it doesn't begin with the ... years\nOh no not at all uh uh so uh this is one of the major points I Try to make in the book is that the transformation of the party system from the Nineteen sixties really through the early to thousands really set the stage for Trump for his emergence\nI'm not that we could have predicted that Donald Trump was going to win the Republican nomination and then the president say are very few people if anyone would have would have predicted that happening but I think looking back we can certainly see that without this transformation that that that could not have happened just as\n... without the transformation and the demographic you know the the racial them demographic bases are the parties of Obama's nomination election could not have happened I'm\nSo with Trump I think that the the you know growing a\nRelationship between racial resentment and support for the Republican Party among white voters a it was crucial and and and the growing influence of religious conservatives also ... played a role in this although that wasn't really a group of he especially appeal to during the Republican primaries\nA really um you know he did get some support there but but there were other candidates particularly a Ted Cruz you know really really was the probably the a preferred candidate up a lot of religious conservatives\nAnd in ... during the two thousand sixteen primaries but now they've gone a over you know there's certainly a a a strongly behind Trump\nWill was it about the Nineteen sixties was the civil rights act\n[noise] sure I hear on the line when it was yeah I think it was the civil rights revolution ah and then the uh the voting rights act on the entrance of large numbers of African American voters into the electorate and\nAh then in the Nineteen sixty four presidential election where you had\nFor the first time they um party is really a a taking these are new positions on civil rights with the Democrats and Lyndon Johnson the Democratic candidate I really began before the election but then continuing in the election Johnson and you know embracing the cause of civil rights\nUh and and uh the Republican nominee Barry Goldwater a a strongly opposing a civil rights\nAre and so uh that that was really a first and uh we saw shift the African American vote you know big increase in turnout ... after the voting rights act African American voting increased pretty dramatically [noise] um but in in sixty four ah we saw a ... you know a white\nA southern um many white southern voters a swinging to the Republicans in the in the presidential election and then\nUm that really can continues after the Nixon uh Seventy two campaign ... with the", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Democracy Now!", "city": "Madison", "day": "25"}
