BBC News\nGood day and will come to the letters and politics I'm a judge a grand lesson of history that no system empire republic government last forever\nBy definition history does not tell us when current systems will fall but it does show us how previous systems fell and we can glean from them what we will today we're in a look at both the fall of the Roman republic and then later the empire\nAnd compare it to our political times today in us history for that conversation very happy to welcome back to a radio station Arthur ... Arthur ... professor of history and distinguished university professor at the universe\nSee of Maryland College park is the author of a number of books including moral vision and the histories of Libya's his most recent book is called bad moon rising how's the weather underground beat the FBI and lost the revolution in fact we had our ex dine on to talk about that but just just a few weeks ago and then we had talked to answer on that you are a professor\nAt the moment is an ancient Rome and yeah I I was a we had another conversation and then I was like well how did this happen and how does this and that the exactly how it was pure luck folks that's right [laughter] good to see her again thank you for them and back good I'm very glad to be here Mitch\nI Want to quote from an article that you recently wrote that was published in the book uh called chaos in the liberal order and your article is called a risk to Krissy oligarchy and Trump he said this quote\nTime after time ah so that their lives are of a financially ruin\nA so they were demanding a ... a a a better a new deal and especially because people who came back sold their farms in order to get out of debt but then they don't have farms and then they drift into the city so that are wrong it comes to the city surrounded by slums in the capital of the world becomes surrounded by slums\nAre inhabited by the people who made the empire\nAnd it's just making ... ... income inequality there are certainly their farms voted already own all the ... and so\nOh yes some of the income inequality in the late republic is astounding and uh one of the things Sallis says he says houses the size of cities are being built and that is true we actually have a map\nOf Rome from that period with lots of little he's only ... streets and then there's somebody is a state in the city which is the size of five city blocks you know\nAnd and those people are living and people can see how what's what's going on so the the uh the income disparity is terrible I should say how that was eventually handled was that the young Octavian who became a the emperor Augustus\nSettled people new people poor people on the land by force in a forty to forty one forty B. C.\nOr he confiscated private property\nAnd gave it a two of the deserving a actually veterans who had who had fought and you know that actually handle the problem and the first century id Italy is actually a land of small farms but how it was done was by violence by saying okay this is what's gonna happen\nGet off the land you have here comes the soldier and his friends and you are through is the owner of this place\nThat that's really interesting because I just as soon as he he takes over he he becomes him for after after Caesar's killing right and so we're jumping ahead a little bit we'll get back to ... to complete the story but but that's interesting to me\nBecause we think in the east coast of our own culture here think well democracy is always the best\nAnd especially for regular people for poor people but history would show and if you if you have a monarch or let's just say even a dictator you didn't have a really bad dictator\nBut then also find that oftentimes dictators will be friendlier more compassionate maybe ... now my name is the right term but but more beneficial to poor people than say the aristocratic\nYeah the ... Augustus certainly was Octavian certainly was an Caesar intended to be himself\nA let's go back to Caesar though and the thing is but his ambitions were viewed as unlimited and that's what created distrust back in Rome about what he was doing and I think they were unlimited or to give you two examples [noise] once the civil war starts\nHe he's fifty two years old he's balding fifty two year old guy with a teenaged mistress who is also the queen of Egypt that Cleopatra people looked at that and said what's this\nWhere is the limits to his appetite it's not just ambition and it becomes appetite that's involved in it\nAnd so you ... so you have writers a political thinker saying it's appetite that's the problem and that if you have people with a great deal of power who are oligarchs and only interested in themselves that appetite shows up first\nIn feasting and food a vent insects whereas where it's unlimited what they want to do no restrictions no limits\nAnd then its power\nSo I mean you look at a Trump who is a supposedly one pound short of being officially obese\nAs for his sexual drive we've all had to deal with this ad ... and so when people look at that now they go this guy has no limits\nMind republics ... a run on limits limited became limits on behavior what you can say what you can do people didn't believe that Caesar was going to accept any limits to his power after he conquered call I mean he became a\nUm his private fortune by the end of the Catholic conquest was the size of the room and treasury now we're we're not talking about Bill Gates who who's got a hundred billion dollars we're talking about somebody who has two trillion dollars\nSo you can see why people are worried about him that he had no limits\nYeah I Want to ask you flush um in that is the Roman republic is a democratic do people do people vote\n'em but one has to it's a modulated complicated thing people are elected by a popular well elect in buying a electoral college\nWith where the rich vote first\nAnd there are a hundred and Ninety three voting units and Ninety eight of them belong to the rich\nSo if the rich all vote for one person\nPerson is automatically has a majority vote of the units\nAnd then there's no ... need to continue asking other people to be counted\nSo that all happened um it just stopped with the upper the aristocrats or if they were United on the reason I Want to make a complex is there were often many candidates running there could be as many as six or seven candidates running for the console ship the presidency in one year\nAnd so you can never know how things were actually going to come out\nBut it's certainly heavily weighted towards the rich charts property owners\nAnd ah the mob the masses got one vote even though they were a majority of the population um nevertheless um\nAristocrats and all the guards had to learn public speaking and the only reason to do that is because they actually had to convince people to vote for them\nAnd it could happen that that very aristocratic people lost\nMy oratory so important that's right ... that's the mark of the free state oratory the importance of it is the mark of a free state it's not it's not a frozen waste it's very complicated politics Cicero\nActually a road I'm a a pamphlet called how to get elected which we have and it's really complicated when you know who you have to talk to who you have to schmooze with who you have to butter up all of these things to to get elected\nWe don't have any Haitian with Arthur ... professor of history and distinguished university professor at the University of Maryland College park ... author of a number of books including\nMoral vision and the history of polygamy is that your guy right ... yeah you know talking about I was moment his latest book is called Batman rising how's the weather underground beat the FBI and lost the revolution it's also author of an article that does pertain to the conversation or having right now it's called Arista Chrissy oligarchy\nAnd Trump the reason I asked if if the Roman republic was democratic if people voted and it kind of goes back to the previous question I had and that is sometimes dictate or even ... and\nA strong armed ruler a monarch whatever you want to call it may sometimes be more beneficial towards the poor people in a democracy would and the reason that Caesar was killed I mean this is the popular telling the story anyways it's because he was about\nTo um [noise] upset the cart the apple cart for for the aristocrats\nUm yes [noise] that's true and a and one of the things to think about is a of the conspirators half had opposed him in the civil war and had been pardoned by him and you would say and people did it say how one grateful love him to kill him\nNot to which the answer is these are people who are used to pardoning people they're not used to being part and\nYou know there used to making it on their own but the other half of the conspirators including the leading military person had supported Caesar and the civil war\nThey they uh were people who thought he'd had a case but they didn't want the republic destroyed and Caesar was showing himself to be a person without limits including having his statue carried with the twelve God's a in a ...\nAmong these were being declared a dictator was actually it's constitutional office in his right lesson for six months lasted for six more like an emergency office right lose I Want to hear the call the shots to deal with a very important situation and then you step down yeah it's six months or the end of the crisis whichever comes first\nAnd it was a a a great amount of trust to trust somebody with a great powers that the dictator have on because they're trusting him to step down and not to be a seduced by it\nBut Caesar was made dictator without time limit at first he was made dictator for ten years not six months and then he was made dictator without time limit and that was in February of forty four and he's dead the next month\nSo I'm a people worried that he was going to end free politics\nAnd is that politics free is endemic renting it is in a way a there are a multiple candidates for office but they're all from the same class you know so you can vote you can vote for a Clinton or you can vote for Rockefeller or ... you know\nSo he had to deal with them a it's a ... and the damned the emperor shipping want to use that term was a ... institution in Rome you cannot appear as a a total dictator outside of room\nAll the stature show him wearing armor or naked which was the other thing the Greeks like that it's called heroic nudity\nYou get that as well\nSo that he had to be both\nOctavian was able to do it Caesar was not a Caesar's unlimited appetites we're clear to everybody and one of the reasons he was killed was he was leaving to go conquer the ah the Iranians and would be gone for a long time and would be his regime would be settling in\nWhile he was gone so they want her to kill him for that reason too\nUm but I I Would I Would say about this that the level of distrust that's created by people not accepting limits on their behavior or can wreck or a republic public depends on for instance\nOr if you lose the election you lose the election that's all that happened a you're not threatened with being imprisoned\nWhen Trump to adapt to Clinton threatening her within prison this was a violation of the limits on behavior that had been established for two hundred fifty years that you don't do that\nOr you don't see that as Trump being Trump just that's what Trump's can't tell you anything that guy says seriously\nUm through cities writing two thousand five hundred years ago the Greek historian Greek historian set on on the island of ...\nA a debate in the ... in the assembly before the people on whether to ally with Athens or not and with one side winning the other side then takes the winners or to court for on various trumped up charges\nAnd fails to convict them so then those people take their opponents to court and do does convict them and then the opponents assassinate those who uh had won the victory in court and have political debate in the assembly division leads\nTo use of the court's ... the weaponized some of the court's against your enemies and sue city says this is how things collapse\nSo when Trump said that I went oh my God\nYou know ... to cities would go I've been here before\nI've seen this myself and here's where it's gonna end up in because he didn't he saw the end of democracy in Athens and asked is yeah um [noise] although it was restored so ... by violence by violence\nOr an and those people are are heroes and people are restored them democracy where ordinary people who who who did that\nBut I I I think again the issue becomes distrust and and\n... a republics need trust I Know I'm gambling on but it can give you a two separate sets of information [noise] uh since Nineteen Ninety two every American president has been viewed as ill legitimately elected by one group or another\nAh Clinton a Bill Clinton was viewed as illegitimate we elected because Ross Perot took twenty percent of the vote from Bush a senior who would then of want\nA Bush junior in two thousand was legitimately elected because of the he actually lost the election in the in popular vote and then there was a terrible business with Florida and says\nPresident Obama was considered ill legitimately elected by people with already been born in Kenya and therefore legally could not be president\nAnd Trump or was elected and there are lots of people who say he's it legitimately elected because Clinton won by three million popular votes so we have now had a sequence since then or twenty five years\nWhere some large group within the American population views the government as illegitimate either from the left or from the right\nAh that's very bad for republic that creates polarization and create splits creates people not only differing politically but beginning to hate each other and feel they're being cheated or somebody is cheating so that's one thing\nHow things used to work is this way a Bill Clinton's deep Robert Dole or for president in Nineteen Ninety six\nAnd after the election or Clinton invited to all to the White House and said I Know you're interested in the issue of refugees in the Balkans I Want to make you the president's special representative on refugees in the Balkans and I'll give you wonder if they're forced to what whatever it is\nAnd [noise] ... said okay I'll do it\nHe was interviewed on I hate to ... ... ... a station which shall not be named and the interviewer said\nWhat are you doing working for Clinton she beat you and ... who's a representative of the greatest generation the generation that we're in World War two and then also defeated the Soviet Union she ... he says to the interview or\nThe president of the United states was my political opponent he was not my personal enemy after the election he asked me to do something for the country I agreed to do it what the hell's wrong with you\nKnow the ... well yeah with you and I'll be all said said yeah and he's had a bad temper and and\nThat person the interviewer is the voice of the future\nYou know very few people like Bob Dole anymore I'm not that I voted for do an issue [laughter] but\nUh ... this is people who accept limits and cooperation as the essence of the republic\nAre in conversation with Arthur ... professor of history and distinguished university professor at the University of Maryland College park [noise] he's a professor of history of the ancient Roman world and he's the author of a number of books in his latest book which is not on this topic but we had him on about a month ago to talk about is called Batman rising how's the weather underground beat the FBI and lost\nThe revolution he also has an article that came out recently in a book called the chaos in the liberal order called aristocrat see oligarchy and Trump so here we are in the situation right now and I think is pretty remarkable and I'm I'm curious if you see the parallels anytime in the ancient world\nWhere you have what seems like government entities going after\nEach other and maybe this is related to what you're talking about\nA week course at ... and and and uh the the threatening or even presenting of ah your your political opponents but right you know you you you see what's happening in the house intelligence committee against the FBI the Trump against the FBI but he's got Democrats are responding to that the eyes responding\nAnd almost ... I'm getting a sense or not that these were perfect I mean I was on Capitol Hill ten years ago covering congressional hearings almost every day but I've never seen what really seems like\nMaybe we got this ring the McCarthy Era or but by just a pure weaponization of these entities\nI I agree Mitch I've never seen anything like this either um even in Nineteen sixty eight or maybe in Nineteen sixty eight but not since Nineteen sixty eight sixty nine\nIt is a distrust in the institutions um and that means the reason for that just trust a of but certainly being weaponized by Trump is\nThat those institutions are not responding quickly enough to the needs of the population as the population season\nOf and um [noise] the Senate and room there used to be no alternative to the Senate so people went along with them being clumsy and slow\nThen people began saying well the Greeks have alternatives to this kind of republic one of them is somebody was given a lot of power to get things done quickly\nAnd after of one thirty three after the ... who are saying we can have land reform we don't have to wait for the Senate to vote on it because they never will because they're\nLarge landowners they don't want reform high\nThe Tribune Siberia crackers will offer you land state owned land so that you can go back in to get back in the uh on the countryside and have small farms again uh\nOnce that happens once there's an alternative then people are looking at alternatives to senatorial rule that\nUndermines the Senate which had a ... up to them how to such enormous prestige that people listen to it but now people are saying well who are those guys in the Senate they're just rich guys who don't care about us and of course if you look at the American Senate how many are millionaires\nYou know I'm a mother in the house not all but many many are you know so\nPeople that that was the ... and how we end up getting the Tribune ... right and we say Tribune's interest in

limits established by the the treaty\nOr they have not exhausted all the diplomatic opportunities are that are available to resolve this issue uh we've been working on that and what Trump has done is

very important agreement that's important for us and European and Russian security\nAnd it does absolutely nothing to bring in Russia back into compliance with the treaty\nAh and it opens the door for

examine these missiles of concern and the two sides could conceivably work out an arrangement by which\nAre each side's concerns are are addressed and if Russia does have missiles that can fly in excess of the the treaty limits or they could be\nCalled upon to stop deployment but they haven't the two sides haven't gotten this far there have not been discussions are at the detailed expert level about how to resolve this in fact the only been to meetings on the IMF issue between us and Russian officials since Trump came into office\nI mean can you talk about how many um [noise] uh how many ... does the United states has how many does Russia have um is this just a gift to the weapons manufacturers just no holds barred take all restraints off\nWell you're you're right I mean we got to where to put all this in perspective you know even though the Cold War is over or so to speak or the weapons that were created during the Cold War still exist and the the nuclear strategies that the United states and Russia had at that time are still very much in place so\nAs we sit here this morning chatting about this uh the United states deploys about one thousand four hundred warheads on long range bombers and missiles that on land and on the\nUh the Russians have equivalent numbers\nAbout eight hundred of those could be launched on an order from the president within about twenty minutes so that means that both sides remain on hair trigger\nOr if there is a warning of an attack or the nuclear strategies call for um the immediate launch of eight hundred or more a nuclear warheads\nOr in retaliation so that creates the chance for miscalculation so we have massive overkill or we have a situation in which the fate of literally a hundreds of millions of people rest in in the hands of a of a small number of people specifically to\nA gentleman Trump and food and uh so\nUh we're talking about making the situation worse by removing one of the treaties that was negotiated in the eighties by none other than Ronald Reagan or that help and the Cold War so this does reopen the possibility of a a new arms race which of course would certainly\nAnd if it ah the weapons contractors or that or would build a any any new weapons\nCould you give us a sense on the floor we conclude wonder if a state with the new start treaty and does this give an indication that Trump will pull out of the ... has been opposed to that as well\nWell uh yeah Bolton before he came into office he was he wanted to pull out of the IMF treaty he has said a negative things about the new strategic arms reduction treaty\nOr so that treaty was negotiated by bronco bomb and two dollars and ten it's scheduled to expire in February five twenty Twenty one just a few days after the next ... inauguration day\nA Trump including could however agreed to extend it by five years along with the transparency and verification provisions that are very important\nUm and right now John Bolton is leading an interagency review about whether to extend the treaty trash the treaty or try to renegotiate some new treaty and the the little amount of time left between now and twenty Twenty one\nSo you know if we if we look at this I enough decision I'm very worried that John Bolton is headed\nIn the same direction with respect to the new start treaty and if that's the case we would not have legally binding limits on the world's two largest arsenals for the first time since Nineteen Seventy two [noise]\nSo it's very important for Congress or to step up a Republicans and Democrats who support the new start treaty to press a Trump to extend this treaty to buy some more time so that we can at least have these limits in place and pursue further negotiations with Russia\nOr to further reduce the the bloated and costly arsenals of these these two\nAnd finally we just have thirty seconds even though this is an agreement between the U.S or was and is it actually Trump saying we're pulling out meaning we have pulled out its it's also a message to China that President Trump descendants\nWell he may think so um I don't think the Chinese are particularly perturbed a you know China has most of its arsenal on ground launched missiles or with a a a medium or intermediate range or just as to\nDo with geography um they're under no pressure to join the INS treaty um and uh they have a relatively small about three hundred nuclear weapons arsenals that they feel is sufficient to deter the United states so you may think he's sending a message to sign up but I don't think it's a very effective one\nMhm and what does it mean is the U.S out since Trump said they are\nWell that's a great question I mean these discussions between John Bolton and the Russians today in Moscow I think will be key uh it is not clear whether a Trump is actually pulling out um it may be that they're trying to threaten that the U.S will pull out if Russia doesn't do something in particular\nThat's not clear ah my Russian contacts has not yet heard anything like that our European allies have not heard anything like that but I think it's quite likely if we remain on the current track that the high enough treaty will be terminated by Donald Trump sometime in twenty Nineteen\nDaryl Kimball want to thank you for being with us director the arms control association previously led coalition's reduce nuclear dangers [laughter]\nThis is democracy now democracy now for the war and peace in front of course we'll continue to report on the U.S Russia ins treaty when we come back and changing trans policy and the part of the Trump Administration stay with us\nAnd and the more we have an ideological debate about whether or not it's you know moral or ethical to recognize the existence of trans people the more we're going to embolden the Trump Administration and other state level government actors to act to take away our rights\nThis this isn't this isn't a debate it doesn't violate anyone else's rights for trans people to have right\nWell how would you respond to those who say that framing the conversation and this way is a way of persuading people now of course as you say these ... people of course they exist\nBut if the other argument is put forward than perhaps people who aren't persuaded of this will be persuaded\nI think the concern is that we're hearing a debate about trans existence that's not being led by trans people and so much of what we're seeing is understanding of trans nest that really in trenches this notion that there is some biological truth of sex and something else that's ideological called gender and that really is a false dichotomy\nAnd what we're seeing is that by\nBy saying that there's something called science that's true ah interesting\nThat the administration is using science to defend\nAll of a sudden they are and how science um but but the reality is that that that I think what I Want people to really understand is there any things that are typically true in science so for example it maybe typically true that men have certain bodies but it's a political choice to make that definitional to say men have\nTo have certain bodies are in order to be men and I think what we have to understand is that these are political choices that are part of a long legacy that is very much connected colonialism white supremacy and efforts to exclude people from participation in some way I think is the best place to get information on transition\nI think the best place to get information on trans issue is from trans people so we can look at publications that have trans writers whether that broadly advise them a Hyundai not publication dean boat the voices of trans people have a ...\nOn challenged the way this conversation has been framed in places like the New York times and you're at times the New Yorker the guardian or regularly running pieces ... attacking whether or not that people can and should exist\nAs we begin to wrap up you

people also also get that health care and I just want to say to the trans community this is a terrifying time people were breaking out into tears yesterday I Know people are scared but we have a long history of resistance and we will continue to fight and we absolutely will survive\nWell I Want to thank you very much chased strange you for joining us staff attorney at the ACLU assist democracy now
