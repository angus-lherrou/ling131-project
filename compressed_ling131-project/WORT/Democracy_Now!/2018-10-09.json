it's just rich and now joining me is Nancy McLean and empty McLean\nIs the William H chase professor of history and public policy at Duke University and she joins us for a discussion on her new book which is called democracy and chains a deep history of the radical right's do plan\nFor America mentioned McClain who is my very good pleasure to welcome you to this radio program\nThank you match I'm pleased to be with you we've done a number of shows on the history of economics and also the history of the right and we've talked about many uh different economists were influential and the ideology of what we consider\nA center right or even a far right a ideologies today one name however we have never spoken about until today is that of genes MacDill Buchanan why do you focus on James McGill Buchanan and and who is\nWell first of all let me say in sympathy with your listeners that I had never heard of James McGill cannon uh when I stumbled upon him in the archives pursuing another ... a topic and the reason that he is so important in my book is that I discovered that he\nEssentially supplied the ideas the a style of political economy and the analysis being used by the Koch donor network today to radically transform our politics and I think it's a story that could actually only be discovered a\nOut these these clearly partisan a fundraising appeals for the center which a whistle blower had found and was saying look this stuff is illegal and at that point James Buchanan himself trying to disassociate from the enterprise and he'd been exploited by the Koch\nA coke people and it was really quite the the kerfuffle about what was fascinating for me is it took me into this world of you know what it's sometimes called the corporate university now of how these\nVery arch right donors um are are pushing their political agenda in universities through funding particular centers like what coke funded at George Mason which is now called the ... center\nBut anyway getting access to be cannons personal papers basically confirmed all my developing understanding of what his ideas were about and what they were being used to do so there was ... there were moments when I was in that\nUm the cannon house where what I was finding was just heart stopping in the way that it it confirmed what what I had\nCome to believe will tell me what were what was her heart stopping\nWell there was that coke that exchange about the coke implant at George Mason and how in the end it actually ran roughshod over Buchanan himself and the university administration pushed aside its Nobel\nPrize winner an economics in order to please it's top donor Charles Koch so that was pretty pretty stunning but I had also along the way and my research learned that Buchanan had been invited to kill a by the Pinochet dictatorship\nCivilian allies in Nineteen eighty to advise the hunt on how to design a constitution\nThat would return the country to electoral rule after this brutal dictatorship but we do so in a way that would preserve all the games that chilies elite had got a gotten through the brutal suppression of any popular a organization you know trade unions farmers organization students that cetera [noise]\nAnd um and privatizing Social Security healthcare schools et cetera and uh so so I knew that you kind of had gone there but in his files I found confirmation of that and I found\nCorrespondence with these Chilean officials and here was Buchanan a man who calls himself a libertarian and always spoke of the free society\nAnd so of course I look for some condemnation of the dictatorship and its methods and I found nothing\nA of that all I found was him\nAre applauding the regimes top ... newspaper a saying that they had perfectly captured um his his advice on the the constitutions of course I quote that at length on the book\nThat advice that he gave which was was quite um direct um but then he also tank top regime official for the lovely luncheon held in his honor and the jewelry and wine and flowers given to miss this be a cat and and\nSo you know at that point again something just shifted in my God and I thought who who my writing about here you know who would be\nVisiting and abetting one of the most brutal dictatorships of the era who's practices actually helped give her eyes to global human rights activism\nAfter all that had been exposed in the media they'd actually just purged universities and knew before he became an arrived and here he was thanking them for the you know the wine and the jewelry and the flowers from Mississippi cannon in the lovely launch with no word about um these repressive practices\nSo that was another ... parts per um and then there were I Would say smaller a I'm a elements along those lines like for example I found that Buchanan a bit for other people we know better using the term\nHad had used the phrase a counter intelligentsia you know something on associated with neo conservatives and such and the Nineteen seventies but he was saying that early in the Nineteen seventies and working with Ed Meese who was Ronald Reagan Ronald Reagan was governor of California and Ed Meese was his his right hand man\nAnd B can was working with him to organize such a counter intelligentsia creating something called the Institute for contemporary studies\nAnd talking about you know creating and these are his words a gravy train to bring right wing academics you know to to to learn young people into these fields um end with this gravy train get them committed to these right wing ideas\nAnd then push them out there in the world to advocate\nFor these ideas so I found in his papers documentation of that\nAnd at one point he said conspiratorial secrecy is at all times essential that he asked how much hypocrisy is necessary so this is you know a kind of inside view of the building up of right wing think tanks and right wing bastions at universities that we don't often get access to\nA and then I saw how they're after um he was working with some of the top conservative\nOr right wing funders um you know in addition of course of the folks but also um the ... foundation that was so important and undermining the administration of Bill Clinton and the Nineteen nineties and launching they tax on Hillary Clinton um and and many other uh such right wing groups and also\nWorking with corporations and inviting a CEOs and managers of corporations on right wing foundations to a Virginia to take a seminars and training in how to apply actions on what you can and called the spectrum of secession\nOn this goes back perhaps to your interest in John see come home that you mentioned but he he advocated ...\nActions on the spectrum of secession saying secession was no longer legal since the civil war but still act the the exit could be a threat could be a source of the threat of acts that could be a source of power and leverage\nAnd so he urged um privatization decentralization federalism a and a few more actions on that spectrum of secession to essentially um urge corporations into what has come to be known\nTo most of us as the race to the bottom [noise] you know we tend to think of this you know this this decline near this constant corporate pressure to lower taxes to lower public services to say\nYou know to North Carolina well I'm going to go to South Carolina to Indiana I'm going to go to Alabama or whatever but you know basically using the threat of access to drive down taxes regulations workers' rights standards um all ... you know environmental enforcement\nAnd what was fascinating to me is we'll talk about that as I'm almost you know sort of ...\nAn avid about something that just came with globalization but what I saw Buchanan papers is that he was actually um training people training corporations in how to use that threat of access to fight\nA democratic a victory is from the populations of their states on again matters from workers' rights to civil rights to environmental protection and so forth\nAnd we're a conversation with Nancy ... is the William H trade professor of history and public policy\nAt Duke University and she's the author the book that we're in conversation about called democracy and change\nThe history of the radical right's still plan for America so so what did you do with James Buchanan papers or you've found at George Mason university use leave them to Oregon I made a lot of universities for that [laughter] and then when you got 'em well\nHere's an interesting thing and I didn't understand it fully at the time and I was actually concerned as a scholar and as a historian about the condition of these papers because it was obvious that he was a very important man it was obvious that this was a crucial piece\nOf our national history and the papers as I said we're in honor disarray\nUh and then I learned from someone who was working in the building that there was a threat of mold and the building so I was really you know pushing and saying you know these really need to be preserved they need to be put somewhere and then it turned out that ah the library had tried to get Buchanan to to donate his papers but he had been resistant part\nPartly because he was so angry at the way the ... I think had taken over his campus and the way he had been\nTreated Shabba lay by the George Mason administration in ... to that uh to their top donor so he was reluctant to give them over but after a after I left they have since been I'm taken by the special collections department at the library there which is you know usually university are Kaiser and special collections\nAnd they are working on processing them now um so that's interesting and they've actually also discovered\nA they discovered very late in the process another thirty two boxes of his materials which I guess we're in a base or something I don't really know um\nWell they came to find those but any of that they have thirty two more boxes but they are and the the course of organizing them now and processing them and making them available to researchers\nI mean it's interesting to see how you got into his office so that's what you do these weren't boxers put somewhere else after his death you you got into his office as as it was the last time yeah there's\nReally I mean again for historian for anybody you know it's important but for historian who's kind of mindful of the past and I knew a lot about this guy and it was just it was really\nUnsettling you know for example I opened one drawer and I found a bunch of aspirin and you know Advil and things I had arthritis in his late ... and he had complained about that the people at his correspondence and so\nThere was something just very strange about it you know about having access and when there was a a suit jacket of his that was still hanging on a hanger in the office and\nSo again it was unlike any archival uh experience that I'd had before and it really was almost kind of haunting in the way that it was still um yeah so macho working office\nAnd I know they let you in the University of the UN or did you break it\nThe leaders of the strike were active in every major club and the debate of society and the black version of the four H club and the chorus and that is that and the other and so they got to tour around a little and they saw the kinds of schools that other kids had\nTo bring them into as they put the modern world and they wanted their own school to be that the school had tar paper shack it had you know it was a it was terrible\nAnd so they had this strike to get a better school which of course would have required more tax resources and the county leaders actually told their parents and their principal well your tax contribution is too low\nYou know you should earn more and as the black leaders of prince Edward county put it you know they were telling us to make bricks without straw you know how could we possibly pay more taxes if we didn't have the education to get better jobs\nSo I tried to repay that and the book the civil rights movement is also a story about public finance which was Buchanan field because what these young people did and prince Edward county was\nYou know they were seeing the world around them and the Nineteen fifties they could see that the labor unions at the CIA oh which were active in the south and in Virginia or winning\nBy applying collective power engaging in collective bargaining they were improving conditions for their members and their communities and that was resulting in higher taxes for some wealthier citizens you know and we have a tendency I think only to see the civil rights struggle in terms of\nYou know attitudes about race and what people have in their hearts but this is really you know there's a long history of institutional racism and of public\nPolicies that favored whites in this country and what I saw happening in that strike was that students were saying this is not fair this is not right and we need to equalize it and the consequences of that would be to to have greater taxes for\nA wealthier whites and Buchanan saw that too and the school of thought that he founded and I want readers to wrestle with\nThe complexity of that that we're not just talking about added mystic racial attitudes about fundamental questions of political economy and what kind of society we have been and what kind of society we want to be and what that means for things like our taxation system and our public policies\nMental McLean is our guest and she's the author of the book democracy and changed the deep history the radical right's health plan for America man Sima clay on the jump around a little bit in time here and I I foresee us ending or near towards the end of our conversation talking about today's Freedom Caucus\nBut I actually want to go back into time before we get there back to this\nHistorical figure they you've you've already mentioned John C.\nCalhoun and I find John C. Calhoun interesting for for a number of reasons one right now because when there's\nSo much talk nationally about the removal of Confederate statues while John C. Calhoun who was a senator from South Carolina did not live long enough to see the civil war but before the civil war he was known as the great defender\nOf of slavery uh in in the Senate and for me on a personal note I always find them fascinating because\nMany years ago as the Capitol Hill correspondent in right outside of the Senate chamber of theirs is\nA big portrait of John ... who and knowing his history I remember thinking to myself I Wonder if one day there's going to be pressure to remove that portrait right outside the ah the Senate chamber but talk to me\nAbout this connection of of John C. Calhoun and maybe can fill in a little bit more about who he was and why it's important and understanding James Buchanan and today's right wing politics\n[noise] yeah well maybe I'll just start with an interesting fact which is that some of the accountants colleagues at the ... center at George Mason university a Tyler ... and Alexander ... both of whom I've worked with Charles Koch well in ... case now for twenty five years on this Mercator center on this project to change\nThe country they wrote a piece I I'm actually calling John C. Calhoun it's terribly anachronistic but\nCalled him a precursor to modern public choice theory to your cannons ideas and then you know they go through the whole thing of the ways in which their ideas are similar and treating slavery as sort of an unfortunate side note as if it wasn't central to Calhoun motivation [noise]\nUm but uh but they so they treat slavery as I Know and then they say that the two schools of thought John ... hands and James Buchanan had the same purpose and effect\nAnd I thought that was just fascinating um and I already knew that there was a Calhoun connection but that took me deeper into it\nSo um uh so uh what I learned was multiple things will one and I already knew this from the earlier Virginia research that I was doing but Calhoun a was\nResurrected zoomed whatever you would call it in Virginia in a Nineteen fifty five to Nineteen fifty six by right wing columnist named James Jackson Kilpatrick who later became nationally famous\nHe was exempt so as to give Virginia respectable cover for fighting the brown decision so a view Ken I'm Sorry I'm Calhoun who actually wrote two major treatise says about politics that we can come back to\nAnd considered himself a police actually use the word for political science\nBut a Calhoun had said that states had the right to Interpol is was his verb their authority\nUh between their people and the federal government when they thought that the federal government was an error so that's why Kilpatrick revived Calhoun ideas and the state of Virginia and a number of others actually adopted what were called inter position resolutions\nIn answer to the brown versus board a mandate to desegregate and so Calhoun was very much in the air when Buchanan moved to Virginia and um jak James Jackson Kilpatrick was ah the news editor of one of the Virginia's major dailies\nHe was constantly you know he said he was on a ... and the Penn was his land said he was writing all the time about Calhoun and it was you know\nI'm a big subject and at the University of Virginia the president Colgate Darden was also part of a group called the Virginia commission on constitutional government\nWhich was again using these ideas to push back on the new deal model of government saying that the federal government didn't have any right constitutional right to regulate the states so that stuff was very much in the air is Buchanan was developing his constitutional theories even even in the arid his own university\nI'm so part of what I was doing to is providing that context that historical context for the development of his ideas because you know other people\nUm in his fields I don't know about that it's been quite a shock for them to hear it but it's true and I think a lot of people he often talked about the minority right and so if you were reading his book you know say at Yale or the University of Minnesota or University of California you might read him talking about the rights of the minority and think he's talking about\nIt you know embattled racial minorities in the south or political dissenters but I could see he did nothing to help him battled racial minorities if anything he was you know tightening the oppressive ...\nMeasures they were facing and he ... many times called for repression of a\nPolitical dissenters and activists and organizers so clearly he wasn't interested in them when he talked about the minority he was really talking about the rich and that's\nWhat links him to Calhoun because again I think we have sometimes a way of talking about race\nIn contemporary America that makes racism sort of like just a disease of the heart you know or an irrational attitude but what we see in Calhoun\nIs a cold I calculation about how best to ... protect\nThe the the uh we'll generating system that was um it was at the forefront of the capitalism of its day there were more millionaires in Mississippi than in New York when Calhoun was writing um\nAnd they were rich because of the system of slavery but Calhoun could see that a national democracy was getting more and more hostile to slavery or to slave holders have not to slavery\nUm there was more and more descent you know the abolitionist we're organizing a lot of things were happening and so Calhoun concern was to defend that system to to erect barriers um\nFor that economic system or to the reach of national democratic political minorities majorities and so that's really the crucial link that I see with the cannons project and with coax project because in all three cases\nYou had individuals who could see that their ideas would never be embraced by a minority I mean by a majority they ... they these were men who had an extreme\nExtreme you know whatever you wanna call it free rein capitalism a ideal and they could see that the majority would never agree with those ideas and in each case repeated experience has shown that\nAnd so what they began to do was develop ideas for how to um shackled in ... the phrase that I use it in the book how to shackled or these democratic majorities with\nUm various measures are and in ... case that was the notion of states' rights and enter position and ultimately in the case of the slave holding south you know\nI'm war against the federal government treason to get away from that Democratic majority um so that's the case with Calhoun but also with the cannon and coke they more and more push for measures that would Adam\nEyes the majority so trying to destroy labor unions without actually being honest that that's what you're doing but that's clearly what you're doing\nTrying to undermine Social Security as a system of social insurance and push toward privatization an individual accounts but without telling the public that's what you're doing and I have in the book a whole um a ton of killing discussion about the advice Buchanan gave to Charles coax Kato Institute in the Nineteen eighties", "show_name": "Democracy Now!",
