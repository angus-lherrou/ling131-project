I'm joined by dreams Greene professor of Brazilian history and culture at Brown university uses director of the brown Brazil initiative and use the\nThere are the book exile within exiles river Daniel gate Brazilian revolutionary he joins me being the telephone James Green is my very good pleasure to welcome you to this radio program\nThank you for having me good to have you let's begin by talking about who in explain for us what's important to know about ... the new president of Brazil\nSo he is a former army captain who was involved in a actions to demand a salary increases for non commissioned officers and was punished in the military for doing that he was jailed for Fifteen days later\nHe was involved in a plot to plant some bombs in the military academy in order to a vote sympathy for the cause of the non commissioned officers\nWhen was this this was a Twenty years ago and he was a pushed out of the military\nThe labor movement against the government's economic policies the military's economic policies and labor policies and headed in a lot of ways abroad alliance of social movements that push the country towards democracy and built the strength that the left to add to eventually elect a president in two thousand and two\nIn the previous decade for Latin America as a whole we were talking about this leftward move led by people like ... ... um I think we've seen a reaction to that in this decade what what do you think the election\nAnd ... now the president's ... will mean for the geo political dynamics of Latin\nSo I think this represents a larger global trend of right wing and authoritarian candidates coming to power in Hungary in Poland eh we're seeing the possibility of a polarization in Germany hum a turkey the Philippines a and a I'm a conservative government of putting in in Russia\nAnd other wave in Latin America in Argentina and to lay in bed or why I think Brazil represents part of this wave 'em it's going to open the country to a foreign investment and they privatization of state owned industries\nUm they weakening of workers' benefits and social service networks and safety networks [noise]\nUm basically increasing the gap between the rich and the poor in the country I'm using the\nLanguage of fighting corruption and opening up the economy and fixing the economy I think it's going to we're going to see a a greater I'm a rate of poverty and a greater rate of of inequality in Brazil over the next period\nOn the other hand um there is a strong tradition of social movements and popular\nA reaction to this and I'm very confident that after people get over the shock of this victory they will think of reorganizing and and resisting this government in power\nI Want to I Want to make a point because um I was when I Lived in Brazil in this in the seventies during the dictatorship but it wasn't\nAnd the anti dictatorship activities I was also founder of the gay rights movement in Brazil and ... and fought within the left to\nOpen up a ... to the left and one of the things that have been significant in the campaign against both so now to this last year and most recent years is that the issues of algae beauty people have been generally and widely accepted by those opponents of also not who is very homophobic\nAnd so in a in a positive way within this negative contacts I see that the\nOpposite up opportunities of opposition to bolster NATO will really be much more inclusive and broader that has been the tradition in the in the past among progressive forces in Brazil and in Latin America and so I think the attacks on ... ... people which is going to be one of the ... the first\nUh and hardest hit groups as with people of color after descendants and poor people in general I and women I think is going to build a strong unity of progressive forces they will fight and not just against but for and against Wilson on it but for a country that is really socially inclusive\nNow that's that's countering a ... program and so it's going to be a very a difficult time had the country's extremely polarized extremely divided\nWe're down to our final minute by just let me ask you quickly what was the appeal that year ... had to the people if you five percent of the\nAid he used to fear you use the ... ... ... the crime or the violence and the city's used um fake news information to create hysteria around the workers' party and to exaggerate what it is done\nHe used the fact that the Workers Party and other political parties or sectors that were involved in corruption\nAnd to mobilize working class middle class of support for him\nAnd he also use the fact that the Workers Party under under mind as a series of social and economic car keys as a way of returning to a nostalgic past where mates don't receive Social Security benefits and rights and and we can return to an order of of normal\nWe're white people are on the top of the heart of on the pyramid\nJames Green is professor of Brazilian history and culture at Brown university's or after the brown Brazil initiative\nHe has joined us for a conversation about Brazil's presidential election that occurred yesterday he's also the author of the book exile within ... Daniel gay Brazilian revolutionary a James Green all have you back one day as soon to talk about exile exile soon\nAnd Harvard and anytime anytime you want me back to talk about Brazil lifted ... thank you so much and we\nWere pretty shady you taking time joined us today and you're listening to letters in politics when we come back we'll be looking at this idea of stick caustic terrorism and which mass media is used to put out a message demonizing a group of people that inevitably leads to an act of violence against that group of people stay tuned\n[noise]\nAnd you're listening to letters and politics I'm it's just rich and the aftermath of the massacre that happened at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania which eleven people were killed at the hands of anti Semitic man Robert powers and then also after the in the aftermath of\nWhat we saw with the twelve pipe bombs\nIn the mail a ... addressed to democratic leaders and democratic supporters this past weekend I came upon a term that I found very interesting I first founded though didn't originate here but this weekend are in group to a bra story was writing about it and you can find that it raw story\nDot com and the term is stick caustic terrorism\nNow what it means is mass communication that inspires random acts of violence that are statistically predictable but individually unpredictable so in other words if there is a let's say demonization of a particular\nGroup through mass media media and that can include a social media and then we should at some point expect a random act of violence to occur against that group by someone who we don't know who will be we don't know when we don't know how but we can expect it to happen that got me thinking a lot\nAnd I called up a good friend of ours we've had unfortunately on [laughter] I don't know fortunately we had him on this program but usually under these type of situations are very appreciative of him joining us for these type of conversations\nIs Patrick blanche bill Patrick blanche field writes about American culture and violence he is a member of the Brooklyn Institute for social research and his upcoming book they should be out next year is called gun power\nTo be published by birth so books he joins me from Pennsylvania a via Skype Petra blanche field again always uh always unfortunate the reasons we talk but I'm always appreciative of of you are coming on\n... is a real pleasure always to talk with you you know the circumstances are on on a very ugly or leak\nSo I mentioned ... caustic terrorism this is a term I never heard before this past weekend um I did a little bit of digging not not exhaustive but a little bit of digging on it and the meaning of it and work comes from is a bit obscure I Am a I was able to trace it to\nOriginal blog post that was written by somebody anonymously or then the Rolling Stone magazine picked it up and two thousand and sixteen and covering Donald Trump went and he was on the campaign trail a saying that if\nHillary Clinton were elected president and got to um nominate judges to the federal courts than the than Trump said the second amendment people have to do something about that\nAnd now the word seems to be used more and more last week it was used or in the New York times what what more can you tell me about this this ideas to caustic terrorism\nSure of so\nI think it's really it's a useful concept right um and and your description of it your destination summarize it very well ride dissemble ideas\nYou have a\nA society or a a word there is a rope by and large enough set of people a and a robots and uh\nCan cast it enough political discourse that certain types of messages with varying degrees of subtlety can when offered at scale produce predictable\nOutcomes by individuals who you know in in in the Gulf trace heavier here and understand that there's an implicit call to action in some of these states so I think it's very it's useful for thinking about certain types of mechanisms\nUm and we're thinking about the way in which powerful people can prime individuals on a mask to do certain things will also retaining their personal deniability in it\nI'm Bad at all so I think like it's it it should actually coexist with a with a with an awareness is something that I think is very basic and we don't even need a sophisticated term to describe which is just that when you\nWhen you cheapen the lives of Basque of a whole class of people when you paint them as enemies when you eat a human eyes are demonize them it's inevitable that you know that we'll have real world cash\nA ... and we we obviously need to a tune our our capacities to a detached were\nBought and um make unacceptable rhetoric that has subtle button violent downstream effects on people\nUm but that said like there's nothing subtle about\nThe ... like a total\nWell produced slick world view like what you're describing on Fox which is basically I mean the word for dishes a kind of fascism right like the other who are carriers of disease contagion but are also Savage ... animals are\nAre are are literally under siege by them they're bearing down on our borders and meanwhile our nation state is in peril but also so to or I guess are precious wife\nOr his race I mean there's someone was it this is precious bodily fluids territory right like this is this is there's no there's no subtle or implicit or hitting message here it's basically\nThis is the core of basically kind of fascism right and\nThere's a point at which and also we're deploying troops you know unable we're deploying your million military force Amazon and border to work like\nThis is this is all this will also lead to be will be all\nRight directly east policy choices this entire sort of orientation of the of the American security apparatus around ... or you know hordes of I'm wash diseased bearing others is is is a license to kill in a different way\nUm and it's\nIt's nowhere near as as him and I don't even know if you can call us to catch a terrorism stuff settled but it's it's not so it's just a dare I and part of what's very distressing to me and I think for a lot of other people walk is how the um\nBoth the liberal in the ideological sense like the Democratic establishment but also the liberal and sort of the political theory sense like the liberal state is\nJust seems incapable of metabolizing\nThis ... ... maybe the answer to sort of ... the idea that well if we just somehow do were by the fact that the\nClaim that these people have disease right if we if we were like no dog show up in Donald Trump's Americans on Twitter and you're like serious or how dare you but they're actually if you were vaccinated children in like silicone valley than there are on the care of that are similar like or like it doesn't matter or the idea of some houses that\nDiscourse can ... did it the corrections within speech can fix the\nProblem of people using speech essentially as a weapon to\nKill and I don't think\nI don't think it's adequate to that ask\nPatrick Plainfield is our guest and letters and politics Patrick Lynch field writes about American culture and violence he has a faculty member at the Brooklyn Institute for social research he's the author of the upcoming book to be published by ... power and you can also find him on Twitter\nAt ...\nBlanche field Patrick ... into this I and I I don't mean to get you to comment on something you you may not have seen by just thinking more about\nWhat I described earlier there's a segment on Fox again this comes after a lengthy coverage of the caravan that's making its way through Mexico a following up and it's my mistake for not writing this this this this guest's name down um but about the need of another baby boom\nGeneration the need for American citizens to have\nA more babies so that you don't need immigrants coming into the country and you know I I don't mean to say it's worse than it was I'm not trying to portray it worse than it was this this guest did not say that what we you know that we need more white babies but we all know that Fox\nNews is very connected to the refund supportive of the Republican Party in the Republican Party has become the party of white conservatives and I think as you allude to it it's hard not to think\nThis was this ... this I don't know if you called dog whistle or whatever it may be but that's when I heard it that's what I thought you know white babies that wasn't her words but that's definitely what would I thought I'm not even her\nHer target audience\nThemselves as dumb as to where the other day he was\nTalking about the caravan and he said well they're Middle Eastern is set in their right which you know obviously gamble we're so ... so deluge getting ...\nWhere it's like we don't ... it's hard to you just see one of his vision just reacting\nAnd collecting data but like that was a towel right in the sense that Trump previously because a court pressure and political pressure and had to use very certain locations when it comes to things like the travel ban right you can't say it's just against Muslims to ... countries where there's a majority\nTheocratic ... where he has to come up with these euphemisms and then the other day he just said no no it's about middle Easterners right they are purely a geographic slash ethnic characterization if there ever was one\nRight so there is some way in which like on the one hand yes I think it is probably we shouldn't be like oh everything is this guy is uniquely falling in this way 'cause that ... that can be that could be a historic and also in a weird way to mobilize\nAll but by the same token I Do think\nThis question of of the of the border so specifically bears or I Want to recommend to you and to your to your to your audience to a book by a a wonderful historian named Kathleen Battle do B L E W as a book called bringing a war home [noise] and it's on white power organizing and basically right wing\n... white chauvinist\nMilitant radicalism since the seventies all run out of the sixties and seventies and one of the things that she actually uncovers there is it actually there is a there is an extensive history of\nA klansmen ... and ... returned getting on bats a broken hard right doing things like self deploying to patrol the border you know do the Mexico border in the Nineteen sixties and seventies right and they have weapons and they're there to to to to to to get like communist infiltrators and obviously Mexican immigrants you know immigrants right so there's always this army is the same\nUh but I Will say like there is something there is still something\nJarring about basically getting ... ... white\nGenocide talk which is basically what that is right\nOn Fox hearing that from ... from podium Z on from talking heads and and and then for just to hear that so\nGlee without even the pretense\nOf ...\nOf any type of of any type of constrain or any type of euphemism is\nThere something about that too which is again it it\nI as a person just real I don't know how to until I can I keep trying and trying to deal with it but there's something out of it sucks all the air from the room\nAnd there's a way in which attempting to report it merely just makes it so somehow gives it to some degree of credibility and do the appropriate\nAnswer which is not a viable one is just complete refusal and and just like not allowing us in our public sphere but it's where I was already are so I don't know what to do that\nPatrick Lynch field I'm ... and I think it's important to note that massacres in this country occurred before Donald Trump or the the massacre at the uh Baptists AMU church and South Carolina was under was during President Obama's tenure as was\nA Sandy Hook elementary school the massacre there\nI think we obviously see very different reactions in the aftermath of these type of events Obama would usually um arrive where they occurred and tried to give some type of national address a that would attempt to unify the country a\nDonald Trump seems to tweet about baseball a Saturday Night that very morning I Know I saw you tweet about that I found that pretty remarkable\nIsn't it there's something about it where it's like it's just always see it I don't know if the if you're sixteen or they should go and find that the the the Trump's\nComments as he's about to either ... or ... or the plane from a plane somewhere in a in a sort of doing that thing where you rocks back and forth you sort of his body language is oddly so soothing and sort of distracting\nAnd he just sort of says well you know like this the terrible situation there's been a lot of evil in the world I guess I've just been a bad world in a bad world for many centuries I think you said which is an interesting thing to say oh and then he just volunteers all the people in uh the people in Pittsburgh really need more armed guards and that's the answer\nOff and then when you just sort of walk away and a couple of hours later he's he's he's wives waiting a Dodgers game and it's there said there is again this is that this is the Dean I think we're we're right here where they they don't even think it really bothered a try\nRight crew bomber tried a great deal and you know he was your questions of\nWhy I waiters to like ... staffers and New York and I later see the only place I've ever seen that image since has actually been weapon used as a right wing named like celebrate liberal tears which is super quickly what do you think about it but that said um\n... you could see he seemed almost ... he\nJust wanted to get it on Trump seemed to want to get it over with and then on to to to offer some leading and all her the generic thoughts and prayers are sort of like prayers would make sure but when you pray there was an armed guard off and\nThen baseball and it's sort of it I was trying to I'm trying to imagine if there had been a mass shooting attack on a synagogue\nUnder Obama and Obama's response had been essentially victim blaming or will they should've hired more security even though there were a free cops there got shot for crying out loud and then to go on to like\nLive tweeted sports match it just it it\nI I feel like there would be I\nI feel Tucker Carlson probably would have had a stroke on like TV if that happened and yet now we're just gonna we're gonna move on the next day Trump's going to be attacking the press even as more mail bombs are apparently mean discovered our mail them is a\nIs there is a kind of one striking thing about the Trump situations that there's a kind of contempt even for the idea of tree tax write whereas like you and I'm not saying we're going to necessarily good but it is a data point I mean you you got the sense that um", "show_name": "Democracy Now!", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "31"}
