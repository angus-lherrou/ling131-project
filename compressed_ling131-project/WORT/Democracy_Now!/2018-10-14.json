H. O. report on October second Fifteen were from known transmission chains but exposures for fourteen other people were still being investigated\nWhen health workers find cases with no known links to other patients they suspect that bowl that is circulating on detected in parts of the affected area\nPosing a high risk further spread\nDelays in case reporting ongoing discovery of infections and security concerns are hampering contact tracing and investigation of possible illnesses\nThe W. H. O. N. partners are supporting the DR the ministry of health efforts to strengthen response measures in order of priority these include\nSpots coordination surveillance contact tracing laboratory capacity infection prevention and control measures\nClinical management of patients vaccination risk communication and the community engagement psycho social support safe and dignified burials cross borders the valiant surveillance and preparedness activities in neighboring provinces and countries\nThat W. H. L. reported that one of the new cases is a plumber from the United nations organization stabilization mission\nAnd the D I see him and his co who was working at the outbreak coordination headquarters in Benny they found that he had stayed at the center of the traditional healer where earlier confirmed Ebola patient\nHad done before she was taken to a treatment center\nThe ... response team was vaccinated and the center disinfected the primary has been hospitalized and in a bowl of treatment centers in semi\nIn most places that concrete I'll go to a a landfill or be broken up for road base or something we bring it in to the sites are we've arranged a barge ing operation to bring it to our side the barge so we're not\nTaking these heavy materials on the roads with trucks or anything like that\nAndy in our process we extract the calcium out of the concrete and what's left when we do that is\nThe original rock and aggregate that was in the country\nWhich can also be up cycled and reuse a as a recycled materials in structural concrete which is really exciting 'cause right now in the bay area in California we bring a lot of Iraq down from British Columbia a because there's a shortage of sand and gravel\nSo in addition to extracting the calcium from the the old concrete that otherwise would have ended up in a landfill\nProbably in we release and liberate the sand and gravel than was originally in it and are able to reuse that again and instead of having to go out and mine it and have a open pit mining transport rock into the bay area long distance where we can\nRecycle the by product\nOf a of our calcium source which is the old concrete it's really up cycling it um\nBut the main products were making is the carbon sequester in limestone which is made from the CEO to that came from the flu gas from the power plant that would have gone into the atmosphere combined with the calcium we extracted a to make another type of aggregate which is a limestone aggregate so that's\nThat's an example of one of the projects that uh we're we're developing locally here to develop the blue planet technology and make this solution available\nYou're also doing some work in mosques landings down to San Francisco\nWith California's largest power plant ...\nYeah I I built a [noise] I guess what was the largest carbon sequestration plant in the world are about ten years ago at the mosque landing power plant and um and uh now with the second generation of blue planet we we may go back down there as well um sometime in the future and\nReestablish the carbon operation there uh the plan I built their ten years ago made a calcium carbonate sequestered cement a CEO to sequester getting calcium carbonate what we're doing blue planet is making the the rock component of concrete which we call aggregate\nRight in the mosque planning one used sea water right maybe you could explain some other differences between the two technologies\nWell the the most fundamental differences or the color a plant that I built down it much landing starting in two thousand seven [noise] sort of two thousand ten made cement and it made a replacement\nFor Portland cement which is some any component of concrete in a like I was saying concrete about uh ten\nPercent Portland cement and then the rest is sand and gravel and a blue planet we're focused just on the sand and gravel because it's a much larger component there's only about three or four billion tons of Portland cement manufactured every year but like I was saying there's about fifty\nFive billion tons of rock mind an open mind several years since we really want to make a significant impact in carbon sequestration of carbon removal it's going to be with the rock component of of concrete uh but\nThe differences are also um with blue planet or were able to access the calcium in the community and natural rocks in materials like concrete which we called geo mess a with a clearer system\nWe developed in electro chemical methodology to create our community from water by splitting a sodium chloride into starting my drug side in it\nYou see 'em and like you said uh we were located on the water coal natural gas plant and we had access to the water there and we extracted the calcium\nFrom the seawater in that particular site where it's up at the planet and um we were using demolished concrete as our calcium source in or out community source\nNow when you're talking about what you're doing you're working with other companies and you're providing you or know how and knowledge of prophecies or is there some physical technology that you're providing\nWell from a business model point of view there's sort of two extremes one extreme is what we're doing up\nHere at the a power plant up in Pittsburgh where we\nFormed a separate company it's called San Francisco bay aggregate in San Francisco bay aggregate um is I'm an independent operating company it\nBrings in the food gas from the power plant um can utilize other utilities like steam and electricity for example cooling water from the power plant [noise]\nUm it brings in a demolished\nConcrete the barge from you know San Francisco and other places where there's a lot of building in demolition\nGoing on 'em and um it's an independent entity which I'm then sells the aggregate that's made\nTo concrete producers and there were three or four\nMajor concrete producers around the bay area we would there's one we've been working with in particular that has about a third of the market share of the concrete in the bay area they've done parts of the bay bridge there are fairly significant concrete producer and so there are off take her on the rock\nThe other extreme is a strange license so in that case were licensing the patented technology\nTo the uh emitter of CEO too and I'm worried by saying are there\nEngineering for German and construction group on what to build how to operate it um how to find the right markets for the rock how to find the right in coming to you know mess you know raw materials in the in in that's a different kind of relationship where\nWe're receiving a royalty and providing a service to them\nAnd can you give us an idea of any similar projects in terms of trying to either sequester carbon in the\nAsphalt and concrete making process or other environmentally conscious steps that are going into it for example the recycling of of concrete is something we hear a lot about\nYeah that's a that's a really interesting area you know right now especially in Europe and more so\nEvery day here in the United states or you know people in the recycling world are realizing the largest Massa material being recycled this country you know if I say take the city of San Francisco and I ask you if if\nHow much does the city of San Francisco way uh and and what percentage of that mass is concrete and what would you say\nI Would say at ways one trillion tons and eight hundred billion tons of that is concrete\nYou know that that's about the rights ratio and I'm really so literally just pulled out of nowhere but okay [laughter]\nIt fits are familiar friends\nRight I mean we know concrete savvy and we know it's the most use building materials so when you build a sales force power you know you had to remove a whole lot of concrete and um [noise] that country and had to be trucked out of their taken across the hey we're bridge which is really difficult with big heavy trucks in in our case\nThat that country coming from San Francisco is going to go on barges go right up to Pittsburgh\nAnd um [noise]\nYou know normally a with\nConcrete they just mechanically crush it up into what's called one it's minus rock and you know concrete can be highly variable\nAnd it's sort of powdery and not very strong when you break it up like that and so it's used in what's called minor concrete or non structural concrete\nOr road base and it's sold for maybe six dollars a ton or something you know very low by contrast and we bring in this all the old demolished concrete instead of recycling were upside\nClient meaning we're we're turning to do more valuable product what happens is when it goes through our extraction process where we extract the calcium and oxide out of it when we're left with is the original sand\nOr gravel that was in the original concrete but now it has all the variable and low density powdery weak areas completely dissolved away\nAnd you have a hard endure rated high quality aggregate that can be no used as an up cycled\nMaterial and structural concrete and so for example the city and county San Francisco currently requires about twenty percent recycled\nConcrete in the minor concrete in in their departments are like San Francisco\nAirport is one of the departments and with the blue planet re meat we call it a re mediated aggregate we can use a hundred percent of it as structural in structural concrete and and that's really significant you know right now the state of California\nProjects we need about\nTwelve billion tons of rock over the next", "show_name": "Democracy Now!", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "14"}
