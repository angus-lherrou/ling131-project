least had some people fear that the expansion of slavery would continue and not just in the new states but perhaps even into old states where slavery at all already been abolished and I'm Talking about to other things\nAlong with the Kansas Nebraska act that being the fugitive slave act of Eighteen fifty and then the Dred Scott decision of Eighteen fifty seven\nThose are both very very critical um then of course we're not just talking about states in the East that had one sad slavery and gotten rid of it but states like Ohio where we never had slavery um where the slaves slavery was barred from here under the um um\nOriginal northwest ordinance right back going back to the Seventeen eighties but [noise] the fugitive slave act\nUm is making it is it's not the first fugitive slave act with what this one is isn't intended to put more teeth into it it makes northern community is responsible to catch in return runaway slaves now runaway slave\nCan basically be anyone that a slave holder or one or their representatives identifies as a run away and then the in theory they're going to be taken back to the south and the situation will be decided there\nOf course it's it's it's fraught with possibilities of a individual injustice and so on but what it particularly does is it makes northern community is directly responsible\nFor the implementation of laws that they decided not to half of the maintain an institution that they had decided not to maintain slavery was an expensive institution in some ways you had to maintain a mechanism for running down runaway slaves them for keeping control of slaves and while\nI'm someplace like Mississippi or Alabama the people that were non slave holders didn't have much of a voice\nAnd this and they were sort of a I'm compelled to pay taxes and serving the militias and so on and do the service of maintaining the institution of slavery people in the north didn't so there was a tremendous resistance to returning fugitive slaves\nI think this divided all northern communities some more than others and there were a number of a tremendous incidents that took place in the north where I think\nStarting among free blacks among African Americans who are not and slaves in the north recognize that this was a a direct attack on their security in their homes\nOr would actively engage and resistance to slave holders there were a number of rather striking incidents not in Kansas but even before Kansas where there weren't violent alpha outbreaks of northern cities\nTo prevent the seizure and the return of runaway slaves sound more successful\nUh the Glover case in Milwaukee for example and some like uh the burns I'm Anthony Burns in Boston were not successful at least not initially\nBut what he did do is it basically took the question of slavery and put it right on the streets of\nBoston or Philadelphia or New York in a way that um made it something less than an abstract question\nThat was really no way that the government authorities had of dealing with this the fugitive slave law was bipartisan and it was something that the federal authorities generally agreed upon for good reason they again they needed to maintain the old structure the stability of the of the two parties\nAnd that meant placate English south\nThen the the Roger tiny Supreme Court justice I asked Eighteen fifty seven rules and the Dred Scott decision that tried Scott who who was a slave in Missouri had escaped to other states only did he have to be returned\nRoger tiny also ruled that blacks whether free or not ... we're not citizens and people solve this\nAs a step towards and maybe a subsequent ruling that they would see in the future of allowing slavery in all states well Dred Scott was actually belong to a doctor from St Louis who had\nAt one point moved into Illinois and in ... lived in Illinois which is a free state state that didn't have slavery\nAnd Dred Scott lived with a doctor in Illinois for a while and then they went to the Wisconsin Territory when it was still a federal territory and still under the federal\nRule that they were not going to have slavery they're so Dred Scott based on having residents in in a free state and residency and a federal territory when they went back to Missouri\nAnd the doctor died Dred Scott sued for his freedom is an interesting story behind is the the local anti slavery people had already raised the money to make sure that they would be able to buy Dred Scott is freedom but they were trying to make a a test case of this and the courts\nAnd there was an extremely interesting while on it went to the court in St Louis which ruled in favor of Dred Scott\nSo they appealed it to the state Supreme Court in Missouri in the state Supreme Court\nRuled in favor of the widow ruled against Dred Scott so it went to the federal circuit court in the end they ruled in favor of Dred Scott so it goes to the U.S Supreme Court this is traumatic it's not quite something that's covered by twenty four seven cable by people that were following this understood the significance of it\nUm by the time it got to the high court Roger Chinese or a rolling his his decision on this set explicitly as you pointed out that no black man in America has any rights that a white man is bound by law to respect and that is a national\nDecision so in theory the Dred Scott decision allows\nSay southern travelers\nWho want to bring their slaves on a on a trip into the north New York city or Philadelphia are you know wouldn't be able to bring their slaves with them there were several northern states that at all\nAlready explicitly passed laws saying that if you brought a slave say to Pennsylvania and the slave decided that they didn't want to remain a slave that they had a right to walk away at that point and that the um local authorities would support them in that [noise]\nSo that's essentially is trumping all sorts of state laws it does open the door to the presence of slavery as a national institution\nMark laws as a professor of history at the University of Cincinnati and he's the author of the book a long road Harpers Ferry the rise of the first American Left\nAnd you're back to the pledge rap we we will be here for just five minutes timid timing us four minutes fifty five seconds ago it's Tim behind the counter making us all bring your voice

FM that orgy hit the delete button and then click all in your whole big ... empty into our treasury\nLet's hear from you folks\nCan you talk to me more about the relationship of the radical abolitionist it's party and the formation of the Republican Party a party that was formed to take on the slate power from the south yet there was agitation and I think we'd even recognize in today's post\nIt takes people who didn't think the Republican Party would go far enough in their opposition to slavery\nThe the actual history of the Republican Party is very amusing that sort of like a talking about where the origins of the pledge of allegiance or from right that the pledge of allegiance to something by\nFrancis Bellamy the brother of Edward Bellamy the great socialist writer from the Eighteen nineties the Republican Party is in and if you go back to the early history of the party it's described as\nBeginning in a place called rep in Wisconsin\nIn Eighteen I'm fifty four and an immediate reaction to the Kansas Nebraska act\nThe a gentleman who chaired those meetings was a man named Alvin ... day there was a radical from New York one of the leaders of the national reform association the land reform movement sort of political allies socialist\n... chair those meetings but interestingly enough ripping itself until a few years earlier was known by the name was arrest go\nIt was a socialist community\nAnd the founding meetings that the Republican Party are described as consisting of about half of women and it's not surprising that it's coming out of this I'm a radical community where people had been critical very critical of the dynamic of the two parties for some time [noise]\nSo their call for a Republican Party immediately echoes alone that network of people who had been involved in abolitionist our land reform third party movements the actual launching other Republicans as a national party\nTakes about two years and when it gets back to New York for example many people will later save it the wigs basically transformed into the Republican such great over simplification\nBut the wigs in places like New York actually decide that they're going to join this new\nAnti Nebraska party at the end and it sounds like you're hostile to Nebraska but what they mean is there a hostile to the Kansas Nebraska act and that's really the core of what becomes the Republican Party than nominated a John C. Freemont for president in Eighteen fifty six\nThe radical abolitionist\nI don't really try to remain independent of the Republicans not only in fifty six but in in Eighteen fifty eight and even in Eighteen ... debut the Republicans as being very compromised by the acceptance of slavery in the south where it exists\nAnd the radical abolitionists are also raising questions like the black codes segregation basically what we would call Jim Crow after the civil war I'm as they existed in northern communities\nWell it happened to two women with the formation of the Republican Party and and again as as we saw the attention put on for women rights maybe women suffrage ah with the radical abolitionists\nA woman always played a big role mommy radical abolitionist in fact some of the ones that we do know about is as associated with them or Elizabeth Cady Stanton and um and Susan B. Anthony\nAnd the Republican Party women don't play any kind of a role beyond what you would expect in any any political party of that time\nAlthough it's generally understood and believed by the advocates of women's suffrage for example that Abraham Lincoln another leading Republicans are sympathetic to them when Lincoln first ran for office state legislature back in the Eighteen thirties uh he actually raised the question of women's suffrage\nIn his first campaign which he lost", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Democracy Now!", "city": "Madison", "day": "02"}
