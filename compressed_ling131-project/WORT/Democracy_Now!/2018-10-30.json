assisting are members of this um you know a migrant group that is seeking asylum\nAnd he posted a saying they are ah people who are just you know living in on doors\nCourt being recruited by Soros and given a cash incentive to join a the caravan and that's not at all what the video is up and there's no evidence to support that theory at all if anything I'm you know this uh\nThis whole um a

lie\nRight I mean who's the you the EU is everybody who was not a a white Christian male or not even Christian ah ... it because some of the neo Nazis or actually kind of pagan\nI'm paying brace old Norse gods because I guess those are the very white gods but anyway\nI just do bad ... not necessarily inherently racist or anything but she don't know\nRight right it's it's pretty pretty pretty fundamental to all you know cultural mythology is right it's it's got all of those hero stories that\nTo it so yeah yeah it's it's it's just you know I was here with my colleague Jared hot halt yesterday in the office\nIn Washington DC as you know we kept getting new reports of these bombings or not bombings but a bomb deliveries or we think they're bombs or we don't know if they're bombs and you know we're sitting here and\nThey're they're launching may not look like they're bombs\nYeah I mean the threat with poor explicit right um and you know we watch this stuff every day piles and piles of it ah Jared covers the neo Nazis and they All right\nUm and yet we were rocked by it you know it was like you were you feel like you're kind of watching a movie [noise] um when you're watching all of this stuff happened and then all of a sudden it's very very very real\nYeah I watch it because I get when I get ready in the morning I I Do have CNN on and I watch them fold with their fire alarm going off and everything live blues pretty surreal at the moment I'm Adele standing or are you observing how the far right is is reacting to all this\nOh yes we have a post a up at right wing watch uh that chronicles how the right has responded to the bombing issue the the the bomb that perhaps bombs having been\nSend it to all of these top level democratic officials including a former president um [noise]\nAnd it there it everybody has pretty much the same narrative that it's a false flag that also that yeah that progressive have planted this that left us a client at these bombs that it's all a distraction from\nThe quote unquote caravan that it's you know it's it's they take absolutely\nNo responsibility of course for any of the rhetoric that may have been inspired ... percent these um devices are around\nUm and but it's all about how you know this is the thing ... it Trump has been so brilliant and detaching his base from a anybody else's notion of reality but his own\nThat you know you can say this this is you know this isn't the Alex Jones mentality right they\nInfowars mentality you call something um that is a challenging through your world view you hang the false flag or a pen on it\nAnd they'll stand I Know and every time we talk about this issue especially concerning the protocols of The Elders of Zion and we're talking about right wing conspiracy theories here but I've heard it on the left before to oh I'm not surprised when I get emails I always get emails whenever we talk about this thing saying oh you you well\nYou know anti Semitism is not um limited to any one kind of a political ideology and I do believe that and and when you get to I'm a ... and ... and all political\nIdeologies have their um you know proponents of conspiracy theory of you know everybody's looking for a unified field theory for why things are the way that they are and when you have a\nMiniature that has been circulating presented centuries it's it's not surprising that a chip pop up and all kinds of places um nonetheless does that mean that the left has some you know\nSome account to take of uh anti Semitism within its own ranks you bet without a doubt\nAnd it gets complicated right because uh because of the way that people who oppose uh you know the policy of the current government in Israel um you know a are painted as anti Semite and you know [laughter]\nAnd uh so so so it becomes very very complicated but nonetheless um I Do think we all have\nA moral obligation to you know listen carefully when we're hearing um critiques that same conspiratorial\nMy I think we could be against apartheid well also not being anti Semitic\nOh right right right right yeah well I mean it's a [noise]\nUm that the you know it's one of those semantic I'm a arguments that can be twisted you know do 'em by one side or the other and\nUm you know with people who are proponents of the net and Yahoo government a policy uh against Palestinians you know are going to hurl the anti Semite to um uh [noise]\nUm that would help for the Republican Party and the Senate um and that would provide consistent spending Congress\nAnd so um it's I think we talked about the rural small state bias of a of a sudden it was an accident in a better House Republicans as as an accident but certainly not [noise] um and so what we're left with right now is a Senate not where [noise] thirty days probably say that the Republican Party\nGenerally um and twenty states lean democratic and so in in an average election year in a neutral environment where we're not in a neutral environment right now thanks to the president [noise] um but in a neutral environment Republicans without a decisive advantage I'm In the U.S at an all US Senate election in terms of who controls majority\nSo if we look at the next thirty or forty years American history and you extrapolate our current trends um you know Democrats\nWill only control the Senate when when something really bad happens on the Republican rural and um then it's another thing that we have to address within the confines of the constitution\nBecause the constitution was very clear that equal representation of a sudden it cannot be amended or without the consent of the states uh who's equal representation being taken away yeah we're right on the ball so we have to think about other ways to address the Democrats an la structural deficit and the Senate\nSide how do you do that in the Senate with us in a way you could create more fish [laughter] legal and yeah a\nPuerto Rico Washington DC I'm you know these are these are all these are places to live in American citizens for credit American citizens who have no voting representation in Congress um so that's six hundred fifty thousand there seven hundred thousand people in the sea or you know two point seven million and Puerto Rico I'm\nNo you know they know representatives in Washington I think in in the case\nBecause Puerto Rico in particular over the last year we we see the consequences of no one in Washington I think the answer to the people of Puerto Rico um and so if if the book is full of the things that are\nAnd you you create you create those Puerto Rico in Washington DC into into states and then what you end up having is most likely me and I have to have an election but pretty good chance you can ask for additional Democratic senators\nAbsolutely I mean I like the people we had done nothing to do than I Am a democratic controlled Senate right now we're not control the Senate with a ... Democrats but the election abductions and all that if we we all like we have for Democratic senators out of those two chairs\nHow easy is it to create a new state though\nA very ... [laughter] uh you know it's an act of Congress signed by the president so\nUm how about the bill the Senate ... president finds it and presto Sanjay state\nSo I guess you had to get rid of the filibuster first\nThat yeah that's another place where the filibuster is it's not going to be friends and so were you know the book takes place in a in a sort of a fantasy world where Democrats have recaptured unified our in DC and twenty Twenty one I'm which is possible\nBecause it's a very different electoral map in the Senate come twenty twenty\n[noise] it is yeah it's not as good as I think people think it is but it was better than this year um yeah and so it's it's actually really important that we not lose more than a year or two in the Senate this year um because it's not\nSuper plausible to me that we're going to gain more than\nA screaming for free it's in the Senate and twenty twenty so we need to stay within striking distance but yeah\nI'm so piece of legislation\nAnd create a new state um DC in Puerto Rico popular referendum I'm endorsing statehood so we know that is what the people at these places while I'm actually originally to hold another one it's sort of a long story but\nUm at least in DC is it's very very clear what the role of the voters as um and so there's a minor constitutional issue with D.C about um the sort of the capital districts needed to be administered by Congress um\nBecause you just you know you shrink the capital district um to the Capitol building and Supreme Court and the rest of D.C becomes the state\nYou know new Colombia or whatever you want to call it um they you know for\nFor sort of existing D.C city government what will become the legislature and governor will be some sort of a mayor or governor [laughter] so it's not a complicated you know what I mean you know\nHow many times in the class this is different route to becoming a state [noise] um do you see in Puerto Rico are pursuing versions of the Tennessee where\nUm where do you see sort of a new state constitution you'll elect representatives in D.C has a lot of senators who have no power [laughter] ... senators but the part of the Tennessee slam where do you sort of created talks on the ground in the ... Congress to give you stay on\nLet me just ask you one last question here um because you also write about expanding the number of judges that are in the Supreme Court\nThat that that that was considered once before by Franklin D Roosevelt too was worded\nOr early on and many of those new deal programs\nUh Franklin Roosevelt were a floated the idea of expanding or how many judges end up you know in putting more judges until you'd have a majority to support his programs are on the court that eventually do would be opposed by many including including Democrats\nYeah you know it's a very I'm really fascinating period in our history and I think a story of a little bit more complicated than than it's commonly understood I mean I think that we we think of that now you know what about the our biggest mistakes you know maybe not up there with concerning the Japanese but uh no not as kind of on it but\nI think many calling court packing it's not necessarily a favorable term\nYeah I like to call it an inherent court appointment techniques um\n[noise]\nI think the uh in the Arctic and I think is is that as a new deal struck down by the court\nUm and uh so he has to scan but what the you know anybody that's over Seventy it on the court who doesn't require a he got out of justice like we're not actually what out of six justices to the court and so what what is a little bit of a new one with lots of history here so it's not as congressional alley actually willing to us\nFewer seats in that under different plan um for the Senate majority leader Joe Joe Robinson you meddle with Roosevelt and it's like look\nYou know six six justices that why is there is crazy like to do two to three\nYou know I I think that actually FDR could have gotten his way if he'd had a little bit less crazy of a plan you know to almost double the size of the Supreme Court [noise] um and the whole thing became moot anyway and when when the existing just started\nA sort of unexpectedly accept to uphold a piece of the new deal about the place in like the minimum wage laws for instance so I'm thinking that was because of the threat of expanding the court\nThis is another little wrinkle All right I mean they get a call up at switching nine we can find that said nine\nAt that that they you know the threat of this I'm On a cause some conservatives to switch their vote but a\nLot of those that are devoted already been taking a ... that's the key case that that has this the signal that this was happening on the boat taken a celebrations that already happened by the time but FDR made this threat which was secret you know like nobody knew what he was going to do that so I think there's some historical evidence to suggest that\nThat they would have which any way um\nYou know that at least one of them had a had a change of heart [laughter] um so anyway\nI I think that it's up to the sort of take away here it is not that it is that it's not impossible you know that I think that there are\nThere are scenarios under which FDR could have added chocolates as to their core um without it being remembered as a total failure um in in in our case in the in the modern era\nYou know I think that this was a case where Democrats really do have to offer a compromise before they pursue something I'm at the truck business quirk that there's a there's a bipartisan compromise that's that's\nA potentially bipartisan compromises floating out there on spin out there for a long time there's an organization called six the court that pushed the version of this law um and it would it would end lifetime tenure on the Supreme Court I'm\nSo does this look at Eighteen year terms in the medical like sort of a politics improving part of business but every president what you have to ... to a point to Johnson\nIn court for more years so in the first and third year you'd go to school and everything on the court or the oldest you know the oldest justice would not old at the time age wise but the the judges who'd been on a court the longest would retire and you get to rip you place them with a new one or what the new law so that would really\nSort of elimination zero stone character up our court appointments um\nAnd it's sort of like reduce temperatures I think it like this is I think one of the potentially one of the most important American political reforms that's out there is a bipartisan constitutional and I'm not\nI'm too I might contender on of course but I don't think Republicans are going to go for it like I don't think they're going to be in the mood to accept that compromise in in our fantasy world is twenty Twenty one now don't you get to replenish their their majority\nRight exactly I mean so from their perspective it's like okay let's say in this fantasy world\nUm Ginsburg and Breyer survive [laughter] ... somebody Twenty one and we're looking at a five for court um you know maybe Thomas has died down to end it replaced by somebody younger maybe Alito stepped down as replaced by somebody younger um and so in in that\nCase you don't have a ... you have a new Democratic president a democratic legislature who may be looking at an entire you know a year or two terms in an office\nChasing a conservative dominated Supreme Court um that's that's extremely already proven itself to be extremely hostile progressive policies\nAnd so to me the choice is like you know you have to do something about the core what have you done for years talking Medicare for all and seeing it I'm struck down by the Supreme Court", "year": "2018",
