E. D. D.\nRed is one of the opposite mechanisms that's part of cap and trade and here's how it works [noise] see used up all of your carbon credits and you need more well you can protect a bunch of force in the global south forest which is in danger of being cut down [noise]\n\nCutting down forests is sad because it's a carbon sink so far been thinks is a way of saying that trees naturally hold carbon dioxide because of course as we learned in basic biology class trees stake in carbon dioxide\nAnd release oxygen and that's how you and I are able to read\nThat get the button the guard for friends of the earth international so because you're protecting forest which actively pulls carbon from the air you get an offset you get an extra carbon credit [noise]\nDeforestation is a major driver of climate change so stopping it is good right\nWhereas it's actually not what it does is it encourages\n... in the global north factories and refineries\nTo continue burning fossil fuels\nWhy they pretend to save a forest somewhere else in the world and that compensation that active compensation or offset is what is meant to be okay for the refinery here to continue for Newton\nThen there's this question of what protecting the forest even means\nSort of read is actually driving land grabbing and forests grabbing and resource grabbing inside them countries because they will forests that local communities indigenous people used to live by for many many many many years\nAnd all of a sudden now there's a fence around it they're getting fines for going into a treat to repair their houses and why is that because\nThere has to be this pretense of saving that far has to be able to say that it compensates for the faucet feel activity in the not legally and morally it's the rich countries that have the historical responsibility for climate change I Need to be the ones that are stepping up [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] okay so you've heard about the problems with carbon markets in red and cap and trade so now let's look at solutions and well each community will have its own answer to the climate crisis there is one solution I heard over and over again and energy transition isn't simply about renewables\nIt's about making sure that those who have been a bird and at the intersection of poverty and pollution and environmental racism or actually a first in line to benefit from the renewable energy economy\nIt means creating pathways and opportunities for the workers whose livelihoods have been linked to\nUh the extractive economy and how to find some place to thrive in a new economy that was Sheena Robbins in from the Asian Pacific environmental network\nAnd so that means smaller scale solar projects or other renewable projects what we really want to see is more local and community owned energy resources\nSmall scale solar and local and community on al ... says together these ideas could revolutionize how we consume energy\nSo the first ingredient community owned [noise] usually the power companies by energy from power plants are solar farms and then they sell us that energy\nSo there's a way that we can buy the energy ourselves\nThrough something called a C. C. A. CCAs stance for community choice aggregation that's Jessica Tovar from the local clean energy alliance I guess a less fancier where it would be like pulling like when you ... for example so people get together and\nAct as their own company and then you can choose where to buy energy don't want dirty energy don't buy\nIt you can buy clean energy instead in a sea ca you get to choose\nThis model has already started an Alameda County in northern California now they did a early launched this summer and then I think a full launched this fall and so they will provide Alameda County with\nDifferent levels of green energy so it's like a certain percentage all the way up to one hundred percent renewable energy here's the second ingredient locally produced so you've got the buying power now where do you find the energy [noise] what about those big solar panel\nFarms and the desert when no one lives you know but the truth is people live in the desert there's wildlife that lives in the desert Flora and fauna there's you know so you're still destroying that ecosystem and we're trying to really emphasize you know that local is better and we need to start doing that now [noise]\nLocal is better in this case\nWe mean locally produced energy through solar panels hook to something called a micro written a micro ... uses infrastructure already in the ground so you do have to pay a small fee to use it but you're micro British autonomous and can be turned on and off without affecting the whole municipal system Wall Street\nFor example has its own generators and during Hurricane Sandy\nWhen the power went out in New York Wall Street\nStayed in business kept their lights on and that's the kind of resiliency that we need\nArt community forget Wall Street right like if there's a disaster like that we need that kind of infrastructure\nHere we are pushing for a micro great in Chinatown for example which is an evacuation site for downtown but is not great resilient yet and there are a number of community health clinics elementary schools libraries that could be real community centers in the case of a climate disaster\nAnd this hyper local model could create new jobs in my mind imagine Alameda County or whatever county live in an imagine all the commercial building all the municipal buildings and then all the housing and multi family kind of building\nSolar rice when you look at\nSolar in that way\nThat's a large project that's a long term job this kind of vision this kind of model it's the first of its kind and it's because of organizing\nIt is visionary and so far the model isn't is testing phase and there are some potential issues corruption is a possibility but advocates say that that can be avoided when people get involved with their CCAs to make sure that their democratic and transparent\nThe larger problem they say is that the utility companies aren't exactly happy about CCAs are committed he choice aggregation\nI feel like every year dealing with the the legislature there's always a bill and there's always some kind of gotten him and and sneaky language that gets thrown in that hinders or attempts to hinder community traits programs\nCurrently in northern central California Pacific gas and electric is trying to raise the exit fee that is if you pay if you leave their system if they raise enough most people can't afford to leave Pacific gas and electric\nIn order to join a C.
