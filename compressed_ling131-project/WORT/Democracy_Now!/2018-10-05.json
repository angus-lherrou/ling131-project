been doing and talking about both in our was calling him Brazil's Trump\nWhich drastically and radically under state's the case he's much closer to say do tear teen Philippines or even generals to see in Egypt both in terms of what he intends to do and wants to do and what he's able to do given the fragility of Brazil which has been extremely young democracy that exited\nA military dictatorship only thirty three years ago and therefore doesn't have the same kind of institutions to limit what someone would want to do the way say the United states or or the u._k. would so it's an extremely dangerous\nMoment for this country um polls do show that he's unlikely to win in the first round on Sunday but there is a possibility that he made that he could actually just get fifty percent of the

it\nDry I met with a whip Noam Chomsky after that meeting or in some polo and we talked a lot about the dynamics that brought us to this point and one of the things we focus most on during our discussion was the fact of the dynamic is so similar\nTo what's happening in the U.S the u._k. and and and in Western Europe where you see the spread of extremism and this rise of right wing\nFanaticism and the media outlets and the establishment factions that have laid the groundwork for its rise refused to take any responsibility and that's definitely the case here in Brazil\nWhere
