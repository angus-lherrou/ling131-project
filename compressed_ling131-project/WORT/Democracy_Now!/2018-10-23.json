I'm very happy to welcome to our radio program Daniel zip black Daniels zip lab studies Europe or from the nineteenth century all the way to the president\nHe's the author of several books including conservative parties and the birth of democracy and he's also author of another book that we're going to be in conversation about that has been co written with Stephen Lipinski\nIs called how democracies died this will be a continuing part of our conversation about what this moment and political time means and what it may mean moving after this moment or has passed for our political\nInstitutions Daniels ... is my very good pleasure of working in the program yeah thank you it's great to be talking to you good to have you\nI imagine the reason for the publication of this book right now how democracies die is just not a coincidence about what's happening in our political world right now I I imagine that this is also purposely even though I Know this is something new and your coauthor or had been studying before\nA two thousand sixteen a presidential election but I I imagine our current state of affairs also is a big part of this\nYeah you ... we both are are people who have spent our career studying other countries not the United states we we work together both as professors\nOf political science at Harvard I study Europe as you mentioned my coauthor is mostly spent his life studying\nLatin America and other developing democracies we've taught together um and we've known each other for Fifteen Years been colleagues and then as the election was unfolding in two thousand Fifteen thousand sixteen you know we kept running to eat in to each other in the hallway and and noting that uncanny parallels between the countries we had studied in the tenor of the\nI'm ... so that that's you know that's an important\nBut I think at at at a deeper level you know one of the things that we think gave rise to the to the Trump presidency and the kind of deeper hills in our political system that we think will last summer or an intense levels of polarization\nAnd norm erosion and so I'm happy to talk a bit more about that but you know at some level you know as Americans have increasingly come to fear and loathe each other across the political aisle this makes it harder and harder to solve basic problems that we can front\nAnd also runs the risk of escalating politics to make it more and more dysfunctional and so people become more and more tolerant of alternative kinds of solutions to to to solve our problems um you know one one survey that we cited in the book um you know in the Nineteen sixties there was a survey done which asked\nA Democrats and Republicans you know how would you be disappointed or how would you feel if you're um or your child married somebody the other political party and only five percent around five to ten percent of Americans have each party said they would be particularly disappointed are upset\nAt today that number is over fifty percent you know so there's this incredible at a very existential level of kind of animosity across party lines and that makes it incredibly hard to get normal politics done\nAnd also a you know escalates the kind of the tenor of our politics as well and again that we know we think that certainly proceeded began you know we date that going back to the Nineteen nineties\nUm and it will probably outlast a President Trump no matter how long these in office\n... principal figure in in the polarization that we see today that people will point to Newt Gingrich would you agree with that\nYeah so we in our in our book you know we we uh highlight the beginning of this I mean we we make the case and you know people may disagree with this but you know based on our investigations of this we make the case that\nI'm just began really in the Nineteen nineties with the with the Gingrich ah take back of Congress Republican take back of Congress you know it's very very self consciously or the ... Gingrich and Republicans I mean he in many ways the you know he didn't invent this he was responding to what he saw a potential opportunity with deepening polarization and\nHe responded very effectively but he you know very quickly you know ... it encouraged\n... other Republican congressmen to accuse the other side of not loving America of hating the flag and all of this kind of rhetoric\nWhich then escalates politics and make both sides more fearful of each other because the other side's an enemy than you are going to use more of a kind of hardball tactics to regain power to hold on to power and so you know we regard the\nUh you know they are very partisan impeachment of Bill Clinton I'm as part of this increase of the filibuster which has really exploded or in this period and you know and it's both sides though you know at the beginning and the and this is kind of a dangerous cycle that countries get into where you know once one side begins to act without what we call forbearance or self restraint\nThen it becomes increasingly tempting for the other side to act in the same way so it's that during the early ... years\nOr if the Democrats control the Senate also use the the the Senate filibuster to block a judicial nominations and so each side you know now has something to to blame the other side um and you get into this kind of spiral and again looking at other countries around the world we see once countries get into the spirals very hard to get out of\nYeah when when one side I guess we'd say pushes the envelope and does something that might be legal or within the rules yet controversial and and seen against perhaps\nDecorum usually the other side ends up doing it as well in math and it escalates and and I know we've seen that and I think it's a little butter\nOr what's happened to the changes of the filibuster as it is a good example of that the issue over polarization and we have this notion I think post World war two\nMaybe all the way up to just pre Newt Gingrich years ... well you know I mean do you get started I guess in the late seventies and hunger is but uh maybe let's just say to the eighties um of Congress working well up strong bipartisanship\nBut there are there I've heard of historians argue that actually that period of time first post World war two up till maybe Nineteen Ninety it's actually an anomaly in American history that that if you look at other periods of our history there there was also hyper partisanship going on in Congress\nYeah no that's we make we traced that out in in the book I mean one of so we regard these kind of norms of what we call that the two norms we identify the book that have been critical for American democracy if you look at the U.S constitution I should just say it's a very ...\nDocument the written rules are actually incredibly ... what makes our system work in large part\nAre these unwritten rules and the two unwritten rules the norms as as we call them are one mutual toleration where you regard the other side as not an enemy but it's simply a rival not somebody you fear and load but somebody may disagree with vehemently but you regard as simply arrive will probably has a right to govern\nThe second big norm that we talk about that as as really mattered a lot in American history is this normal for parents where even if you have a constitutional right or legal right to use power and a certain way so for instance you could you know president can pardon anybody wants he or she wants the filibuster can be used at any point\nUm you know you can block any Supreme Court nomination for president can a pack the Supreme Court there's no limit on the number of Supreme Court justices but the stuff hasn't happened in an American through much of American history because there's been a norm that even when you were in power you need to act with suffer strengths in order for the system to survive\nAnd so in terms of you know where where are these no one's come from have they always been present you know certainly the American American democracy was not born with the student with these two ... I mean we called the ... us off guard rails of democracy\nUm and you know if you look at the Seventeen nineties you know the central us and the Republicans despise each other in each thought the other side was a representative a foreign power the Republicans thought the federal is love Britain yes right exactly and this this is exactly politics without gargoyles I mean you at a constitution but without these norms\nAnd you know and and over the course of the early Nineteen century there was a period of stabilization but this came undone again during the course of the civil war and the lead up to the civil war I mean there were stabbings and fights on the floor of a U.S Congress you know before the civil war fighting began\nUm then you know is the period you know through reconstruction there was a major effort to democratize American politics um you know through after the U.S civil war and in franchise African Americans in the south I'm this all\nCame on done beginning in the seventies but really in the nineties and beginning really roughly between in the beginning of the twentieth century and through the Nineteen fifties sixties seventies eighties ... this is kind of basic to norms were were ...\nNow one of the points that we make in the book and this is in some sense of kind of tragic history that we have because the moments when these norms come undone these norms which we think are actually really critical for democracy are in periods where I'm Rick race has been moved removed from the political agenda me part part of the reason that\nAn ... done during the period of of the civil war is there was a major effort to democratize America\nUm and race came onto the agenda um when reconstruction failed so when this major experiment the democratization failed at that point suddenly or you had southern white Democrats who were representing a authoritarian system in the U.S south able to cooperate with northern Republicans\nAnd this system remained intact through the sixties and so I think in many ways what we're experiencing today a since the passage of the civil rights act in the voting rights act in the mid nineties sixties which were major efforts and successful effort to democratize American politics\nUm ... what we've seen is a kind of backlash against us in which are now these norms are under assault again and so the the the challenges that we face as a democracy is how do we\nAre both maintain our democratic system in our main maintain our commitment them a multiethnic democracy and at the same time maintain these norms which are are are which are very hard to sustain and that's really the challenge we face\nWe're in conversation with Daniels ... studies Europe from Nineteen century to the very present is author of several books including conservative parties and the birth of democracy\nHe's author of another book that were in conversation about that is co written with Stephen ... it is called\nHow democracies die for our listeners in the San Francisco bay area Daniel ... will have a few appearances and may first on\nA may sixteenth you will be at the commonwealth club in San Francisco that's may sixteenth at noon and then again on may Eighteenth at the accidental Center for the arts in occidental\nIn Sonoma County that will be at seven PM will give those details are again as a a as we make our waste\nIt was a program and a Daniels ... actually when you go to occidental you'll be going home yeah yeah that's right yeah great yeah it'll be very exciting\nI hate asking this question because I always feel like it it it I'm I'm sending the wrong message which would I don't mean to do but it's to piggyback off of what you just said and how race plays all into this\nAnd again when we talk what we consider to be this golden age of of cooperation in Congress a lasting world you know really from World war two up to\nA Nineteen Ninety or or so I I Do find myself wondering\nIf the makeup of of of who is allowed and who was able to participate at the time plays into that because you mostly had white males who were in Congress almost exclusively in the Senate and and vast majority in the house\nAnd as as we in franchise more people and and more people are able to join Congress from different ethnicities women a profit across the political spectrum if it's suddenly it if it gets harder because you just have a a a ... a vast array of\nYou know who gets momentum win New Hampshire comes before\nIowa if you know South Carolina comes after Iowa you're going to you know if you were to switch the order you get different results and so you know by not having a nationwide elections certainly not democratic and the results and kind of curious outcomes where you you don't have these all these candidates on the stage in at the end you have a guy winning who not everybody necessarily want it to be the nominee but this is that this is\nThis is the this is the way the system currently work\nI guess on the flip side of that and and the concern here is what then then who is acceptable to run who is acceptable to leave the country and who is deciding that inevitably and and I think I I don't think this is a stretch to say democracies tend to favor\nThe aristocratic classes or or the ruling classes the educated classes um that we start to narrow who then is would we consider acceptable to run\nAnd and I think we've seen in the last ten years or so ... recession maybe a little bit before then I'm leadership in not just the presidency but Congress that that norm that regular people I guess and you see this with the rise of Bernie Sanders' campaign you see it with Donald Trump\nFeel like the establishment filled them and that there should be another way besides ... what the establishment presents\nYeah no that's right and I think they mean to me to you know there needs to be open competition and whoever gets the most votes should win I mean I'm not I'm not at all I advocating anything different than that that the the issue is where we need to have a red line is when\nA candidate running for office fails again what we call this litmus test um it was somebody clearly violates democratic norms and their rhetoric or their actions so if there is a candidate running for office even if he or she has pop mass popular appeal I mean so in that sense they seem democratic because they have mass popular appeal\nBut if they violate the Democratic norms and it's very it's very finite list of things if they challenged the legitimacy of elections if they attack them\nIf they can donor endorsed violence or engage in violence themselves if they are criticized their their rivals as being enemies um then then the other that's beyond the pale they are not so you know says so somebody like um [noise]\nUh somebody like Bernie Sanders is an outsider certainly but he ... by no means he violated any of these and so he has every right to compete for office he's an outsider at you know in many ways Brock Obama was an outsider as well in two thousand four and there needs to be a level playing field or these guys have a chance\nTo take to to win to win the nomination but you know we need a system though however that allows us to ah prevent somebody who violates democratic norms from coming into office I mean that's that's the major dilemma that democracies face today is\nYou know since the way that democracies die or you know the title of her book is how democracies die you know they used to die from the military is today the way democracy dies through election that they handle elected leaders are so\nSo that dilemma we face is how do we prevent people who clearly violate democratic norms and the rhetoric and their actions from using the very institutions of democracy from coming into office and then once in office dismantling are attacking democratic institutions\nAnd so that that's that's kind of the the dilemma we face\nIs is not a new concept tasty if we could trace into two thousand five hundred years ago in Athens\nUm it only lasted a hundred and fifty years or so and and then get a Republican Rome and then people argue you know there is some forms of democracy within a indigenous groups in the United states and stuff and and I don't mean to get in the whole discussion but I guess what I Want to say is that\nFor the vast majority of history at least of civilization um democracy is the exception and not the norm I was obviously right now worldwide we're living in a time of proliferation proliferation of democracies\nUm but you know even if you go back to to Aristotle and then they they had a word of of the day they didn't they were concerned do in in wary of democracy they had a word for what they thought democracy would turn into and that would be and and I think it's called an ... or in other words\nBeing into um mob rule eventually into chaos that would lead rise to to to tyranny or at least to a strong armed leader who would bring normalcy again I mean is an inevitable that at some time democracy is going to die\n[noise] well you know I think you know the the way that the the way that democracy has changed over time maybe that's certainly clear I mean during that period of the Cold War and we look around the world we document this in the book that three quarters of the wait three quarters of democratic that's came at the hands of ... of men with guns and military coups\nUm that's how democracies die a since the end of the Cold War because of the proliferation of democracy and democratic institutions and many people will guard elections as much more legitimate the way that democracy is now usually dies people coming to power through elections\nAnd so having the mantle of democratic legitimacy you know and you know this there's certainly you have to take you have to respect the results of elections\nUm but then once in office attacking democratic institutions in you know certainly you know American democracy is one of the older democracies in the world there's other old democracies as well and all the market everything has a lifespan\nBut uh you know I guess I don't I don't you know I I don't know I don't accept the idea that we have to you know say wall democracies die so let's just you know roll over a you know I think we need that people need to fight for our democracy democracy constitutions or not self enforcing\nUm you know you need to have citizens and political leaders who fight for the principles ally behind the constitution and lie behind a democracy\nAnd if they do democracies can be preserved I mean certainly lots of democracies have died and we you know in the United states we've been quite lucky I Would argue over the last couple of hundred years and there's reason for our success I mean I think we have a\nA a um you know the longer democracy lives actually the greater the probability that it will survive I mean that's that's kind of an interesting\nFinding if you look around the world I mean at the data is pretty strong that the that democracy the each year that democracy has existed at the probability of its continued survival next year as much higher than ... that are most likely to die or those that have just come into existence\nUm so you know so again I think you know there's a reason to be optimistic that the u._s. can kind of model its way through the challenges we face but the point\nWriting this book is to look at other countries around the world and to identify the warning signs ahead of time so that we can learn from experience is that other countries of of confronted and so our country doesn't succumb to the same crises\nAnd we're in conversation with Daniels ... Daniel ... is the co author of a book called how democracies die that is what we are in conversation about producers in the bay area again Daniel zip ... will be here in may giving a a few addresses including a on a\nOn on may sixteenth which is a Wednesday he is going to be at the commonwealth club in San Francisco and that's going to be at twelve PM noon on may sixteenth\nAnd San Francisco the commonwealth club and then again on may Eighteenth you'll be at the occidental Center for the arts in occidental that's may Eighteenth at seven PM I'll give those details again\nAs we wrap up at the end of our conversation here [noise] um [noise] you you've done a lot of work\nIn Germany and and I want to talk about Germany a couple of things one of the best way more republic actually that we don't do a lot of talking about and can can you compare and contrast for me\nThe why more I mean we all know about Hitler and everything obviously you can't have this conversation without talking about him but can you tell can you compare and contrast the constitution the Democratic constitution of the way more Republican and maybe the constitution we have now here in United States\n[noise] yeah sure I mean so I mean one thing to one thing to be said at the outset is that you know the points that I was just making that the U.S has a much longer live democracy the Weimar Constitution was a brand new constitution Nineteen Eighteen so there had been a\nImperial political system that was not democratic until World War one until Nineteen fourteen they had universal male suffrage but there was a lots of restrictions on that amongst the parliament was very weak\nBut after World War one I'm a group of real you know democratic committed Democrats Catholic central party the German Social Democrats or let liberal parties\nAre working together in parliament began to push for a piece as well as a democratic constitutions you got some really committed\nDemocrats [noise] um and they wrote or are they helped write the constitution and it costs you mentioned over Nineteen Eighteen Nineteen Nineteen\nUm and again you know I think you know we have to be careful making comparisons because the Weimar Republic wasn't News New country and a new new constitution so that so it survived you know quite briefly between Nineteen Eighteen and Nineteen\nThirty three I mean I guess it was you know wasn't formally suspended but in fact you know in fact when Hitler came to power January Nineteen thirty three the Weimar system was dead and in fact it was probably even dead a few years before that\nBut just to answer your question directly on the on the constitution so was the constitution designed by some very smart men a max neighbor to the famous sociologist had a saying that there was some other\nUh famous uh German a law professors from University of Berlin and they wanted to create a system that was highly democratic and it was a very democratic political system according to the constitution they had a system with a portion representation of kind of pure proportional representation\nSo this meant that you know depending on the share of votes he got in the country that's how many seats in parliament said this allowed for small parties to get into the parliament\nUm it was that there was a presidential system though obviously got a strong parliament chancellor ah but then you also had to directly elect the president and\nSo there were these two kinds of systems of I'm a kind of legitimacy competing with each other which cause some problems so so ah the idea was to create this very democratic system they've gotten rid of the king and the president was opposed in some sense or replace the king", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Democracy Now!", "city": "Madison", "day": "23"}
