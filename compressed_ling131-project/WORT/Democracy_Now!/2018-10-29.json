possible that we'll see perhaps the biggest turnoff for such an election ever one thing I think\nWe can say about Donald Trump is that he does have this uncanny ability to galvanize both sides as it turned out is as heavy as I suspect it will be we may see many places with really long lines\nThat will perhaps inevitably discourage people from even voting even if we put to the side here just for a moment voter suppression tactics election day could be quite chaotic and in an age in which every political event is now contested\nElection day and its aftermath could be a real focal point again or a real flash point and\nThese are the issues that we're going to be talking about this hour joined me here in the studio as Steven Rosenfeld Steven Rosenfeld is a fellow at the independent media Institute tea has been\nCovering the election issues for as long as I had been working in radio I Believe which is a good Fifteen to Eighteen years you're the author of a number of books including his latest which is called\nDemocracy portrayed how superdelegates redistricting party insiders and the electoral college raped the two thousand and sixteen election Steven Rosenfeld my very good pleasurable coming back to a radio station ... it's a pleasure to be here thank you it's good to see um\n[noise] let's I I wasn't planning on starting here but it's hard not to sort of dominating the news cycle this morning and that is that explosive devices have been sent in the mail or to the Obamas to the Clintons yesterday to George Soros and\nBecause if Democrats are elected governor they're going to be able to veto the bad maps\nThat basically created is red super majorities in one of the super majorities do in the past decade they filed the lawsuit today they opposed Obama Care they opposed algae because he writes they oppose climate change they oppose reproductive rights you know this is where this [laughter]\nThis how this stuff percolate through the system and that that's one of the more important factors what's you know it's not just taken over Congress and stopping Trump it's basically stopping this this is ... ... you know the gerrymandering segregating voters by party\nAnd its and creating you know popular vote majority said actually don't reflect the overall state why popular you know state populations and if you went so that's why those races are so important and they are all in play\nAnd they're all used to go back to the polls right now they are all within the the ... the separation between the winners and losers is is smaller than the margins of error nobody knows what's gonna happen it's a turnout battle it's really tight and this is every single one of those states this\nIs a really important point you you you bring up and I just want to stay with it for a moment because we're paying so much attention maybe rightfully so who's going to control Congress after the this midterm election was also really important for both this election and then also the twenty twenty election is who is going to control\nThe state legislatures because then twenty and twenty we'll have another census and it's from that sense is\nThat new districts will be drawn and we get into the issue of how these districts are drawn\n[noise] ... yeah I mean you know what what we have here if you step back is we have a we have one major political party the Republicans that are no longer the their base is shrinking demographically now it may be concentrated in more states than others you know we talk about elections we talk about voter suppression would talk about voting\nAnd we talked about representative government it's almost as if we are there are really two different versions of America there's you know here in California the way things are run which I'm not saying it's perfect is very different than red state America and\n... and ... and so what you have here is um in you know in these slices of the country that control majorities in Congress the house of representatives and also presidential elections\nYou know you have a different set of rules and it didn't just come up by accidents\nAnd we're seeing them play out right now we're seeing them play out in Georgia we're seeing them play out in different ways in Arizona we're seeing them play out in Missouri we're seeing that play out in North Dakota it's no accident that all these states have close US Senate races close governor's race is close house races where real power is at stake\nAnd we call building suppression if you talk to\nRepublicans you've talked to conservatives day they may call it a a wood voting credibility or voting security right but regardless of of what you call it ... as you say what what you we cannot escape is these measures are all happening in red\nYet what's really interesting though compared to um what was happening a decade ago and even six years ago is that the that the um the process of voting and registering to vote in many of these same states has has opened up\nAnd it hasn't really been as widely acknowledged and I can tell you how to second um by by folks on the left in progress is because you know\nI I think we make a mistake when I say we I think you know progressive and the political organizations that do a lot of organizing for campaigns and fundraising and everybody take a look at all the emails we all get [laughter]\nBy focusing on the you know the fear the villains because voter registration is more open than it's ever been and that's because compared to six years ago three quarters of the states have on line registration\nAnd um and and they all ... and at a dozen states started two years ago including Georgia have automatic registration if you get your driver's license now the new obstructions have come\nA partisan obstructions have come around the processing of that information that comes\nIn to like the DMZ ease and didn't migrate over to the ... the state voter rolls and that's the new feature of twenty Eighteen so for example in Arizona\nOr public and run state for some reason and there was this ... went to federal court and the voting rights advocates last for some reason nearly four hundred thousand updated changes of address did not get sent from the motor vehicles department to\nThe voting you know the the ... the the people who administer the statewide voter rolls and the county voting officials well that's a state that votes mostly eighty percent by mail so what so what's the obstruction well they're not going to get there the right balance and if they don't get the right balance they may not notice the last minute\nAnd and then people will show up and that leads to the whole um ... you know sort of\nCycle vortex of polling place delays lions obstructions people get upset everything we've heard about before another state Missouri same thing two hundred thousand votes ... information of two thousand two thousand people who moved to not get get sent an although there was a federal court ruling that sets two weeks ago that said send that information\nAnd it also they also throughout a I'm\nAn owner as part of that state's stricter voter id law which adds another hurdle for people to get a normal ballot the problem is even though these aren't nominally victories and you know you'll talk to a voting rights lawyers and they'll say this is the this is great we want that doesn't mean it trickles down and his implemented at the local level because\nPoll workers need to be trained they not experts in this stuff like that can be confusion and you know and all the ... the whole thing is you create this chaos and confusion where does it need to be [noise]\nNow there are other examples of purposeful yes ... there are other examples of this you know we can talk about what's going on in Georgia, Georgia is it's so schizophrenia\nNow most of your listeners have probably heard that slightly more than fifty thousand voter registrations are in what's called the pending file their suspended and and you see all these emails from Stacey Abrams and move on everybody else they'd be able to the Democratic cover candidate governor how voter suppression blah blah blah\nHe's running she's running against the guy get Kemp Brian Kemp Brian Kemp who was the secretary of state administering the election and the Republican candidate and may have no match law yeah if if there's anything different from the driver's license to the registration right it could right okay so here's the thing about all this this maybe this is getting a little too granular\nBut here you know here's it's\nThis is the big picture has been missed and the national media this is a really gets a frantic landscape\nGeorgia is one of a dozen states that has automatic voter registration California just started this that Georgia started before California New York state doesn't have it some of these big blue states they don't have it\nAnd they also have online registration so since November twenty sixteen last presidential election [noise] something like one point four million people have registered they've increased the size of their voter rolls by Fifteen Percent now here's this gets sick part [noise]\nCamp who is one of these Republicans who believes in ballot security has used the most aggressive means to disqualified people whose information doesn't quite match\nAnd this is what you said there's no ... well people who registered on line this is the they verify their information Stacey Abrams who's running for governor in her group the New Georgia project they were trying to invest a lot of\nAfrican Americans and people outside the process but they submitted paper registration forms so because they submitted on paper and they didn't do it on line ... gave camp and\nYou know a way to impede and attack the process now why would they submit paper well because they want to have contact information with the voters to mobilize their base\nBut beyond all that\nYou then have this crazy thing where you have by the the best information I've been able to get and it's not being widely released you've got somewhere between two hundred and fifty and it may be a plus or minus probably cost another hundred thousand new voters\nThis year in Georgia last month I was told us yesterday there were there was ...\nIt was a hundred and thirty or a hundred and forty thousand people registered in the last month in Georgia alone\nThat's more than this fifty thousand numbers that we're talking about when you're not hearing that [noise] so what you are hearing is all this this information about um the threats to voting in this but you're not hearing what's going to empower these people to get him over the finish line there is a very positive story happening and I do believe it or a very positive store\nAnd I think it shows and and just even the the the nomination of Stacey Abrams as the the democratic nominee for governor so so\nThis is letters in politics and we are in conversation with Stephen Rosenfeld Steven Rosenfeld is a fellow at the um [noise] had it here somewhere I Know you're an independent media Institute [laughter]\nUsa formerly Ruth alternate uh is the author of of a number of books including democracy betrayed how superdelegates redistricting party insiders the electoral college rigged the two thousand\nSixteen elections even Rosenthal don't want to ask you another question about turnout for this election it may be one of the biggest turnouts we've ever have for a midterm election and I said to my introduction\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise] they're\n[noise]\n\nThey're no longer [noise]\nSteven Rosenfeld is a long time political correspondent he's now a fellow at the independent media Institute He's the author of a number of books including democracy perpetrate how super delegates redistricting party insiders\nThe electoral college raped the two thousand sixteen election also author of course there are the template with Jeff Chester produced by the center for digital media called up already protect yourself from online political manipulation in ... new election two thousand eight teams says letters in politics I'm Mitch does rich and today we're speaking to Stephen\nRosenfeld about this upcoming midterm election just in a lot of interesting stuff do you and I very much appreciate you\nBeing here today and I do want to get this next question to you and that is what do you think the likelihood a again we live in this political culture this political moment where everything is contested including process what do you think the likelihood of uh\nThese results being contested come two weeks from today I guess [noise] well I think you can't [laughter] I think you can look at the the rhetoric and you could look at the process\nNow if you look at the rhetoric starting with the president's recent tweets that millions of Democrats are about to vote illegally\nYou can see that it's already being contested in needed us two thousand sixteen as well yeah yeah and and um it's and it's just\nIt's just a lie and and well what's ally what what's he saying that's alive what's he saying is that millions of people who were non citizens managed to vote legally\nVote somehow get a ballot and vote because he's saying that now for this election as well because he said this to them that he has his does he have together this commission that's now defunct yes\nSo you know people I dare say the Republican Party is not exactly you know a party marked by profiles and political courage where people are willing to stand up and say hey wait a second facts matter this is the truth\nAnd everything else that follows from that you know not just the facts matter and this is the truth but that the that that law matters\nYou know that the ... that that you know certain like ... democratic institutions matter and they have to operate according to certain rules this is the president said that has thrown out all the norms and the party has thrown out these norms and you see it most in the rhetoric and the messaging and that's you know on and that's\nAnd that's the role of social media and the Internet is to accelerate and magnify that in ways that are unprecedented said when he said was that the sweets [noise] she said the rhetoric you know is like well\nWe're not going to accept the results that's basically what he's saying now but let's talk about the results you know they're\nDifferent states have different election machinery and the good news is that since twenty if his says two thousand and four two thousand six most states have moved away from all electronic machines which cannot be audited which means doubled\nBecause what's on the memory card is on the memory card\nAnd I moved to a paper they must have paper ballots systems where we're basically you mark a piece of paper with with an ink you know with with a pen and it gets scanned and then you have a series of different competing protocols for\nAscertain how accurate that is now some are better than others and um some of these actually happened\nBefore the votes are finalized which is one which is what really interests me because that means that you can actually verify the counts openly while the the winter has yet to be official\nVersus what would to me is more like an academic exercise after the fact\nSo different states have different voting systems in Georgia is all it's one of the handful of states it's paperless so so as of early today the N. double ACP in Georgia was saying some of the early voting machines people who are voting for Stacey Abrams saw so Brian camps name jump up\nAnd what's that about ... that everybody knows that the calibration issue that means the screen is not and calibrated and and they know how to fix that\nYou know the question is will that scale and that is the key question you know whenever you hear all these tales of of low and oh my God this guy is long voting the question you really have to ask is are we talking about one person or ten people or ten thousand or a hundred thousand\nAnd most of the stuff we hear doesn't scale\nBut ... but so does that mean these these are more isolated events yes they are more isolated events now in other ... now the question we don't we don't know you know we have to know we have to recognize what we don't know\nUh we know that they're using all systems in Georgia and because they're all systems they're prone to break down which means that you have to have an even bigger turnout wave\nYou know the bigger the wave the you know that that that the small you know the micro racial things come up in a close election yes right these things matter more in the micro aggressions or micro injuries or systemic breakdowns are snafu is I mean this is a\nComplicated process and they happen and they haven't they find a school or not yeah and\nPurpose for not and that and so the question is um\nYou know when you say like when people can people protest account they can't really contested County Georgia because what they ended up recording on the ... the memory cards is going to be the count\nOn the other hand you know camp the Republican was saying a week ago or ... you know we can go at a Republican fundraiser oh my God they're they're Democrats or requesting so many absentee ballots [noise]\nYou know we're going to get swamped your come on people get out and vote at a certain point she has to you know he can't stop the wave if you know through these administrative\nYou know sort of back stabbing ... moves\nUm because it's too big it will swamp now other states it's going to be different Florida for example which has a very important governor's race and at ... at a Senate race\nAs and most important I daresay is a measure on the ballot that need sixty percent approval to win which would re in franchise states\nEx felons there or something like one point for a one point five million adults of voting age ten percent of the states voting age population that cannot vote and\n... is a state to state ballot measure any to sixty percent approval to win if it passes and right now the ... the Democratic candidate for governor is up in the polls by like fifty eight percent so it's not quite that sixty percent threshold it will change that stays political ... complex and\nDefinitive Lee and you know it's it it will affect presidential elections will effect everything\nNow in Florida they have different voting systems in different counties that will be able to do\nMore or less accurate accounting of the votes cast before the final winner is declared I'm actually going to go there to look at that because I think that's one of the more promising developments\n... ... you know there's a lot that people don't trust in anything digital when it comes to voting but in a country where you have more than two hundred million registered voters you're not going to have him at the paper ballots\nThat you know we're not in the nineteenth century anymore and I know some people don't like to hear that you've been covering this issue from from the beginning\nThere are ways yes but yes there are ways to do this we use the best to paper and the best of digital and what I've seen and in and this is going to happen in Florida and in a handful counties\nThey're going to be able to look but they're gonna be able to take the images of of the ballots are scanned their not bar codes are literally the ... marks on paper\nAnd they can sort of them and ... by by how clearly the ... and whether their exes are they're sloppy and they can look at the least confident marks and they can do a one hundred percent accounting and some of these big counties before they declare the actual winter\nNow if we had that kind of transparency nationwide\nYou know that would be really revolution or we're talking about the best use as a paper and you know a digital energy they sort of counter balance each other and to me that's really fascinating because we live in a culture where the loser the losing side can accept it\nAs evidenced by the president saying they're going to steal steal it so this is you know this is the moment we're in\nThat that that's interesting to me because I think we're also in a moment where there is a loss of confidence in political institutions courts and the Congress and the administration and inevitably\nYou have to wonder about the election it so well we we live in an era where this is what's you know I I started covering campaigns and elections in the Nineteen eighties\n\nBut [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\nSays\nThe\n\n\nW.

this er this political gasoline catches fire and people get hurt and killed a more refined buying\nI'd love to say I was surprised when I'm not more shockingly Republican Congress has tolerated his often cause vilification\nSharon ... been in their cries of outrage their so called responsible people in our country and are in positions of political leadership their silence has been deafening\nI Would say that the\nSilence tends to legitimize the crazy conspiracy theories to hate speech the threats that violent acts of the most noxious white nationalist elements of the American political spectrum Mr Trump even on ashamed\nTo tell us that among the chanting Nazis in Charlottesville there were many find people drawing a false moral equivalency\nBetween\nWho protesting against those kinds of actions and not just themselves\nShould we now be surprised at well armed white not nationalist begets\nA isolated\nIsolated finalist loners are\nSeeking validation for their empty lives that they that\nThey act out on their heads I think not now Mr Trump didn't pull the trigger and the synagogue he didn't mail those bombs but for the first time in fifty years he's made bigoted hate speech\nIn America legitimate tool of political manipulation is endless barrage of excited hatred tried some lives has consequences as we have seen\nI regard Mr Trump has a hopeless moral in this or indifferent to the deadly consequences of this inflammatory conduct but those politicians\nAnd no better still do not say much they don't stand up and wildly denounces hate speech they don't the announcers lives there hypocrites they're cowards their deafening silence condemns them more loudly than any courtroom\nEver could and so uh what can we say we uh we have to take the actions that are most prudent that are most literal loudest most effective means getting out and voting\nThat what your conscience diets are adding\nThat shit\nFor um Bowers made his judge made his justification very clear I mean he tweeted minutes before and doesn't use tweet by used gab\nOr going into this synagogue I'm saying he wanted to kill all Jews but specifically going after a Jewish organization called high us which stands for the Hebrew immigrant aid society a group that you work for as well as our next guests\nAre in love for an hour I'm at and he immediately made the link\nBetween Jews and immigrants ... helping immigrants coming into this country\nUm among his gap posts he said I have noticed a change and people saying illegals that now say invaders he wrote the six days before he said I like that as he referred continually to the caravan of people coming up\nOn you were particularly close to the story in an unusual way era volunteer for high us\nOr you work with refugees Jewish I'm non Jewish from all over the world trying to resettle and the United states\nAnd your nephew uh Stephen Miller is one of clothes a President Trump's closest advisers particularly on the issue of immigration\nOn your headline and the political pace this is before the attack this weekend Stephen Miller is an immigration hypocrite I Know because I'm his uncle\nCan you talk about this linkage that power made from Jews Jewish organizations bringing in refugees as he called them invaders oh language that President Trump himself has used\n... Memorial Sloan hers hope to rescue Mercer were above a hundred years ago borough serves to protect those for refugees ... ... to her for almost a rumor confirmed was ...\nBecame unwillingly or slaves and apart from those who are Native Americans everyone else came here by and large\nThe fleet danger oppression hunger and fear and together those folks have built the nation brought her wars in advance the cause of freedom and justice in the world\nWe must not turn our backs on this this fundamentally American mission\nOr lead opportunistic hit so politicians turned us against them the words on the statue of liberty shouldn't be remembered give us your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free\nSo I Am particularly horrified and angry about the cynical political exploitation of poor people trying to escape from oppression we\nCan't solve all the problems in the world but we can certainly United States is a large powerful wealthy\nCountry very good at absorbing immigrants as you can find as you can determine just by going out in the street and asking anybody you see when did their family come from originally\nWere graded absorbing immigrants and we need to do our duty to help people who are desperately fleeing from horrible conditions as my family did hundred years ago\nAnd spontaneously the chance that broke out in that vigil was vote vote and your reference to the eleven members of the Pittsburgh affiliate of bend the arc of Jewish partnership for justice writing that letter to President Trump Trump said\nHe will be going to Pittsburgh I think some time this week\nAnd they wrote are Jewish community is not the only group you of targeted you've also deliberately undermined the safety of people of color Muslim ... people people with disabilities yesterday's mass ... not the first act of terror you incited against a minority group\nIn our country they wrote saying that unless he run ounces says a white nationalism on that he can't come to Pittsburgh\nYeah\nKnow this is these are the kinds of connections we need to be making because we actually have power in numbers we not only need to get out the vote but we need to be showing up for each other\nAt the gathering we had on Saturday Night the calvary center of our dear friends and allies um are Muslim and Christian clergy and neighbors came and they spoke and they sing to us\nAnd they shared words there were about a hundred of US President and in in the moment where our words failed us they said we we stand by you we will be standing stone um and and really offered you know the words of\nYou know Jewish liberation from a hundred years ago which is that we will outlive them we will do this in the streets together that we are not alone in this Jews are not alone in this people of color are not alone in this immigrants are not alone in this I was thinking about this in\nThinking that's into my own work related immigrant justice I spent some time earlier in August that the U.S Mexico border I'm as part of a clergy action to\nUm be providing she meant to be resisting this administration's criminalization of humanitarian aid on the U.S border\nAnd um what we know is that the criminalization of immigration is directly connected to the the violence\nIt's being perpetrated against trans bodies against people of color against black bodies out in public space which has been going on um you know for as long as basically the U.S has been in existence there has been um the the the violence against a black and brown bodies has been condoned by the state and this is a time where we need to rise up and read this that and reclaim\nReclaim a sense of connected safety that is not built in state power but that's built in our relationships of solidarity and interdependence\n[noise] didn't and it and we were ...\nI Want to ask also about what happened and it's remarkable moment on friday afternoon most aren't paying attention because the um uh the accused I'm a bomber Cesar ...\nUm had been arrested and said there was a lot of attention on this van that he was living and had all these targets on it and a pro Trump signs he was at a Melbourne, Florida a Trump rally recently\nUm but at that soon after that President Trump was in the East Room with young black leaders\nAnd he basically led a mini rally as he attacked global us and the young people wearing mag hats make America great again a chanted cirrhosis and lock him up\nThis was in the White House on friday I think it was Wednesday that Trump in the middle of the night tweeted I'm putting the word and bombs in quotes and saying this is taking attention away from what we want to focus on right the caravan um\nAh the threats as he perceived them of persecuted people coming up into this country\nWhat what we're seeing is Trump Trump coming further and further out and saying is true colors or we saw last week that he he came out of the national and we know the word that becomes before\nNational it's white nationalist and we we know they used the term global list is directly or a longstanding attack on Jews as an anti Semitic slur that's been used and we've seen these same strategies in in the ... of of media and manipulation that that Hitler and using the Nazi Party to ride\nIn Germany and so I really hold 'em Trump and the entire Republican Party and their silence\nI'm complicit for these acts of violence and this murder the blood on their hands um it's not just about getting guns guns out of out of out of dissemination it's actually about changing the discourse of who's in power um this is not a side project this actually is the project in this administration\nAnd and we need to be speaking out and saying Trump any to denounce white nationalism and we need to hold accountable all of our elected officials and\nFrankly we need to unseat them and changed the face\nOf who was in power in this country because of this violence is not happening in isolation and as we're seeing\nIt's escalating terribly um this past week has been devastating and it's an assault let us on our bodies but on our souls and one of the things that we have in our in our ethical tradition is that in a place where people are not not acting human we need to strive to be human and we need to stay connected to our humanity we need to build this world from love we\nWe
