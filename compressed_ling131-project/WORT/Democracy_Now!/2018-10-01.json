per\nIt would turn the country and an anti Republican direction and they became more sympathetic to that idea um Madison correspondence Washington's correspondence talks about how the New England elite was increasingly\nStarting to look fondly on the idea of a king if if that was necessary to have an anti Republican government in order to make sure that the rule of law\nI'm the rule of law was implemented and that you didn't have too much populist influence on government they were starting to think well maybe that's what we need to do\nAnd he had a ... billion was put down by a I guess a militia that was put together by eastern creditors\nYeah it's a private army basically um these are the people who held the debt they were the creditors so they had a very direct interest in making sure that those debts were paid and that the courts were shut down and they were the ones who coughed up the money to hire the militia I think part of the problem was\nThat militias are just ordinary people and they might decline to intervene against a a\nShit Shays is army which was also consisting of ordinary people who are not really trying to overthrow the government they were just trying to protect their\nFarms from uh being taken from them in bankruptcy a it's not hard to be sympathetic to them they felt like\nA you know it really wasn't fair that they were being taxed at fairly high rates and desperate economic conditions and the money that they were being taxed war was going to creditors who would often than speculators who had just bought up the debt\nFor pennies on a dollar or they'd often bought the debt from the very same\nWho are now joining Shays is army right so you suppose you're a a Revolutionary War soldier and you got paid a nodding cash but you got paid and in script you got paid in some sort of government I argue\nAnd then in desperate times you would sell that to a speculator 'cause it wasn't clear that the federal government would ever be able to to redeem it in an actual currency so you might\nSell it to a Boston creditor for ten cents on the dollar as people scooped up the debt now they're demanding a pretty rigorous implementation of taxes to pay off\nThe debt and that didn't necessarily seem ... fair to the farmers\nAre so\nThey decided there and do something about they're going to take the law into their own hands and then the eastern creditors couldn't necessarily trust the government militia because the government militias just come composed of ordinary people who might decide that they weren't going to fire upon their comrades and so they hire their own private army basically\nAs interesting um so the economic condition and the Thirteen states making up the United states is just after the revolutionary war is a dire one because the countries in major debt in large part because of the more debt that it does and so this is a situation in Massachusetts\nYou mentioned Massachusetts I think he said it was it was made more conservative or at least not as as easy on requiring its citizens to pay taxes because other states are taking different measures to Massachusetts so they don't\nThey don't have the same situation that Massachusetts at\nA majority of the states um at least seven of the Thirteen states have passed a paper money laws which are basically uh basically ... of\nEmitting paper money which is basically just loaning money to farmers so they're paying interest on it\nBut it enables them to monetize the wealth they have in the farm and to pay their taxes\nSo majority of states have passed paper money laws and debt relief laws so a debt relief law for example might say even though you have a contract with a creditor and you have to pay back a certain saw him on a certain day we're going to give you six extra months to pay the debt or will allow you to pay the debt not in\nHard currency even though that's what the contract calls for will allow you to pay it\nIn some other sort of in kind property and a majority of states are passing those laws because most of the state constitutions are very democratic and these dead or farmers are a majority of the population so when they demand relief they tend to get it\nIn the state that they didn't get it in Massachusetts\nA basically things ... you know they they they build up until finally some steam as let off and the farmers decided to shut down the courts but in ...\nIn most of the states there have been smaller variations on Shays rebellions so in Massachusetts you got a larger abroad or on a larger revolt\nBut in other states especially in western parts of the states it wasn't unusual to have similar sorts of efforts but on a smaller scale if the legislature was not perceived as being sufficiently responsive to demand for debt and a\nAnd tax relief then people would shut down the courts rather than see their farms taken away from them\nAnd if your argument that\nThis situation with these first these these rebellions from Shays rebellions other uh billions are happening throughout the country and in states responding to the popular will\nUh of their their citizens at the time is is what that would bring alarmed too I I guess who we call the leaders of the country for for bringing a constitutional convention\nI don't want to reduce it to one variable and I don't want to claim any great originality for the argument this argument's been around for a hundred years I basically agree with that and I've tried to flush it out perhaps in a little bit more detail\nAnd I've also tried to offer an explanation of how the elite was able to pull off this kind of ... which is adopting a more conservative constitution to suppress the debt and tax relief movement\nBut they're they're ... they're clearly more than one thing going on um the articles of confederation which are what it was kind of the governing arrangement before the constitution it's clearly failing because the national government just doesn't have sufficient power\nAs we've already discussed it doesn't have the taxing power doesn't have power to regulate foreigner international commerce it doesn't even have the power to implement the treaties which it's explicitly given authority negotiate but there's no mechanism for a ... state to comply with the treaty that the national government has negotiated\nSo clearly something has to be done about this the national government just needs to be made more powerful but there's another dimension which is the anti populist aspect of the constitution you could make them more nationally\nPowerful government without making yet as anti populist says the frame or just dead so those are two different dimensions to think about one is shifting power from the state and local level to the national level and the other is trying to remove\nThe national government to the extent possible from direct control of the people using mechanisms like lengthy terms in office indirect elections\nOut a lot of disagreement among historians is which of these should we see is the dominant dimension\nAnd I think maybe that kind of conventional view is a\nThis is is to emphasize the nationalizing dimension that we're what we're doing is responding to acknowledge deficiencies in the national government by making it more powerful and I think I'm suggesting and other revisionists have suggested that that's downplaying the anti populist angle too much\nAnd Madison actually set at that convention that of the things that brought them to Philadelphia he thought the most important factor was this need to respond to the excessively populist impulses that had been predominate in the states Madison's a pretty good\nAdjudicate or of this disagreement among historians he's really more responsible than anyone else\nFor the success of the movement for the constitution and he said pretty explicitly in Philadelphia you know to the extent where here for one predominant reason is to try to suppress this excessively populist dimension of what's going on in the states\n[laughter] letters from politics than we are in conversation with Michael J. Claire man he is the Kirkland and tell us professor of law at Harvard law school author of the book the famous cool the making of the United States Constitution\nWeren't listeners we are right at the tail end of our pledge drive you're going to go on for a couple of days but you've got ... here talking to you yep and Bert ... river river and the debt I just want to know that uh we have forty when listeners on line they kill all thinking each and every one that's\nWhy are you know and Kathy would like to look at the top rate corner of your screen [laughter]\n[laughter] yeah that's right and what war\nMaybe the donate button ... it'll hurt there it's really easy and uh all the pledge of premiums basically are on line and\nAnd I know that a bird has a pledge premium listening to Michael chat about Michael climate is so amazing listening to him and and knowing history Howard Zinn once said why do we want to know what history it's all in the past he says\nBecause today we're making decisions that creative future\nWe make those decisions based on what we know over the past and knowing the past\nIn a critically yeah thoughtful otherwise you repeat it that idiot you don't know the past [noise] so so if you can pledge at all at any level you want you can play on a monthly level ... five dollars or more per month five dollars a month or sixty bucks a year and that gives you\nUm premiums as well if you wish to have a ... and there's all sorts of premiums or if he puts on a one time basis or an ... a monthly\nBasis let's focus on the book we keep talking about the the the the comics of Wisconsin\nI'm In Wisconsin by Paul ... let's let's look at the the endorsements on the back of his book hundred and eighty pages of a media is hardly ... said comics in Wisconsin recovers the history of an important center of comic art experimentation offers readers of\nCongress has given almost unlimited military powers raising an army creating a navy calling state militias into federal service Congress has given unlimited power to regulate\nA foreign an interstate commerce\nCongress as explicitly granted implied power so in addition to each of the enumerated powers like the taxing power the power to regulate commerce Congress has also given the power to pass any laws necessary and proper to implementing the enumerated powers which is essentially a grant of implied powers\nSo those are all a trick significant broadening of Congress's powers relative to the articles\nBut then they also created a Congress that was very distant from the people so much longer terms in office a senator served six years representative served two years under state constitutions almost all officeholders had to be annually elected\nIn direct election of senators indirect election of president very large constituencies so Congress was going to be tiny the first Congress was sixty five representatives for the entire nation that's compared to the Massachusetts lower house which had over three hundred representatives\nThat's a very large constituency for each congressional representative and the point of that was both to ensure that the quote unquote better sort you know the\nThe very well known large farmers the wealthy elite would be elected to office but also to create more distance between representatives and constituents to ensure that the national government would not never fall under the populace some of the citizenry\nSo I'm both dimensions the constitution is actually a\nPretty radical departure from the status quo and they actually wanted to go further it's an important point to note that they were constrained by the need to get what they did random\nBye bye popular conventions so they didn't go as far as they were inclined to many of the delegates in Philadelphia would've liked to create a lifetime tenure president\nAnd many of them would have liked to create longer terms in office than six years for senator so they talked about dying your terms Thirteen year terms Fifteen year terms\nKind of unimaginable from a modern perspective but they were trying to create an institution in the Senate that was like the British house of lords and they were trying to create an institution and the presidency that was much further in the direction of a monarch than any of the state governors at the time who actually had very little authority\nAnd the idea I'm representing so many people as a congressional member and that and tell me how that benefits somebody who who's wealthier a large landowner an aristocrat\nSo that the baseline from today's perspective each ... congressional representative today represents about seven hundred thousand people so we're talking about Basque constituencies\nThere was nothing like that at the time and the first Congress most of the representatives were representing thirty or forty thousand people but you have to compare that for example to legislate tour in Massachusetts\nOr a member of the lower house of the Massachusetts legislature represented about fourteen hundred people\nSo fourteen hundred as compared to thirty or forty thousand so you're talking about twenty times as many constituents for each congressional representative\nAs for each member of the Massachusetts lower house now how does that translate into a a greater likelihood of the elite being represented you know if you're going to be represented from a vast\nGeographic constituency with forty thousand people in remember there are very few cities back then most of these districts would have been very large geographically because they were sparsely populated and\nThere was very poor transportation and communication so how are thirty or forty thousand people going to elect a representative there aren't that many people in the district to have large ... reputations it's going to be somebody who went off and became a hero in the revolutionary war like George Washington or a very large wealthy\nA landowner who has a large patronage network on lots of people know about enter indebted to that person so the larger the district and the people who are supporting the constitution fully understood this the larger the district the more likely you are to get a member of the elite\nAnd in addition to the larger the district and the larger the number of people being represented the greater the distance the metaphorical and physical distance that the representative has\nWhich enables the representative to pursue his own vision of the common good rather than simply being a faithful delicate of whatever popular opinion is\nAnd that's what they were looking for they were looking for elite people who would have a fair amount of discretion to pursue what they saw the common good rather than just faithfully representing the views of their constituents\nAnd they designed a system that was most more likely to accomplish that\nLetters from politics and we are in conversation with Michael J.

I wanted to go to\nI'm Dianne Feinstein controversy over the confirmation of Clarence Thomas at the Supreme Court triggered a wave that swept democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California into office in Nineteen Ninety two among other women and that was a year after that confirmation\nNow senator Feinstein's a key player in Kavanaugh's confirmation as the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary committee she noted Thursday the FBI carried an investigation into any details allegations of Thomas had sexually harassed her\nIn Nineteen Ninety One Anita Hill's allegations were reviewed by the FBI as his the normal process and squarely within its jurisdiction\nIn Nineteen Ninety One and the Senate heard from twenty two witnesses over three days\nToday while rejecting an FBI investigation Republicans are refusing to hear testimony from any other witness including mark judge who Dr Ford identified as being in the room when the attack took place\nIn Nineteen Ninety One Republicans belittled professor hills experience\nSaying and I quote it won't make a bit of difference in the outcome and quote\nAnd the burden of proof was on professor Hill today our Republican colleagues are saying this is a shake up Dr Ford is mixed up and declaring I'll listen to the lady but we're going to bring this to a close\nSo that was Senator Dianne Feinstein during the hearing this is Anita Hill making her opening statement in Nineteen Ninety One confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas when she testified that he sexually harassed her", "show_name": "Democracy Now!", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "01"}
