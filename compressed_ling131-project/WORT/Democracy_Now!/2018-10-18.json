few weeks ago and then we had talked to answer on that you are a professor at the moment is\nAn ancient Rome and yeah I I as we as another conversation and then I was like well how did this happen how does it ... it was pure luck folks that's right [laughter] good to see you again thank you for coming back\nGood I'm very glad to be here Mitch\nI Want to quote from an article that you recently wrote that was published a book uh called chaos in the liberal order in your article is called Arista Chrissy oligarchy and Trump\nSaid this quote it is clear that do CDs and Plato ... would have been a poll that I'm Donald Trump\nAnd after time ah so that their lives are of a financially ruin\nA so they were demanding a ... a a a better a new deal and especially because people came back sold their farms in order to get out of debt but then they don't have farms and then they drift into the city so that a Roman becomes a city surrounded by slums capital of the world becomes surrounded by slums\nInhabited by the people who made the empire\nAnd it's just making ... income inequality there are so many of their farms and blow it already own on the ... and so\nOh yes some of the income inequality in the late republic is astounding and uh one of the things Sallis says he says houses the size of cities are being built and that is true we actually have a map\nOf Rome from that period with lots of little ... streets and then there's somebody's state in the city which is the size of five city blocks you know and and those people are living and people can see how what's what's going on so the the\nUh the income disparity is terrible I should say how that was eventually handled was that the young Octavian who became a the emperor Augustus\nSettled people new people poor people on the land by force in a forty to forty one forty B. C. or he confiscated private property and gave it a two of the deserving a actually veterans who had who had fought and\nYou know that actually handle the problem in the first century id Italy is actually a land of small farms but how it was done was by violence by saying okay this is what's gonna happen get off the land you have here comes the soldier and his friends and you are through is the owner of this place\nThat that's really interesting because I just as soon as he he takes over he he becomes him for after after Caesar is killing right and so we are jumping ahead a little bit we'll get back to ... to complete the story but but that's interesting to me\nBecause we think in the east coast of our own culture here think well democracy is always the best ...\nFor regular people for poor people but history would show and if you if you have the monarch or let's just say even a dictator you didn't have a really bad dictator but you also find that oftentimes dictators will be friendlier\nMore compassionate maybe ... finding the right term but but more beneficial to poor people than say the aristocratic\nYeah the ... Augustus certainly was Octavian certainly was an scenes are intended to be himself\nA let's go back to Caesar though and the thing is about his ambitions were viewed as unlimited and that's what created distrust back in Rome about what he was doing and I think they were unlimited or to give you two examples once the civil war starts\nHe he's fifty two years old he's balding fifty two year old guy with a teenaged mistress who is also the queen of Egypt\nThat Cleopatra people looked at that and said what's this\nWhere is the limits to his appetite it's not just ambition and it becomes appetite that's involved in it\nAnd so you ... so you have writers a political thinker saying it's appetite that's the problem and that if you have people with a great deal of power who are oligarchs and only interested in themselves that appetite shows up first in feasting and food\nAre then insects whereas where it's unlimited what they want to do no restrictions no limits and then its power so I mean you look at a Trump who is a supposedly one pound short of being officially obese\nAs for his sexual drive we've all had to deal with this ad ... and so when people look at that now they go this guy has no limits\nRepublics ... a run on limits limited became limits on behavior what you can say what you can do people didn't believe that Caesar was going to accept any limits to his power after he conquered golf I mean he became um\nHis private fortune by the end of the Catholic conquest was the size of the room and treasury now we're we're not talking about Bill Gates who who's got a hundred billion dollars we're talking about somebody who has two trillion dollars so you can see why people\nAre worried about him that he had no limits yeah I Want to ask you if I'm In that is the Roman republic is a democratic do people do people vote 'em but\nOne has to its modulated complicated thing\nPeople are elected by a popular well elect in buying electoral college with where the rich vote first and there are a hundred and Ninety three voting units and Ninety eight of them belong\nTo the rich so if the rich all vote for one person\nThat person is automatically has a majority vote of the units\nAnd then there's no ... need to continue asking other people to be counted\nSo that all happened um it just stopped with the upper the aristocrats or if they were United on the reason I Want to make a complex is there were often many candidates running there could be as many as six or seven candidates running for the console ship the presidency\nIn one year and so you can never know how things were actually going to come out\nBut it's certainly heavily weighted towards the rich\nCharts property owners\nAnd ah the mob the masses\nGot one vote even though they were a majority of the population um nevertheless um\nAnd all the guards had to learn public speaking and the only reason to do that is because they actually had to convince people to vote for them and it could happen that that very aristocratic people lost\nMy oratory how important it that's right which that's the mark of a free state oratory the importance of it is the mark of a free state it's not it's not a frozen waste it's very complicated politics Cicero actually\nYou wrote I'm a a pamphlet called how to get elected which we have and it's really complicated when you know who you have to talk to who you have to schmooze with who you have to butter up all of these things to to get elected\n[noise] we're not conversation with Arthur ... professor of history and distinguished university professor at the University of Maryland College park ... author of a number of books including\nMoral vision and the histories of polygamy is that your guy right ... yeah you know talking about I was moment his latest book is called Batman rising how's the weather underground beat the FBI and lost the revolution it's also author of an article that does pertain to the conversation or having right now it's called Arista Chrissy oligarchy\nAnd Trump the reason I ask if if the Roman republic was democratic if people voted any kind of goes back to the previous question I had in that is sometimes dictator you an authoritarian\nA strong arm ruler a monarch whatever you want to call it may sometimes be more beneficial towards poor people than a democracy would and the reason that Caesar was killed I mean this is the popular telling the story anyways it's because he was about\nTo um [noise] upset the the cart the apple cart for for the aristocrats\nUm yes [noise] that's true and a and one of the things to think about is a of the conspirators has had opposed him in the civil war and had been pardoned by him and you would say and people did it say how ungrateful love him to kill him\nNot to which the answer is these are people who are used to pardoning people they're not used to being part and\nYou know there used to making it on their own but the other half of the conspirators including the leading military person had supported Caesar and the civil war\nThey they uh were people who thought he had a case but they didn't want the republic destroyed and Caesar was selling himself to be a person without limits including having his statute carried with the twelve God's or in a ceremony\nThese were being declared a dictator was actually it's constitutional office in rush right lesson for six months lasted for six more like an emergency office right when you don't want to hear to call the shots to deal with a very important situation and then you step down yeah it's six months or the end of the crisis whichever comes first\nAnd it was a a a great amount of trust to trust somebody with a great powers that the dictator have on because they're trusting him to step down and not to be a seduced by it\nBut Caesar was made dictator without time limit at first he was made dictator for ten years not six months and then he was made dictator without time limit and that was in February of forty four and he's dead the next month\nSo I'm a people worried that he was going to end free politics\nAnd is that politics free as undemocratic it is in a way a there are a multiple candidates for office but they're all from the same class yeah so you can vote you can vote for a Clinton or you can vote for Rockefeller early on you know\nA it's a ... ... ... the ... the emperor ship and want to use that term was a ... institution in Rome he cannot appear as a a total dictator outside of room\nAll the stature show him wearing armor or naked which was the other thing the Greeks like that it's called heroic nudity\nYou get that as well\nSo she had to be both\nOctavian was able to do it Caesar was not a Caesar's unlimited appetites we're clear to everybody and one of the reasons he was killed was he was leaving to go conquer the ah the Iranians and would be gone for a long time and would be his regime would be settling in\nWhile he was gone so they wanted to kill him for that reason too\nUm but I I Would I Would say about this that the level of distrust that's created by people not accepting limits on their behavior or can wreck or a republic public depends on for instance\nUh if you lose the election you lose the election that's all that happened a you're not threatened with being imprisoned\nWhen Trump did that to Clinton threatening her with imprison this was a violation of the limits on behavior that had been established for two hundred fifty years that you don't do that\nOr you'll see that as Trump being Trump just that's what Trump's can't tell you anything that guy says seriously\nUm through cities writing two thousand five hundred years ago the Greek historian Greek historian set on on the island of ...\nA a debate in the ... in the assembly before the people on whether to ally with Athens or not and with one side winning the other side then takes the winners or to court for on various trumped up charges ah\nAnd fails to convict them so then those people take their opponents to court and do does convict them and then the opponents assassinate those who\nUh had won the victory in court some have political debate in the assembly division leads to use of the court's ... the weaponized in the courts against your enemies and sue city says this is how things collapse\nSo when Trump said that I went oh my God\nYou know ... to cities with go I've been here before\nI've seen this myself and here's where it's gonna end up because he didn't he saw the end of democracy in Athens and that is yeah um [noise] although it was restored so it was a by violence by violence\nUh and and those people are are heroes and people and restored them democracy where ordinary people who who who did that\nBut I I I think again the issue becomes distrust and and\n... a republics need trust I Know I'm gambling on but it can give you a two separate sets of information [noise]\nUh since Nineteen Ninety two every American president has been viewed as ill legitimately elected by one group or another\nAh Clinton a Bill Clinton was viewed as a legitimately elected because Ross Perot took twenty percent of the vote from Bush a senior who would that have one\nAh Bush junior and two thousand was it legitimately elected because of the he actually lost the election and the in popular vote and then there was a terrible business with Florida and says\nPresident Obama was considered a legitimately elected by people with already been born in Kenya and therefore legally could not be president\nAnd Trump or was elected and there are lots of people who say he's it legitimately elected because Clinton won by three million popular votes so we have now had a sequence since then or twenty five years\nWhere some large group within the American population views the government as illegitimate either from the left or from the right\nThat's very bad for republic that creates polarization and creates splits creates people not only differing politically but beginning to hate each other and feel they're being cheated where somebody is cheating so that's one side\nHow things used to work is this way or Bill Clinton deep Robert Dole a for president in Nineteen Ninety six\n[noise] and after the election or Clinton invited to all to the White House and said I Know you're interested in the issue of refugees in the Balkans\nI Want to make you the president's special representative on refugees and the Balkans and I'll give you wonder if they're forced to what whatever it is\nAnd [noise] dolf said okay I'll do it\nHe was interviewed on I hate to a station which shall not be named and the interviewer said\nWhat are you doing working for Clinton she beat you and Dole who's a representative of the greatest generation to generation that we're in World War two and then also defeated the Soviet Union he ... he says to the interviewer\nThe president of the United states was my political opponent he was not my personal enemy after the election he asked me to do something for the country I agreed to do it what the hell's wrong with you\nAnd the yeah with you and I'll be all said said yeah and he's had a bad temper and and\nThat person the interviewer is the voice of the future\nYou know very few people like Bob Dole anymore I'm not that I voted for do an issue [laughter] but uh ... this is people who accept limits and cooperation as the essence of the republic\nAre in conversation with Arthur ... professor of history and distinguished university professor at the University of Maryland College park\nIs a professor of history of the ancient Roman world and he's the author of a number of books in his latest book which is not on this topic but we had him on about a month ago to talk about is called Batman rising how's the weather underground beat the FBI and lost\nLucia and he also has an article that came out recently in a book called the chaos in the liberal order called aristocrat see oligarchy and Trump so here we are in the situation right now and I think is pretty remarkable and I'm curious if you see the parallels anytime in the ancient world\nWhere you have what seems like government entities going after each other and\nMaybe this is related to what you're talking about\nUm with ... and and and uh the the threatening or even in the printing of ah your your political opponents but right you know you you you see what's happened in the house intelligence committee against the FBI the Trump against the FBI but you see out Democrats are responding to that the eyes responding\nAnd almost ... I'm getting a sense or not that these were perfect I mean I was on Capitol Hill ten years ago covering congressional hearings almost every day but I've never seen what really seems like\nMaybe that destroying the McCarthy Era or by just a pure weaponization of these entities\nI I agree Mitch I've never seen anything like this either um even in Nineteen sixty eight or maybe in Nineteen sixty eight but not since Nineteen sixty eight sixty nine\nIt isn't just trust in the institutions um and that means the reason for that just trust a of but certainly being weaponized by Trump is\nThat those institutions are not responding quickly enough to the needs of the population as the population sees it\nUh and um [noise] the Senate and room there used to be no alternative to the Senate so people went along with them being clumsy and slow\nThen people began saying well the Greeks have alternatives to this kind of republic one of them as somebody who's given a lot of power to get things done quickly\nAnd after a one thirty three after the ... who are saying we can have land reform we don't have to wait for the Senate to vote on it because they never will because there are large\nLand owners they don't want reform high\nThe Tribune Liberia's crackers will offer you land state owned land so that you can get back in to get back in the\nUh on the countryside and have small farms again uh once that happens once there's an alternative then people are looking at alternatives to senatorial rule that\nUndermines the Senate which had a ... up to them how to such enormous prestige that people listen to it but now people are saying well who are those guys in the Senate they're just rich guys who don't care about us and of course if you look at the American Senate how many are millionaires\nYou know I'm a mother in the house not all but many many are you know so\nPeople that that was the ... and how we ended up getting the Tribune or the platforms right and we say Tribune's interest in the ... newspaper all call his all things are going to be well you know what they are the notion that Oakland we had the Tribune are holding still unfortunately does the paper ah\nBut but but that said Tribune was to be sort of the ... the voice of the people\nHe wasn't protects direct during a painful a ten were elected every year by the people\nUm they could not be from the old Patricia an aristocracy they had to be ... beans\nOr their house had to be unlocked and the door open twenty four hours a day in ... somebody needed help and originally their purpose was", "show_name": "Democracy Now!", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "18"}
