ago when I used to live in Washington DC so let me just put that out there if it sounds like I'm biased I might be a little bit but a hawkish I appreciate how come every [laughter] my bad how come I appreciate you taking a moment here a chat with me\nFirst can you tell them you can you tell me what this what this office was what he did well\nI mean the office had many functions um there was a political side of the work that we get you know we we took meetings with congressman and talk to them about a city and you know tell us when to you and ... and so on\nWe're speaking to how come ... ... is an ex diplomat now starting I guess\nToday the palace dying liberation organizations Washington DC office which was officially closed down yesterday night now the ambassador had already left but but workers like you\nOr had had a month to finish up I guess whatever work you still had to do ... my understanding that the vast majority of people that lost their jobs because of this close Iraq a closure\nUm are are American citizens\nYes that's right um I Believe the only the ambassador ... Palestinians and they had left a few months ago\nUm everybody else that we have the other one of us is an American citizen and I want to stress that these are American citizens with families that they support with kids in college or newborns um and as of today they're out of work\nUm so basically this also put in all seven or eight American families out of work\nUm and that's something that I wanted to run as well\nIs is considering a permanent closure of the office\n[noise] um [noise] that's all speculation a bitch because I'm\nThe legal implications of the closure of the office or the the way it was closed um was very unclear at the ...\nIt it's not something that any lawyer has looked at and said yes I can definitively say one way or another what's going on I think the purpose of really close to under ambiguous circumstances to leave the door open or it should be illegal and\nOr or at least you know talks to continue about opening now obviously any talks that would happen about opening up off the sick and\nWould require extracting a political price ...\nUm so I Believe that I'm In the future when the industry in or American officials talk to us about the opening it they will say we were we all if you do one two three\nHave any idea ... with those things maybe I Know I don't think anybody that's actually the administration come to you all and say if if you don't do such and such we are going to\nTo close this office\nUm ...\nNo I think I think it was it was a reflection not on anything that the office was doing and maybe that's why we didn't receive that communication it was a response to what the P. A. was doing in general and and that's what makes this so I'm\nSo so unfair so that you know it it they closed down an office that offering a service because of something that the\nThat the um sending government\nIs still in um so what we've seen this from this administration I mean we've seen them you know are\nWanting to dismantle honor why that provide services for Palestinian refugees around the world [noise] we've seen them um you know cut funding to hospitals that have been around since for the creation of the state of Israel\nI'm\nUsing the humanitarian a service aspect of our government to put pressure on the political and our government and that's entirely unfair because we suffering near as human beings is the actual people that require the ...\nYeah ... my understanding correct that the Trump Administration terminated basically all aid to the un agency that um provide support for Palestinian refugees [noise]\nDon't want to say one way or another I think I think it was certainly cut to a\nVery drastic degree I don't know if it's zero I Can't I Can't confirm that um\nBut by God I Can't say it reduces it but yes definitely cut to the point where there are no what is it can no longer function without 'em in mind you I I remind you and you're listening to the owner or was actually a suggestion of the United states\nI'm a U.S when the state of Israel was created did not want Israel to be responsible for the refugees its creation created\nAnd so they sided with the UN to set up an agency that would handle the needs of these refugees so that Israel can be um exempt from that international international law regulated\nThe ability of any occupied um and so it's it's just bizarre that you would turn around at some point and say we no longer want it and um it's not just about services with ... at this point it is about you know hopeless unarmed\nOn protected refugees in third countries who will no longer have un protection they will be left to the whims of any and this is a very volatile region so any group any\nYou know they're they're very vulnerable Mitch so closing down you know these camps or defunding honor what really puts hundreds of thousands\nOf you know mothers and children\nWell and it makes me think it makes me think of an and I don't know if I'm correct on necessarily who correct me but um it makes me think of the stories I ... I remember hearing the not in in the recent past of of al ... groups going into the Palestinian camps in and and shooting people up\nYeah I mean that happens from time to time and it's it's a very volatile and dangerous situation in camps so once there's no you an umbrella that handles the can't imagine how much worse than I get I mean\nYeah that's that's a quote that people neglect the actual protection of the civilians that the honorable offers\nI mean the U.S they provide education obviously and they provide food supplies that they provide jobs and health care that they provide innumerable services um but the part that gets elected if the actual protection of that you wouldn't label on such as it is\nYeah how come the stated reason for the closure of of your office was that the Trump Administration claims that the Palestinian authority has been moving to slow or not moving at all concerning potential peace deal with Israel and also that\nPalestine has threatened to bring Israel to the international criminal court how do you respond to what they are claiming\nI mean there's nothing to negotiate there's really nothing that's been offered from this administration we have been the ones that system at least since the start since Trump took power in the U.S we've been asking them to come forward with it\n... and they're the ones that have been off a skating and you know saying yes we were working on this plan or whatever it is and they haven't come back to ... for them to turn around and say that the Palestinians are willing to negotiate it's it's certainly\nTrue and ambitious um\nYeah they were actually the only party at this point that wants to negotiate um Americans don't want to see in\nA week on Israel at a time up in the election the Israelis have another election and they have a government that's really what steps are right now so for them to actually be seen negotiating ... prospects it's only the Palestinians at this moment that are saying hey guys let's save this two state solution and let's try to come to an agreement\nSo for them to turn around and turn this on us and say that we're not one single ...\n... and I'm not even getting into you know the U.S embassy moved to Jerusalem\nAnd all that um this is just you know minus ... minus the offenses\nDo you see a connection to the closure of your office to the U.S embassy moved to eastern Jerusalem\nThat's hard to pin down but the closure of the office has been something that's been in the works for years I mean even before the Trump Administration\nRather I mean in ... threatened yeah yeah I mean it's been around since the late seventies\nAnd the Congress has had you know has has requested from administration afterwards ... was his office for a while now\nUm it's only a presidential waiver that has prevented us from being bows every six months the U.S president would have to waved so Congress that close the ... but then they provided that that that the president would sign a waiver saying we need the office open for national security\nAnd every president since re assigned this wave\n'em and chill now so\nIt really wasn't an issue of you know of of what's happening now the closest officers people on the hill that have asked the administration to close down the office and declare the PLO a terrorist organization since Nineteen eighty seven\nThat's interesting so so Congress many times has tried to closure office but it ...\nBy the president each time ... ... until now until now and was this because Congress again and then the Trump Administration just decided not to provide that waiver is that what happened this time [laughter] yeah I'm\nThere the Trump Administration did not sign a waiver and then we spent really the last year wondering why\nOr how we're operating without the presidential labor but we received assurances again and again from State Department and from the White House saying no we'll figure something out we're we'll get back to sign a waiver but eventually they sent a letter saying no we want you to ...\nWhich congressional members were pushing this are though I have taken a light I I Know I'm okay do you have any congressional support\nYes we do and it's surprising because some of the congressional support that we've received were from signatories to the bill asking for the closure of the office and they'll say things like well yes we never thought in a district and would do this\nAnd you know it it makes me wonder why why would you why would you pass a law that you're expecting not to actually be ex but that doesn't make any sense oh they do it all the time how come I guess they do it all the time is just the bill happy their law happy it's too many laws\nI don't think that it's a conversion but three weeks after he became archbishop in Nineteen Seventy seven\nHis friend or a Jesuit priest who was one of the leading practitioners of liberation theology and and working with with companies seen those in in rural communities routinely O'Brien day was murdered by a death squad\nAnd\nThat particular moment three weeks after becoming the archbishop was absolutely critical for marrow\nAnd from that day forward\nHe uh refused to participate in any sort of government event\nUh he uh called for all the masses in the country to be cancelled so that they could have won alone in mass which which may not resonate a lot with with people in the United states who aren't familiar with with ... Catholicism but that was a quite a profound uh you know action to take\nAnd and from that moment on he was very outspoken in his family is ah about the repression so uh so while I don't consider it sort of conversion moment for marrow I Do think that retailers ground days dad or was it was a real key turning point for him\nWas Romero a practitioner of what we call liberation theology and and what what is liberation theology\nYeah so liberation theology is it is in some ways a blanket term and and you know there are lots of different forms of that\nI Do think that Romero was a practitioner of liberation theology in this sense um he called for um\n[noise] that he followed the dictates\nOf the Catholic Church as it had basically changed its theology and the Nineteen sixties and they called on um the church to dedicate itself to the people and and certainly in Latin America to the poor [noise]\nAnd we're marrow did believe that and he certainly did believe in um liberation from repression\nBut also in a sort of spiritual liberation um and and this is important not only for him but for people like ... who was who was some you know considered a bit extreme\nThey were always looking at it through a theological lens through a spiritual liberation that would also than a deliberation from from oppression so so I Do consider Romero a practitioner liberate liberation theology but perhaps not in the way that it's become\nYou know popularly known I mean he certainly was not you did not believe in in you know Marxist revolution or anything along those lines whatsoever even though he was constantly accused of that he saw it as a as a as a key part of his religious beliefs uh you know to call on on on the system to change\nAn important point Sarah Marxism here you is not a Marxist\nNo absolutely not in fact I he this was a central tenet for him in the in the idea of liberation theology was\nThat you know Marxism was looking you know was an atheist approach right to him you couldn't have any sort of\nLiberation without a spiritual component to it so so for him I mean everything that he did was based on his religious beliefs so certainly he did not embrace Marxism and in in that way at all but he did\nI mean he did write about Marxism and and its role in society and all of that it's the he\nBeen very critical of a certain marks the lines of thought and I think his approach to that again of all a but certainly no have you been accused of being a communist and a Marxist constantly uh but I I Would not attached those labels to\nHim and we're going to get to the trial in two thousand and four but a little more history here for background ... says the marks issues ... an important one because you do have a Communist Party or in El Salvador and that was formed what Nineteen thirty uh we we should also poor important elements\nA lot of this story and so so tell me about the Communist Party or in uh El Salvador and then of course this is where we start to see a struggle that would become the civil war [noise]\nYeah I I ... I I won't give all the long history here but but the quake version is that\nUm you know in in Nineteen thirty there was phenomenal inequality in El Salvador um which did lead to the creation of the Communist Party and all the hobbit or although not a not a big powerful force\nUm and there was a an uprising in Nineteen thirty two that was partially by the Communist Party of Salvador partially by indigenous communities\nWho were dispossessed of their land and and we're ... you know we're losing their work on coffee plantations things like that there was an uprising coffee plantations important here than it is the industry in in El Salvador\nAbsolutely and so they had grown a you know over the previous decades and was a dominant economic factor in El Salvador it at one point I Believe it was Ninety five percent of the kind of the countries\nUm you know exports are were coffee so it was it was a dominant dominant a\nFactor in these Salvadoran economy and\nThe large landowners who who ran the coffee plantations um you know essentially had indentured servants working on their land and then when the depression came and coffee prices fell\nUh those people who had been working there were a you know without work and without land and had no prospects for employment or or money and this was one of the factors that led to this this uh insurrection\nWhich was quickly put down by the military\nAnd then in the military proceeded to massacre about thirty thousand people\nCommonly known as ...\nExactly which just basically means the massacre and it is a ... it is known even in a country like El Salvador with a long history of of violence um the my tonsils still today is um is\nThe critical of that really in Salvador and history\nAnd from there and all the way up to the assassination of Romero it we ... we had to struggle going on it's not a full blown civil war as it it comes after\nRight during Romero's time is archbishop in fact the civil war had not had not started in Nineteen Seventy\nWhat's he trying to avoid a civil war well is he trying to or was he trying to bring a civil war I don't\nKnow he was he was trying to avoid a civil war I'm One of the things that's that's interesting from that time is reading um US government documents and and what the um the Carter administration at that point was trying to do in Nineteen eighty and I'll Salvador which was to hold the hold the country together\nUm and they saw archbishop Romero as if not the critical figure certainly one of the most critical figures I as a as a they called you know he's been called the abridged figure or as a centrist figure who could hold the two extremes together so certainly he was he was seen as\nUm when he was when he was murdered\nOr perhaps the key person or was eliminated and then there was a full blown civil war by the by the end of the year\n[noise] we're in conversation with a match ties and Brent he is the author of the book assassination of a saint a plot to murder Oscar Romero and the quest to bring his killers to justice\nFormerly ...
