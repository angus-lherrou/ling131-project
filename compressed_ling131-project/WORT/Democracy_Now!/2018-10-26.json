renew warm greeting from old my indigenous unknown into indigenous brothers and sisters who are working\nVery hard not to defend the Arctic produce all use what we would call off putting in a new ... to open up the ... a loss go through oil and gas development so this is one first ... but a significant one\nYou you started would sing\nOr many of its hangers had uh their rules ripped off a buildings were flooded uh I I think the air force or you know in its assessing the saying that base it's almost a complete loss\nAnd these planes that were left behind the air force as being very careful about what it says about it but the but they say that that many of them are damaged\nIs it believes to be what Seventeen ...\nSeventeen which is worse to somewhere around\nFive point eight billion dollars depending on how you account at a compare that to the replacing the entire base which would only cost about a one point five billion by the Air Force's estimation so these these planes are are literally irreplaceable and also just add a tremendous cost\nI mean you think about this President Trump has been talking about a caravan of immigrants coming up from Honduras making its way through Mexico talking about is a threat to national security\nIf people learned that there was an air force base and the southern border that was almost leveled\nThat perhaps Seventeen of vets leading on a jet fighter planes destroyed\nUm if people would say who did not move who is the enemy um in in fact what we're talking about I mean talk about the elements of this storm that relate to climate change the fact that they could move these planes that simply weren't era where the at the time but if they had\nTime the intensity the frequency how fast Michael hit the panhandle\nWell that's right I think so the air force has been been dealing with um dangerous storms that damages basis since the time when a you know the destruction was measured in blimps there used to it and I think they think that it is a a cost of doing business there's many reasons that the military wants\nTo have a airfield down on the coast in the southeastern United States the question is how do those costs change or if in wind storms become more\nUh more free when uh when they become stronger and and when the a storm surge that comes in become tire and I think because there is uncertainty here they they don't know\nWhat to prepare for and how bad is going to get but I think ten dull was really a wakeup call because it showed how vulnerable they really are\nOut at night the president is going to the dates and saying they're going to rebuild tend to\nI think that and you can argue that that in some cases rebuilding these bases could make sense if you do it right or\nHaving bases on the coast is is helpful for a couple of reasons or we want you want to be able to control your borders uh we sort of take it for granted that that we are peaceful borders right now but that may not always be the case and to the air force and all of the services have to do a lot of\nTraining or their aircraft are are really loud and sometimes they're shooting missiles in shooting down drones and they need an empty place to do it and most of the empty places that they use our over the ocean so it's hard to just say well\nWhy don't you move your basis to Ohio or Kansas or Arizona I'm a you know so so the question is\nIf you want to stay what do you have to do or\nThe air force actually has a a case study of this it has an air force base on Guam are and that ... island is right in the middle of typhoon alley you were talking earlier in the show about the the super typhoon that just hit well those types of typhoons I've had hit a\nGuam repeatedly over the years and what they've done is they've hardened the the structures they're almost you know as if they were expecting them to get bombed their hangers are are built out of a heavy steel and concrete\nOr even the base housing there is built out of concrete so that it can withstand winds over a hundred and fifty miles an hour sometimes up to two hundred or that type of thing can work\nBut it takes investment I one of these hangers could cost a hundred million dollars and I think that that the problem is is is\nWhether the military will invest are they going to get serious about this stuff and will they have support from the administration to say oh we need to be prepared for bigger and more frequent storms and so we need to to have an inch yours infrastructure that will allow\nThese basic to survive I I think those those are probably discussions that are going on right now the Pentagon in and we'll see I don't know\nI mean how they're going to rebuild\nHousing in for a number of years states upset the Pentagon is fully well aware of the threats of climate change it's released report saying it's one of the greatest threats to national security and the twenty first century\nBut you still have President Trump doubling down I mean of course in the past he called it a Chinese hopes up what is the significance ah the practical effect\nOf this denial what it means for bases like Kendall and future one that could be leveled\nDuring the Obama administration and to an extent during the Bush administration there was really a push by top leadership to prepare for climate change in the military uh that meant I'm making sure that that bases were more resilient that they were looking more renewable energy and\nAnd I'm looking more at at sea level change what I've heard from from uh people in a leadership is is that that\nPush from the White House is no longer there\nUh but there's still enough or a nurse or within this this huge bureaucracy that is the military that a lot of this stuff is carrying\nForward you know there are a lot of of smart people in the military and they get it there and they need to prepare for like you said a threat that right now is much\nMuch bigger threat to any us bases in any conventional enemy so I think they're still doing it but the the the question is will that a speed that that they carried over from\nPrevious administrations slowly diminished without leadership from the top and you know we'll see I think that watching how they rebuild Jindal and and look at other airbase as it's going to be a good test but certainly there is no doubt now that that these places are really vulnerable\nWhat most surprised you in your reporting days [noise]\nYou know so when the storms were bearing down they they brought their aircraft that they knew weren't air worthy\nAnd put them in their strongest hangers a these are hangers that it had survived every storm previously\nAnd I think they hoped for the best and they left a and when we saw the footage from the air the morning after the storm ripped through these hangers words in ribbons and you could see the planes that were sitting there now covered and to breed and I think at that point it\nIt was not expecting I wasn't expecting it obviously they weren't expecting it and I think it really showed how much things may be changing\nWell they fill up so I Want to thank you very much for being with us final question how willing with the Pentagon to admit that what nearly six billion dollars and some of its most sophisticated stealth fighter jets were destroyed\nOr are they they were not willy at all it took our of doing some ... they don't talk about it uh it took us during sleeping on the ground and and some math about where planes were another basis to figure out that there were a bunch of the missing and they still haven't given us any\nAccounting of what kind of damage has happened\nAnd you saw the towns you saw what these after twenty two is um you know what they look like\nRight right so we were able to sort of match their silhouettes in the debris\nPhilips I Want to thank you for being with us Pulitzer Prize winning journalist national correspondent for the New York times will link to your piece exposed by Michael climate threat to warplanes at coastal basis\nAs soon as democracy now I'm Amy Goodman and as we go just Fifteen miles from the ... air force base

officials later publicized meeting since social media to move critics say which is to give the crown prince legitimacy\nMeanwhile Yale University law school ... Center for study of Islamic law is reportedly funded by a Saudi\nPotential and the University of New Haven in Connecticut has formally partnered with king five security college in Riyadh since two thousand sixteen when the partnership was first announced a University of New Haven president Stephen Caplan said quote we're excited to put the University of New Haven is world renowned programs and criminal justice national security\nForensic studies at the surface of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia is next generation of security professionals\nWell democracy now reached out to Harvard and MIT to the University of New Haven and Yale University law schools have died last comic Center for study of Islamic law none of the institutions accepted are offered to join us\nOn the show today but for more we are joined by two people in Boston, Massachusetts your cats is with U.S Department fellow in systems biology at Harvard Medical school he wrote an article for the guardian on Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman visit to Harvard MIT\nHis piece focusing on the kingdom's close ties to us universities is headlined elite universities are selling themselves and look who's buying\nAnd in Hartford, Connecticut we're joined by Stanley ... executive director of the middle east crisis committee also a member of the coalition to end the U.S Saudi alliance we welcome you both to democracy now you're already cats let's begin with you\nExplain your response when you heard about what happened to uh the Washington Post columnist on cars show she the latest news you know turkey demanding uh the crown prince come clean on what he knows and who ordered mass murder\n'em your response to that and how this connects to Europe protests\nRight so I think it's important to emphasize that the protests started before the show be horrific a murderer\nSo when been so among was being greeted as a reformer when he visited the United states in the spring he was visiting Harvard and MIT as well an already a local anti war group here mouthpiece action was\nProtesting the visit they said we don't want this a war criminal on our campus the problem is that we didn't really know\nWhen to protest because university has kept the visit so a secret\nSo my colleague ... Peterson and I I wrote the piece when I started investigating it and we found that uh been so long was going to be hosted by the MIT Media lab\nTo one of the school's most famous laboratories and uh that visit with kept very secret people in the lab were told that if they want to access the lab that day they'd have to go through metal detectors but they weren't told why and uh\nUm on on that day I received an demos of the latest technology that MIT he\nMet with a leading university officials he wasn't demos war technologies such as the commerce robots and he signed many new partnerships with these universities and also his visit signal to the continuation of existing wants to already back then students were protesting it activists were protesting it\nAnd even after lobbying Cambridge city council passed a resolution condemning the vet and condemning the way that MIT and Harvard handled a bin ... visit and greeted him as a kind of a\nReformer as opposed to the war criminals that he is so they could show gave a affair obviously has reignited interest in that but it's been it's been going on since March\n... and you suggest that not only didn't they publicize to visit you are saying they tried to cover up the yard\n[noise] yes absolutely and you can see the contrast in the way that these elite universities talk about uh their partnership\nFor the Saudis and the way that a Saudi Arabia talks about it so whenever you have a partnership like that with an elite institution like Harvard or MIT\nThat has a very progressive and techie or image or the Saudi Government uses that on social media they use it to sort of create the illusion that they're really also a progressive governments that they're really on the same\nPage with MIT that they superficially use the same language on the other hand uh universities haven't said much about it they only put out a press release after the fact\nAnd they're trying to minimize that because I think they realize that it doesn't look good here you have a representative of an absolute monarchy coming to campus there is a devastating war in Yemen a activists are being silenced and thrown in jail in Saudi Arabia\nSo it's not a good situation and universities no that viscerally but they want the money and they want the prestige of affiliating\nAh with the with these ah groups I I'd also like to add though that this is not just the Saudi issue it's really um we're not saying the university like Harvard and MIT are so ethically pure that they shouldn't affiliates\nWith uh the Saudi\nGovernment but rather that a university is as a matter of routine practice\nForm on accountable partnerships negotiated in secret with many dubious actors sometimes it's a foreign government\nOr like the Saudi Government and sometimes it's a dubious American actor so for instance MIT has numerous partnerships with re fi on and Lockheed Martin who are weapons manufacturers there in the biggest suppliers of weapons to the Saudi Government their weapons are being used in Yemen\nSo the school bus that was demolished earlier this year we're forty and many children were killed that attack was an act of\nUsing a Lockheed Martin main bomb\nMade in the U.S so that's an American partnership that's also problematic and tied to the Web of on accountable um partnerships and universities for all the time\nHow did and I keep president rife respond to yard and cats\nI think that's a great question and and it's very telling their lack of response so we had a piece that was published in the guardian it's pretty reliable venue obviously after our peace uh the MIT student newspaper the tech\nPublished a very forceful and very perceptive editorial talking about MIT apocryphal see and the gap\nBetween that are as follows the ideals of making the world a better place and it's a reality of hosting a war criminal than there was the Cambridge city council resolution that I mentioned that was passed\nUnanimously also condemning the universities and the sad reality is at the university didn't have to confront any of this they didn't respond to the Cambridge city council resolution they didn't respond to our\nPeace uh they're generally unavailable for comment the only response was a MIT president Raphael rife writing an op ed in the student newspaper in response\nTo the editorial basically not engaging with these issues and just saying look universities have to make compromises it's a balancing act and we prefer dialogue over no dialogue\nOn the assistant vice president of communications at Harvard University melody Jackson declined or off for the offer to be on the show but she did send democracy now statement that ran in part as a global research university Harvard has brought in ...\nGage went in the middle east including in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and has benefited from the intellectual contribution society based individuals over the years we're following recent events with concern and are assessing potential implications for existing programs she said\nNow I Want to turn to the University of New Haven in Connecticut and Stanley Heller a our executive director of the middle east crisis committee also member of the coalition to end the U.S Saudi alliance talk about what happened at UNH in an email\n\n... we have alarmed\nAbout a year and a half to the University of New Haven has a program kind of secretive we don't know exactly what it is\nTo have it hits Henry see elite college uh that specializes in forensic and police work helping the kings fought security college and this is a college were all the police in Saudi Arabia goal for training\nWould we wrote to them we had a letter signed by nearly fifty prominent prominent Americans are telling them
