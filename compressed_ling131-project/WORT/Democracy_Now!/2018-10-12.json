statement for the United states to stand up for an American resident a who is a engaged in\nThe freedom of press the freedom of expression and is being brutally murdered at a console at a place that's supposed to be safe\nThere shouldn't be a partisan issue and I was encouraged that even Senator Bob Corker raised the question that are on so many minds why do we need Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is overestimating their strategic importance to the United states\nAnd I think this incident has forced a re examination and when we look deeper we're going to see the extraordinary barbaric and the killing of civilians but Saudi\nOf because Saudi Government has been engaged in in Yemen\nTrump just said the king needs us\nUm and but you have this growing number of Republicans like Lindsey Graham and they said if this is proven what happened to show gay and there will be held to pay as you mentioned there's Corker Rand Paul has said some things I think even Marco Rubio\nSo what would it take to get a vote in Congress in both houses\nI think we're building towards that I think you've seen a bipartisan support growing up in several things one we need to get more of the facts I think it's a a encouraging development that turkey has a video and audio evidence\nSo if what took place and I think that will be very compelling if there is a evidence that\nClearly links that killing or to the Saudi Government\nA second we need to look at what the US government knew was I raised earlier because if there is evidence that we were somehow sitting on information and didn't share and that is a bombshell and that will influence people's opinion but you see a growing sense among my colleagues\nOf at a the relationship with the Saudis\nIs not consistent with our values and isn't in our

had gotten a on board and you are of course I head of the curve and really had been sounding the alarm in Yemen one of the greatest humanitarian catastrophes\nI'm encouraged that we reintroduce there's about four weeks ago and we now have Steny Hoyer who is the number two person in the house and the chair of the ranking member of the armed Services Committee the ranking member of the foreign affairs committee the ranking member of the rules committee the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee\nFall on board with a resolution to stop any aid in the Saudi bombing of Yemen and the reason is they've seen the same reports the bus bombings killing children and women the fact that Lockheed Martin and rape beyond bombs had been found\nIn Yemen responsible for that\nDeaths of children or this was something that has done the conscience of the United States Congress and I am actually quite optimistic that certainly if we take back the house of representatives we will be able to pass

second one trillion dollar company in October second video went viral showing Amazon senior vice president telling hundreds of Amazon workers the company's minimum wage being increased to Fifteen dollars an hour\n[noise]\n\n\nAmazon's embrace of the Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage made headlines which praised by many in Washington and all over the country but it turns out Amazon's new pay structure might result\nIn law were taken compensation for many workers because Amazon is removing some incentive base bonuses and stock options\nCongressman real kind of Iran the author of that stop these those act in Congress can you talk about this latest news\nStory well Senator Bernie Sanders and I about four weeks ago introduce the stop those act\nWhich was very simple we said or if you're working at a billion dollar company and you're not making enough to be able to afford food and you're relying on public benefits like food stamps than the taxpayers shouldn't be paying for that company should be paying for that\nAnd we publicly called on Jeff Bezos raise wages to Fifteen dollars to look to the model of Henry Ford who did that in Nineteen fourteen\nJeopardy those two are surprising to his credit responded or he raised wages to Fifteen dollars I think he saw all these Amazon workers who rages wages were testifying\nAre built by the way it was panned by all the beltway economist or but it did put pressure on bailouts and I do think three hundred and fifty thousand people are going to get a raise now you're correct that they have\nTaken away or some of the bonuses and grants to stock options uh I don't think they should have done that\nI Do think that's going to hurt a small number of workers and ah I Hope they'll reconsider that but in the aggregate this is a huge raised for many many workers and my hope is Walmart McDonalds and other industries will follow\nThe salary change will not apply to contract workers that trade your salary workers the majority of Amazon workers are contracts\nThat is correct I mean it it applies to part time workers that applies to about three hundred and fifty thousand workers but it does not apply to contract workers and you raise an excellent point I mean contract workers are being underpaid not just that Amazon but\nMany places in my district in Silicon valley or wherever they are are not being able to unionize and they're not getting benefits and that's a huge issue for our society\nCongressman kind I also want to ask you about the fallout from last week's Facebook data breach announcement which continue this is the company is rushing to reassure users that there's no evidence that hackers\nWere able to access third party apps such as Instagram spot fires in New York Times which many people access via their Facebook accounts the breach may in fact it up to fifty million users and we should point out that you're a Congress member from California from Silicon Valley\nFirst um but also they grow with his intensity that really wasn't ever seen in the labs and kind of hasn't been seen seen since\nAnd so what did John hopkins do how did they realize this and then how did they start how did they take the cells and what happened to them [noise]\nYeah so they didn't realize anything I mean she just happened to walk into Hopkins in the fifties at a time when scientists all around the world we're trying to grow human cells outside of the body and it had never worked and\nSo at Hopkins there was one of the leading tissue culture researchers who was kind of at the head of the field and he was taking samples from anyone he could get his hands on any patients who walked into the hospital himself his kids as friends\nAnd basically it was just trying to grow and he sells he could and so it really was this kind of chance confluence of events that Henrietta was this incredible cancer arrived at the location where this man had been trying to do this for so long\nSo it wasn't that they targeted her that they said oh her cells are interesting she just went in for a routine by a biopsy of her tumor and they just took an extra little piece and put that in a dish\n'em and that's what became the cell line and and that she never knew about\nBut they did and they knew how valuable it was so they didn't tell her she died and they didn't tell her family is that right in fact they understood that they wanted information from her family as well um their genes\nAs well actually they didn't yeah they didn't know these were going to be valuable so at the time we didn't know anything about cells they were just trying to cure cancer there like if we can grow cancer cells outside the body maybe we can figure out why it's so powerful\nThey had no concept there was no industry connected to any of this or biology really in general they hadn't DNA hadn't been discovered yet so we couldn't know that some day they'd be able to look in these cells and learn about her family so it's important to look at this story within the context of history in that way that they they really had no idea what they were potentially discovering\nI'm more of that there was a potentially any gain in it and they didn't they didn't have any sense that they wanted anything from her family until twenty five years later in the seventies and at that point you know ... ... genome sequencing was starting and um and what they wanted to do\nIt was look at some of her family her family member cells in their genes and it was in order to learn more about the cells there was no financial interest at that point there wasn't someone saying oh we can make a bunch of money if we take samples were family it wasn't that at all\nBut they went back to her kids at that point because there were things they needed to know about human cells that they wanted to be able to learn about her genes in order to do that\nAnd did they explain this to the lacks family as they were All right doing experimentation on that\nYeah no and that's that's the key I mean there are sort of several big ethical moments in the story and the first is in the fifties they took me samples without her knowledge you know should we do that should we not that was the fifties and then in the seventies\nUm when they went back to her family it was it raises these other questions about what should you should people have to be told that when they're kind of researchers are going back to them and asking for more samples\nAnd in the fifties we didn't have any practice related to that um there were no laws saying they needed to ask that it wasn't standard procedure but in the seventies it was um at the law I hadn't had actually been written saying you have to ask in a situation like this but hadn't been codified in law\nAnd but at the time any most people would have asked and they didn't they the family thought that they were being tested to see if they had the same cancer that Henrietta had which wasn't the case so they actually saw they were receiving medical care when in fact they were being used in research and there was no personal gain to them at all\nAnd I'm Deborah her daughter asked a lot of questions in that moment about what was going on in this nobody explained it to her and to me that's the really the heart of the ethical story is is that moment when her family got drawn into research without their knowledge without their consent\nAnd then you know this continued to happen over the generations after that\nI'm In using her cells without their consent um\nAt your book is published the scientist sequence the human genome posted on line what was the impact for the lacks family and didn't you feel that constituted an ethical breach before we go to charity [laughter]\nSo right into in two thousand\n... three years after the book came out a group of scientists sequence the human genome which had a lot of value for science because you can learn a lot about the cells that way but the cells also contain Henrietta's ... personal genes [noise]\nUm and yeah they posted this on line and you know these days people take you know swabs of your cheek cells and send it to companies like twenty three and me and you get this report\nThat says everything from you know you may get early onset Alzheimer's too you know your your male pattern baldness genes or whatever and you know people often go to a genetic counseling to decide if they want that information they certainly don't usually publish it on line or how that happened without their knowledge and that was what happened with these in this moment\nWas it was the genome sequence posted in line where anyone can download it and you could learn a lot about Henrietta her kids her grandkids from that\nUm and so it was a big moment and also there were no laws saying that that couldn't happen um and in fact there had just been a commission on a bomb that had just had to his bioethics commission look at the question of whether we were in danger sort of\nThe way that the regulations were now of this being able to happen to people um and it was just a couple of months later it happened to the lacks family which is sort of what happens with bio ethical questions if it's going to apply to you or me or anyone watching the show related to yourselves your genes privacy\nIt's probably going to happen to them first so we you know and that that's one of the things that the family in that moment once they found out that it happened they said okay this is enough we want to be part of this\nFrom here on out we don't want future generations to be to have this happened to them again and\nSort of a long story short they ended up taking the the sequence off line and the un age ended up creating essentially a committee I'm with a few members of the lacks family and some scientists were now if if you want to do research and using that the genome of the hill is not the cells themselves just the genes [noise]\nYou have to put in an application and it's actually reviewed by a few members of the lacks family um to see if they feel like it's warranted\nSo I Want to bring Jerry lax why into this discussion the granddaughter of Henrietta Lacks Henrietta Lacks known around the world her contributions to medicine\nAre in measurable but not known as Henrietta Lacks known as Sheila and Sheila cells taken from her name Jerry Lewis and you understand what happened to your grandmother shelves\n[noise] it was when the ... actually came out that's when I found\nOut a lot of information about my grandmother about her tremendous contributions to science we knew when we were growing up that she how with\nThe polio vaccine we knew that she died from cancer but we just didn't know what type of cancer she died from so when the book came out and gave us so much information that\nWe didn't know that our parents didn't know who was like a generational thing where\nOne generation didn't know that he couldn't tell the next generation so now the grandchildren know every other shoulder no so we make sure that our children now so we can carry on so they can carry the legacy and and bring awareness to Henrietta's\nTremendous in huge contribution to science\nCan know you were involved in the decision of Johns Hopkins to name the building after your grandmother Henrietta Lacks can you talk about the evolving relationship between new the family and Johns Hopkins\n[noise] um\nWell we had a discussion last year about naming a building after um Henrietta Lacks\nUm you know some family members and greed and some family members didn't agree about name in a building and that's ... expecting we have a large family a lot of people all opinionated so um we were grateful that they actually move forward with naming the building and it was just amazing because I Know at one point\nLast year when we was talking about um you know what we want to John hopkins didn't do to on our grandmother one in the family members said okay well maybe they should name a wing after Henrietta Lacks or maybe they should put a bench\nNear John hopkins with her name more name a hint\nYeah the lax reading room and Saddam John hopkins but when he came to us and said okay we're going to name a building an entire building after you\nAnd your grandmother you know we was excited and grateful that actually John hopkins is honoring our grandmother in such a a fulfilling and tremendous way\nYou know you and to other family members um serve on a panel at the national\nInstitutes of health or to prove who gets to use a healer cells and their research Jerry lax why\n[noise] [noise] yes it is is to family members that well actually three in the beginning it was just too but then they added another family member um to serve on the committee and what we do is just review applications from researchers just to make sure that they meet the criteria is that\nThat has been following related to make sure that they meet what is required of them and just I mean this has been exciting just to actually\nLook at even though I'm not a science the type of person but just to look at what researchers are using the heel is\nSells for and what they're hoping to accomplish", "show_name": "Democracy Now!", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "12"}
