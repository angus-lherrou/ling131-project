get to the bottom\nWas briefed on those\nTo be very severe but we'll see what was\nHowever at when we come to the present and we come to the election of Mr Donald Trump Saudi Arabia had at as you said of course it did to receive that President Obama\nA in Saudi Arabia and frankly if President Obama sold more weapons to Saudi Arabia than any other president\nThat was one issue that they did not agree on and that is the Iran nuclear agreement which allowed Iran to be happy to stay tuned into the international community and accept are they the conditions off\nThe as they are they're agreement to stop a its nuclear program\nAnd Saudi Arabia I felt threatened by that because it felt that President Obama went behind it and behind closed doors and did not involve them in the end of the agreement or the negotiation in fact Saudi Arabia at that time wanted the United states to bomb Iran to gather with Israel\nAnd I wanted to keep the momentum of their rivalry and they and they uh uh antagonism between the U.S and Iran to make sure that it had the it is the only\nA regional power that the U.S could rely on and its relation with the rest of the Arab world\nAt but this agreement went ahead and the relationship went into some kind of um attention at the time until the election of Mr Trump who wanted to turn the page and reverse all this agreement\nAnd he felt that there is an

a kind of neo liberal economy in Saudi Arabia but at the same time\nThat are the political issues as Saudi Arabia is and missed it and then you project\nAnd in a new projects to actually reach some kind of agreement between the Palestinians and Israel\nAnd I'm from the perspective of Mr Trump or Saturday rolled is extremely important so for example when the uh American and us embassy moved to Jerusalem and and that was an agreement that Saudi Arabia would not make a big fuss and in fact it didn't make a big part\nSo there are economic issues in this relationship strategic and also the political aspects of of that tradition should not be ignored\nHowever I think at the moment and um I met this man on the Saudi regime are increasingly becoming an in an embarrassment and the burden on that partner especially the U.S\nBecause the world and that civil society of human rights organizations are very vocal and condemning\nThe abuses that take place inside Saudi Arabia and and that for public opinion is shifting\nAnd ... and ... and ...

it's about uh whether freedom of speech is respected in countries like Saudi Arabia and many many other countries not only in the Arab world but elsewhere\nAnd if if this kind of pattern of behavior continues in that place that both about upholding democratic values the rule of law\nThe separation of powers that if that is not happening in the place where it it should happen then I think we have

achieved a victory or no war let's remember that in Nineteen Ninety\nOne when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait the Saudi regime had to invite five hundred thousand troops to defend itself against a possible invasion by Saddam Hussein\nAnd therefore the Saudis are being now is is using Yemen as a training ground even if it doesn't achieved victory that it's still a battleground where they practice\nAnd practice kidding in Yemen which is which should not go on checks and unfortunately the the night the states and Britain at the two countries that are actually extremely heavily

this just the second time that you've been invited there you've enraged\nAnd Netanyahu the Israeli prime minister\nIt's essential for us to try and bring about and and for the occupation it's a reality that is so well documented all of this was happening in broad daylight in the sense that we have with them as in working on this issue for more than almost Thirty years already at this point\nNow have this place where I Would have agreed with the prime minister is that we would have wished that we would have been\nThe short episodes in our country's history we want to exist only as long as the occupation exists and our mandate is to bring about an end to that reality but of course this has been going on for more than half a century already and the only non viable path that we identify\nTo change this reality also because of the huge imbalance of power then they'll get by with the stadiums and they're ruining Israelis is through assertive international action and that's the voice that we had been repeating already a number of times in recent defeat in recent years\nAnd the one place the most important place perhaps on the planet to assert dots points precisely to the U.N

when I talked about the casualties\nPosting dead in the number of Palestinians who had been shot and injured by Israeli forces\nThe entire situation in Gaza in many ways is getting closer and closer to a humanitarian catastrophe in some aspects we've already arrived at that point but I think usually when people discussing the theory and a calamity is it's a result of some natural disaster\nIn Gaza everything's we're seeing as a result of consistent policy that's been applied by this point already for more than ten years and discussions of issues such as that is the right thing quality of
