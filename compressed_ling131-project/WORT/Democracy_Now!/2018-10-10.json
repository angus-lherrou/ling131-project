studies and director of the center for media in citizenship\nAt the University of Virginia She is the author of a new book that we are going to be conversation it's called anti social media how Facebook just connects us and undermines\nDemocracy sea of idea knocked on my very complex for me to a radio station thank you for being here thank you so it's a pleasure so again you're are you you just look at Facebook not not social media in general the Internet in general but but just Facebook is adjust\nFacebook from it's mostly Facebook that's the problem so Facebook is so much bigger so much more pervasive than anything else Facebook is to point two billion users around the world two hundred and twenty million users in the United states\nUh it is the by far the number one social media service in the world um if you go through the top seven social media services in the world I'm a four of those seven are owned by Facebook\nTwo of those seven only operate in the People's Republic of China so you might even considered different market the remain the remaining one is YouTube which is owned by Google so [noise]\nYou know really a Facebook is everything it's Facebook at Facebook Messenger is Instagram it's what's out there all face of products\nUh in contrast Twitter which we often try to group with Facebook has very little impact in the world don't tell the president raised about three hundred million people you're not even for the president [laughter] it does in a in a weird way so not because actual human beings are attached to Twitter in any significant number\nYou don't want it to work and you don't you don't want to ... to well I mean you you going\nDepth and ... and how Facebook\nCreates division between people and create so these are my words but kind of put us in our own tribes as to how to write and and um and reinforces the sense of reality that [noise]\nYou know we all love being told that we're right we all love being told that were smart and we all love being told them are beautiful and\n... if you use space for long enough your news feed will be a constant uh array of positive reinforcement you know people people who agree with you I'm telling you that you know what you're doing\nPeople who love you telling you that your kids are doing great right um and that's not to minimize that yeah that that's all good like we we could all use a\nOf a few hogs are here and there even if even if they're through these tiny screens and editor century our hunger for contact our hunger for community is a real thing and it's something that we could address\nThrough actual human kindness or investing in our institutions that provide forums for deliberation and community\nBut instead we outsource it to this company that decides to simulate some thing like that and you know that that's something Mark Zuckerberg solve these problems in the world that people are lonely and people are disconnected and\nUh people could use a little bit by a positive reinforcement um and he decided that he would create a platform of software based platform that would\nUm he thought fulfilled those needs but in reality merely simulate some sort of solution to those in the way the potato chips pretend to be food Facebook pretends to be a community\nYou know it's off with one when potato chips and that's exactly right and that's by design and this is a uh in Silicon valley it is a standard idea that you build your service in a way that I'm a affects people's systems\nLike a slot machine a few ... machine casino right you give them just a little bit of a reward and the potential for a bigger award and they never move from that chair they just keep hole and pulling the lever and that\nThink about how you know anytime you're bored anytime you're stuck at a station a subway station or a bus station or you're\nIn line somewhere you're like pulling it out and checking your ... your Facebook and and you just never stop and you scroll through it and it becomes this constant flow of stimuli but little level stuff right nothing you encounter on Facebook is going to a rocky or world necessarily but you might giggle you might smile you might cry you might get\nMoved a little bit and you might click like which is the least anyone could ask of you [noise]\nYou know so little and I I actually I think it's like a big bag of potato chips or throw you\nI mean I have found if I'm On it long enough that I Will\nAlmost feel like I eat tobacco protests writes you feel just horrible right like what did I Do at the last hour of my life sorry I did that arise right and you know I Know in the book and I actually in my classes and my students often compared to like a cupcake now everyone's had like an awesome cupcake at some point right\nA cupcakes has just made its it's made with craft and care and and if you eat one\nAnd it's so such an experience\nUm look it's not nutrition or is not going to but it but it's like a significant part of your day like oh my gosh my day I'm going to tell you about this ... nobody ever says that about a bag of potato is rich enough you're not going to eat too writes right exactly\nUm and you know I I I I think\nThat's where it's really important to understand that our experience of Facebook is a lot like a bag of chips it's low level pressure a pleasure\nLow level stimuli uh but sometimes it's actually pleasurable right so if you're the subject of harassment or if you are encountering a barrage of bad news and the world you can start to express yourself on Facebook in a\nIn a way that um you know indicates that you're not happy and Facebook's watching that Facebook is watching everything we do monitoring our moods and and actively trying to structure our moods\nTo be happier because if we're sad when we use Facebook we're going to use it last so Facebook is constantly studying us both individually and collectively and constantly adjusting our news feeds to give us more of a thing\nDoes that make us happy or we say make us happy more potato chips or you know and ultimately in the end that's what they want more I'd help or longer it's ... it's what they want it helps their advertising it helps their bottom line\nAnd that helps the business wing Facebook but they also believe there is no tension between their business success and and the bed and benefits to humanity\nThis is the weird thing about about Facebook Google and a bunch of other companies you could include Starbucks and this you could include whole foods and up before Amazon bought it this con conviction that there is no tension between commerce\nAnd the good life right that that in fact commerce is a way to the good life and that\nThe fact that Zuckerberg and Facebook have become incredibly wealthy is a sign of their grace like the Puritans used to think right\nThat said oh the very fact that my business is thriving or step my fishing nets are full of fish it's a sign of grace from God and therefore I must be living right I must be satisfying God's Plan\nRight that puritanical notion if you use the expressions of it again in Silicon valley like well of course look at the two point two billion people use Facebook they must be helping us\nThey must be doing well but the key is\nEvery one of these two points ... billion people benefits in some way from Facebook Like it's it's good for almost every one of the or they wouldn't be on it right by use Facebook because it's good for me but it's terrible for us you do use it I Do well I have to because I study it right I mean if that's true yeah you know when I was talking about it but also they use it\nFor personally I Do I Do because well first of all because not using it wouldn't matter like Facebook wouldn't care I wouldn't change its behavior if I didn't\nUh I Do take long breaks because it can really dragging me down um but especially if I have a deadline or something but but look a to point two billion people use Facebook um if everybody who bought my book quit Facebook tomorrow Facebook wouldn't notice\nUnless somehow I sell to point to a billion bucks which is going to happen right or if a million people quit in the United states tomorrow\nFacebook would make up for that number\nIn Brazil Indonesia and India within six months\nProbably sooner actually you know two point two billion people that's a lot of commas that's a lot as heroes and it's growing all the time and the places it's growing are places outside the reach of my book outside the reach of my voice right now uh they're growing in places like India and Brazil and Indonesia and Thailand\nA and a and Hungary or places where democracy is fragile and places where nationalism is deadly in many cases right ah and ah and that's really why we should be worried about Facebook\nLike I said when I was preparing for our conversation last night and going through your book I did say to myself okay let's let's see if you can go without for the rest of the night without looking at your Facebook account just on your phone by thinking that it's such an\nAutomatic rifle I couldn't yeah I did five more times before rather bad even once in the middle of the night I Can't remember right right uh you know look at his side and write it gives you that it does feel like an addiction it can it can it's at the end because it it becomes a habit if nothing else right\nThere in these studies about the enemy is is like a little bit of doping mean and and I love absolutely there have been studies about it\nThere's a lot of differing um conclusions about the overall effect on people's mental health and wellbeing\nAs there often are with these things right so I was on will and I didn't write about that stuff in my book because I ah perusing the literature um I didn't find a safe conclusion to make I found different results from studies that I Will not qualified to interrogate [noise] um [noise]\nBut there are people who have made the case that uh you know excessive use of Facebook is dragging this out is is a harming our mental health and our social relations\nI'm not willing to endorse those findings yet we may get their um uh but I see a very clear effect on a on our civic spirits so that's what I focused on what Facebook is doing to\nTo the spirit of democracy to our ability to understand the world to our ability and willingness to actually examine the problems we face\nFacebook makes it really hard to think collectively about\nAre common fate and I ... at this moment with the polar ice caps melting I Can't think of a more important\nChallenge [noise] his letters in politics than we are and conversation with the the ... nuts on is the rubber a Robertson professor of media studies and the director of the center for a media and citizenship at the University of Virginia is the author the book anti social media how Facebook disconnect\nConnects us and undermines democracy I Want to get back to your example Myanmar and democracy and how Facebook works and something that I have become aware of just with my own Facebook feed and I'm I'm In the media\nYou know a lot of people in my feed but I also um have a lot of people who consider themselves progress is on the lab that that political environment\nAnd even with that group even with people that are mostly agree with sometimes I'm alarmed of what I see is is what I take as a mob mentality kind of like an online mob mentality and I've always had to say and I I never trust 'em up\nEspecially if I agree with it [laughter] good um and I've seen it I've seen it you know somebody does something wrong says something wrong and then next you know and it almost seems is a vigil sort of response where everyone has to comment and just show more and more anger and it gets into this frenzy and I'm Glad it's online and not physical ... I don't know what avenue we're\nThat a better model is that a better model of helping to put everything up chronologically and you'll see\nSo it's not better for the bottom line is not better for measuring engagement but it's healthier for society and for people but ultimately what I concluded with this book was\nFacebook is a really bad idea and the first place we were better off before it we'd be better off without it but we're never going to get rid of it it makes too much money it's too influential it's too important in people's lives were stuck with it\nWell let's let's let's look at the other side of this and and nothing he I I agree with everything you use your head\nBut I also think about other some of the other side of positive things things that I interpret as positive black lives matter and hash tag me to write or women's march runs Marge or just the ability for people who usually never got a lot of press coverage from traditional press\nAgencies whether you're talking about gay and lesbian community disability community transgender community or whatever it is\nSuddenly their voices are now involved and their voices are being shared and that I think I I don't think that would have happened with with out these types of tools\nOkay a much of that would have happened in the pre Facebook\nInternet um so the notion of pull a version of voices which was lucky if you think about like the greatest communication challenge and the twenty twenty century it was about bringing marginalized voices\nTo a place where they can be taken seriously that's what this radio station was all about and has been all about it's a dark career raised entire time with us um but look you know I grew up in the Nineteen seventies and eighties when it was three white guys three old white guys on the networks telling us what was important in the world\nThe virtue of that is there was a shared sense of what was happening in the world do the great cost was that we were not allowed to see other arguments other points of view in other parts of the world that weren't of interest that he's three white guy\nThe U.S has bought exactly right so what we had them for a very brief time between let's say Nineteen Ninety eight and two thousand and eight roughly the time of the world Wide Web breach in critical mass and much of the world\nAnd existing and most of the world and the rise of Facebook as a as a Republican available service Nineteen Ninety eight to two thousand they ten year period\nWe now we were during that period of time we had the worldwide Web where it was cheap and easy to publish where one could find an audience that one couldn't find before so marginalized voices had a way to cheaply published it basically is there a marginal costs and if you were good at what you did and you found a voice\nOn human beings would make the active decision to a redo or watch you engage with you and link to your pages which would then signal to the rest of the world this is important\nI think that was a really good model like those ten years we had a pretty we were lurching toward a much better ecosystem that would've allowed for more voices but I'm reasonably\nA structured deliberation we have the potential you know a lot of work to do on the deliberation part\nBut that was a problem people were trying to solve like how to how to keep the crazy people out of comments was like the biggest challenge of the blogosphere if you remember right but I think the blogosphere was really on to something had been allowed to mature\nOr added been allowed to figure itself out we might have been in a much better situation Facebook ruined it and Twitter ruined it right so Twitter became so attractive to bloggers who are tired of\nPosting everyday to keep their readers happy I we used to run two or three dogs at different times and I quote him all once I could write a hundred and forty two hundred and eighty characters\nBecause most of what I had to write wasn't actually that important and most of what I had to write with links to other people's stuff and I can accomplish that on Twitter\nThat was a bad move for everybody to have done right so we had we never had Twitter I think we would ever rich or a mode of communication and Facebook has completely destroyed it because it allowed everybody thinks that they were creating their own blog ...\nFact all we were creating was this walled garden this gated community\nThat benefits Facebook 'em and doesn't really give us the opportunity to deliberate deeply now with a thing as you pointed out are really valuable right black lives matter the women's march me to all of these movements have benefited from Facebook and Twitter but they might have worked\nBefore and without we just can't run that test but let's remember social movements have thrived\nIn places without these things and at times with that you're saying so that's that's important to remember\nThe women's march there was a good case because of the scale right the women's march was unnecessary sounding collection of active focused to people who put themselves on the mall in Washington DC and in public spaces all the United states with something like four weeks notice yeah\nI think that's a pretty good indication of the power of Facebook because it was almost all down on Facebook and here's the thing Facebook is brilliant and powerful for motivation but it's terrible for deliberation so you mentioned things that you agree with and I agree with\nAnd and I think we can safely say that those things work better and faster because of Facebook\nBut they also face was also crucial and filling the streets of my town Charlottesville, Virginia with a bunch of violent Nazis in the summer of two thousand Seventeen are so again it's great for motivation and organization it's terrible for deliberation\nA Democratic Republic needs both motivation and deliberation we need to spaces and the opportunities and the norms and the habits that allow us to get together\nAnd work through our challenges in our problems even when we differ with each other based on a an agreed upon set of facts and we've let those spaces collapse or rust we've let those habits and mussels atrophy [noise]\nIf we really want to save our democracy we have to work on deliberating better we need to reinvest in the media the spaces the\nAnd organizations that can allow us to deliberate about our problem\nIt's about schools libraries museums or community radio stations right we need to pour money into these organizations oh yeah so that we can actually have decent deep conversations and not learn about the world through this flurry of stimuli and\nHonestly I may ask you though hum because one thing we wonder what the future of radio actually is and maybe they'll just repackage the radio signal for something else wants his All right um but is is there a reason why on radio you can ... and I'm just used where yeah I mean as an example\nThat you can have a longer deeper conversation then ... and get\nWith somebody and Lincoln ... a pod cast on line\nYeah and not all radio right so uh you know a ... am sports talk radio you get a lot of yelling you don't get a lot of deep deliberation right and um it really is about the political our economy of of\nThe service right the fact that um look people listen to the station because they want these long deep conversations with interesting the whole planet ... we'll see you know the tests and we want ... and um and we know that not enough people\nAs many as we would like choose to engage with that um but to capitulate to other market forces would be to to to undermine the very principle that we're trying to operate under you know that's why we need to invest in it we need both public investment and community investment um and we need to actively promote\nThose sorts of forums that actually can help us lead better lives\nLook in Nineteen sixty nine the Cuyahoga River caught on fire outside of Cleveland it came at the uh you know after about Fifteen Years of a growing environmental movement in this country but\nFor several nights the entire country watched that river burn on TV and it in a really short period of time like three years this country pass the ... the clean Water Act the clean Air Act and establish the environmental protection agency and\nThe country and the world is much better because of that not as good as it should be right it's been dismantled largely over the last couple of months actually um but you know we're just so much better off but think about what happened in those three years the country had a fervent debate over how to do\nEnvironmental crisis there the ... or whatever was on fire that's like that's like something out of Greek mythology right I mean it should never happen right so um\nSo we sat about thinking seriously about serious issues on some people propose market based interventions and other people will propose a an elaborate state enterprise like\nLike the EPA and other people said oh you know maybe if we just uh sue companies and I use the legal system or we can create a disincentives depleted we ended up with something of a hybrid system but but we actually had a debate about it and we move forward with policy\nAt no point in Nineteen sixty nine\n[noise] did anyone set up and say I don't believe the river's really on fire I think that was faked had our media system allows for that we meet and might never have gotten to that serious policy\nDebate and deliberation because we would have been stopped going what are you talking about of course there was on fire and all the members of our rate the company would have emerged that's where we are today a coffee so whole world is on fire is everything yeah\nThe hecklers veto it gives me everywhere and he was in Puerto Rico I think we do right instead of saying what can we or should we have done better with Puerto Rico after the hurricane\nWe can't get beyond you know X number of people that are a\nNumber of people that I don't mean well how foolish does that look if one person died in Puerto Rico was too many [laughter] I mean it does matter that it was so traumatic and that thousands of people died in Puerto Rico and a lot fewer people died in Houston that's not a", "show_name": "Democracy Now!", "year": "2018",
