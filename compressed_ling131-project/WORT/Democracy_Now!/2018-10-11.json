change released an alarming report\nThat some of the most dire predictions of climate change some of the early ones anyways will occur much earlier than previously thought about twenty two years from now report said that the current rate of greenhouse gas emissions stays consistent until you're twenty forty\nYears well worn by one point five degrees Celsius or to point seven degrees Fahrenheit on average results could be profound mass food shortages more tree wildfires and a complete loss of coral reefs to veterans\nStay on this latest report I Am joined by one of its authors Christie ... she's a professor in the department of global health school of public health at the University of Washington she was part of a team who put together in particular chapter three of this report she joins me via Skype\nChristie bite is my very good pleasure told me this radio program thank you for your interest in their report yes well obviously a very important to report 'em but let me ask you right from the beginning what what has caused this shift to talk about twenty forty rather than\nRather than later and what are we looking at before this report came out when we start to see a one point five degrees Celsius warming\nThat's an excellent question if you look at the history of the understanding of how emissions of greenhouse gases or change our atmosphere and what that means for people ecosystems livelihoods our societies that in the beginning of the way the climate models work\nEvents also affect crop yields mentioned the heat waves and Europe in two thousand and three big declines and crop yields because of the high temperatures related to that there's also research\nAnd many of the animals the chickens and others that we rely on for our protein are pretty sensitive to the heat so when you have heat waves that also affects the animals we rely on and then another issue is that the\nCarbon dioxide that humans are emitting through burning a fossil fuels through deforestation are affecting the quality of our cereal crops particularly rice and wheat that under higher concentrations of carbon dioxide\nSo way these plants grow and take carbon in from the atmosphere means they have lower protein lower micro nutrients such as iron and zinc and lower ... vitamins\nThere's about eight hundred and Fifteen million people worldwide who are food insecure and about two billion who have micro nutrient deficiency so this is deeply concerning\nThat the quality of our food is going down\nBut it's really interesting to me is that already happening is that something that we can measure this is something based on quite a number of experiments that put carbon dioxide at higher concentrations over crops\nAnd I am in the process of submitting an application to do research to answer that very question\nIt does need to be answered why does understood about plant physiology tells us yes that has likely already occurred\nWhich means that affects everyone to donuts you get out of the donut shop in the morning on the way to work all of us are being affected by the quality of our food\nIt depends of course on how much you rely on rice and wheat for most of your calories the poor tend to rely on carbohydrates\nIt's much more than those who are wealthier and as you look at the lower and middle income countries even today in Bangladesh three or four calories comes from rice\nSo this is a impact we published a paper a couple of months ago that as carbon dioxide increases in the atmosphere could affect six hundred million people just in parts of Asia\nAnd so just understanding and that's interesting you're you're you've been doing a lot of research on on this very issue the the idea is when there's more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in the air plant actually grow quicker grow faster but in doing so aren't ... don't have as many nutrients as the otherwise would correct that's the dynamic\nYes people understand that carbon dioxide is plant food because the plants grow faster that does not mean that they're better for us\nOne other area like to talk to you by your report is about the prevalence of diseases that will probably occur and I and I think you you'd say ... has already occurred and the spread of disease\nIs that there is a disease is particularly the infectious diseases carried by mosquitoes\nIn ticks that as temperatures go up\nMosquitoes chained to a ranch it's warmer they move into places that are compatible with their preference for temperature and humidity so we are seeing changes in the geographic ranges of a number of mosquitoes in ticks\nCarry diseases that can be transmitted us\nThere is a very good research done in Canada are showing Lyme disease is changed its range from Canada or hissing anecdotal evidence from mountainous areas like ... for example parts of Kenya where malaria is changing its range\nThere's really no constraint on those mosquitoes changing their range when the temperatures go up\nAnd what's particularly concerning is the projections suggest that will see changes in geographic range in the United states of um\nCalled a decent chip time also any tell the pick this and these both species as eighties\nCan carry dengue fever can carry Zika and they can carry chikungunya\nEnd projection suggests that by oh towards the end of the century we could see those mosquitoes spread well into the mid west\nWhether or not there would be seized transmission depends on how warm and how long the summers are so typically the projections suggest that we wouldn't see disease transmission although we would see the mosquito in those regions\nAnd then last year breeding colonies of this mosquito were found in Toronto Toledo and Detroit casting once again we're under projecting when we might see changes in geographic range and preparing for our\nConversation I watched the speech that you gave a last year and you do I'm In which you were talking about the the spread of disease connected to mosquitoes and talking about human systems connected to the human systems in particular the used tire business mating or from\nIt yeah that they will ... tires year old tires that eighty thousand picked us is called the tiger mosquito was introduced in the U.S in use tires there is apparently an active trade around the world and use tires\nI don't quite understand this but they are shipped not just from location a to B but they're shipped all over the place and typically they sit outdoors I collect water\nEighties uh gypped I ate his elbow picked us like to breed and small amounts of water they can breathe in the water and the bottom of the flower pot and sold them breathe inside these tires that are sitting outside which then ship somewhere else so yes we are moving the ski toes around the world and on friday of ways\nSignificant is the change that we've seen in earth temperature in the last hundred years I didn't move since since the beginning of the industrial age\nThe earth has warmed on average by one degree Celsius how significant has that warming been huh what type of changes have we seen up to now\nWe've seen changes in the frequency and intensity of particularly heat waves we've seen changes in the intensity of precipitation events in the United states heavy precipitation events have increased by at least twenty percent we're not seeing more precipitation events\nWhen it rains it rains harder that comes with flooding so we've seen a lot more flooding events in areas all around the world at the same time\nWarmer air will pull moisture out of the soil and so there appears to be an increase in drought that's related to climate change\nAnd then of course there's the consequences of all of these ... for health and for our society's when\nYou look at NOAA for example is putting out list now every year billion dollar disasters\nWe're seeing a lot more disasters in the U.S and and everywhere else we've talked a little bit about infectious diseases those are changing their range with warmer temperatures were saying shifts and where people are experiencing these diseases we talked about heat waves more deaths than heat waves\nOr seeing changes in crop productivity and parts of the world because of climate change\nSo we're already seeing that climate change is affecting our lives now\nFinally to do does your study ... look at the possibilities of all these changes whether it be from weather event will I guess it's all weather events are mostly um but whether it'd be from food shortages disease that this will put pressure on people to migrate and hence create migration problems\nWell there's two parts to that and I apologize it didn't emphasize this more earlier in the conversation these are all projections of what could happen you know and so part of the urgency of this report is saying here's what could happen but there's a lot that we can do\nPrevent these things from happening we can't prevent change is an extreme event we can prevent people from dying and heat waves we can make sure people are protected communities are protected when you see flooding events\nStronger surveillance programs for mosquitoes and ticks and other diseases means that we can identify early when faced mosquito show up and undertake prevention activities so people don't have to get sick so many of these things don't have to happen\nAnd that applies very strongly to migration that if Moore is done now to protect food security and places that\nAre on the edge where people than migrate because of food insecurity if we could prevent that now people wouldn't have to move if we don't do anything than the expectation is that more people will move\nIt is up to us our greenhouse gas emissions and how we prepare for and manage these changes that are coming out\nWe normally think of much later time the McCarthy years as being the period of greatest repression and American Life but I think of this actually is earlier time [noise]\nAnd I think there were two things that happened ah one was us entry into World War one which unleashed the usual patriotic fear that they're always is when our country is in a war a and the other was coming the same year the Russian Revolution which are terrified the\nGovernments of the United states and its European allies they were afraid ... was going to spread a and it also upset them because it and the Bolshevik pulled Russia out of the war which meant that the allies last\nYou know all those Russian soldiers are they on their side time down German troops on the Eastern Front so on [noise] I'm In the United states at that time of the u._s. was seven or eight years into a period of intense labor strikes were there had been enormous strikes\nA every year a and\nA state governments the national governments employers were a very easy were were were very eager to hit hard at unions\nAnd especially to shut down the most militant union the WW the industrial workers of the world or the ... the most militant and the most colorful union the United states has ever really seen\nThey used the excuse of war\nUm and then later the Russian Revolution to do this and they went after the ... in a in a horrible way [noise]\nUm they rated in the late Nineteen Seventeen every I W W office in the country there about four dozen of them they arrested more than a hundred people ah they brought a many of them in sealed box cars rarely boxcar as to Chicago ah\nHundred and one while believes were put on trial that lasted for several months uh in Chicago and then the jury rendered its decision finding all of them guilty on all counts a sent them to prison and find them an enormous amount of money which which none of them could afford\nLoses the Espionage Act that their country yeah the\nWere a couple of laws that were passed right after the U.S entered the war the principal one was the Espionage Act but most of the people prosecuted under it had nothing to do with espionage rather they were left these who's activities were allegedly impeding the war effort their deportation of immigrants [noise]\nThat's right that was a big one a and I also talk about that and the title essay of lessons for a dark time a lessons of from the dark time could also be called lessons for a dark on because I think we're living in a pretty dark one right now [noise]\nAh yeah they were um ah the the I think the most famous immigrant to get deported was Emma Goldman and who with her one time lover a long time come right Alexander Berkman was set off to Russia and a Nineteen Nineteen\nAnd of course she found Russia and its different way just as impressive as the United states and turns her back on it quite quickly\nUm there were some six thousand immigrants who the U.S government wanted to deport a briefly tell a story in the book of a guy inside the government\nToday we'd call him part of the deep state named Louis Post who was a good men cared about the rule of law and managed to prevent about three thousand of those deportations 'cause he was in a position or in the Labor Department where he had to approve\nOr any of these it infuriated the young J Edgar Hoover who compiled a two hundred and fifty page Ducey about him got the American legion to mount a campaign against him tried to get Congress to impeach him but it shows you that sometimes a decent person who respects the rule of law can accomplish\nSomething even in a in a dark time yeah and I also think of this period of time of the Eugene Victor Debs\nPerennial presidential candidate maybe the Ralph Nader I'm In day out maybe Ralph Nader is the the Eugene Victor ... of our day\nAh who ran for president as a socialist from his jail cell\nThat's right a wonderful human being a Eugene Debs the great American Hero I think he ran for president five times on the socialist ticket he was inspiring eloquent speaker um [noise] I Wish I could quote the famous speech he gave when he was sentenced to prison but\nIt's something we're has when when there is a working class I Am of it as long as there is a man in prison I Am not free [noise]\nUm and uh he amassed the largest total number of votes nine nine hundred and Fifteen thousand uh from his jail so he had been sent to jail for opposing the first World War he was still in jail for\nTwo years later in November of Nineteen twenty when he ran for president on the socialist party ticket\nSo that's an inspiring example a and he's somebody who's stance I think that goes down for us today and and and as somebody who stuck up for justice and the rule\nOf law and some of that would a president Woodrow Wilson came down hard yeah it's funny we're as animosity we remember\nWoodrow Wilson as a sort of internationalist idealist the men Christian who pushed for the league of nations and so on but in fact he presided over what I think is the greatest period of repression certainly an twentieth century America a repression of the left in a progressive forces\nFrom Joe Wilson himself\nYes yes he was not somebody who had any kind of personal tolerance for it to send a he once he'd made up his mind that the U.S was to be in this war he wanted anybody descending against that prosecuted he gave a very free ...\nTo his postmaster general\nMan named Albert Burleson the first Texan to be in a cabinet who use the power of the post office over the press which was considerable because newspapers had to reach and magazines had to reach their subscribers through the mail\nAnd a ... issued various edicts that were vague saying nobody could publish anything which was detrimental to the war effort\nPeople wanted to know delegations of lawyers came to see and what does this mean exactly he wouldn't say knowing that a vague edict with the threat of government power behind it\nIs often more powerful than a more explicit one uh some Seventy five publications either had issues that he prevented being mailed or were shut down completely and he did various other things like for example\nThere was ... because there were so many new immigrants in the U.S at that point\nOf ... there were a large number of publications in foreign languages because people came from you know Eastern Europe or wherever didn't speak English well they made a rule that any foreign language publication\nIf it said anything to do with the war or one of the allied countries they had to provide to the post office a translation and English before that issue could be male and this was a ruin us expense and in effect forced a lot of these publications out of business\nIt's remarkable how powerful the postmaster general ... you're talking about here even into the Nineteen fifties yeah yeah\nIt's true now these days unfortunately for some of us were moving away from print a and it's the people who control the Internet's a you know the country are companies like Facebook and Google that have that kind of power\nLess interesting to think about I never thought about comparing them the postmaster\nGeneral it's not and then their power is a different one I think it's not the power of you know preventing censoring this or that\nFrom going through the mail but uh of not censoring you know fake deception operations whether they're mounted by the Russians are the Chinese or somebody else or conceivably at times by forces within our own country\nYeah we are in conversation with Adam ... his latest book is called the lessons from a dark time and other essays just a few weeks from the hundredth anniversary of the armistice of World War one that's right I'm In November\nHow how how important is this period of time do you think we went and you do you your your your journalist founded Mother Jones magazine ... Mother Jones magazine um ram parts and you find that found that new but you know Rahm parts magazine that well um\nAnd you write a lot about history does is history important for you and and understanding today\n[noise] I think it is I think it is you know I Love to write about history because I liked the challenge of bringing other times and places alive and people who live in them whether somebody like Eugene Debs who were just talking about or other people\nBut I also think it's important to look at these times and understand them deeply\nA World War one has always fascinated me and I wrote a book about it uh to end all wars of the phrase attributed to Woodrow Wilson that this was the worst end all wars load appears that he actually didn't say it [noise] um and I think it's important", "show_name": "Democracy Now!", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "11"}
