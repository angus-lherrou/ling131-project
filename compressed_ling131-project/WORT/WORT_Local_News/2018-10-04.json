going on\nTo the federal society reformed in you know in the eighties by some of the same people I was talking about who who brought a very distinct ah and political vision to the to the idea of the court this was a period in which the kinds of originalism was invented\nUm it it didn't exist before Nineteen eighty a period and whichever nice as attorney general instructed the OJ lawyers just to look for opportunities to challenge on a list of specific precedence that that in his you ought to be overturned\nA and along with me or the other two were ... were the two were most prominent in in pushing this idea of a new way of thinking about the role of judges and interpreting the constitution and explicitly in order to achieve a political outcomes\nDuring that same period the federal society is formed and at this point uh for example Trump's shortlist of nominees will still be handed to him by the federal society a George W. Bush to do the same ... the Republican presidents he said simply outsourced the process of vetting and selecting judicial candidates to the society\nMay and and so you know let's talk about ... how different are they\nHe sat and what are some of the most striking thing that you heard from finding hearing well I mean I think I I was struck by the same thing as everyone else um he was remarkably emotional or an extraordinarily dismissive and rude of senators no one's ever seen\nOr I Can't really do that or any other context a witness to talk with US Senators will probably find themselves Helen contempt\nI'm a you know he refused to answer questions that we ... you have it all sorts of ways that when my generally describe as obnoxious or and that's just not regardless of the issues that's just not the kind of behavior one expects a at a Senate hearing or even during the say the McCarthy hearings\nOr you didn't really hear that kind of behavior which will be not from a guy in this position\nI think it's really important to remember there have been about a half dozen\nReally contentious nominations are going back to a car as well for Nixon Harriet Miers ah over George W. Bush board and Ginsburg ah for Reagan Clarence Thomas or an al ... or each one is different\nUh people forget for example in the ... in case\nThe Democrats were predisposed to dislike for cars Bork had been Nixon hatchet man in the Justice Department\nWho carried out the Saturday Night massacre so he came in with his baggage from ah from Watergate\nAnd people tend to forget that colored and and the Senate and the senator is of course are people of Washington more than almost anyone else so that'd be hard perceptions from the other comment on civil live very it was a very provocative choice so he doesn't have a lot of your background or scholar Iraq round\nHe was nominated to the court of appeals by only four votes a very narrow vote he was regarded as under qualified under experienced there widespread accusations that he committed perjury and two thousand four and two thousand six or denying his knowledge that certain documents had been stolen from Democratic Party\nAnd denying his awareness of the creation of the torture memos memos during the Bush administration his major sort of a one of his major credentials was the work you did for the Bush administration which is you know obviously a partisan political position right so so ... ... and finally he was ...\nBeen widely regarded for years uh uh someone really at the far right edge of the conservative legal movement so in choosing terminal before anything else came out the Republicans were going with the candidate who was a a poke in the eyes are going to lose ... who is\nExpected to be wildly provocative to the Democrats\nRight and then you know obviously it it just got more provocative from there I guess what is every democratic process and that has a goal right so what's the goal\nAs dean dump the confirmation process you know what our senators hypothetically supposed to be looking for when they're interviewing something\nRight so so this gets really interesting in a really complicated hum when one part of a story that needs to do to get focus is the complete failure of the Senate as an institution to reform its constitutional function\nThe idea of advise and consent is the Senate exercise independent judgment ... independent judgment overly question is this the right person for this position\nYou know instead we have is a highly partisan process where the members of one party dissenters from one party are automatically sent to represent the Kennedy the senator's another party arts or you know may or may not be for them to oppose that candidate\nBut certainly you know we expect all the Republicans to support this candidate or any other Republican presidents Kennedy and you'd be quite startled every Democratic president proposed a candidate and the Democratic senators proposed that person um you know that's really important\nIn a second question is one of the centers political goals in this case when there's a there's a theory you know there's a version of the narrative that says both sides are getting what they wanted the Republicans wanted a highly provocative contentious candidate who'd cause was nobody will cause a lot of trouble so they could use that as a rallying point for their voters\nAnd the Democrats got a scandal that can be used as a rallying point for their voters are both are looking to the midterms you know I I think that's a little reductionist [laughter] I don't I I think it's more complicated than that uh but it's entirely plausible that both of those stories are at least partly in play certainly there's been an awful lot of theater\nObviously this isn't a criminal court you know we're not trying\nFigure out whether or not have an eye is guilty of a crime so they can go out on the way\nThe Senate has really has failed it his mission that their phones inside of it is he is the right guy for the job not is this particular physician correct\nThis is kind of sparked a lot of conversation in popular media so I'm sure definitely in scholarly articles about\nHow to make that process better what are they things that people are suggesting are there you know ways that we could change the process can make it you know more than more true to how it's supposed to be\nWell I mean there are a little bit like question depends on you know by change would you include significantly rewriting portions of the U.S constitution I'm a model for the for example one suggestion that has been made many times in which I think there's a final and\nIsn't really an Eighteen year limited term for a Supreme Court justice\nUh I'm\nNot you know ... and if he's we're staggered terms you'd avoid the kind of situation we have now where as a matter of luck president even presidents are fully one term may appoint for members of the court\nOr so is the one that won presidential election ended up having this drastic effects are less for many many election cycles beyond its event I Would say I personally I Would favor and I think a lot of people look to this question would favor\nSort of like staggered uh unlimited long but limited terms you know to to avoid that outcome or to avoid people being around forever um it's also striking that you know we we were told\nThat none of the justices or I I I forget the exact number I think only two of them are even millionaire the email and not as familiar with anything any other form of social media beyond that that\nIs an issue um for people who are making fundamental decisions about questions like ...\nA faint and whether there is whether it's sort of a a legitimate government purposes so again I think any effort that it was made to try and break these these ... these moments where stranglehold are treated or might be a good one uh I I I Would personally you know be very happy to see a courtroom\nNot every single member as a graduate Harvard or Yale which is what we currently have\nYou know this is the type of thing that changes by an hour and by the minute but does Kevin all probably have the votes can be nominated this weekend and the next couple of days\nSo as recently as two days ago I was betting that the answer is no\nNot a lot of like I said I bet a dollar more because I was so short but this one at a dollar but the other way and the reason is that what we've heard about the contents of the FBI report and we're relying on you know very very few comments but suggests that it has no startling revelations\nUh it it neither provides certain confirmation nor nor are questionable denial for Dr Ford allegations\nAre in the absence of at the same opinion slate uh we've seen or the Republican leadership and and and the Republicans in general kind of rally around the flag or to a degree that wasn't true even a couple of days ago so that the president has come up with much more strident language I'm\nRather than candidates out in the in the field or finding this or useful talking point I think my impression is that the leadership of the party has concluded that using this controversy to mobilize voters rather than trying to run away from it is a better strategy and so whereas at one point not long ago there may have been members of the Senate\nRepublican members of the Senate or or the house facing\nReelection who said boy are probably be a whole lot better than sitting just went away I think now the political calculus has shifted but between that and the impression that the FBI report isn't really gonna change anyone's mind I think that puts us in a place where he was a regular chances of succeeding\nI mean we've been speaking last you double the amount of than political science and law professor Howard ... he has been putting that Kavanaugh's confirmation process into contacts for as likely see movement on that next couple of days and eventually I think so much for coming on the air today\nMy pleasure thanks for having me\nYou're listening to hand crafted local news here on W. O. R. G. eighty nine point nine that film please stay with us we've got lots more stories coming up in the second half of the show\n\n\n\n\nIdentify as you know being people who care about things like equal opportunity and fairness and justice\n'em and you know they're trying on the one hand to teach their children those lessons you know they want to raise kids that will be that way too uh but then on the other hand like you said you know they're they're faced with living in a structurally like on equal society and so\nThey're making decisions within the context of inequality and often times they're making decisions at least the parents and my book that benefit their own children I'm In ways that you know actually sort of contradict their their otherwise stated values are abstract values at least of\nYou know equal opportunity for example um so I think it's really it's really complicated and I don't think there's an easy answer I'm like try to highlight in the book like you've got somebody who's honest conversations that people are having\nAnd try to you know sort of pull out what's going on here and try to um you know at least offer some ideas about thinking about alternative ways to move forward in the future\nI Want to actually I'm so glad that you mentioned conundrum privileged because I wanted to read a quick excerpts from the book where you mentioned that were ... I Want to read a\nA paragraph now so are these are it starts off you're mentioning the names of some parents that you were talking with Tom and Janet along with other affluent white parents in this study who identify as progressive are often faced with what I refer to as a conundrum of privilege\nHow much work is enough how does one raise children in ways that truly cultivate anti racist practice while still receiving an earned white advantage and the benefits\nOf class privilege is it possible to raise privilege children at the individual level in a way that maps onto their ideals\nEvery quality at a structural level and to what extent these parents exert their privileges even with in this context of race and class diversity\nAnd even given their good intentions to get what they want for their children I mean not really robot home of the well I Want this but how far should I go and okay I'll send my children to these schools but when they send them to these schools they're gonna have piano lessons\nThe class after school and mass lessons after school and all these things so that if the school doesn't provided it's okay I can provide it on the side so you're not really ever in the same boat as everyone else even if you affirmatively choose to go there\n[noise] yeah I mean yeah and it's like you know I think that the biggest the bigger issue and again I'm a sociologist so Martin digging in these terms but I think the larger issue is the fact that we live in such an inherently unequal society you know we have\nYou know wealth inequality that has not across generations right so we have formed a quality when it comes to class but also of course it comes to race and so you know it's you know I think the parents and my in my research are\nYou know sort of facing a paradox because they\nYou know again they're trying to make decisions about their own individual child in this context of inequality so for example if we didn't have such an equal schools\nIn America than parents would not feel like they need to make these decisions to get their kid into the basketball if all the schools were young then that wouldn't be as big of a concern and so I think that the you know the larger sort of structural problems that we have in this country particularly when it comes to things like educational inequality\nUm are what these parents trying to navigate the individual level and I don't think that that's easy\nThat was Mississippi State university professor Margaret Truman Reagan was a ... about her new book\nWhite choose the Wisconsin department of public instruction says more than Seventy two percent of black students and MSG is classic twenty Seventeen earned high school diplomas and that's a fourteen percent increase from the year before\nNow it sounds like an encouraging number but you W Madison psychology department Jeff and re case says there's a discouraging flip side now that's the subject of a piece he authored in this week's it's messed with Laurie frost\nHenry case caught up with W our T's Nina ... earlier today we have Dr jets Henry guess on the line that he is a distinguished lecture with ah U. W. Mattis\nIn psychology department has peace out in today's if mass about achievement gaps at and and the nasty Jeff thanks so much for coming on the air today [noise] glad to talk to\nYou know um Estee is kind of touting increase graduation rates but as you go on on to say there's there's a twist you know there's the rub white is kind of the the other side to these increase graduation rate [noise]\nWell um the the other side I'm as you put it is that um our students are still not succeeding in the important areas of\nI'm reading and being able to do math um basic fundamental academic skills and so\nOur concern and our motivation for um diving into this data\nHas been to uh have an an honest conversation about what our schools are an art doing 'em and [noise]\nYou know the district um likes to ... good news when it happens um but I think that it\nIs a is a little less than honest uh for the community to walk away from a report about increased graduation rates to think that we have solved the problem\nUm because are very real and large gap exists between our students of color and our majority of students in terms of their performance\nRight and tell us a little more about that gap ... that class of twenty Seventeen over a number of years tell us what you found and you know how how much that gap exists between minority students and lights didn't [noise]\n[noise] well um [noise] the\nThe the gap that we have seen in a we've been looking at the uh for a number of years but we looked specifically at the class of twenty Seventeen um there is test data on standardized tests\nI'm from grade three through great eleven and\nUm are African American students at no point during their academic career when we've been testing them have they scored above twenty percent in terms of\nThe percent of students proficient in reading 'em or in math um the numbers are equally dismal for our Hispanic students um thirty percent or less across that um\nEight year period of time are performing at grade level I'm at the same time uh\nOn the year or the test [noise] um we've got a at least fifty percent of our white students performing at grade level um and you know the the pattern that we see in the class of twenty Seventeen\nIs a pattern that has existed for years um and so it's not just this one class we could look at um classes of students from five years ago ten years ago and we would see the same a tremendous performance gap a in our students\nRight and so let's talk about you know these students who are graduating what are some of the skills that they you know are having shown not necessarily have based on these test scores you know what what are we talking about here what these had not you know\nSo that's that's a question that's hard for me to answer um because I I don't actually know sort of what the standards are for you know on ninth grade reading or ninth grade math and so forth so\nI don't think I can give you\nHonest appraisal but the the most recent a forward test results that came out I'm actually just this week on on I think on Tuesday um if you look across the school district um we have more than fifty percent of our efforts\nAn American students performing at or below minimum or ... it's called below basic what used to be called minimal\nI'm so\nThat and it's like they're not even close to grade level performance um and", "show_name": "WORT Local News", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "04"}
