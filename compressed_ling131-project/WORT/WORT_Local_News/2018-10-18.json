past decade they've popped up popped up all over again county in front yards and parks\nLine she's the managing editor of the Wisconsin Center for investigative journalism which is that was a news story this week about immigrant dairy workers in Wisconsin or something they have been covering for quite a while do you think so much for coming on the air today\nThings a lot for having me so tell us about the ... bridges program how long have farmers been making these trips out to Mexico and and what do they do there\nSo it started around the year two thousand or so so it's been a while or and what a what they do as part of the program is farmers from the Wisconsin and some portions of southeastern Minnesota\nWill travel to the home town of some of their workers to try to get to know the family is sort of see where they are the workers are from\nIt gives them a deeper understanding both of the culture that their workers come from but also the circumstances you know the poverty and and and it also allows them to be sort of a bridge as they said between the workers who often are unable to go back home very often and the workers themselves\nA or in the workers' families in Mexico\nUm and so that's part of the program the other part of the program involves nursing students from you W O clerical come out and uh provide some primary health care to some of the farm workers many of whom are uninsured\nWord um that they um well do you know heart heart check ups and diabetes and some other kind of basic stuff but then also provide some transportation for the workers who are not allowed to drive to take them to clinics for a more intensive a medical treatment\nRate and so why is this so important what did you hear and what did you report or hear from\nFarmers and and workers about how ... especially or we'll start with the the travel aspect of this how traveling back to\nPeople's country of origin helps you know their relationship with their employer\nSo in the case of John Rose and now he's on the board there and he has done several of these trips um he said that it allows him to understand both how the motivation to strong motivation that these workers have to come here but also that the danger that they put themselves into\n'em and and it it really gave him an insight into the you know their dedication to the work\nUm and from the other perspective you have um the farmers farmers are the farm workers families feeling a connection and feeling a little sense of relief knowing that these folks\nAre who are they don't get to see very often who are working on our dairy farms up here\nAre cared for a and that they uh they are respected up here for what they do so that's the kind of cultural exchange part of it is getting\nUnderstanding on both sides of the border about what I'm this the immigrant population these immigrant workers mean to the dairy industry in Wisconsin\nRight and and so this is something that you all the center has been covering for a long time what do these workers mean to the dairy industry in Wisconsin how reliant are are farmers in Wisconsin on immigrant labor\nSo um I think one of the workers who we interviewed and Spanish a Roberto Roberto ... uh probably put it back\nShe said without workers the United states is nothing\nAnd he said we don't come to make problems we come to only work um we have you know there are national studies that show over that at least half of the workers on dairy farms across the country are immigrants and and the largest farms anecdotally the number is much much higher\nAnd of course many of these ... employees are undocumented because uh the United states does not have a work visa program for people who work year round uh in in the agriculture industry we just have a part time you know we have seasonal visas for people who come to pick her or particular crop for example\nUm and then they must return to their home country um dairy farming of courses or a three hundred and sixty five days a year you know\nTwenty four hour a day type job and what what the dairy farmers need our our workers who are available all the time uh all year to to work on the dairy farm so that's the that's a disconnect that we have in our current immigration system\nUm farmers tell us\nTo a person that ... U.S born folks will not do these jobs um there is some debate about whether if if they were to vastly increase the wage wages paid on farms whether in fact some American workers would be tempted to do these jobs but\nThe assessment of the farmers that we have talked to and and the major farm groups is that that probably would not happen and it would be\nEconomically unsustainable and the current system\nRight and and so health care is an aspect of this point is program what you know what do what is that relationship like with you know below clear and and and you know described that part of the program a little bit worse\nSo what happens is these are nursing students from you W O Claire and they are in the uh I think of it as a junior or senior senior year I Believe um and first of all they didn't learn something about a farming as as a\nBusiness as a profession as a workplace um and they learn about immigration as part of that and then they they look\nAnd about the intersection between immigration and you know the the dairy industry they go out and visit ah actually rose announced farm is the farm that they go out and visit so they see what the working conditions are like and then they come in and do a these health checks on I think right now they're up to about Nineteen farms up in the\nUh the buffalo county area buffalo in ... counties and um\nSo the the I guess the advantage for the students is they learn to work with a population that is not in primarily English speaking they weren't they are working with people who are\nA pretty low income 'em and they're working with people who have certain barriers to healthcare such as not being able to drive\nIn Wisconsin if you're not here or if you're here without documents you are not allowed to get a driver's license and so\nUh you know a lot of those folks are fearful of driving because that's illegal for them to drive and so they will forego a necessary healthcare so one of the nursing students that I I ended up interviewing I helped on the story a little bit she said that it just gave her this insight into\nSome of the barriers that people face in it also gave her the insight into how hard working these folks are you know that they you know she learned that they're just here they're working hard they're just like you and I um and so it has a a beneficial effect for the nursing students as well\nRight and so obviously as we've kind of talked about already the mission of this program is pretty starkly different from what we usually hear from the president and members of the G O P how the immigration how does the immigrant workers that you're a reporter talk to\nYou know how does that affect them this rhetoric\nWell I'm ... and the stories we've been doing over the past several years on immigrant workers in the dairy industry it's very hurtful for them to hear this kind of rhetoric especially when they're all they're mocking Barnes you know twelve hours a day\nYou know six or seven days a week or in and doing these really hard dirty cold hot you know jobs a fist\nDemanding jobs that a lot of Americans are not willing to do um and so it's hurtful to them and and I I liked the way John Rosen output at 'em and and this was a direct quote from the story he said that one of the things I hear so often from the current president is they're not sending their best\nAnd this is John Rosa now I've been to those villages where our guys are from and they sent us their best they sent us the leaders of their communities they sent us a lawyer they sent us a medical student\nThey have a great work ethic they're honest people you'd love to have is a neighbor so I think that's sort of wraps up the whole goal of the program is to try to human eyes\nAre the people who are coming here at great personal risk\nTo work at jobs that many Americans don't want to do for the benefit of our signature industry which is dairy farming\nThat was ... speaking with Wisconsin Center for investigative journalism\nManaging editor of the whole about their reporting on immigrant workers in Wisconsin dairy industry and you're listening or handcrafted local news here O W or de la ... blue states all we've got lots more stories coming up\nThe beacon day shelter has been open for a year we'll analyze the upcoming election in Brazil and told Madison talks to a local gym bay master\nBut first we'll take a quick break chicken with the BBC we'll be right back\n\nIn eighty nine point nine social gathering at the harmony bar and grill on Thursday October twenty cents from six to eight PM

point nine social class tries to create opportunities for work volunteers to hang out with one of the club gatherings are also a great way for members of the community to meet some of them were volunteers and get uh\nAnd obviously like you know it's difficult because people want to help and like it's such a necessary thing but um you know it does come with challenges because of the population and we're seeing that with police calls\nSo um it ended up not being a good fit for the ... the ... site um I think this site is a little bit different than that it's not as residential um [noise] you know there have been you know some issues with police calls and the folks I talked to mentioned you know\nKind of the growing pains of getting along with the neighbors in the area that different businesses but I'm from everyone I talk to you it sounds like things are really improving um\nFestival foods has been a really great and they were they called the mountains it's specifically I'm very charitable minded company um so yeah so it's been it's been a journey but um everyone seems really excited about the way things are going\nAnd you also talk to people about the future and what they want to see you know next year or in future years\nWhat are some things that you know people staffers and and people who work at the center are looking forward to potentially\nYeah um well the first year was kind of about\nUm what would you call it not not necessarily ... but just kind of like the basic immediate needs like shelter and housing and a mental health drug counseling alcohol counseling that kind of thing\nUm but now as people are you know building relationships and hopefully getting connected with some services that they didn't have access to previously\nUm folks at the at the beacon are hoping to kind of phase in more um like softer\nSofter services such as like art therapy pet therapy I'm\nJust kind of quality of life things um you know religious spiritual groups um one thing they mentioned in particular that they actually did implement this year was a softball team\nI'm like Madison's first homeless softball team um they said it was just great camaraderie um it was just kind of a you know something fun to do as a group I'm kind of just quality of life thing so that was really cool so they hope to do more of that kind of thing\nRight Alison anything else you we Mr or that you want to add\nYeah um there's actually One Fund thing that didn't make it into my story on December fourth coming up on at the Sylvie there is a fundraising event at the breakfast fundraiser called beacon eggs\nI'm excellent pond and it's going to feature um some of the volunteers and guest epicenter and they're going to share um you know the experiences of how that plays his

paper about um overwhelming demand at the at the began the new day shelter as it turns one year old Alison thanks so much for coming chatting with me thanks for having me\nOver the weekend for re Brazilian presidential candidate John your ... your forty six percent of the vote out of Thirteen candidates you start to freeze was center left candidate in a runoff election on October twenty ... who's voters\nPeople looking for a dramatic change in the status quo and buying into a fiery seemingly populist rhetoric\nA narrative that sells for meal you're here in the U.S W. or the bullet holes brings standing spoke with a policy professor daddy blanket ... out of the federal university of Rio de Janeiro about three\nSo Hi you're both on our has been described as a mix between Donald Trump in Philippines strongman Rodrigo do ... do you think those comparisons are apt\nI'm well both an audio\nLet let's put it this way he's not Donald Trump or right I think that comparison is completely in hopes he's only Donald Trump in the sense that\nHe's managed to kind of pull off of of a fake populists victory of sorts by appealing to people more face instinct sitting there and more [noise]\nUm [noise] you know racism and things like that sexism homophobia and that sense yeah he's kinda like Donald Trump but in terms of policies and in terms of what he\nPlans to do to the country he's very much more like ... in ... even more so there are specific Brazilian things that we fear that he will do that really don't apply to where they were to get there to work to Trump\nOr what are some of those things one of the fears that those folks in civil society and Brazil have about both an audio\nWhile the big fear now is that is going to three democratic means reinstate the zoning dictatorship people should remember that when the Nineteen sixty four dictatorship occurred it never made a complete civil break or with the government that was there before it they basically took over power\nKicked out a bunch of of congressman and university professors and everything like that and then they said OK Now we're going to you know putting in a couple of writers on the constitution and we're going to say some people can't be elected to public office and\nWe're going to put it in the military jumped out of it is going to control the country but everything else will go on normally in the constitution will go on and I'm like and then through five four and more successive what they're called\nInstitutional lax they gradually up to Nineteen sixty eight ramp up into a very hard core dictatorship but it but no time to be able to say oh we're stopping elections were never going to have elections again a president's weren't elected but you know a city council people elected state governments hadn't ended up being elected\nThe the people in charge just gave themselves the the right to basically kick anybody else that they didn't like who is elected\nSome what we think is is that\nBoth not is going to try to do something like this again but with more a little bit more of a team of democratic application he has a big enough of a he has a big enough majority in the house of Congress he will have a big enough in charting the Supreme Court\nThat you can basically rewrite the constitution however he wants without ever really stop being everything and saying oh you know we're going to have to do a dictatorship so even in the best of all possible circumstances even in the\nEven if there isn't a huge outrage and they've been fighting in the streets and big demonstrations he can literally re change the constitution you can reform the constitution anyway he wants pretty much and then of course if there are huge demonstrations in there probably will be we've had\nOver a million people mostly women came out against him because he was a very massaging as candidate and we're in the streets a couple of weeks ago then you know you know I was declared a state of national emergency in at that point we're we're in we're seriously in a in a dictatorship situation\nNo you're you're talking as if the run up and watching them or ... or a done deal do you have a ... a basement Fernando ... going to beat him in the run up\nNone at all um why why why do you have a limited and the\nPeople who voted for ... you are not going to vote for her that that's it's just that simple\nUm that would have to ... literally convince every\nBrazilian who did not vote for both NATO and the first election that they have to vote for him and the problem is is about is associated with the workers' party which is now and went through several you know prices she had a big corruption scandal which was heavily supported by global media which is the main media source in the country\nGlobal had that everyday how corrupt the TTP was the most popular president Brazilian history Lula da Silva music now said Lula da Silva was\nSealed on very experienced charges she should have been the candidate but he's not allowed to be because he's in prison and about resume that he was going to get you know votes from the ... supporters\nThat's not going to happen even thirty seven percent of his only in St Louis unjustly jailed hotdogs didn't even get those people to vote for him during the first election so yeah I think it's a done deal I mean and this is even discovered in the possibility that countries like Russia might be or even the United states\nInvolved in hacking the Brazilian elections in ways that were done in the United states during the Trump election or even worse you know we might end up finding out that that's the case later on\nAs it does about how both scenario has run his campaign and where does support come from\nWell both of not as run his campaign at the very interesting way he simply refuses to debate with anyone he was actually not a very smart person he's\nNot ... I'm so she refuses to get their first debate one of the female candidates just destroyed him and he lost popularity a so he's refused debate debate sense and then he suffered a stabbing attack in late September\nUm which we don't really know what happened I mean it does seem to have been a legitimate stabbing attack there's all these conspiracy theories that she you know he can get it to themselves and all this but I I don't really see that as being true but now he's used is recovering from the stat stat and it's actually not\nDebate he's refused to debate with sovereign ... anyone else because every time he opens his mouth he loses supporters and he's telling people what he was going to do he's he's simply not showing any plan at all as somebody who's going to do so once he's in he can pretty much do whatever the hell he wants basically\nI Would like know campaigning without you know speaking publicly without a debating where we're did his support for me I have to have some degree of popular support to get forty six percent of the vote on the run up more of these people and why are they boot while you're on an open your\nResume so unless some happiness is going on in the elections which is always a possibility but I think the big thing is this\nIs that there's a lot of people who are very upset to defeat the right now the workers' party and would like all Brazilian parties including ... parties were involved also nodded started with even more involved in corruption scandals in the tea", "show_name": "WORT Local News", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "18"}
