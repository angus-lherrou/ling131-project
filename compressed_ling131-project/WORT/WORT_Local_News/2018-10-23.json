Garcia is um\nComics and France and paintings and Daniel king is doing a video installation but during the day on that\nSaturday from eleven to for um we're renting esteem roller and we're going to do a esteem roller print mayhem so a large would lock released\nPrint are going to be made with the steam roller from eleven to for um I don't know if it's the first one but I'm calling it\nThe first ever winter steam roller printed that we're going to have our hands and we're going to have\n'em paper making stations and we'll be pulling sheets of combat paper which has paper made for military uniforms um and then we're going to have a small press David Jones in ... Maryland crops from the center from collaborative research ...\nAre bringing their press on wheels um so we're going to be able to print smaller plates as well as the steam roller cleaning um it's all the agreed event for um families kids of all ages I'm obviously we'll we'll we'll make sure the kids or with an adult near the steam roller I just think it'll be an opportunity to meet a lot of um\nArtist from around the country um who will be president to be making prince and paper\nThis exhibition is is spanning the John Rhodes mediums and and and times\nYou know from World war one as you said to modern day post nine eleven was that intentional that that this would go over such a you know long span of time\nAbsolutely I mean I think I I I spend a lot of time talking about individual events and that didn't even cover all of the events I'm ... and it's part of my thought process with this was\nYes it is the centennial celebration I keep saying celebration and it really isn't a celebration at the commemoration of the signing of the armistice and I found it really interesting\nWell developing this month of events that we often find ourselves celebrating are commemorating the entry into war um the wheel like we spent twenty Seventeen talking about the hundreds anniversary of World War one because the United states entered the war in Nineteen Seventeen but\nRarely do we find that same tore type of um\nA solver Tory passes over the end of war and that struck me as really interesting and so I as an artist and a curator who is um now teaching about um\nYou know I worked with warrior writers to teach about reintegration in the arts um and they asked me to teach about visual arts and veterans working in World War one and also in global war on terror and in in the process of doing that research I was amazed by how much overlap\nThere was in World War one and present day and so I think it's really valuable that we show these generational um\nYou know similarities we we can definitely acknowledge the differences but when you see the similarities and um what leads to conflict ... leads to war and what are the reasons for it ending or the push for the end of war we can start to see that not only does history repeat itself but we have\nThe opportunity to look at how we shape our policies and how we have um our perception of war conflict by acknowledging history and the ... and ... and that which happened before and so uh yeah I think it was definitely intentionally I mean I think\nMany of the events organically unfolded I'm too\nIn a little bit of serendipity that that happened but\nUm you know we do have a short comment well that is a response it's artist responding to World War one um and when the kids are his approach me and John which they approached me to work with them for the greatest war I was on board because I think it's phenomenal what they're doing with creating their film and and um\nYou know that the show that's going to unfold it's not only can be educational but you know there's that fine line between making some of the educational entertainment as well but I think we we can embrace the creative side to have a broader understanding of our own history\nTell me a little bit about your personal experiences with art and how was that similar to other veterans and and what how does art play such a big role for you and and for other people when returning from service\nSure well I I've I've always been an artist I could drop as long as I could hold the pencil so for me um my military service was has just added additional components to my art practice\nOr many of the artist I'm working with where in the same boat they they um were ... artist before they joined or like some of them actually left grad school um to deploy um for me um\nI think my military service has given me a little bit more of a focal point for my the creation of my body of work um I I'm not as law in looking for things that I Need to talk about\nHowever I mean when I served I actually volunteered to paint murals and ended up painting your old out in both of my deployments giant ... than concrete barriers and I'm black barriers and so I just [noise]\nAnd it was the token artists that they would call when they needed something painted and that was really nice to be able to have that creative outlet in that environment and I'm\nTo be acknowledged in an effort to do that which actually brought me to connect with a lot of my fellow soldiers because they would come and talk to me well as pain [noise] um so when I got out of the military I actually did not want to do any\nI did not want to work in LA any military subject matter anymore I had kind of written that off but the more I thought it the more on its way back into my practice and so I found ways to make that personal narrative\nUm come through and my art work\nBut I also realize the responsibility of that work as well um you know doing the veteran prep project we've ... artist with veterans to create a print and then the artist makes in addition of print based on the veterans' experiences and I\nAnd create that project because they felt it was necessary for civilians and veterans to have a conversation and are really kind of allows you to do that um but\nAdds that project has evolved over you know eight nine years\nI'm ... we have up at the overture it's called the transients of narratives and the reason I did that is this is somewhat of a retrospective of the nine years of work of that we have a prince in the archives and and I did that because it's still like\nWe often with oral history with\nConversations will document one period in time but that doesn't mean in life are story changes in life or our personal reflections of how we view our own personal narratives changes\nSo um how are we going to look at these print that were done maybe several years ago how how do we as participants eat the change in that story or a perception of what we see in life how does that change how we look at that piece of art where\nBeen speaking with that you know she is director and coordinator of the art exhibition coming to Madison next month to month long um featuring emerging veteran artists um you're not thanks so much for a chat with me\nUm so every year just inspected brush piles if you want them to be long lasting I'm helping to make habitats for wildlife\nUm you know you can rake around them and clear out and eat the stuff or you can also plant some native species around the brush piles that might grow a wild grape is a good one in Wisconsin um honey cycle trumpet Cooper um there's lots of different wild flowers that you can plant around there\n[noise] um and then very last type pulled the living brushed pile which I thought was really cool and I learned about when I was actually reading misinformation too\nI'm from the D. and ours recommendations um and I never thought about this one but if you're clearing a large area of tall standing living trees um that you don't mind having down you can actually just cut them at a certain angle flip the whole tree falls in word\nAnd then you can have multiple living live trees that as long as you don't cut the tree completely are still going to last a long time with fresh leaves and bugs and and other park and things that the other animals will eat\nUm so that's another one that you can consider so we love people make brushed\nWell it piles for wildlife um that they're using their a natural surroundings to help these animals that will definitely need shelter during the winter I said oh this is something you should definitely consider doing as a full project um have you ever have any questions about the wildlife in your yard that you're seeing a give us a call at six zero eight to eight seven three two three five [laughter]\n[noise]\n\n\n\nIn today's radio astronomy hosts that pay some kind of hold dive into how to tell which ... to life the new research is showing there might be more out there than we think here's the story [noise]\nThe debate about life on Mars just got a little hairy or\nOr maybe a little saltier Hi I'm Kendall and I'm Zach Zach\nWhen you think of the central building blocks of life what comes to mind\nWill humans need liquid water and ... and of course other types of organisms can do pretty well in situations humans would have some\nTrouble bacterial colonies thrive in hot under the fence on earth and eat all the chemicals that come out\nAnd yeast which is a fungus doesn't need much besides the source of sugar\nRight but let's talk about life it's similar to us [noise] finding those two things liquid water and lots of oxygen somewhere other than earth's surface indicates that some environment could support life like but we're used to thinking of\nOne of the leading contenders in our solar system at least is Mars and one of the main goals of all the lenders and rovers at NASA's set there in recent years just to search for signatures of life chemicals that are produced as a result of living organisms doing their thing\nBut the question always comes back to water and oxygen can we find these on Mars new research from the European space agency she just that it's very possible that both could be found somewhere on Mars\nNow to be clear no liquid water has ever been found on the surface of Mars\nBut we're beginning to see strong evidence for liquid water existing underneath the surface [noise]\nDon't pause minute isn't the average temperature on Mars about minus eighty degrees Fahrenheit why would moving underground make that any better\nIt is true pure water freezes at thirty two degrees Fahrenheit and Mars is a whole lot colder than that\nBut we aren't necessarily dealing with pure water very salty water for instance has a much lower freezing point combine that with inflation of the Martian surface and he never large possibility of liquid water only a mile or so underground\nOkay so we have evidence for the first central life water [noise] what about brie double oxygen the Martian atmosphere is only point one four or five percent oxygen compared to Twenty one percent here on earth and there was a much center atmosphere on Mars to begin with\nThis part is neat to think about once they have to first essential we build up to the next water can absorb what little oxygen is president sort of concentrating it and other living things can breathe it in\nI see a little problem though let's suppose the water worst salty which allows it to be like within the first place this water with Ben absorb less oxygen the more salt is dissolved inside the less room there is for other stuff to dissolve\nThis is true but there are other factors for instance the colder water is the more oxygen it can absorb on Mars it's a battle between how salty and how cold water is\nSince this problem isn't exactly simple researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory turn to mathematical modeling\nIt was super cool literally they're models allowed for liquid water all the way down to negative two hundred and eight Fahrenheit\nThey found that the cold salty water hidden maybe a mile below the surface of Mars could have plenty of oxygen to support microbial life\nAnother discovery that points to microbes on Mars is the president says manganese oxide\nUnlike its cousin iron oxide or rushed to the chemical that gives the soil on Mars it's red color manganese oxide is not very abundant\nIn Guinea's oxide you need either much more oxygen for the reaction to happen on its own or you need microbes do the work for you\nThis is great evidence that the surface of Mars was once home to lots of bacteria the process minerals in order to generate energy\nYes this and the discovery of a possible liquid lake of brine under the surface of Mars means there's a chance for life on our near neighbor\nThanks between again today it's based place this Saturday October
