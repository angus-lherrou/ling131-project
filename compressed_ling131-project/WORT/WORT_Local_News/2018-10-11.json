I mean they kind of separate the fibrous parts from the spongy soft parts\nAnd they use that for rope and shirts in textiles and stuff then there's also a the grain friday um\nWhich is what we grew which has a um a a smaller a stem easier harvest 'em and puts on ideally puts on\nA you know a big head of green a and then there's there's hybrid varieties which are kind of somewhere in the middle that obviously is is sort of I'm kind of the ideal scenario where you started have dual income or off of one\nCrop but you get you know you get less\nEach so it's it's kind of a it's a balance um then also there are um the CBD four ID's which are bred to have more flour and with those um those are for the medicinal market\nSure so it sounds like you're definitely going to continue to grow hemp and and do you think you're going to expand beyond Eighteen angers\nSure um I've got some spreadsheets out and I'm kind of looking for our rotation and seeing where it'll fit for next year I'm I I'm I'm kind of wanting to hold steady a little bit until I feel like I get some of the economic figured out\nWe had a lot of rain this year and a you know I just didn't get the even stand out there that I Want it where it caught it was really good and it it really um [noise]\nDid well competing against the weeds but where it didn't establish um\nI had a lot of Fox tail a amaranth development leaf and and those are those are weeds that you know have have reestablished ended the seed bank so I'm going to have a battle on that field next year I'm so I think I I Want to I'm kind of hold steady around there maybe increase a little bit\nUm just until I feel that I get my seating rate and I'm from my nutrient management kind of under control and get a better idea of what it will require um you know again\nWe we haven't grown this crop in an eighty years so to expect that we're going to which I did expect that we're going to be able to go out of the gate and and and hit it out of the park is is probably not realistic\nIf you don't mind me asking is this a money making venture yet or is it really did researchers are not meant now\n[laughter] yeah well um this year I I did not\nI did not harvest a duck or did not get enough across the field to ah to make any I didn't lose that much but um I kind of joke with my dad that this year was going to be an education and I had to kind of find out if it was an education I was going to have to pay for an hour and a ... fortunately I I Do so\nIt's it's not not yet there but um I think that once the knowledge gap is narrowed it and once we have a familiarity with it we get that knowledge back that we've lost\nThere's an opportunity here and there's a tremendous market for it I Believe or at least there will be obviously yeah do you in the future being that this would be something that has low inputs are low maintenance and and and\nHigh high value so uh I Believe that that it has potential and I'm I'm Still looking to uh to do more and learn more and I'm not ready to give up yet [noise]\nThat was reporter shall we Pitman speaking with building he was one of Wisconsin first Pico firing near me fifty here\n\nOne man show\nBottles\nI got\nOn your\nFriends I'm\nThe\n\nMom\nAnd\nAnd then a lot of people just tech quips about trying to get Scott Walker out of office so that was also a pretty common themes\nYou know obviously next Gen as liberal group how about conservatives groups on campus I Know you talked to a college Republicans what are they doing to or they do they have that bridge to get students not to do\nSo from what their communications director of you W branch of the college Republicans\nShe said that they've done quite a bit in terms of bringing candidate to talk on campus so she said that they had had\nBoth a U.S Senate candidate leaves look mirror and Scott Walker on campus to talk and so kind of helping college Republicans are students that identify Republican and meet the candidates or get to know what the candidates issues\nWhere they stand on about issues is one of the things\nThey're doing she also said that they are trying to register young voters but I didn't hear specifically what their efforts are let's talk about this\nWalk of voters in general you know people talk a lot about millennials making a big difference in this this election but how are they politically different from their parents\nWell sure so I mean the big change is that the two thousand sixteen presidential election marked the first time that millennial and Gen Z voters out numbered baby boomers than older voters because\nPeople are finally turning Eighteen and older and so you have the huge box of of young voters who are eligible to cast a ballot and according to research they tend to be more independent or a democratic than older generation\nAnd elect more progressive candidates so my uh I go this is well she said if they get young voters out they can elect progressive leaders to to\nUm I also spoke with a professor at U. W. Madison and she talks a lot about how diverse demographic demographically diverse that's generally the generations are and that when you live in a diverse generation you've grown up learning and being immersed in issues that tend to make you fall into that\nSociety as a whole versus society as an individual which is off and backed by democratic policies\nRight All right Jenny anything else that you want to add anything you know part of your story that you think you're missing here\nI mean I think that's one thing that was interesting was as of early this week next Gen had pledged forty five thousand students in the state of Wisconsin to vote which is a pretty big chunk and I'm\nA large chunk of that two hundred and fifty thousand goal for next Gen so they are definitely getting out there\nAll right we've been speaking with Jenny peaks she's the author of a story in today's business about millennials and and young people on college campuses here in Wisconsin getting out to vote and the efforts to try to get them to do so or age anything so much for talking with me today\nThanks October is domestic violence awareness month\nAnd one area nonprofit is organizing to stop domestic violence for a particularly vulnerable group the lights next community eight o'clock buys hosted Brian standing spoke with maybe fair to have you need to ... about their domestic violence efforts\nSo a tell us a little bit about how domestic violence affects the Latino community in Wisconsin a Dane County\nSo that's actually one of the reasons that are needed was started um we started in Nineteen Ninety six well obviously I wasn't there I was just born a year\nI mean before that I'm starting to Nineteen Ninety six in response to the fact that um there was a heavy unless you know an immigrant community here in Wisconsin but they weren't accessing the resource it would be needed even though a domestic violence was a problem with it\nAnd so what ended up happening I'm running to me for this research led to needles again being started Nineteen Ninety six in response to that um so what did he does his goal ended up being is making sure that different organizations and different resources and the communities\nHad access to like a base of people who understood the culture of Latino culture and how to um understand how violence affects Latino culture and also specifically just how to speak a specific type of Spanish that really lets Latinos feel comfortable and be able to access the services\nSo um when you're talking about barriers to you know do people accessing these kinds of services that are out there I mean obviously didn't carry her domestic violence services for a long time or is it just a language barrier that was keeping people from accessing some of these services or was there more going on there\nIt's not just the language barriers also just like a barrier of trust um see one of the big things that when he was like to emphasize is that we're a multicultural in terms of like we are very expensive in terms of different type of Latinos that are in our organization\nSo when you have that available to like the population you have like a really different perspectives and different types of Spanish but on top of just like the Spanish and the cultural aspect was also the fact that again I'm victims and survivors may not trust like local services are especially if like our government pays for verity of reasons\nI'm In the clients might be I'm undocumented the clients might be just afraid of the government for maybe the person who is abusing them is telling them that you can't trust 'em they're telling them lives maybe something like they're going to trust me over you especially this happens in like mix documented kind of like um situations\nAnd ah so how does when you do sort of combat that I mean how do you present those services and the way they're culturally appropriate\n[noise] so what we do is uh we are really try to get more and more involved and community we are very involved the community and we try to make sure that our faces now that the community knows that we're Spanish speaking bilingual that were bicultural that we understand like\nThe ... the difficulties of being an immigrant and also just being ... next here in the United states and in Dane County um a lot of like the work that we do is just basically making sure that they know us they have community behind them that they're not\nJust going to have to be forced to access with resources where the the only language spoken English or some other language Manuel um tell us a little bit more about\nUm ... sort of is there is there a social stigma in the Latino community about talking about domestic violence\nOh yeah definitely um the stigma is I Would say is like very calm and just all around and different cultures and different races but like like it's the same thing where people say for example in your family can tell you don't talk about it you know\nBut I'm In my lab mix community we have like a really big emphasis on somebody on these small keeping things within the family so to the point where like they'll keep problems and even such as like mental health problems are like things that they might be going through within the family when there's resources that they can access\nBecause of fear of students like honor shame um the fact that also like the community here in um didn't county is very small so there's always also the fear just people are going to hear about it so that's one of the stigma but then there's also other social stigmas that are out there\nSo what sort of events do you have going on this month for people to learn more about domestic violence\nSo I'm On October twelfth we actually have our vigil um during the vigil it's going to be a very emphasize on remembering the names and run into people who passed away here in Wisconsin due to domestic violence um what we're going to do is that we're bringing in people from our support groups in from the community to um\nDo a rock painting activity to do a minute of silence at the end way lighting candles were going to be eating bread and coffee and just talking enjoying each other's company just really try to emphasize going that there's a community of support um we're going to be reading poetry it's just very something very casual but trying to see you know by the community to come\nAre these are bilingual events are mostly Spanish language or mostly English\nI'm it's I'm mostly Spanish language but of course bilingual events because again all of our stuff is bilingual so we're going to be looking to him to anybody and everybody who wants to come\nTell us about the domestic violence men's grew\nUp so um we're I'm pushing for it must have bounce men's group in terms of um so what are the resources that when he was offered support groups to um there's my head as other ... other than to leadership um and then there's this man's group that we're starting it's currently name project that not starting that we ... we have an action I'm Sorry about that [noise] um\nSo the whole point of men's group is to pay people to show men that you can be man and you can be victims as well because victim the definition of victim doesn't just mean that like it has to be a woman\nFor example a man could be victimized by their partner the partners male or female\nUm that ... victim could be you know they can because maybe their family was abusive to them or they saw abuse in their family\nBeing growing up in those situations just really changed here and another thing is that we really want men to understand and try to be a part of the solution because\nYes not all men are violent but we believe that all women have like face some sort of violence from men and understanding that this is a gender based violence is really important so the men's group is also a moment to like educate our community built leadership and just pull people into understand what's going on\nMan well uh what steps can individuals take to address domestic violence issues in their homes and the communities\nSo one of the things that I like to really emphasize is just getting out there and volunteering um there's many wonderful organizations here and in county that worked in domestic violence for example days and end up these Wisconsin another thing too is just educating yourself you know through those organizations or through multiple different like readings that can be found on line\nAnd also keeping an open mind and believing victims when someone tells you either going through a situation I'm obviously\nYou there may be many times on where you can't like empathize with sympathize but you just have to try your best to really understand who's what they're going through\nAnd the beast situations are very difficult sometimes it takes I Believe this was seven to ten times for someone to get out of a domestic violence situation and then there's the whole process of mental process thinking I'm actually going to do at this time I'm actually going to do at this time", "show_name": "WORT Local News",
