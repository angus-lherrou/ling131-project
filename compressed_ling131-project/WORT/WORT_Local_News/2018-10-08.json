got from the Chicago Sun times and bell when from the Wisconsin Center for investigative journalism\nThey have collaborated on a piece that's out today about exploitative practices at some Asian food restaurants and employment agencies in the Midwest a specially when it comes to undocumented Latino workers Alex ... thanks so much for joining us today\n... thanks for having us just to start off what are these agencies can you kind of want to describe how they work and what they do [noise]\nSo the employment agency\nThat we talk about our story are primarily faith in Chicago's Chinatown and Alex than I pay them a visit when we went there for the reporting and the way that they work is\nThey actually connect the Latino workers with restaurants that are on nearly Asian restaurant with their faith the Japanese steak houses\nConfident and all throughout the Midwest\nSo the employment agency and can I say the workers in restaurants veil set a wage is essentially a lump sum set the workers get paid [noise] listen\nStrong and so what the ends up becoming is a very wary of the situation where the workers sometimes works ... hours days six days a week but they're still getting paid say only two thousand dollars a month\nRight anything else that you want to add Alex\nWell um I guess I'll add that the workers are you know they're coming from mostly Mexico Central America and\nUh coming up to work so they find different they you know they come here and they find different jobs with some of them have worked in\nA like construction or factories and then um how they find these agencies is a lot of them have come across newspaper ads um that'll offered them the employment for you know over\nTwo dozen ... month they can work in these restaurants um and when they do when they start working through the referrals by these agencies and they find that the conditions are I'm\nA bit more difficult and\nSometimes that they're mistreated or they're underpaid\nRight exactly right and so can you tell us a little bit more about those conditions you know what are some of the main things that you guys found that these workers were facing\n[noise] um the workers described working many long hours to over Thirteen hours a day six or seven days a week I'm being paid in cash there's not much record of the actual\nHours that they're working and some of them described being you know called stupid or other verbal abuse being in kind of high pressure environments\nUm and some of the restaurants since these workers are kind of shuffled around between restaurants around the Midwest off also offered them places to stay\nUm and that's another issue that ah the conditions that those that housing is often you know kind of crowded and one worker for example described kind of being in a cold wet basement that one employer at out to men\nAnd and so you know how how do people find these agencies do workers and then also the rushed\nFrance that employ these people you know they're based in Chicago but sending workers out as you said all throughout the Midwest so how does that kind of coordination work\nSo when it comes to the restaurants uh the Asian restaurants in the Midwest the way that they find out if south employment agencies is typically through Chinese language ads in the world journal which is a Chinese language newspaper there is a Midwestern\nChicago edition or some is distributed\nFrom Midwest states and a lot of the employment\nAgency in Chicago's Chinatown would run these advertisements that would make references to the fact that they had\nSay a Base Camp or Mexicans or the ... and since you're hardworking Mexicans and those labor agencies has since been prosecuted by the Illinois attorney general so in twenty Fifteen they were prosecuted under discrimination charges for those types of advertisements calling out\nMexican laborers but that's how the restaurants were kind of know that\nThese labor agencies had the type of workers that they were looking for\nAnd the workers described finding the ad advertisements again for you know these jobs Asian restaurant since I was a month in the paper ads here in Chicago and also elsewhere you know one worker told us originally found an added Appleton I think kind of the word of mouth from these workers get to\nYou know they end up talking to each other give each other phone numbers for different agencies um and one worker described being approached at one of the restaurants\nWere faced obviously in Madison here so are there are restaurants here in Madison that people should be aware of that have been set of use these agencies what do we know about the situation here in Madison\nYeah so when we were reporting a we\nHeavily on court documents from the twenty Fifteen case from the Illinois attorney general and we found that there were eleven restaurants in Wisconsin and some of them in Madison as well\nHad a change workers from the employment agency so that's not just say that we know for sure that they were supporting these workers but we do know that if they receive workers from those agencies it would likely be under a simpler scheme where\nYou know it has been known to be very ... way it is of the workers\nYou visited a couple of these agencies what was your reception like what what did you get when you went to try to talk to people who are running that still\nSo when Alex and I went to one of the women agencies somewhere to twenty Fifteen he\nWent up to set up there so we were in the door by one of the workers a who was from Mexico and when I spoke to one of the owners\nIn Chinese she was very reluctant to speak with me she claimed that she didn't understand\nBut I was saying uh didn't know about the lawsuit but she did say that she was still sending workers to various restaurants all over the place\nI think a lot of people in Madison are probably hearing about these kinds of agencies for the first time but it's not new you know this is something that's been going on for a long time what are some of the efforts like and the activism community what are people doing and have been trying to do to kind of wild west\nSo there is a\nNonprofit group a there's a nationwide nonprofit group called the heartland alliance which uh provide services as well as uh some legal services\nTo people in low income jobs and uh people who [noise] people who\nMore needy and their\nMidwest organization has a dedicated anti trafficking group and so this group helps bring to light what was happening specifically in Chicago and then help shed light on\nThe fact that the workers were being brought to run a restaurants all across the mid west but\nWhen it comes to reaching out to the workers\nMore directly sometimes if the worker centers who arguably the most uh sort of direct action so they're worker centers and Madison are also worker centers within Chicago as well as other Midwestern states which\nI'm are part of the effort to combat the type of labor exploitation as well as labor trafficking or more extreme than\nI think to your question about uh people are not as that or people with hearing about this happening for the first time in eastern restaurants I think it's important\nTo ah be aware that this is a very had ended as both problem but also not to apply the sort of a criminal activity with a broad brush to every single restaurant they go into support and to be aware that\nOftentimes workers are mistreated are taking advantage shows but also that I'm not every single restaurant is engaging in these types of exploited practices\nI mean we've been speaking with Alex Ari I got from the Chicago Sun times and bell Lynn from those conference center for investigative journalism\nAbout a new report that they have out today that dies in two exploitative practices at some Asian food restaurants unemployment agencies here in the Midwest Alex and bell thank you so much for joining us today and giving us your
