R. T. producer Neenah currency with an interview with him [noise]\nWe've got McDonnell line he's the dean county clerk and he's here to tell us a little bit about ah absentee in person voting so far and what you need to know before you had to the polls Scott thanks so much for chatting with\nMe today sure so\nYou know people have been voting even election day isn't until Tuesday what do we know so far about a\n... you know do we know anything about turnout in terms of in person absentee voters and and how it compares to other years\nYeah so far it's been really strong it's been stronger than the last gubernatorial elections so\nA turnout and Dane County has been strong in the in person voting and Madison the last few days and then you know several thousand people a day which compare favorably to twenty fourteen so I'm actually in better than fourteen and closer to sixteen\nSo the strong turnout number so far\nRight um and so what are the ways that people are voting right now there where can people still do play says a ... or ... and and can people still mail in ballots people's options right now\nYeah so if you've you know some people request a paper about the mail to them\nAs long as us return em by election day um those will get counted so and the post office is is aware of that and they make sure they gather everything they can and bring it in on time [noise]\nBut I'm the trend lately a is been in person absentee voting and a lot every community ending county is allowing people to vote early and places like Madison that every single libraries open this week I'm\nTill they're close so it's pretty you know early evening [noise] um\nYou can vote in person and those are when you vote that way than those are brought to the polls and counted on election day just like every other ballot\nRight and so I said at every library and ... and the clerk's office right\nWay to city clerk's office it was a couple of occasions all news on the county website and on the city website you have to be a city amount of some rather than do so if you live in some prairie and you're working downtown you have to vote in summer although they have they have um they have a really absentee and in some prayer as well and then just everywhere and and counting\nRight and and so you are those locations open over the weekend to how long do people have right up until the election\nYeah not up until the election so that the cut off um you know that they're not a Monday before the time to reset and make sure it and print the materials and everything like that so um Saturday a is open now and then in the in the evenings you can you can vote early as well\nAnd can so let's talk about registering little bat with Johnson has the same day voter registration but you know people need to register right now and and don't want to register on the same day can they register online still or do they have to wait no can't the\nCameras are on line but they can or just started when they vote 'em early absentee so if you go into the clerk's office if you go in to the Madison library and you're not registered you can register then\nBut um yeah but that that would be or a remedy until election day and then of course you can register at the polls on election day\nAnd how do you find out if you're registered maybe of and don't allow the greatest\nWebsite ever invented my vote dot W. I. G. O. V. I use it all the time and you can you can look up everything there um you can look at your own voting record you can see what's on your ballot you can see 'em a where your polling places and you can see where the registered so I'm actually bookmark that website\nRight on and and so if people you know still need to register what do they need to brain when they go to the polls are either you know on Tuesday before then\nWell you need to have oh you're going to you\nThe ID so I'm for almost everybody that's Wisconsin driver's license and you cannot use an out of state driver's license you can use other things like a passport or a military id\nUm veterans ID so there are there are a couple of choices there but not out of state IDs um you can't use your student ID although the university will provide you with a with a compliant one um those will be available on campus on election day but also union south\nUm those ... so you don't need an ID to register though and this is an important point your ID doesn't have to have your current address on it and this is a constant source of confusion and sort of banks your ideas only for the purposes of identifying who you are\nYou can use a utility bill you can use a bank statement Elise I'm to show what your current address and you can use that from your phone so you could look up\nYou can go to your your credit union or your bank on line um and show that on your phone to the to the poll worker or the clerk and they can use that but people need to mentally separate id from registration you do not have to have your current address on your ID\nRate and so you know let's turn to you what what's gonna happen when people actually got unloading but as you said it's got a governor's race has got a couple of other big race ads and a couple of other smaller questions on the ballot so you know what's on there what do people need to maybe research before they get the bulls\nYes of course you got you know the Senate is pretty important a governor I'm you know mark ... is going to be the congressman from this area and he's on oppose\nSo you'll have you'll have um some legislative races at the bottom of the ... there's a couple of referendum questions depending where you live there could be one for raising the levee for your school district so you might want to check that out but there are countywide there's what's called they called dark store loophole referendum and um\nYou know the the idea there is that some of the big box stores are comparing their assessment to empty box you know stories that are no longer being used to try to lower their assessment and that pushes property taxes on residents\nIt doesn't mean that they couldn't contract it again in the future\nSo a lot of these birds may go back out they may uh you know come into contact obviously what other finches and they're migrating together and they can you can theoretically get it again in our lifetimes\nSo it's something you should be on the lookout for especially in the fall time at your feeders when you're feeling bird seed\nUm and we really highly recommend people to clean out their feeders this time of year so we wanted to make sure people got the message and were able to know what to do if ah if they have a bird feeder in their backyard at home I'm so we put out a Facebook post um to talk about washing your bird feeders\nTake them down washing out what's really hot soapy water remove any dirt and debris that's on the feeder\nAnd then once it's clean you should be able to disinfect with bleach solution and we recommend to wonder thirty to mix\nFor bleach or to make sure that you're going to kill the bacteria\nAnd so that's the same as doing a half a couple of bleach for every gallon of water so easily it's a tablespoon of bleach and sixteen ounces of water that should be enough for most leaders um if you're just doing an individual feed her at a time you have to make sure it's it's for at least ten minutes about the bacteria is killed\nAnd let it dry out and then hopefully by the time you're done cleaning it you can put it back out\nAnd we definitely recommend at least once a month if not maybe more frequently if you have a lot of birds like once a week um and sometimes keeping the feeder down for a couple of days so that if there are infected birds around they move on to other areas so at the center we've actually treated more than Ninety of these finches and it's twenty fourteen African jumped\nOn and we wanted to share a little information about that what you did\nIf you have any questions about why life or if you find birds who condemned tomatoes at your feet or give us a call at six zero eight to eight seven three two three five and this has been widely [noise]\n\nWhat is the largest thing you can think of it is a tough question especially when it comes to the matter and ... our universe earth is pretty big but our son is incredibly bigger and our whole galaxy of course is way bigger than that\nNow astronomers are learning more about the structure that's one of the biggest of all radio astronomy hosts Zach pace and Julie Davis explain what's happening with it [noise]\nTo this week's episode of radio astronomy I'm Julie Davis and I'm jak pace today we'll be talking about the newly discovered galaxy proto super cluster called type period period and\nThat's a pretty awesome sounding name but what the heck is a galaxy proto super close to a great question and answer it we need to talk a bit about how the universe is organized when we look around space we see gravity causing object to a group together\nEverything from climate around stars to star grouping into galaxies\nTo galaxies forming clusters and so on and so on [noise] All right that's the hierarchical structure astronomers liked to talk about small objects coming together under the influence of gravity to form larger object exactly anti period as an example of the final results of that structuring\nWhen you bind hundreds of galaxies into clusters and then find those clusters together themselves\nOh you got a super cluster [noise]\nThese clusters aren't very common though right I've read that astronomers only know a few of these mega structures and one of them is the secret costs our own Milky Way galaxy resides in called money a cat or in measurable heaven\nThat's right [noise] super clusters are so big that it's hard to tell where they even start and and they stretch across huge swaths of the sky so it can be challenging for astronomers to determine which galaxies belong to the cluster or not\nTwo galaxies can be close together on the sky but in reality one might be ten times farther away\n[noise] so I Can't see the forest for the trees problem then these super class just must be pretty darn big if there are hundreds of galaxies in a galaxy cluster how big is a stupid question [noise]\nSuper clusters are just mind blowing the huge they are the biggest structures in the universe hundreds of millions of light years across and containing tens of thousands of galaxies Hyperion itself is about five thousand times more massive than the Milky Way\nThat's really intense five thousand times more massive than the Milky Way is five ... billion times the mass of the sun the Milky Way already has a trillion stars and you're telling me this thing has five thousand trillion\nThat's exactly what I'm telling you this thing is a monster but it's actually not that impressive compared to the other super clusters we know what that is crazy I guess that is because it's a proto secret cluster right that's right Hi period and the galaxies that make it up are surprisingly distant\nIts way across the universe eleven billion light years away\nWhile the other secret clusters we know that are much closer than that that must mean we're seeing a galaxy cluster as it was a really long time ago at eleven billion light years away we're seeing the super cluster as it was when the universe was only about two point seven billion years old\nIt takes gravity a long time to bring together these mind bending the huge structures so this cluster is still in the process of forming as we're seeing it and how do we know Hyperion is still forming thanks to a spectroscopy project on the European\n... very large telescope\nAstronomers have been able to measure how galaxies are moving around the cluster so they want to see if the galaxies has settled down and I know that a fully formed\nCluster super cluster has exchange lots of energy among its galaxies resulting in the big galaxies sinking to the center and smaller galaxies getting kicked out since the astronomers have observed that the galaxies are still exchanging energy and moving around high period it must still be forming\nThat's correct so high period is of proto super cluster in the very early universe this is all very cool but why do we care about this huge thing that so far away good question we need to remember that our own local neighborhood of the universe\nAnd our super cluster lineage care were once like high period so then this is a way to understand how he got here\nThat seems like a pretty fundamental question yeah and a great piece of the puzzle to understanding how the largest structures in our universe form and grow but we'll have to hear about that more in some other week that's all the time we have for today you want more astronomy this week be sure to head over to you W space place this Saturday for science Saturday\nOr Washburn observatory next Wednesday night for public
