O. R. G. studios in beautiful downtown Madison\nDane County is urging residents affected by last month's flooding seek help from FEMA anyone who have their home business damaged by the floods and we'd like federal assistance needs to conduct prima directly\nEven if they've already contacted the county to county has a website with details about what religion info that's D.C flooding ... county of ... dot com\nHalloween is just over a week away and Madison is getting ready to celebrate\nThis Wednesday downtown businesses will host arts and craft hay rides and trick or treating this is from three to six PM the children's museum will have a pumpkin toss the historical museum will have spooky ghost stories and the overture will have a free musical set by Ken long quest\nAnd then on Saturday don't be spooked by road closures as the city for pets so freaked fest streets crossing state street will be begin closing at five PM\nLake street Johnson street and Dayton street will all be we'll all close at five PM grown steep streets will stay open until six PM state street will be gauge it off and will require a ticket to enter starting at seven PM\nWell so the city removes old bike from state street on Saturday So don't forget your bike buses will also be toured off beat Detroit off state street\nTend to be a little more personal a little more on off the cuff I suppose\nAnd um yeah in a way that the the written story does not necessarily capture also not everybody's comfortable writing their memories and they're um thoughts and stories down and so yeah the audio um it just gives us I don't know even the playing field a little bit\nWell tell me naturally communicate right like I mean we talk to each other right right so a horse some of the people you interviewed so far\nSo far on that we have done a um we worked with the Italian workman's club in the over 'em on regent's street actually Dave Rizzo and Frank I'll find out who helped pull together a group of um community panelists who spoke to the historic green Bush neighbors neighborhood so kind of\nUm before the mid sixties um and it was actually a member of exactly [laughter] [noise] um yes before the urban renewal process happened on 'em and so that was you know that was great we um interview well we had on the panel on\nJohn ... and ... and ... um [noise]\nI'm Katie stuffy west and I'm Sam nice and\nTony Bruno or all the community members who were on that panel on we've spoken with Dr Richard Harris who um spoke about south Madison neighborhood um we talked with Mona Adams Winston shoe on spoke sort of about both on\nThe green Bush never had a little bit ... Madison neighborhood ... who grew up in Greenwich neighborhood\nI'm most recently a little more recently we talked with Merl sweet um who also\nLived in the green Bush and just outside of the Green Bay the neighborhood and then um our newest collection is I'm from Linda Franklin cue I'm actually with a wart um show host um for a number of years and\nUm and so she speaks about her time itself is\nSo uh you're focused on these mainly senior citizens people who've lived a long time and that in that particular neighborhoods and I can remember back when it was different\nI think um that's you know for now that certainly the focus the way that we sort of\nFind names or find people to interview is really a Pearl growing process where will sort of ask the people that we are interviewing who else should we be talking to you and a lot of those folks um tend to be maybe classmates or neighbors of folks that grew up in um in those neighborhoods and so\nI'm for now that's that's kind of our focus and\nUm I think that\nThat is the focus at the moment for the library initiated interviews we also I'm part of the project is also supporting um\nCommunity associations neighborhood associations um organizations and institutions that want to do their own history project those might end up on you know being a little more recent history you sort\nOf it was just asking I mean there's there's some interest in getting some more contemporary voices to I mean it seems are part of what would be interesting about this project is to get both of those perspectives MC sort of how things have changed over time and then also create an archive for people in the future\nExactly yeah I think I'm your data and I think I'm this project has a lot of potential for future projects and you know if for example a class at ... you know one of the\nUm Madison schools wants to interview you know sort of listen to the kind of like that we have so far and an interview people who might live in the neighborhoods you know now or um\nBe able to speak to more recent history of a particular place in Madison I think um that would be fantastic I think we we welcome and invite 'em a lot of not only collaboration but people to just really dig into their own history project\nAnd and how is this project funded who's there is there are enough of a stable funding source that this can continues or really becomes a warrant term historical archive or is this a temporary\nProject I Would say on the funding that we really need is for the equipment at the moment so um we were able to get 'em some fantastic support from the Madison public library foundation um so they um have supported the project with\nSort of the main or quarters that we use for our interviews as well as on some community history cats that were actually just putting together\nUm the boxes of equipment are sitting you know at my desk as we speak so I'm so does our\nYou know they were able to find that equipment and you know the idea is really wants that equipments in place you know we have some money set aside for replacement costs but really it is than about people sort of I'm checking out those kids that they would like to and interviewing family members and neighbors\nSo these are things you can check out from the library\nYes I see it coming soon it'll got available quite\nThere yet given your library card and take it out and go and then bring it back at a particular and just like a library book\nAbsolutely and there will be instructions on you know how to use the equipment and um for folks that haven't done a lot of I'm interviewing are all an oral history worked before on some example questions you know a question was to get you started on some you know kind of simple tips and tracked for how to conduct\nSo you're so far as living history project on line you've got to a collection on the green Bush and south Madison neighborhoods um why those two neighborhoods in particular and what's especially interesting\nYeah for sure so the on the impetus you know part of the impetus for this project originally was that we were approached by the uh\nI'm staff are working on the historic preservation plan for the city of Madison's planning department\nAnd I'm One of the things that they want it to do as part of that plan process was to really capture um everyday histories sort of everyday places that might not be on historic registers one kind or another they might not even still be standing but they're still very important those grocery stores gas stations\nUm parks community focal points um you know auto repair garages things like that um places where people congregated in that were really important to the neighborhood\nUm so that was you know sort of where we started this conversation was with those um people working on that historic preservation plant and\nThey wanted to prioritize the historic green Bush neighborhood um and we also you know just um in looking at Madison history that as a neighborhood as you alluded to that does not exist in the way that it dead on before the urban renewal process happened so\nBecause I'm also people are starting so we feel kinda bad we ... well I mean [noise] with good reason you know and and also just from a a practical perspective\nUm people are getting older and so those voices are not going to be around for very much longer and I think that that\nIs I'm certainly uh you know especially what we saw with the community panel at the Italian workman's club is that people really do want those stories conveyed and I'm not only told but also\nYou know sort of collected and maintained because it is a really important part of Madison history to understand what happened to that area\nAnd I think south Madison is\nThe history of that area is tied very closely to the green Bush neighborhood um history because so many folks moved out direction after that neighborhood was raised and um [noise] ... yeah\nAnd self medicine has moved to a different cultural history too I mean even now it's probably one of the more diverse parts of the city um you know certainly you can you can tell that by the types of restaurants\nFor a perk street for example in the grocery stores and things like that [noise]\nUm so it's like a it's a history that's ongoing you you mentioned that the kids are not yet quite yet available for for check out um I Do have any expectation as to who we think it's going to take those things out and use them and bring back oral histories are you doing any outreach to sort of promote this and are who are reaching out to\nYeah so I think it definitely um you know outreach is I'm sort of an ongoing process will are just going to keep talking about this project and I'm working with different folks to sort of shape their project ideas and plans going forward\nOn I think I suppose um community centers neighborhood associations um schools you know different sort of groups or you know as far as we're concerned individuals who just have an interest in 'em documenting the history of their block or their street\nUm you know I think that the playing field really is wide open and we've had a lot of interest you know I'm from\nNeighborhood associations is you know particularly neighborhood associations right now um but also other organizations and institution so\nUm there's a lot of conversations that are sort of in the early phases of um projects really starting to take shape and we expect that the kids will be checked out by um people who sort of\nHave a project planned in mind um and maybe every once in a while there is somebody who wants to do a one off interview you know with a family member or I'm with a neighbor who they feel um would be a good storyteller\nAnd so this is I mean it's it's kind of interesting because it's not really a a ultimately it's not going to ultimately be a curated project as much as sort of a crowd sourced kind of project where depending on what the interests are the people who come into the library\nThat's what you get what's the I mean that that sounds both sort of interesting and perhaps a little terrifying in some ways I mean what do you have any idea what kinds of stuff you're going to dead or is it just throw it up in the air and see what's the\nOf wide open I think um you know there is a ... as far as what people actually use the kids for they can\nFailing fall into a vat of acid the files read like Upton Sinclair or even Dickens speaking of Dickens workers in Britain heaven increasing work week as well\nThe longest showers in Europe just over forty three and a half hours compared to the you average of just under forty wall France has instituted the thirty five hours a week but that is a story for another

at another meaning and they're spending that rule and their lungs three to five minutes so they won't be cutting people off unless there's too many people who showed up\nAnd the most people might not realize when you go to speak of the committee oftentimes you're limited to just three minutes which is kind of tough it'd be really something to say\nAnd in past years they've even limited it to some
