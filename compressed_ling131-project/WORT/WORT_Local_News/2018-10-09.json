wholesale viruses poetry collection that's all about uh what it's like being in an immigrant um and and\nAmerica right now and what it's like to grow up here um and and to deal with the kind of factors and and the racism that goes along with that um I I think that they're just so many different versions of\nI'm kind of the national stories being played out of the book festival storm lake by our colon was on friday night\nI'm tells the story of small town life in Iowa\nAnd how um are calling won the Pulitzer Prize for his work um cataloging the conditions at the meat packing plant in his

written this really wonderful book that's all about\nYou know what does it mean to live in rural Iowa now how does immigration play into that how to environmental\nProblems play into that how does the role of tradition play into that so I think there we've looked for a number of different ways that we can talk about these broader topics um in in a way that you know draws people in but also um you know allows them to explore different different aspects of what's going on\nRight also great also slipping through the the schedule here a little bit I'm seeing a good amount of science science the ducks and ... what are you know what are some some highlights her first science people\nSure I mean there are many of them I'm David Quammen who whose new book the tangled tree explores kind of what

been having 'em with keeping\nColonies are going um we have a play on which goes behind the science of elite athletic\nSo actually um it was also another interesting thing is testing for it um you can't just find a you know brain tissue unless you were to go uh\nYou know under anesthesia and try to do some sort of um surgical technique to to get a sample usually the only time we do that with wildlife as if they had to be euthanized for some reason and you could do and ... which would mean opening that animal up after they've been deceased to confirm if the worm is there\nA but it's also been said that that uh is not always definitive very hard to identify those worms ones that travels through the spine or into the brain yes people can get it but it would have to be a very rare occurrence where it was accidentally adjusted from their action feces\nWe don't want to scare you guys all about this worm them I think it is definitely very prevalent in certain areas in the Midwest um and in northeast and the Atlantic areas especially in the United states\nBut it's just a really interesting one with a very cool life cycle that you know we think is is just a really an interesting topic to talk about [noise] so uh if you ever find any male or animal with an injury head tilt these\nSigns is near a logical condemns give us a call at the wildlife center at six eight to eight seven three two three [noise]\n\n\nBaltimore we have a problem the Hubble Space telescope is asking for backup from its headquarters in Maryland this week it's a needed some crucial parts to go back to

S. T. [noise] public was launched on April twenty fourth Nineteen Ninety and since then it has made over one point three million observations [noise] to do all these observations Hubble has to point to the object in the sky with high precision\nAnd stay there for several hours at a time consuming\nI mean ... is traveling at Seventeen thousand miles an hour around the earth it's an amazing achievement\nThe precision is such that it's like being able to shine a laser beam on President Roosevelt had on a dime while about two hundred miles away [noise] to achieve this amazing feat the Hubble Space telescope uses gyroscope ... gyroscope\nZ aren't devices that can tell you your rotating there are so useful that all modern smartphones have won so why do we care of ... rotates [noise]\nOn earth it's quite simple to know where we are what's the altitude and if we're level or not that's because we use or surface as our frame of reference\nIn space things are a bit more complicated so we use the gyroscope is to inform how much were rotating based on our past location and orientation\nWith this we can control Hubble to point to wherever we want\nAnd maintained that location and obtain those amazing pictures on science huddle like any other thing in space\nNeeds three gyroscope to notes precise location and orientation at any point all three are perpendicular to one another meaning that the NGO between them is Ninety degrees and there are three because there are three dimensions in the universe we live\nOn the last service mission back\nIn two thousand nine all six gyroscope unborn Hubble were replaced basically we were supposed to have three ... this past weekend one of the three active gyroscope stopped working and Hubble winter protective save mood on friday of ...\nThis is not surprised that the scientific community since we knew it was bound to happen currently scientists at the space telescope Science Institute in Baltimore which is where they run Hubble are working hard trying to bring it back up to life if they can't scientists will turn one of the gyroscope ... off so\nThere'll be ones fare still and Hubble will only observe with one which decreases its efficiency a little bit [noise] but it will allow Hubble\nExtend its life and keep giving us a view of the universe if you want to learn more is it our Facebook page at Facebook dot com slash registering to me\nAnd for up to date information among the ... you can follow Hubble on a Twitter account for local astronomy happenings this weekend is the Wisconsin Science Festival where the astronomy department will participate in several different events also as part of the universe and the park program this weekend is your last\nChance for the season will visit and into a state park Newport state park devils lake state park and core Andres state park\nThat's old for this week's episode banks and have a stellar week\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nMan [noise]\nIt's now six forty five PM and you're listening to the live local news on W.
