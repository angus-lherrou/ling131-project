M. and you're listening to the live local news on W. or tea in the age of fake news and click bait headlines it can be hard to know which stories you can trust\nBut one project is looking to make that all just a bit easier\nThe Wisconsin Center for investigative journalism is one of the founding collaborators of the aptly named crust project eight o'clock buzz host Brian ... spoke with Coburn do card the centers digital and multimedia director about how they go about verifying news sites so the trust project\nAttempts to set a standard for transparency and openness about a particular media outlets editorial policy and operations what are the elements that go into that trust button that you press on a media website\nYeah so we were part of a larger global coalition of journalism organizations that were adopted adopt in what has been referred to by the trust project as the trust indicators and those indicators are a series of policies um\nThat's not exactly how our journalism operation is run 'em including such things as our ethics policy a policy on diversity um how we handle correction how we handle\nUnnamed sources um as well as the whole um editorial standards page um we also um [noise] enhanced our author profiles so that when you're reading a story and you click on the journalists name you can read more about their background other places they've worked awards they've won language as they speak\nUm to tell you more about who is writing the story as well as how the story came together and how were these trust indicators put together\nThat's a great class and they were put together by um a group of news leaders from about eighty news organization they spent a long time interviewing readers and journalists at different news organization thing came up with a a standard\nSet of these policies that um they asked participants and the trust project to put in place on their website so it was a large group of both readers and journalists that put these indicators together\nAnd you mentioned that there are global media outlets to participate in this how many outlets are participating in the ...\nI Believe right now there's about wanting news organizations and that represents I'm about one hundred and twenty different news sites because some of those organizations are large and how multiple um news sites that they run so right now it's about a hundred and twenty news sites\nNow or in the Wisconsin a Center for investigative journalism Z keys did this you know Jay already have policies in place for each of the areas covered by these trust indicators or did this force you to read some of those for the first time\nWe actually did have many of these policies already in place I'm One of the things that we pride ourselves on at the\nAt the center is our transparency and so we already had a lot of these policies in place on our site including our ethics policy our diversity policy um I'm outside that tells about our stop I'm a corrections policy but we didn't have them I'm In a place where a reader could easily find them\nAnd reference them from any story and\nI'm so they were they were somewhat buried on on a on a page we called about the center but through the process of working with the trust project we've restructured I ...\nSo it's much easier for a reader to find those policies either from our home page\nI'm clicking on the about the center button um and then now on every single story that you go to um there's a small trust project logo on the side of the story and a button that says read our policies and when you click on that it it lodges that pop up window that than um lists very clearly all of our policies all in one place\nAnd how long has a C. O. J. been participating in the dress rather than\nWhat we just launched officially last week um so that was our official announcement although it's been\nA good six months or so working with different news organizations um we were part of a group in the U.S and Canada that that weekly by phone um to talk about our progress in putting these policies together so so we were invited to participate um earlier this year\nBut it's taken 'em a long time to sort of put everything in place and then we had a coordinated launch with um news organizations all over the world last Tuesday 'em to announce our participation in the project\nSo it was it too early to tell how viewers are on this project I'm button and finding out your policies\nI think it is we did a um pre launched survey I'm In the week running up to the launch where we had our readers take a questionnaire about what they thought about the center and I'm sort of how they read our news and how trustworthy we were and then we will be launching a post um trust project survey\nUm shortly to see if those indicators have made a difference in how people um if you are news\nAnd what was the impetus for the trust Broderick there was there a particular incident that that got a journalist together to Katie we really need to make sure that we establish a these kinds of policies and and our reputation preserve our reputation\nWhile I think there's been a a conversation I'm you know about how people are getting their news and whether their news especially if it's coming to them through social media is coming from a reputable source and with a journalist is obviously we've heard a lot about fake news in the last year or so\nUm this project was led by a journalist named Sally alarm in and she bought all these people together to um\nEnhance transparency and integrity and news so it's just a matter of journalists sort of explaining how we do our work\nWhy we do our work who we are so that when people read our stories they understand that we have an extensive background um and I know who we are I'm writing the story and so they can understand how that story came together also it as part of the ... project\nUm there is a an ability to put another button on our stories that would that would be a little bit about how the story came together so that would be a button called behind the story and in that case we would explain\nHow we decided to do the story how long it took some of the stuff that we needed to go through to get the information whether that was um filing freedom of Information Act I'm looking at data documents so that people could really understand the backstory to the\nTo the news report that they're reading so in our upcoming stories we are going to start reading a little\nUm a couple of paragraphs explaining how the story came together and why we took it on\nYou know there's a debate in journalism circles about the a possibility for being objective and whether that's even a goal that journalism should pursue given the fact that we all carry inherent bias was a ... every every activity that we do so it was the goal here to sort of\nA identify a concept of objectivity or is it just to be open and honest about what any of those potential biases might be\nAbout being open and honest and transparent about how we do our reporting um you know every journalist's strives for objectivity and they're reporting and so we always reach out to um people on both sides of the story to share their perspective\nI'm so that readers can ultimately make their own choice about um [noise] you know which which way they're going to lean if if a story called for it I'm mostly it's just about explaining that there is a rigor behind the reporting process that we\nCheck our facts one of the policies that we ...\nSomething that we pride ourselves on at the centers are fact checking policy um every story that we right\nEven if it's um a short story or if it's a month long investigation goes through a very intense and rigorous fact checking policy um where the reporter and editor sit down together and go through every word of the story to make sure every name as ... correctly every fact is correct and we\nUm print out a physical print copy of where we got that ... and then we number the fact on the page so I'm by the end of the fact checking process will have a giant stack of paper to sort of backup every single fact in the story just so we can\nBe totally transparent and accurate where everything came from and and hopefully readers um when they understand how much work we go through to make sure that our story as accurate though you know trust trust by the project came from\nNow you mentioned um that one of the bowl the goals of the center for investigative journalist is to get a we've used that both sides of the story um our book miniseries don't break along those sort of a you know by a by focal sort of um ... and I are there\nEfforts underway to try and make sure that you get multiple or diverse viewpoints rather than just two we seem to have a\nPreference for stories that have a dichotomy when in many places there's more than one or two points of view and will\nOh absolutely a lot of stories that we do a very complex and um I shouldn't have implied that there was a one side or the other what we're trying to do is provide that is present um you know an issue and go in depth\nAnd explaining that issue and expanding the history behind it how it came to be and how it affects real people but I always try to find real people to represent how policy might\nBe um affecting the public um something that might have gone\nThrough the government um we explain how that happened and then what its effect\nOn real people um as and then
