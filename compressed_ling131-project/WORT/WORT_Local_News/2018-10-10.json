Madison and political science professor David can and on the line here to put some contacts are on this new Marquette law school Paul that's out today um parents are Canaan thanks so much for coming on the air today\n[noise] good to be with you\nSo you just start off ... you know lots of stuff and that's Paul ... and ... or ... about a month away from the November election now I'm Walker and ... is our neck and neck and in this poll is not surprising to you or is that kind of normal for about a month before the election\nWell I think the interesting thing about the governor's race is how much has changed since the September ... so in this September poll Uber's was actually a head of Walker by five percent which is even outside the margin of error\nAnd in this poll though the governor is ahead of beavers by about one percent which is you know within the margin of error but the other thing too that's interesting is that the ... percent\nUndecided as down to one percent so here we are you know less than four weeks before the election um and we still I'm only one percent of the voters say they don't have a preference or don't lean one way or the other so pretty much everyone is made up their mind now so the only question is at this point whether or not um you know\nEither candidate will be able to\nChange some of those voters' minds in the last couple of weeks\nRight and so I I also noticed that the libertarian libertarian candidate ... than has like five percent a right and that could really sway election here that can make\n... you know I think there is a pretty good chance that uh if that number holds up a that would could be the the difference in the election so the margin of victory\nYou know for either candidate is not likely to be bigger than five or six percent now one thing we have seen in other elections this in in general kind of across the board\nIs that often a third party candidates whether it's the Green Party or Libertarian Party will poll stronger\nOr in the last month or so then they end up on election day because a lot of people who you know thought they would support the third party candidate actually get into the voting booth and think boy I guess I better vote for my second choice because they have a better chance of winning even if the libertarian or the Green Party might be their first choice\nRight on and so let's talk about that ... that is a lot last class right\n[noise] right yeah tell me ball and has a very substantial and steady lead and in that in the Senate race has been very consistently and around ten percent both in the market pull it was eleven percent last time ten percent this time but in other polls have been taken to have had a balding with about ten to twelve point lead overly a book mirror and so that\nIs one that hasn't bounced around as much as the the governor's race seems to be holding pretty steady\nRate and how I'd normally not how likely is it that we'll have a a Walker Baldwin ...\n[noise] well yeah we we tend to uh have split outcomes in you know governor and Senate races are we now have often we have like one\nA democratic senator and one Republican center and we have to either democratic governor Republican governor so we do we are uh you know a purple state as they say we're not in a red state or a blue state\nUh we we tend to be a pretty competitive with the two parties very evenly split so that wouldn't be that unusual or an outcome to to have the governor's race in the Senate race won by people from different parties\nRight on and I'm Still you know I Can't play their games mostly to do when incumbents or or lack of you know voter turnout like what do you think\nYeah so with ball and I think it is partly income and see that you know the people around the state of gotten to know are pretty well over the last six years and before that here in the second district in the house you know she was a very popular house member from and the second congressional district\nSo I think with Baldwin she has developed a a fairly strong reputation of the state you know people tend to like her favorability rating is usually you know a reasonably high for you know especially a lot of politicians tend to\nYou know it's the kind of an anti politician age these days to have you know favorability ratings that are stronger than your unfavorable is a a positive thing for a\nCandidate and balled and almost always is in in that category\nI think she has a reputation for you know strong constituency service she kind of takes care of her constituents so she I I think it can be explained by the fact that you know she's\nPretty well known in the state and and people tend to think she's been doing a good job now with Governor Walker it's you know he also has that incumbency status obviously but it's it's a much more\nDivided a kind of of a verdict on on Walker where people do tend to be either very strongly supportive of the governor or really very much opposed to him that you know not not much in the middle west\nI'm going to walk into the dates back all the way to the act in a very divisive a act in a policy has passed when he was first governor and so so there I think it when it comes to the governor's race but it's not really as much incumbency as it is\nYou know what are the voters of the state you know think about his policies do they\nGive him credit for our strong economy that we have right now or are they still you know quite a upset about the the cuts education and some of the other things that are Tony ... is\nCampaigning on in his attempt to unseat Walker\nAnd do we know at all who the people are when they got that gap those voters who are maybe you know voting for Bob land and air modeling and walk or potentially or or voting for one of them and not be either you know who are those you know\nYes right so they tend to be the the the pure independent some people who you know 'cause when they when the market pull or the polls ask a these questions about who you're supporting me also ask questions about which party you identify with\nAnd they always categorized the poll respondents into either strong partisans leaning partisans or independence\nAnd usually about a six or so somewhere you know low teens to you know mid teens a percentage wise or\nCategorize themselves as pure independence like they really don't align with one party or the other and so those are the folks that we would expect to be splitting their ticket and that way states supporting Tammy Baldwin for the Senate and Scott Walker for governor\nIt's very unlikely you know certainly wouldn't see many if any of the strong partisans doing that that would be not expected it all of the people who say I'm a strong Democrat or I'm a strong Republican leaders you might get you know some of the leaders as well that that might split their tickets in that way but it's mostly going to be coming from those independents\nAnd do we know anything about the demographics and those people you know kind of people they usually I mean [noise]\nWell so the Marquette poll doesn't break it down and that level of detail in terms of of what is publicly release the like\nGive a cross tabs a party id and an age is what you would would need a but based on other polling that that we've seen you know from you know not from Wisconsin Senate race in governor's race but just generally which probably would hold and Wisconsin as well\nIs that the people who are the the appear independence or do tend to be a little bit younger than the average voter um and also tend to\nNot be as fully engaged in politics or as the the more apart and voters like they will will tell pollsters that they you know aren't following the election is closely\nYou know many of them do obviously but just in general the the average level of awareness and the ... they're following the election is a a little bit lower than the strong partisan to tend to follow it more closely\nMy next question a little bit away from that whole thing I don't know why you know about the influence of digital ads on on this election so far and you know it just you know on line I mean I got him out of ads from Locke\nNeedy last friend ... that's the only sounds about right you know do we know anything about how ...\nWe almost know nothing about the impact of digital as because they're so hard to track 'em that we we have very good data on the broadcast media ads because you have to actually you know by the\nTime well in advance and we can you know see actually when the ads are are online because it's very easy to you know record them at once they're there broadcast\nWith social media like you and I might get very different ads popping up on our Facebook page or when we browse on Google or whatever just 'cause we you know go to different websites and so um they're they really are micro targeted to specific\nSearching strategies and and your your history isn't the kind of places you go to you'll get different sets of ads are and so it's really really hard to track digital ads for that reason in fact one of my colleagues I hear you W young Kim in journalism mass
