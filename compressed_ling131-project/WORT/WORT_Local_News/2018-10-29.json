S. C. served spikes of witchcraft trials here and there\nI'm so about I Believe eighty eight people were executed over the century and said Mark I'm which accounts for about a third of all of the trials in Norway a third of the executions in Norway despite the fact that said mark only has less than one percent of Norway's population\nUm so why were they so bad a that's a complicated question I'm the one big reason is that the authorities there really\nA took to this continental concept of demon allergy and believe that there were which is who were in league with the devil trying to overthrow the state and the church um so when you have that situation and people in power who believe that they go looking for which is\nAnd how much of these men were were persecution of women in general and non Christians and in particular\nSo very little up the ladder actually I'm most most people who were accused and executed not all but most were Christian um or belongs to some domination of of\nA Christian Church um how much was it a persecution of women is also a complicated question it depends on where you are um but certainly I'm\nMost which is so they mentioned were women on the other hand a lot of accusers were also women so it's a it's a tricky question\nTell us a little bit about the presentation\nIn a to tomorrow night at the ... Society Museum ... what are you going to be talking about\nThat tomorrow we'll be talking about more if the Scandinavian trials themselves will be looking at um some trials that happened in Sweden or in the seventeenth century as well as the spin mark trials in Norway\nUm and I'll be talking about some of the uh the legends of milk ceiling which whom I mentioned earlier and a couple of other legends that um that sort of ... the ah the trials\nWhat what what are some of those other stories\n[noise] um so there are a stories about and which is who can transform themselves into animals associate shifting which is for instance\nUm I'll be talking a little bit about that a an I'll also be talking about flight which we've also discuss a little bit um a habit that what you seem to have of writing things through the air\n[noise] so um what is meant your ... the title of your presentation is of the devil goes north and there was a phrase talking about the evil comes from the north and Scandinavian or what what does that\nCome from [noise] yeah uh [laughter] it's a great question so\nI'm there does seem to be this long standing association um at least at least in the early modern period on\nUm of associating the direction that cardinal direction the north with the forces of evil and uh with the you know with bad forces where that comes from I honestly don't know I'm not I'm not sure that anybody knows\nUm but uh on the island of gold Lyndon and Sweden for instance island in the middle of the Baltic Sea\nI'm also churches there are medieval are a lot of them um there are essentially no graves on the northern sides of the church and the story that I've been told about that is that on judgment day\nI'm also you know good Christians would would rise from I'm from the earth and in a sense to have in\nUm the churches would no longer be needed so they would topple over and they would all fall to the north which means that anybody who is buried on the north side of the church couldn't get up and so you'd only very bad people I'm On the north side of the church you married\nWhen they're at all [noise] [noise] so I'm told that we talk real quickly sort of about modern day which is er ... and there's lots of people who are you know a call themselves which is they practice or a religion called wiccan\nUm is that there is there a direct connection between that and what we're talking about in terms of witchcraft and in these folklore and these which trials\nI Would say no I'm historically speaking no um there's certainly no historical evidence that people who were uh tried or executed for witchcraft in early modern period practiced a different religion um practice some earlier form of of Wicca\nUm however to the best of my knowledge I Do think that modern we can see 'em recognize some of their own um practices in the past um and that's not a historical um linkage but certainly can be a spiritual one\nAnd and what kinds of people were accused of being which is a during these these which trials period\nSo again it depends and but generally speaking um as I said mostly women I'm not all um they tend to actually to not be the very poorest of the poor which I think is a stereotype that that we tend to have\n'em instead they were a little bit better off than average um in general and some of that has to do I'm probably with the fact that so much of a witchcraft belief accusation legend has to do with somebody who has more than she should\nUm so the people who tend to be a Q as we're just a little bit ahead of of their neighbors were\nThere a ... was their mental illness involved I mean people are behaving in strange ways or things like that\nI'm sure sometimes um there was but\nBut it was really just someone who had a little bit more than everybody else seemed to be the\nYeah um but and you know just just being sort of had economically or socially wasn't going to do it by itself and there had to be some other factors involved one of which was having a reputation reputation was huge in the early modern period um you\nYou if you were accused of being a which um and you could gather some of your neighbors friends relatives around you and they could all testify to your good character and you're you know good practice of Christianity and so forth chances are you are going to get off pretty easily or completely\nUm if you had a reputation as a scold as I'm the kind of person who you know did annoying things that are neighbors that sort of thing then ah you were in big trouble\nNow you've written that you want people to stop using the word ... if a as a justice simply of story with no factual basis in in what way do you think of the word myth\nSo when folklore is use the word and mess we mean something pretty specific we mean a story that is not necessarily factual but that is true in some profound sense are that typically involves God's or heroes um that is set in a remote past\nOr a sort of non timeframe if you will so you know there was a number of years ago I'm from New York City um and a number of years ago there was a bulletin\nUm excuse me billboard on a one of the highways into the city around Christmas Time that and I had been paid for by an atheist group and it had a a sort of silhouette of the need to be I'm seeing 'em\nAnd ah the slogan on it was you know it's a mess and I thought of course it is [laughter]\nUm it's that's exactly what a myth is you know but um the usage of that word in the colloquial sense to me and something that is commonly believed but untrue is not helpful [laughter] I'm for people who study what I Would call drew mythology\nAll right we've been speaking with amber rose she's for poor PHD candidate in the University of Wisconsin department
