severe weather outbreak upstate this afternoon and that so far has failed to materialize at least in any significant way the main concern was significant tornadoes given very strong wind shear in the near ground layers of the atmosphere to the north one was\nAbout Ninety degrees are better correctional veering near the warm front which is currently sprawled from west to east across the northern most of your accounts of the state having\nFlown northward through here early this morning\nA more prevalent cloud cover to our north than down here seems to have held down service based instability up north so no tornado reports from the upper part of the state but some high winds with what we're otherwise some fairly strong thunderstorms\nThat activity is being driven by a low pressure system that's passing near the Canadian border with its surface reflection that surface all deepening rapidly now over Lake Superior\nAnd his upper level parents trough dipping south east words through the Dakotas in northern Minnesota that ladder feature as visible as a prominent swirl under water vapor image of North America that's currently the featured graphic at the top of the W. or to you whether

front of rains over us\nTomorrow night then a second stronger impulse will follow friday\nNight which will focus some moisture concentrating low level jet over the area through the night and into Saturday morning and that may produce enough elevated instability at least the times for thunderstorms during that period which may then train\nOver certain areas are so possibly quite a wet periods especially in certain spots as we go over night or friday and Saturday but with drying now as we get into the day Saturday\nWhich will continue on into they Sunday\nBut we'll have to go through another two or three rounds of this sort of thing at least as it would appear by the longer range modeling as we go through the bulk of next week so I'm Still very wet periods coming up over the next

period with a light rain moving in probably before dawn on\nFriday or certainly after with low temperature and the overnight in the mid forties\nAnd then friday all generally be kind of a cool and raw will have passing sessions of rain on Easter league wins it will be more south easily at eight to twelve miles per hour [noise] uh I don't think a whole lot of rain during the day but maybe two or three tenths of an inch from the rains will ramp up those we go on the overnight and the winds here more subtly and the two points start to come up\nOr the temperatures will rise until the or perhaps the sixty degree arranged by dawn on Saturday and we may see an inch or two of rain come down and the friday overnight there may be more than that if we do see some training of invective cells\nWinds
