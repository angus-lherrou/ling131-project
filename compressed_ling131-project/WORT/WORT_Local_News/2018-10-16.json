O. R. T. studios and beautiful downtown Madison here are tonight's headlines\nThe midterm elections are just three weeks away and so far one hundred and fifty nine thousand absentee ballots have been issued in Wisconsin according to the states elections commission\nEighty four thousand had been returned so far if you're interested in getting an absentee ballot you can ask for one at my vote dot W. I. dot Gov you can also vote absentee at your local clerk's office if you'd like to request an absentee ballots you must do so by five pm on November first\nAnd with the general election just around the corner Bernie Sanders the independent senator from Vermont will be holding to rallies in Wisconsin on Monday in Milwaukee and ...\nSenators throwing his support behind Democrats senator Tammy Baldwin given a ... candidate Tony ... and Randy Bryce who is running against Republican Brian Steele for house Speaker Paul Ryan seat in Congress Sanders is making his way across the country in an attempt to rally liberal voters and it has a patient at the upcoming election\nPolice are still looking for Thirteen year old Jamie class who went missing from her home in Baron yesterday her parents James and Denise class were found dead in their home early Monday morning\nPool that was in Wisconsin back before twenty fourteen\nThat wasn't a that was expensive than the coverage was was not great for a lot of folks\nRight and so I guess how would how would that change look like some people you know how how would\nDare healthcare changes actually\nWell it's a you know it's an incremental process we know that you know health care changes take time for a little CARE Act was done over you know\nFour or five years a period of time and and this would be similar with we're looking at a five year proposal um initially it would be the state would have to seek some federal waivers uh it would be\nA opportunities to integrate parts of the marketplace and badger care plus um\nThat would help create a pool of over a million people right there er which allows you to spread the risk lower costs a and improve a consumer protections which I think is a really important part of it\nBut this was you know this is something you know people have heard things like Medicare for all I mean this is a variant of that I mean the goals same as try and provide coverage for everyone but this is something that Wisconsin could do I'm I'm On its own with some help from the federal government but integrating these fools\nHis way of spreading risk in a way that uh uh we have some obviously some people in the pool but a lot of healthy people too so it balances out and we have lower costs overall\nRight and so it seems like a bride terms kind of you know this obviously deals with Medicaid population and expand the pool of people who are eligible for Medicaid how would that different from the way that the direction that the seat is going on Medicaid\n[noise] well the state you know rejected the idea of expanding Medicaid they did a small mini expansion expanded for folks blow a hundred percent of the federal poverty limit\nAnd it was really you know a foolish in many ways because they missed out on over a billion dollars in federal funding could have supported um healthcare coverage programs in Wisconsin so um\nYou know it is it does include a Medicaid expansion includes building on the badger care plus program as the base but over time we begin to ask people to the pool and as more and more people get into the pool we get to the point after five years that\nSmall businesses large businesses that want to um can joined the pool or by that point we have you know probably over three million people in the pool and we'd have quite a bit of purchasing leverage\nBetter consumer protections a blending of of healthy and and and some people it may have pre existing condition but it would be a pool that would ultimately be less expensive than we're paying for right now\nRight and and to use the making this call for the parents need to take federal Medicaid expansion funds for years how would how would you know you've you've talked about how would benefit to see but I guess what has it been like in the years that\nWe haven't been taking this money and what could it could well would be different do you think it is if things had gone differently\nWell if we could go back in time and take the Medicaid expansion funds we would be identifying um coverage opportunities for uh probably another you know sixty thousand people plus I'm just\nUh the process that we went through not taking Medicaid expansion [noise]\nAh the the system was created you know it's a corn means eligibility process so we had parents um that had to go to the marketplace kids that had to go on ... plus families with different providers potentially different systems different ... ability limits people losing coverage\nSo it was a mess you know and I and the administration\nSort of touted as having no coverage gaps um which was really you know disingenuous in a way because\nIt it just had so many\nYou know blind alleys and [noise]\nAh areas that were just so confusing for people to navigate that you know you can pretend that there was no coverage gas but the reality was it a lot of people lost coverage\nWe saw evidence of this in Wisconsin with our uncompensated care costs in the state so when you look at the overall numbers of uncompensated care\nI'm back in twenty Thirteen when the ... first started they were well over you know one point three billion dollars they dropped a you know from twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen down\nTo blow a billion dollars and that was in part related to some of the the mini expansions those numbers have dropped even further if we had fully expanded Medicaid [noise]\nUh but lately we've seen them rising again now for twenty Seventeen that are up to one point one billion again\nPartly this is because we have challenges and people trying to get coverage unpaid medical bills which is part of that which is part of uncompensated care [noise] all of that debt is another way that we can you know figure if we can do this more effectively\nAt the front of the process instead of letting people get into debt and not have be able to pay their bills if we identify coverage for them early on it's gonna save Wisconsin quite a bit of money in terms of reducing uncompensated care\nBecause after all that that those unpaid bills don't go away they get socialized interviewed distributed into everybody else's bill sold the costs of health care goes up because of that [noise] so that's another benefit of the ...\nScare proposals that we're going to really stop socializing medical debt we're gonna we're gonna identify coverage early on for people and give them the care that they need and deserve\nRate and into you know Obamacare premiums has has been going up quite a band and a lot about how you said he has not in that you went to central government would this plan do anything in there you know how does that work into that\nPart of it is the idea that if you integrate these pools you're going to lower the cost him in the marketplace plans are more expensive in some ways because\nYou know it's a it's support the risk pool and you know the fact that there might be people that have more preexisting conditions that are part of it in the ... doesn't allow for um\nPeople being denied based on preexisting condition but it's a smaller pool or if you look at badger plus they don't allow discrimination based on preexisting\nConditions either it's a much larger pool a lot of kids and that that are cheaper to ensure if you integrate those pools you will result in some cost savings and a better blending of the risk between you know healthy people healthy kids are in some people with preexisting condition [noise]\nSo you know at least a with our plan what we're talking about is like integrating these pools\nWe helped to create less risk right now we call a lot of the small groups out their risk puddles because they're not really pools they you know there are risks puddles and people with preexisting conditions the costs rise and\nUh it gets spread out among the other people in that small group sometimes and and the marketplace is in some ways an example of that [noise]\nUm we think that we need large scale pools spreading the risk a and then helping to lower costs both because we've spread spread the risk but we also increase purchasing leverage so it's [noise]\nUm in some ways it's like the the Amazon effect where you if you just have a large group you can really help reduce the costs because you have such\nStrong purchasing leverage or you don't have to pay a really ridiculously high prices you can say no we're we're going to this is what we're going to pay and this is it as part of the reasons people complain about why ... plus has you know is is unpopular with providers because of low reimbursement rates\nWe believe by integrating pools you can also do some things to address reimbursement rates so that they're you know that you're there look more middle of the road or you're going to address some provider concerns but the big big issue is going to be that we're going to have a lot of people in the pool and spreading that risk\nDissolve relies on the legislature obviously nearly down and he does not mean that is there any hope that they could go anywhere and what would he can actually happened\nWell it's you know this is a reflection of our experience serving clients over the last twenty five years you know I don't expect anyone to take this and run with is fully ah but I expect some of the ideas\nTo generate some traction a there's a lot of ideas and here that are worth pursuing I think we we offer hope an opportunity to think there is a better way\nAnd here's some ideas out here that we can you know that we can use that we can try in Wisconsin this doesn't rely necessarily on you know the\nTo wait for Medicare for all proposed we can start doing some things here in Wisconsin I'm very creative ideas that could help extend coverage\nTo everyone over a period of five years I'm so I'm hoping that the the the ideas and here are will gain some you know or some support 'em we liked the other idea here which is a a system of advocacy and support you think about people that are trying to navigate systems of health care when they're sick or carrying for a family member\nIt's challenging red tape a ... it's bureaucracy either private insurance bureaucracy or public bureaucracies [noise]\nYou need help to navigate those systems and we build that into the system 'cause that's part of our experience here at ABC for health is that people do need to help these are very you know legal is to contract sometimes and prevents\nOr bats are considered a high risk rabies vectors species here in Wisconsin\nWhich means that if you're bitten by a bat without your rabies vaccines which is something most people do not have and don't need really in this area they would need to be tested for rabies which you know obviously is a really serious issue because if a human person got rabies you know that is something life threatening\nSo if you ever find a bat you know don't fear as long as they haven't you haven't touched him with your bare hands and then you should be fine but hopefully we can try to contain that animal either using a little Tupperware on a piece of cardboard maybe you can\nPut that over the top of the the bat and slide the cardboard underneath the Tupperware so you don't actually touched the animal or otherwise calling train services and ending county and we have our animals service officers team that have their rabies pre exposure so they can help to contain that animal their number six so eight to five five two three four five\nOtherwise you can call the humane society directly and we can absolutely help you out with the situation at six to eight to eight\nThat in three two three five my name is Jack yet\n\nHow our planet formed astronomers are figuring it out but there's certainly
