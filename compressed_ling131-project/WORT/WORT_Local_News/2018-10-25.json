Halloween costume website\nTake Halloween back dot org\nMadison mayor ... Glen has changed his mind about running for reelection now it was only a few months ago that fog one was running for governor and then he said he wouldn't seek another term for mayor but now he's back in the race so what's up with that neither convince ski asks isn't a staff writer Dylan broken all about it\nWe have this new staff writer John broken in the studio he's author of the piece in today's paper about their side wins reelection announcement after his reelection non announcement that also happened and we ... he wasn't going to run but now he is running what's up with that though is\nWell sort of a poorly kept secret I think for the last few weeks\nUm but yeah I ah in July the the mayor who's been married for a long time pulled aside when\nHe was in the throes of running for the Democratic nomination for governor right against seven other candidates he didn't win that one actually came in seventh of eight candidates and about a month after that a no about two months after that he decided you know what\nI Want to be mayor again it'll be his ninth term if he's reelected in April\nAnd this was going to be the first time without a head in combat and running again in in the mayor's race in a long time right and a lot of people were kind of excited\nReally long time um there was a special election that mayor sue bombing one in the nineties when saga and retired last time to run for Congress\nSo she won that special election and then she got reelected so it it's been at least that long and I don't even think that really counts as a true open rights but we had seven candidates that someone else before saw Gwen I'm said he was\nNot going to run 'em but most of them didn't we have all their mo cheeks we a former all their saltier Rhodes Conway with the mass an equity coordinator\nToriana pettaway we have an environmental advocate uh Raj Shukla\nUh who else we got a comedian Nick heart in the game or another former older Brenda Konkel and it was it there wasn't really a clear front runner right and now\nOh there's like the ultimate incumbent mayor silent and most of the candidates that I spoke to for this piece of work sort of ganging up on the mayor saying it's not that we don't respect everything you've done over the years but you've had your time or Seventy three years old you've changed your mind maybe it's time for new leadership\nYeah and he'd endorsed a candidate right so it's you know oh yeah how do you know how sad yeah that's my feeling\nAbout oh she's playing it off pretty good but ah you know sort of the behind the scenes thing is is that mayor saw Glynn at the very least said she was the strongest amongst all these candidates and thought she'd be an exceptional mayor if elected this was when he wasn't running\nAnd yeah obviously a deep must have some concerns or or he's changed his mind a little bit in but she state you know she thinks it's doesn't change her decision she said she would have run either way or as most of the seven other candidates said that you know it doesn't affect their decision\nYou know I was expecting before the filing deadline in January that we'd have even more candidates jumped in the last minute\nDo you think that people might drop out because he he's he's running or had had you not heard that at all\nFrom under the candidates that I talked to none of them are dropping out um but it does kind of feel like cycling is going to have a lot of he's going to have basically seven candidates going after him before the primary right\nI'm presumably and uh because he's just has a hundred percent name recognition in the city you know he's looking good to at least get through the primary where it's window down to the top two candidates\nSo I imagine that all the candidates running now are are going to be really making their case for why they are the ones who beat sock one\nUh in in a weird way mirrors right this really crowded field for the Democratic nomination for governor who you know Tony ... ended up winning but it was a crowded field too and they're all trying to say why they were the best person to run against Walker will be a little bit more difficult with Saddam and just because\nThe city government local governments a little bit different than federal or state politics right or all these candidates running against fog and say it's time for a change well I think a lot of folks in Madison and ...\nMaybe Simon winning in two thousand Fifteen last mayoral race in a huge land side I think that's proof that you know you can do in a good job and people want their their trashed picked up the the roads plowed and I think it's hard to make a case that song when is failing at the basic infrastructure part I think it's going to be a race about\nNew vision in the city and and where we'd like to go and there's a lot of big challenges that Madison has that other cities like ours do and then maybe he's just not the man to do it at the time\nYou think that ... is is that Trump the fact that people you know jumping into local races local politics because they kind of woke up after twenty six you know elections and they are saying well I ... something needs to change\nI think a little bit of that too but uh you know mayor saga is no fan of Trump either and I I think he has a lot of good reasons for wanting to run again right he was up for being governor for four years right we knew\nHe really thought he was going to win it didn't work out like that or he came in six in Madison right let's you know that's his own terms that came in six\nBut I think he'd like after the ... the big flood crisis in August uh they're I think of the city got a really good response from the public and he was all over that and that may have changed his mind about things and\nI I think he's I think a lot of people it's easy to hate on the mayor as we've seen with the council over the years but he uh he's is his former opponents got Resnick says in in the article in this week's dismiss\nHe takes is still very seriously he's a he's a discipline politician and in at least in two thousand Fifteen Scott Resnick said all these things that he thought would be weaknesses of the mayor he watched him over as the election aired sort of check these things off the boxes and turning these weaknesses in strength\nAnd we're already seeing a teeny bit with the mayor in terms of\nA hiring new sustainability coordinator in uh in other actions like that and I think it's going to be one heck of a race in probably good for the city or they have a\n... a barn burner about election for mayor\nAnd until you mentioned a flight that's one of the big things yeah wants to pay you know accomplish that's one of the things that\nHe wants to do infrastructure he wants to run or some of the other projects that he really wants to to get going ... sure he mentioned the public market as being one of them are he he also mentioned how when he left
