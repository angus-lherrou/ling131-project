isn't acted the charging of an eight dollar monthly premium to medicate versus recipients also got the green light but the administration rejected a proposal it would have required drug testing for those receiving Medicaid\nDemocratic candidate for governor Tony ... is getting protection from the state patrol that's after\nClear that it was a surprise to the Democrats on the committee at that time and certainly a surprise to the public they had no idea and it came up at ten thirty at night on the last day of budget deliberations\nRight and so obviously you know the actual system here isn't new like there have always been nine nine nine motions but from the legislators that you talk to who are some in the legislature and some are tired\nYou know how has that changed you know as as you just mentioned both of your examples has been in the last seven years or so what what's changed here\nSo uh we are as part of our reporting we looked at a a little study that the u._s._a. today network did that were they grabbed all of these\nWrap up omnibus budget motions and they analyze them both for the ... the number of items and sort of the impact and what they found was that under a Walker the these motions had actually increased in size and impact\nUm we did talk with a retired a state senator Dale Schultz who's a Republican and retired state senator Tim calling it's a Democrat and they both agreed that back in the seventies and eighties and nineties and the early to thousands these these motions were really intended for a last minute\nYou know technical changes so that the budget process can continue moving along and then small\nLittle mini let's call them many pork projects a little uh things that never would have made it all the way through the legislature 'cause they're so small like a twenty five thousand dollar grant to a local Historical Society or something along those lines\nSo there was sort of an informal agreements that hey this is really not for big items this is for a little guys and that's what we'll do what's changed is that vehicle has it been used\nNow in in the last several sessions to try to shepherd through some pretty major both spending and policy changes um\nAnd that's a whole separate debate about whether the policy should be a policy which has no physical impacts should be in the budget that all that's another debate altogether um but so the nature of these these wrap up\nThe motions at the end of the session has also changed now I Will say in the twenties Seventeen Nineteen budget wrap up motion it was somewhat smaller than the previous budgets before that under Walker um\nThere were fewer items and fewer pages but it did have again some policy in it that really didn't have anything to do with spending like making it\nEasier to set up a charter school for example or\nRequiring that university professors instruction time be you know analyzing logged unreported so\nUm anyway they said that that that was the thrust of the story is that you've got these things that are being kind of slipped in or in the case of like that Senate bill fifty four recalled those body Snatchers bills where you know just like an invasion of the body Snatchers back in the late seventies and you've got\nIt looks like a person looks like the same person but the whole inside the been changed and something else is there and these bills keep the same number but they do something really different from from what they were um originally introduced to do\nRight very appropriate Halloween imagery for India [laughter] and so what lawmakers say about this especially the ones that are kind of pushing a lot of these things through\nSo that there were two a couple of things we did one thing we did a reach out to John ... and he is the\nCo chairman of the joint Finance Committee\nHis point was well the budget is widely debated we go you know we have all these public hearings and it's\nIt's the most scrutinized piece of legislation that we passed and I ... to ... and that is true but what we're talking about stuff that happens after the point at which the public has a chance to scrutinize it and and so he's right he's not wrong and what he's saying but\nIt ignores a key factor which is the factor that\nWe were identifying which is the last minute budget additions\nUm and so we also talked to some Democrats including Kathleen find out the reason we talk to her as she had actually taken you know she had publicly called out these type of\nTechniques maneuvers or because she felt that it was just it's making it impossible for the public to really track what was going on and to have an influence on policy and spending and legislation and so we we talk to those those folks um and\nAnd the other thing we did was through the Wisconsin freedom of information council we surveyed the candidates for this year for legislature for the assembly and Senate and found that really all but one of them agreed that all motions all amendments all bill's really should have\nSpecific individuals sponsors so that we can figure out which lawmakers want this legislation and figure and and have access to figure out why like what would the legislation do um\nWho is pushing it you know is there a relationship between the lawmaker in the group or the individual or in the business that's trying to push this legislation so there's just more transparency and when things are done anonymously as that\nWrap up budget motion at the end of the session is done we really can't examine the motives are potential impact of some of this stuff partly because it happens at the last minute and partly because we don't even know who's pushing it\nAll right we've been speaking with the hall she used the managing editor of the center for investigative journalism dean thanks so much for chatting with me about this story today\nAll right thanks for having me Mm\nMm [noise]\nMm [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]
