Thirty years\nAnd um the word by an ear was actually really creating a challenge for us in uh Madison region on making sure that anyone who was interested in these topics felt like they were welcome and inclusive\nSo not just engineers in other words\nCorrect yes um and so we're really excited for this fresh new way of thinking about the work um and open ended up to both you know still keeping part of the national contacts but really having a local focus\nNow that the term some it is kind of interesting too I mean you could have called her the conference or workshop or a summit implies that there is going to be some sort of product at the end of that or some sort of a tree if you will I mean that's typically where you hear that that kind of term use that was that deliberate\nYes it was very deliberate um for a few reasons you know at at sustained Dana we really think of this annual gathering which we're now climate summit as the combination of all of the work happening across our various programs across our various partners\nUm acknowledging that you know we're just one small nonprofit small but mighty non\nProfit in the ecosystem of so many organizations doing amazing work and really trying to elevate all of that status and so our hope is that the tree does does grow from all of that\nWas the intern tutor for people to sort of sure what they've been doing all year or\nTwo you know sort of combine those introduced to produce something new and a new direction for the next year\nI'm you know that's a great question a little bit of both from the perspective of when you see the um when you uh ten and you see who were bringing to the stage\nUm our local ... you know these are people who are doing amazing work that are going to share but there's going to be opportunities for the audience to get involved\nAnd make sure that you know when you look around the room at the summit it is full of individuals who are doing amazing work and have just as much to offer as the people on the stage\nAnd if you're listening to this and you're like I don't have that much to offer you actually do and part of the beauty of that day is identifying where you fit into all of this work\nSo uh I notice on the website who you're asking participants to bring toilet paper ... want to get six pack rings and twisted retires so why are you asking people to bring trash to sustainability conference\nUm we are asking because we are where you know the amazing in local artists touch a pac man who is going to lead us throughout the day and some interactive collaborative art\nAnd um when you think about collaborative art\nYou know there is the process is so important and um all of us are engaging with materials that get discarded\nAnd so what can we do with those materials to gather 'em when we have you know a common vision or a common set of instructions\nAnd um the other piece of that is\nWe need to really start looking around our world and looking at things we think of trash as useful and rethinking um you know the materials that is\nPart of our question of sustainability and how do we live in a sustainable way\nDon't hope people aren't going out and buying lots of things for producing these dress dress for this conference room we're hopeful that they have these one around and we're not we really the reason the market for disposal\nExactly and that's actually where we selected these materials you know I really hope that\nUm people are using toilet paper I don't know [laughter] um but you know what in my in my class to tap my friends and neighbors to gather these materials for us because we're asking everyone together even if you're not attending but we hope you do tend to bring them [noise]\nUm I learned that there is some toilet paper with out several without rules and I remind blown right I'm going to sustainability field and that little piece of information\nUm was new to me so very what's I talk about\nSome of the keynote speaker or who's Victoria beret\nOh man if you don't know Victoria Barry are going to want to know her so she is actually a um you W freshmen here in Madison and she is part of the group of youth who

story and what is that story but also\nSo really about the skills that he his students can use those\nI'm beyond and he also you know works with indigenous use\nWhich one we're looking at the

indigenous sketch comedy group um that is national\nAnd last year we showed a video of Dallas gold tooth um who is a community activist and that um fourteen Ninety One as well as Dallas use humor um to help us engage with these difficult tensions and topics in conversations of our time\nAnd um last year people loved or hated Dallas which from my perspective means um we're in for a real treat to engage and think really critically but you know having a little bit of fun while we so that\nPeople are hit it the people who hated it and they feel it was inappropriate for a conference to have humor I mean we're talking about a serious subject what sustainability afraid of the earth was that was not the critique or\nCritique was I think like any comedian um humor lands and sometimes makes you really question your own actions on your own beliefs and that can be hard if you weren't prepared\nFor it or a little uncomfortable source for perhaps your own Hyde Park hypocrisy yes so we're going to explore some of which we all her of course and a ... year you're focusing on leaders under thirty tell us about the live forward\nProject was yes to the live four to ... which were formerly the I'm
