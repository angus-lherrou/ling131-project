I had one cared for three yards why do you think blacks years not been able to get going this year I think\nIt's it's it's partially because what I Do too I ... on a on a defensive side it's like well we know they're trying to get the ball and this guy's hand they ate him a screen pass swing past they had him which authors um they have mine up that receiver they try to get this guy the boss of the deepest keen on them so it was hard for him to get going\nIf we're not able to spread the ball around a similar to you know we showed you know we should show spurts of that last week but\nYou know when a defensive Keenan on the guy's really hard to get going and I think you know things we saw generic grand do ah in years past it started to do\n... twenty nine I'm forty six two hundred and sixty seven yards three picks him one touched down both melting that six receptions for Seventy yard last year six catches forty four I'm an eddy Lewis had four catches for twenty eight yards Travis folk like had five receptions for forty seven yards and a score\nFor Illinois on the ground Reggie Corbin eleven garish for a hundred and forty four yards and score AJ Bush Eighteen for a buck thirty nine and two scores Mike Epstein\nNod for sixty four and a touchdown and a rave on Bonner at for for Eighteen throwing the football ha Bush uh ten of Eighteen eighty nine yards and a scarlet stamps had downstairs here's coach\nYou know we've got penalties on what returns penalties ... we've got dropped off and you know turnovers defense we lose contain on the quarterback jump out of gaps coming side on calls are supposed to\nGo outside when are we supposed to go inside just a lot of things on me I'm I'm head coach it's my responsibility and I'm going to get fixed so we're going to open it up or questions\nSame a place you know that we've talked about before we keep working and I'm you know we we got a lot of work to do a lot of things to clean up ... with the guys out there as between me and you guys\nAre just not how would you assess are performing\nAt three interceptions you know that's a that's not good enough\nOr through some are good balls obviously had a lot of yours but we've got three interceptions in a way it does some issues in the red zone with\nA warming up are you close to pull on them and things like what are known\nTo be a permanent thing or the ... are\nStill experimenting obviously a drum Washington was going to be able to play the day do the injury so it was something that um you know we we thought we would try to do good about numbers just\nA just in the desert himself during the week or I shouldn't say he he hurt himself during the week he was feeling some pain last week and the game or did not practice or this week we try to go out pregame couldn't do it\nWith you you mentioned the run earlier in the week several teams out an ad in the long touchdown run run\nTo fix that diseases when\nI got to be practicing it just changes\nBut you're right you know when do we gotta figure out figure it out you know we've been doing is a long time and to play team defense you gotta be discipline um you know one of the things I Know our players are doing is they they they say they want to make plays and a place will come to you when you play the call in or in the right spot\nUm you can't just go outside of the framework of the defense of coal and expect to make place you gotta you gotta play discipline football you got to be ... sound you got to do with the call is called to do and you gotta do it consistently\nWhat do you think it was translated\nInto\nBeing young but most of your older guys are on the news so\nWhy I think that's\nA it's a good question um there's a concern on the fence you\nKnow what one of the thing I Know I Do know the gears a lot of problems in competition and um you know we're we're missing a lot of defensive scholarship players in Estonia excuse but that's reality and\nThe ... sign up for a while you know I'm you know the issues are where we lost some guys are summers hurt us more or less thought because we've had some measures we've got some guys playing out a position we don't have a lot of ... that's a reality and um you know competition is a\n... something to fix there's a lot of problems you know and the right now we don't have it and um I got to get it fixed\nCame into the the optimistic that this program would take a step forward how concerned are out surprise to you that what's happened the last four\nYou know disappointed obviously I'm Still a lot of things that have changed since then and like I said when you're talking about some games sixteen defensive scholarship players out that that hurts we've\nGot a young team often but we still we got drops we've got penalties thought we've got things and you cannot do on off ants and have a chance to win football games they continue to happen and um you know the lack of focus you know a lack of attention to detail if something's got to be coached differently um we we got to figure it out but\nUh you know obviously it was a lot more optimistic about\nOur chances to win these games that are that we've been playing and um it hasn't happened\nLately game to ah versus\nLaw if you look at how we were running about ...\nSamples that\nHe'll go down there I'm no\nFan of food and understandably so what what\nWas understandably so we're down Seventeen you needed a field goal no matter what\nOur starting kicker is on available ... we're in a position where we can get three points that we're going to need no matter what\nUh so if we don't we go for it and we don't make it the games probably over at that point so we needed points so matter what so we're in position for our kicker to make the kick and put the points on the board when\nYou sing along the Gulf with aggravated [noise] ah I think it was a screenplay I well you guys plan on going up or down it it will to pick out all\nBased on the result of the play um [noise]\nYou know we didn't get anything you know we would have gotten some positive yard has dinner would have been conversation about what we would do um you know it is what it is Justin could not go today you know and when you you don't have that guy you gotta make different decisions we call the play that we thought we'd get some positive yards\nAnd then you have an opportunity to make a decision you know if you don't get the first on on poor down didn't happen we're in a situation you know well we can either try to go forward on it or try ticket I'm trying to kick it\nPerfect you guys there you go that his coach as downstairs are pretty defensive coach um and talked about a limitation certainly guys banked up not having the kicker today um so uh uh what was your overall say come on what coach had to say GPS will coach was\nPissed obviously and there's a couple of questions that he didn't\nHe didn't answer but he definitely could I mean but does that the reality yeah that's the stuff that's happened happening behind closed doors\nYou know kind of pointing out specific areas in which uh you know we were deficient as a defense which is obviously debt which is you know going to be you know competition and a lot of different ways because if you don't have competition good composition behind you you're not going to be challenge yourself during the week or during the games to play even better I mean that's not based on the guy's not being motivated to play that's just human nature\nUh but you know I think coach is really trying to find an answer to this I mean I don't think you know he has a plan and it says yeah well let's go out there and ms assignments and stuff like that so you know every week it's going back to the drawing board I'm really curious as to what's going to go on a behind closed doors once\nWe go crazy with this [noise]\nThis is Rutgers football my M.

three of the program he went from two Seventy one to two forty four\nA which is a twenty seven pounds in thirty three days which by the way is not a tremendous number for a man typically you know for a man that um has a lot of weight to lose you know in thirty three days we'll see anywhere probably anywhere between thirty six to forty pounds however and all over town however his\nA health uh results or hit\nOverall uh health um benefits have been ridiculous so his blood pressure is now one of four over sixty four\nWhich I Would say probably a little low [laughter] if I write his cholesterol ah when I'm Down to one oh nine from from\nTwo twenty eight wow so his HDL is at forty six and his LDL is at forty two down from Ninety seven his triglycerides are now a hundred and seven down from two fifty\nEight this is day thirty three of the ... well\nI mean I I Would think well that's basically what his doctor actually said too because I guess he had a doctor's appointment like\nThirty three day into the program which we usually tell people you know wait until you're done with the program and then go to your primary care physician and kind of do the blood work and all that other stuff but his appointment was already scheduled so he figured he'd go why not write so his primary care I fell off the chair absolutely\nJust blown away he asked him what he was doing he was like I don't understand he's like you were here a couple of months ago you know your your numbers were a disaster basically you know and his eyes I can understand how much energy I'm doing this and doing that I feel so good\nAt you know but that that's really what's cool I think right thirty three days and\nAnd literally um he's basically almost off all of his medications trauma it's tremendous tremendous um [noise] so I think that those are the coolest results right and we talk about that in the office you find\nThe health part of it is the best part land and we're able to do that because of the personalization of the of the of the system and\nPeople come in with his hair and saliva or we use blood work analysis we use DNA Analysis as well and from saliva and uh we were able to look at you know blood work in a functional level and and then to\nSee what supplements with support people need and and so everybody gains weight and different areas for a reason the body is generally trying to protect those areas because of heirs hormone\nA disruption and so you've got the different body types you got to be with the floppy overhanging belly fat or could be an internal issue portrayed in hard belly fat deliver 'em the day that that ... issue with the apple shape apple shaped generally thyroid imbalances\nOr the pear shape reproductive imbalances doesn't really matter\nOr it could be a Ninety number of things are and so we're able to use the buyer energetic scans that we use from parents water use blood work assessment tool or to see when a functional level to keep to keep a ... to keep the body functioning better not so much diagnosing disease\nAnd so then personalize the system personalize the supplements for each individual to help get that one person or into fat burning and unable to\nBasically get people into the secular state of fat burning and then the body starts bouncing self out body starts detox of flying itself\nThe hype is found this which is the uh the main hormone controller and the main thermostat of the body starts resetting itself so when people are done they're not going to put the weight back on because the thermostat is basically re set at a new number just like a house thermostat you punch in Seventy two phases Seventy two\nSo that's what we were able to do the problem is that the reason a lot of times people can't lose any weight is their thermostat is set up to fifty and no matter what they do they're going to stay to fifty\nSo then we get them their bodies bouncing come down to let's say two ten then reset the thermostat a two time you're going to say to ...\nAnd then we give everybody tools going forward as well so if you're going to you know if you if you will give you ten different ways to eat if you're waiting pops up by two or three pounds would tell you how to what to eat that day drops the weight back down so you should never really be above two or three pounds over your you know day forty or sixty or in the program weight\nSo it you know to the system it's personally from the beginning of ... at the end at the end we also use DNA\nTools or we do a DNA test\nAnd so the DNA shows a different eating a types or exercise for each individual a central the need for central vitamins and minerals\nAre different or metabolic factors are assessed so we're looking at over forty different genetic factors to help people not only help keep lose the weight but also how to keep it off going forward so\nIt's basically all encompassing from beginning to end this personalized to each individual because everybody's going to be a little different it can't be one\nOr can't be a one ah ah what one thing that fits everybody so it's got to be a little bit different thought one size fits all sir able to switch these things up and get the people get people work and get their bodies work in the right way and then when you lose the weight and your body's bouncing than health problems start to go away as well so\nIt's really uh it's all it's all about getting that weight off it's all about getting healthier\nAnd so the number to call for that is one eight five five\nFive and J died twenty five five five six five thirty four thirty eight I and that's the schedule of free go over the system in one of our local five locations in New York tri state area\nUh the best way to do it I think is to go on line you go to and jade diet dot com and that's normally Ninety nine dollars for only for only twenty seven dollars right now you can come in and we'll do a body company an appointment with us a body composition analysis we are going to look at not just wait\nWhy are we going to look at body fat percentage were going to look at body water percentage were going to look at your ... your your metabolic age so you were going to look at your basic metabolic rate and how much your and your daily caloric intake so those two numbers needs to be close to each other\nFor you to be able to lose weight we've got people routinely coming in and they're burning off let's say two thousand calories a day but their bodies function which are taken in three thousand calories a day and there are only eating Fifteen hundred calories a day and they can't figure out why they can't lose anyone\nYou know plus they're reading on the program so losing one pound to lose ... pounds thirty five hundred calories we routinely see people losing a pound a day plus or eat it so we're talking about the body burning anywhere from four thousand\nAround four thousand calories a day minimally\nA ... to to to lose the weight uh so you're not you we re route where your body's basically be using for fuel your body's just using your own toxic fat for fuel so to\nTo get that done at say five five five and jade diet one eight five five five six five thirty four thirty eight uh that's good to schedule an appointment a\nFor a free go over one of our officers now when you're calling and\nYou're talking to the folks at the at the call center there they're just an appointment they're set appointments right so they don't have all the answers to your questions I can guarantee that uh that's why we were moving all the ... just come in and and get a check up get a get a check up and all that\nUh and so just don't get mad at those people were people yelling at them all the time all the time uh and so just come in and and and\nUh and the U.S\nAre there and uh but you can also go on line A N J died dot com and that's for only twenty seven dollars normally signing nine dollars only twenty seven dollars\nOr you can um come into\nThe office will do an appointment with one of ... with one of us uh you'll also will do a body composition analysis will take a look at your weight will take a look your body fat percentage of body what percentage of visceral fat rating your metabolic cage a basic metabolic rate daily caloric intake we're looking at a bunch of different things\nA body of water so important that should be closer sixty percent\nOr if you're in the forties you can't lose weight and you're wondering why and you're walking around with a bottle of water all the time you're drinking a hundred ounces of water and you still can't lose weight\nI guarantee your body isn't absorbing it the right way you have a mineral or electric light imbalance we see these imbalances with things like yo yo dieting you'll see it with digestive issues or you'll see it with certain medications like directs that are used to control blood pressure\nOr because you're overweight or you'll see it with a with a an acid medications a lot of times you'll see it a lot of times with antidepressant medications it's one of the reasons they cause weight\nGain or and so\nYou know that might be one of the reasons you're having a problem so we take a look at that and then we can personalize the program for you and you could still lose that twenty to forty pounds more than likely you are not going to need the blood pressure medications and some of the other medications as well so we see this all the time we've seen people come off of all types of different things so there's no limit\nTo what the body can do when you get it working helpfully the body is a is a wonderful healing organisms sometimes it's just had some a lot of barriers that it can't overcome on its own it just needs a little bit of push it needs to a few dominoes to be kind of tilted in knocked down and then the body will do everything on its own after that so\nUh starts and end with the customers Asian the personalization of the of the program the bio energetic scans\nOf parents live a sample for that or blood work functional assessment a DNA testing or that shows us to over forty different metabolic factors that we assess a to help you use the tools going like a blueprint going forward on how to not only keep laid off but also had a stays healthy as possible so\nReally easy and J died dot com or when a five five five or ... diet and wanted to\nTell you about\nA Sondra are we talking about sleep I guess sleep with some some started a lot of people come in and what will sleeping issues and you know I Wonder why people are walking around with trouble to triple ... lattes well sleep eat off he's from God Knows where\nHe just sleep deprivation causes sleep deprivation is having like a to take our stomach you know I Know and that was uncomfortable and one of the most awful thing you can ...\nYeah but it's so people are coming in I guess they they're sleeping and you know they don't tell them necessarily some sleeping issues it when they come in but uh you know when they come when they're done with the price what's cool about the program like people come in and they're very they're they're very very skeptical but they are even going to lose weight and then they stop focusing on the waiting to start thinking about how their health is improving\nA center came in a thirty nine year old female or she lost ... severe sleeping issues she was she was a having a lot of getting up trouble falling asleep trouble staying asleep waking up early tossing and turning just having a ton of issues sleeping\nA and a lot of times it's a neutrino adrenal issue with cortisol levels and and things like that and you know the quarter solo so important uh they're supposed to you know they're supposed to cortisol as grades it's a it's produced by the adrenal glands and and so\nIt's supposed to during the day help you burn fat and the night help you sleep and if you're you have a dream exhaustion issues a lot of times you'll see the opposite you can't lose you can't burn fat and you can't sleep\nOr and so she came and she lost a twenty four pounds in forty days so you know ... you know great usually see twenty five to to thirty five with women so she was just a little bit on to that but what's great about it is that she ... she says that after the first seven to ten days at a program she's basically been sleeping like Iraq\nFalling asleep eleven o'clock she goes to bed with long waists are up at seven she says she doesn't even realize she's asleep anymore she's just kind of goes to bed wakes up boom rich already started day\nRested feeling great no crashes in the three o'clock in the in the afternoon and much less need for coffee in the afternoon which is great which is going to help her sleep so you see when you get this thing going in one direction it's going to stay going in one direction [noise] I'm\nTwenty four pounds sleeping like a rock she came in we did the herring saliva sample or a bio energetic scans blood work functional assessment we gave her a hormone support hype a family support we also gave her adrenal support um got they've got the body work in the right way and uh now we've got the results that we say\nIt's not surprising either right around that age right around the age of thirty nine forty I hear more and more of that ad right between the ages of like thirty nine and forty one I'm a lot of things change in the women's um\nBody you know ... and cycle right and so it's really it's interesting that every ten years right away or exactly so I think that it's interesting that um you know you brought that up a speaking of at the health benefits so we had this happen a bunch of times in our office but there's just recently happened again\nMichele I'm who am I Believe she's in her and mid thirties and she lost eighty pounds she did to round yeah I mean really very a lot of weight eighty pounds ... pounds well what happened was and she had some trouble getting pregnant with her first child and so get a lot of\nYou know I'm hormone therapy type staff and ... and ... and\nAt ... and all these other things and all of these tribes are really am known for and they'll put on weight I'll put that tell us a ton of weight I Am worried him and really just create all sorts of floating in the body and um all sorts of very unpleasant things but you know she got a baby out of it which is really a great positive because of that\nAnd she had gained not only a bunch of weight before she got pregnant but also while she was pregnant and then\nAfterwards really hard hard time taking it off so then she tried to get pregnant again and again more hormones and more and you know these procedures and unfortunately her second time was not as successful\nBut she was about eighty pounds heavier than she had started out before so she came to us she did to\nA forty day rounds which basically means ... pound for pound them both of them um and that's very um you\nKnow it it's common because this was not her regular weight right this is wait put on with your mind right so that's why she went pound for pound because her body really needed it really needed to get rid of all it's cracked\nPound for pound a pound a day for a man is impressive pound for pound for pound a day for a woman his job search\nWe've had a number of women without an atmosphere at so anyway\nSo she comes and she comes and um and she says she goes you guys wouldn't believe she came in for parents saliva test I'm just one after the program and she says you wouldn't believe what I have to tell you she says I'm pregnant oh no hormones great now at\n... no ... no nothing on she says I guess my body got rid of all the ... of all the extra hormones I dropped all this way\nShe says and now it's a really great story but you know we've had this happen at you know I don't know at times I Would say yeah half a dozen two dozen times where um you know but she by the way completely didn't expect that I mean her her her and her husband\nFully like just you know we're settled with one child and happy and the baby's healthy and so now she's about to have a second one and she said\nI Can't believe I'm going to have to lose weight again but you know what I think it's going to happen to be honest with you is probably ... now they're not exactly regulator bodies more regularly our probably gain she'll probably Jay has not\nGained a ton of weight are already and she even said that with that with the first baby she had gained so much during the first couple of weeks and kept gaining and she said with this one she feels completely different she feels so much healthier and really\nFeels good not as much knowledge that during the ... really she says it's just a whole different experience for her she feels like herself and it's really great and congratulations to her and I you know looking forward to meeting that healthy baby\nYeah that's that's awesome we had a chill also I had to somebody came and it was telling me the same thing uh Joe came in and she's thirty two years old she hasn't had a a regular cycle in years she says she would come and go heavy bleeding\nFor days on end and it wouldn't than a it would go for weeks than it would stop for months and completely inconsistent ah and she came in and I'm similar situation you know she said that it then the ... cycle totally stopped\nI'm Shauna came in and she was down so shot at it or to the program she kind of did it in a weird way she looked at it for thirty days than she had a two week vacation\nSo she did the program for thirty days stop the program two weeks short before a vacation to get her little ... to get to reset couple of days and then she came back in and to and she did another twenty days of the program she was just a total of Fifteen days are and what should the cool thing is she was away\nSo she stopped the program she's thirty days or lost a bunch of weight\nLoss of twenty five or thirty pounds or something like that and so in the thirty days went away on vacation for for ten to fourteen days and days and put any of the weight back on all while on vacation which is awesome and then\nShe came back and did another Twenty one days of the program so basically she had fifty days at a program and lost so fifty six pounds total in the fifty days\nThat's pretty impressive yeah that's great to vacation in ... in the middle ...\nYou must you must have customize that one for her\nBut yeah we have to have it a little added ... so she had a she says you know she had a vacation plans she had been away and look they're not going to tell somebody that's going to catch so we just customized before we played with it a little bit did it the right way um and what's great is she no more thyroid meds\nAre no more no more sugar medications a siren levels are normal so she doesn't need that ... to ... medications anymore uh and when she came in we we were able to do we did the herring saliva\nBy energetic scans gave her a hormone support gave her thyroid support she needed bankers support also and she lost she lost that weight or the DNA we're going to do the DNA is going to be used to also to help keep the weight off to keep her ... to keep her as as healthy as possible uh and you know when your thyroid\n... you know it's really important when you're talking about people that are coming in LA Times with mineral imbalances in and things like that\nUh that affects the thyroid a lot the thyroid really that I ... got to get by with sodium to get into the cells of the thyroid a teach for each to even work so that's why you know people have a sluggish thyroid a lotta times you'll see weight gain and the problem might not even be with the ... the problem might be but the fact that your body's not as bad as the mineral imbalance and the and the um\nThe the the ... dying may not be with you get into the cello the thyroid gland so you know that conversion the tea forty three ah is really get that that that sort of the the gas pedal to their metabolism so to speak\nAnd if that's not happened the right way so if you're if you're having a hard time losing weight you have a mineral imbalance unlock trade imbalance a meeting your body isn't absorbing water properly before because of that you'll be affected on the weight loss ... end of it and now if you're if let's say the thyroid if you've got fired issues\nAnd you're not be able to lose way a lot of times we'll see the thyroid not being able to get to even the chemicals the minerals into the thyroid to get the the whole process going so that'll slow it down also so it's all important your body is just a ... an amazing amazing mechanism but unfortunately here and there will see\nA few issues come up a few imbalances come up and that's all it takes really is a few imbalances in getting it going the wrong way and you're going to stay going the right or wrong way and then\nConversely speaking you get it moving the right way it's just the body heal so great on its own then once you get a deal in the right way you're going to be able to keep it going that way and and and get on the road to help them stay on the road health so\nReally the one eight five five five and Jay diet a one eight five five five six five thirty four three

thirty has diets\nI cannot imagine and about what the body to coming up\nThe body fat went from thirty percent or twenty six percent tremendous tremendous right I sort of twenty three days and it's great right so you're he basically replaced water ... percent about what was right body fat he replaced it with two percent body mass and a muscle mass excuse me and\nA two percent or more than two percent water so really that's exactly how those numbers it's supposed to work\nThat's exactly what it is yeah the muscle weighs more than fat that also has more water in it or and so when you get rid

O. R. voice of New York and I hardly\nGet sixty five and cloudy at\nFive o'clock good evening I'm the woman lightens Brett Kavanaugh will be the newest member of the Supreme Court vice president Mike Pence making the big announcement and the Senate this afternoon after a final vote on the judge\nAt that big hospital and one who came with us pinpoint treatment cancer free and I told the story on the radio and this doctor from a neighboring big city heard about it and his loved one at the same moment had the same disease cancer of the ...\nShe was an older woman about Seventy Seventy five and she had already been scheduled for the surgery and she was going to be operated on but the next day\nAnd he calls me up and says the emails and he says Dr Lederman my loved one has the same thing you were talking about a ... cancer cancer the man double she's scheduled for surgery\nAnd I didn't know what to do\nAnd I said well you can do whatever you want the best thing is to inform the patient to let the patient know what the options are\nUntil that surgery is done you can always cancel the surgery until the moment the surgeries done you can cancel that surgery I once had a patient a doctor who came to me from Atlanta Georgia\nWith a cancer also the head and neck area the throat and they carry means the throat the mouth\nThe voice box at a doctor who had a large square ms ... of the neck\nAnd he was on a gurney on a stretcher going into one of the operating rooms that one of the biggest hospitals in New York City and he had heard about our work and going into the operating room he jumped off the gurney\nYou wrapped himself the sheet he ran out got a taxi and he came to us\nAnd if you get a book with about radio surgery you'll see his picture was big\nIn fact mass before and gone after treatment that I get tired of that he was so happy that he jumped off the gurney and left that hospital ran away and got an a taxi came to us that non invasive treatment he was so happy\nAnd for this woman why should she have that chance to why is the other people the family and the other is trying to protect her from information\nThat could change your life so much that I told the doctor who was a personal friend of this woman who had the\nCancer demand the ball she was scheduled to have surgery or the next day\nGive her the chance she can always cancel the surgery for one week she can come here from that city she can come here and meet and talk and learn about all the options well about six hours later I got an a text message from the doctor and the family saying\nThey're afraid to tell her that she already has her heart sat on this big surgery and they don't want to upset the apple cart okay they don't want to upset the apple cart they're going to take this older woman\nWith a man they'd be their cancer and let her have her job removed the leg removed from the bone removed from the leg and pick out our teeth do radical surgery and then\nAnd I said that your choice it's your choice I Would advise to let the patient decide the patient wasn't given any options by the doctors at the super duper big hospital none of New York city and another neighboring city\nNot so far away\nAnd then I heard nothing more I heard nothing more than a month later that Dr set me another email\nAnd he said Dr Lederman I just want to let you know that the patient had the surgery as planned as we discussed and within days she died of surgical complications\nWow wow\nAnd this is a woman who's closest friends and family knew that you could have had non surgical options and yet decided not to tell her the thoughts her heart was set of surgery she had that surgery and sad to say she died of that surgery which\nIs another reason to avoid radical surgery radical surgery is called radical surgery for a reason and it's not so easy as we age I Know young people as well as older people who died during surgery surgery is traumatic to the body\nThat's the beauty of stereo tactic body radio surgery the technology that were first in America with as we brought\nRadio surgery we offered it to you first in America delivered to first of
