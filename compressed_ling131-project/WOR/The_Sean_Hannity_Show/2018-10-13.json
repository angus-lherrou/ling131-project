losing in medicine is we're fit for we're forgetting about quality of life we don't save lives if we don't have quality left in it all of those aspects has to be\nWorked with and and your your good physician does work with that and and and you know if you've been to a physician and you walk out I don't care if they save your life to the surgery but they're rude and mean then you don't really

medicine to use fear to get people to do it we want no bounds of nature we use education jobs here means teacher so so that people can make that choice not fear I don't believe in fear factor\nAnd the health triad is also just magical and ... ... one wonderful thing as a health coach when you're working with people\nAnd sometimes there's decided they helped tryout that people can't face you know they're just they been working on it long enough and they're done they're like I'm given up on the physical and I can't lose weight or I can do whatever I'm done I'm not going to work on that anymore and so\n... the health coaches that\nIf you just work on two sides of the triangle the third one comes up naturally on its own so we just say okay let's set that aside for now and let's look at the other two ... and ... it improves and then as things improve then they get more\nWilling to look at that site that so difficult for them\nSo you have a health coach that takes a customer or through the various ways in which the fruits and veggies interact perhaps with other medications or how much you should take what time you should take them what are some of the different roles that health coach fails when they start taking balance of nature\nWell the main role of a health coach is\nBecause we are results based company is to make sure that our customers are getting results or you know we all there's always results with balance of nature all you have to do is take it and and we teach our health coaches that because that is absolutely true we've done the research we know that we know the results that you're getting\nOn the human cell if you just to swallow them but you don't always feel it\nExactly whether you fill it or not the result is there and you know I I Hope this person doesn't mind that I use the example of not use names anyways but just just yesterday I had a wonderful experience speaking with a man and um and in\nRelation to what you're talking about what do we talk about with our health coaches his it's based upon the try out of help and that's what I built after five six years of practice and I started to realize and see this that everybody's help is based on three factors and and a lot of people don't go I've heard this before but not this model of it\nBecause we are based upon a chemical aspect of health that's nutrition that the air we breathe the drugs everything in our body it's a chemical we are a chemical laboratory so everything's based upon the raw materials of ... of of chemistry\nAnd then and there's good and there's bad okay and then there's the physical side of help and that's an aspect we have to we have to address always and then there's the at the mental\nOh spiritual emotional side of that is all one that's not three different things that one side of your health try it and so we work on goals on all three of those sides to help people really see the greatest benefit and for example I was with somebody yesterday and ah\nAs I was talking with him is a good man and so one of his goals hit you know they'd written down be good to people do kind things for people and those are all important but I just looked at him finally I said\nYou do all those things you are that person you could just see it in him and fill it from him and finally I looked at my you know what you're what you're dealing with is fear\nBecause fear and face cannot coexist you can't have them in the same space one chases the other out and so\nWith tears he finally said you're right\nI don't trust I Need to change the trust in my life and he left with a new resolve to trust to trust in the process of his body to trust in the process of things to trust in people\nAnd he he will have a whole change in his life because now we're working all three sides we had some other goals of walking and being active and and and obviously was with nutrition we had several several goals but until we found that one he wasn't a change person\nHe will see results now\nWe're going to take a short break and we'll be right back with more from Dr Douglas Howard answers and Howard don't go away\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in

Laurence Smith and we are talking about why whole foods or the answer to many health problems versus taking supplements that have vitamins\nI'm the founder and formulate or a balance of nature Dr Douglas Howard and his wife Susan Howard Dr Howard is a medical doctor had real practical Dr researcher and specialist in vitamin nutrient\nDr Howard what is new is that you can tell us with balance of nature and and truly what do I know you do research continually you're one of those perpetual scientists\nTell us what you're learning ... even more and more as the results come in to the company about what the wonderful people who are taking this product what it's doing for them\nYou know it was beautiful the balance of nature is it's not new is the oldest form of nutrition on the earth and that's exactly what it was made for us you know yes I'm always researching and finding and driving a how and why does it work\nBut the beauty of it is we don't have to reinvent it every couple of years and make a special a new\nBecause the formula for balance of nature has been here for thousands of years on the earth it's one hundred percent pure fruits and vegetables\nThere's nothing added and nothing taken away from it except for the water it's pure produce\nIt took years of which fruit and which vegetable and and how they would interact with each other and studying that through and then doing studies with with the electron microscopy to different universities so they could study by electron microscopes\nHow it was affecting the DNA the very best and then some of the studies we were doing was how it would affect the immune system the most you remember the game pacman of course okay well you've got white blood cells in there that run around like pacman going you know to to eat the the bad things\nAnd that's what those white blood cells are out there to do so we tested how many of those white blood cells could be out there to eat up the things that shouldn't be in your blood\nAnd how quickly they could respond those immune studies those DNA studies and studies about how the red blood cell could receive the nutrition and receive oxygen so get out to where it needed and also even studies about the ... the blood or in other words\nThe thickness of the blood how it flows through the veins and can get to the smallest possible vessels\nAll of that put together then I studied which fruits and vegetables and combining those until we had sixteen different fruits and Fifteen but different vegetables\nThat made the greatest impact on those things and in the DNA for example how could protected the most and how quickly the DNA could repair itself wind damage to those are all things that help prevent aging diseases\nIt's always such a great pleasure to speak with you Dr Howard and Susan Howard from balance of nature what I find remarkable is how easy balance of nature has made it for me to get more than\nTen real whole servings of fruits and vegetables every day it really is remarkable beautiful benefits of the ... the whole house system\nJust so much about what good nutrition means and what it can mean for everyone's life no matter what age it's a real

if you guys get a chance definitely go to and J died dot com and take a look at that profile picture sixty four pounds of sixty days is very impressive\nMan and woman it doesn't matter how old you are I mean it really is that um [noise] it's an ...\nAn astronomical number in my opinion on his officers I I think something to this effect again I don't know the patient personally because I don't go to the Brooklyn office but\nAh you know this is just staggering number and really just the health a benefactor the vast officer any tracing criminals around I bet you can do it much easier sixty four pounds down I Would think so I definitely I think that's probably a better situation for them especially in this heat and we've got going on them\nSo we improved we've we improved the safety of our city just yes that's correct if he can chased on criminal ... yeah ... ... yeah when I went wow ups yeah when when\nOne at a time right so but you know ... pounds a great but I think that um a lot of what we see in our office is really the health benefits of what happens and um\n[noise] you know just losing ten twelve or Fifteen pounds can make such a huge difference in how you feel and\nUm what your blood tests are and where your numbers are so we stand who are just um was in and he's on day thirty three of the program he went from two Seventy one to two forty four\nA which is a twenty seven pounds in thirty three days which by the way is not a tremendous number for a man typically you know for a man that um has a lot of weight to lose you know in thirty three days we'll see anywhere probably anywhere between thirty six to forty pounds however and all over town however his a\nHealth uh results or hit overall uh health um benefits have been ridiculous so his blood pressure\nIs now one of four over sixty four which I Would say probably a little low [laughter] if I write his cholesterol ah when I'm Down to one oh nine from from two twenty eight wow\nSo his HDL is at forty six and his LDL is at forty two down from Ninety seven\n... his triglycerides are now a hundred and seven down from two fifty eight this is day thirty three of the ... well\nI mean I I I Would think well that's basically what his doctor actually said too because I guess he had a doctor's appointment like\nThirty three day end to the program which we usually tell people you know wait until you're done with the program and then go to your primary care physician and kind of do the blood work and all that other stuff but his appointment was already scheduled so he figured he'd go why not write so his primary care I fell off the chair absolutely\nJust blown away he asked him what he was doing he was like I don't understand he's like you were here a couple of months ago you know your numbers were a disaster basically you know and these guys I can understand I have so much energy I'm doing this and doing that I feel so good\nAt you know but that that's really what's cool I think right thirty three days and and\nLiterally um he's basically almost off all of his medications trauma it's tremendous tremendous um\nBut I think that those are the coolest results right and we talk about that in the office you find\nThe health part of it is the best part land and we're able to do that because of the personalization of the of the of the system and\nPeople come in with his hair and saliva or we use blood work analysis we use DNA Analysis as well and from saliva and uh we were able to look at you know blood work in a functional level and and then to\nSee what supplements with support people need and and so everybody gains weight and different areas for a reason\nThe body is generally trying to protect those areas because of heirs hormone\nA disruption and so you've got the different body types who got to be with a flat fee overhanging belly fat or could be an internal issue for treating hard belly fat deliver 'em the day that that side Roy issue with the apple shape apple shaped generally thyroid imbalances\nOr the pear shape reproductive imbalances doesn't really matter\nOr it could be a Ninety number of things are and so we're able to use the buyer energetic scans that we use from parents lobby used blood work assessment tool or to see when a functional level to keep to keep a ... to keep the body functioning better not so much diagnosing disease\nAnd so then personalize the system personalize the supplements for each individual to help get that one person or into fat burning and unable to\nBasically get people into the secular state of fat burning and then the body starts bouncing self out body starts detox of flying itself\nThe hype asylum is which is the uh the main hormone controller and the main thermostat of the body starts resetting itself so when people are done they're not going to put the weight back on because the thermostat is basically re set at a new number just like a house thermostat you punch in Seventy two phases Seventy two\nSo that's what we were able to do the problem is that the reason a lot of times people can't lose any weight is their thermostat is set up to fifty and no matter what they do they're going to say to fifty\nSo then we get them their bodies bouncing come down to let's say two ten and re set the thermostat a two time you're going to say to ...\nAnd then we give everybody tools going forward as well uh so if you're going to you know if you if you will give you ten different ways to eat if your weight even pops up by two or three pounds would tell you how to what to eat that day drops the way back down so you should never really be above two or three pounds over a year you know day forty or or a six year and a program wait\nSo ah you know to the system it's personally from the beginning was ... at the end at the end we also use DNA\nTools but we do a DNA test\nAnd so the DNA shows a different eating uh types of exercise for each individual a central the need for central vitamins and minerals or ... different or metabolic factors are assessed\nSo we're looking at over forty different genetic factors to help people not only help keep a lose the weight but also how to keep it off going forward so\nIt's basically all encompassing from beginning to end this person lives to each individual because everybody's going to be a little different camping one\nUh can't be a one or what one thing that fits everybody so it's got to be a little bit different fat one size fits all travel to switch these things up and get the people get people work and get their bodies work in the right way and then when you lose the weight and your body's bouncing the health problems start to go away as well so\nIt's really uh it's all it's all about getting that weight off it's all about getting healthier\nAnd so the number to call for that is one eight five five\nFive and Jay diet twenty five five five six five thirty four thirty eight\nI and that's the schedule of free go over the system and one of our local five locations in the New York tri state area\nOr the best way to do it I think is to go on line and you go to and jade diet dot com and that's normally Ninety nine dollars for only for only twenty seven dollars right now you can come in will do a body count be an appointment with us a body composition and now says we're going to look at not just wait are we going to look at body fat per se\nYou know plus the reading on the program so losing one pound to lose ... pounds thirty five hundred calories we routinely see people losing a pound a day plus the reading so we're talking about the body burning anywhere from four thousand\nAround four thousand calories a day minimally\nA ... to to to lose the weight uh so you're not you we re route where your body's basically using for fuel your body's just using your own toxic fat for fuel so to\nTo get that done it said five five five and Jay diet one eighty five five five six five thirty four thirty eight or that's good to schedule an appointment a for free\nGo over one of our officers now when you're calling and you're talking on the folks at the at the call center there they're just an appointment they're set appointments right so they don't have all the answers to your questions I can guarantee that uh that's why we were moving all the ... just come in and get a check up get a get a checkup and all that\nUh and so just don't get mad at those people with people yelling at him all the time all the time\nOr and so just come in and and and uh and the U.S\nAre there and but you can also go on line A N J died dot com and that's for only twenty seven dollars normally signing nine dollars only twenty seven dollars or you can um come into\nThe office will do an appointment with one of ... with one of us are you also will do a body composition analysis will take a look at your weight will take a look your body fat percentage your body water percentage of visceral fat writing your metabolic cage basic metabolic rate daily caloric intake we're looking at a bunch of different things\nOr body water so important that should be closer to sixty percent\nOr if you're in the forties you can't lose weight and you're wondering why and you're walking around with a bottle of water all the time you're drinking a hundred ounces of water and you still can't lose weight\nI guarantee your body isn't absorbing it the right way you have a mineral or electric light imbalance we see these imbalances with things like yo yo dieting you'll see it with digestive issues or you'll see it with certain medications like directs that are used to control blood pressure\nOr because you're overweight or you'll see it with a with a an acid medications a lot of times you'll see it a lot of times with antidepressant medications it's one of the reasons they cause weight\nGain a and so\nYou know that might be one of the reasons you're having a problem so we take a look at that and then we can personalize the program for you and you could still lose that twenty to forty pounds more than likely you are not going to need the blood pressure medications and some of the other medications as well so we see this all the time we've seen people come off of all types of different things so there's no limit\nTo what the body can do when you get it working helpfully the body is a is a wonderful healing organism sometimes it's just has some a lot of barriers that it can't overcome on its own it just needs a little bit of push it needs to a few dominoes to be kind of tilted in knocked down and then the body will do everything on its own after that so\nUh starts and end with the customers Asian the personalization of the of the program the bio energetic scans\nOr the hair and saliva sample for that or blood work functional assessment a DNA testing or that shows us over forty different metabolic factors that we assess or to help you use the tools going like a blueprint going forward on how to not only keep laid off but also had a stays healthy as possible so\nReally easy and J died dot com or when a five five five or ... diet and wanted to tell you about\nA Sondra are we talking about sleep I guess sleep with some some started a lot of people come in and what will sleeping issues and you know I Wonder why people are walking around with trouble to triple ... lattes well sleep it off he's from God Knows where\nHe just sleep deprivation causes sleep deprivation is having like a to take our stomach you know I Know and that was uncomfortable and one of the most awful thing you can ...\nYeah but it's so people are coming in I guess they they're sleeping and you know they don't tell them necessarily some sleeping issues it when they come in but uh you know when they come when they're done with the price what's cool about the program like people come in and they're very they're they're very very skeptical but they are even going to lose weight and then they stop focusing on the waiting to start thinking about how their health is improving\nA center came in a thirty nine year old female or she lost ... severe sleeping issues she was she was a having a lot of getting up trouble falling asleep trouble staying asleep waking up early tossing and turning just having a ton of issues sleeping\nA and a lot of times it's a neutrino adrenal issue with cortisol levels and and things like that and you know the quarter solo so important uh they're supposed to you know they're supposed to cortisol as grades it's a\nIt's produced by the adrenal glands and and so it's supposed to during the day help you burn fat and the night help you sleep and if you're you have a dream exhaustion issues a lot of time just to the opposite you\nCan't lose you can't burn fat and you can't sleep\nOr and so she came and she lost a twenty four pounds in forty days so you know ... you know great usually see twenty five to to thirty five with women so she was just a little bit on to that but what's great about it is that she ... she says that after the first seven to ten days at a program she's basically been sleeping like Iraq\nFalling asleep eleven o'clock she goes to bed with long waists are up at seven she says she doesn't even realize she's asleep anymore she's just kind of goes to bed wakes up boom rich already started day\nRested feeling great no crashes in the three o'clock in the in the afternoon or much less need for coffee in the afternoon which is great which is going to help her sleep say see when you get this thing going in one direction it's going to stay going in one direction\n[noise] I'm twenty four pounds sleeping like a rock she came in\nWe did the herring saliva sample or a bio energetic scans blood work functional assessment we gave her a hormone support hype a family support we also gave her adrenal support um got they've got the body work in the right way and uh now we've got the results that we say\nIt's not surprising either right around that age right around the age of thirty nine forty I hear more and more of that ad right between the ages of like thirty nine and forty one I'm a lot of things change in the women's um\nBody you know ... and cycle right and so it's really it's interesting that every ten years right away that place I think that it's interesting that um you know you brought that up a speaking of at the health benefits so we've had this happen a bunch of times in our office but this just recently happened again\nMichele I'm who am I Believe she's in her mid thirties\nAnd she lost eighty pounds she did to round yeah I mean really really a lot of weight IT past eighty pounds well what happened was and she had some trouble getting pregnant with her first child and so get a lot of you know I'm hormone therapy type staff and ... and ... and\nAt ... and all these other things and all of these tribes are really am known for and they'll put on weight I'll put that tells us a ton of weight I Am worried him and really just create all sorts of floating in the body and um all sorts of very unpleasant things but you know she got a baby out of it which is really a great positive because of that\nAnd she had gained not only a bunch of weight before she got pregnant but also while she was pregnant and then\nAfterwards really hard hard time taking it off so then she tried to get pregnant again and again more hormones and more and you know these procedures and unfortunately her second time was not as successful as her first but she was\nAbout eighty pounds heavier than she had started out the forces she came to us she did to a forty days around which basically means she went pound for pound and both of them um and that's very um you know\n... it's common because this was not her regular weight right this is wait put on with your mind right so that's why she went pound for pound because nobody really needed it needed to get rid of all it's great so pound for\nPound a pound a day for a man is impressive pound for pound packs a day for a woman is job search\nWe had a number of women are like ... ... so anyway so she comes and she comes and um and she says she goes you guys wouldn't believe\nShe came in for ... saliva test I'm just one after the program and she says you wouldn't believe what I have to tell you she says I'm pregnant oh no hormones great now a\n... no ... no nothing on she says I guess my body got rid of all the ... of all the extra hormones I dropped all this way\nShe says and now I'm pregnant [laughter] it's a really great story but you know we've had this happen at you know I don't know any time I would say yeah half a dozen two dozen times where um you know but she by the way completely didn't expect that I mean her her her and her husband\nFully like just you know\nWe're settled with one child and happy and the baby healthy and so\nNow she's about to have a second one and she says I Can't believe I'm gonna have to lose weight again but you know what I think he's going to happen to be honest with\nYou now they're not exactly regulator bodies more regularly or probably gain she'll probably Jay has not\nGained a ton of weight already and she even said that with that with the first baby she had gained so much during the first couple of weeks and kept gaining and she said with this one she feels completely different she feels so much healthier and really\nFeels guy is not as much knowledge that during the ... really she says it's just a whole different experience for her she feels like car south and it's really great and congratulations to her and uh you know looking forward to meeting that healthy baby\nYeah that's that's awesome we had a chill also I had a somebody came in was telling me the same thing\nUh Joe came in and she's thirty two years old she hasn't had a a regular cycle in years she says it was she would come and go heavy bleeding for days on end and it wouldn't then uh it would go for weeks than it would stop for months and completely inconsistent\nAh and she came in in a similar situation you know she said that it didn't have to type a cycle totally stopped\nNo really don't know you know you could be best friends with someone else who provide positive things for you yeah yeah\nThat's true I'm Shauna came in and she was down ... shot at it or to the program she kind of did it in a weird way she looked at it for thirty days than she had a two week vacation\nSo she did the program for thirty days stop the program two weeks short before a vacation to get her little ... to get to reset couple of days and then she came back in and to and she did another twenty days of the program she was just a total of fifty days are and what should the cool\nThing is she was away so she stopped the programs for thirty days or lost a bunch of weight\nLoss of twenty five or thirty pounds or something like that in ... in the thirty days went away on vacation for a pretend to fourteen days and days and put any of the weight back on all while on vacation which is awesome and then\nShe came back and did another Twenty one days of the program so basically she had fifty days at a program and lost so fifty six pounds total in the fifty days\nThat's pretty impressive yeah that's great to vacation in\n... in the middle said you must you must have customize that one for her\nBut yeah we have to add to that a little added ... so she had a she says you know she had a vacation plans she had been away and\nLook they're not going to tell somebody not to go on vacation so we just customized before we played with it a little bit did it the right way um and what's great is she no more thyroid meds\nAre no more no more sugar medications a siren levels are normal so she doesn't need that ... to ... medications anymore or and when she came in we we were able to do we did the hair on saliva\nBy energetic scans gave her a hormone support gave her thyroid support she needed tankers support also and she lost she lost that way or the DNA we're going to do the DNA is going to be used to also to help keep the weight off to keep her ... to keep her as as healthy as possible uh and you know when your thyroid\n... you know is really important when you're talking about people that are coming in LA Times with mineral imbalances in and things like that\nUh that affects the thyroid a lot the thyroid really that I ... got to get by with sodium to get into the cells of the thyroid a T free to even work so that's why you know if people have a sluggish thyroid a lotta times you'll see weight gain and the problem might not even be with the ... the problem might be but the fact that your body's not is has a mineral imbalance and the and the uh\nThe the the ... dying may not be with you get into the cello the thyroid gland so you know that conversion the tea forty three is really get that the that sort of the the gas pedal to their metabolism so to speak and if that's not happened the right way so if you're if you're having a hard time losing weight you have a mineral imbalance unlock trade imbalance\nA meeting your body isn't absorbing water properly before because of that you'll be affected on the weight loss ... end of it and now if you're if let's say the thyroid if you've got fired issues\nAnd you're not be able to lose way a lot of times we'll see the thyroid not being able to get to even the chemicals the minerals into the thyroid to get the the whole process going so that'll slow it down also so it's all important your body is just a ... an amazing amazing mechanism but unfortunately here and\nThere will see\nA few issues come up a few imbalances come up and that's all it takes really is a few imbalances in getting it going the wrong way and you're going to stay going the right or wrong way and then\nConversely speaking you get it moving the right way it's just the body heal so great on its own then once you get it here on the right way uh you're going to be able to keep it going that way and and and get on the road to help them stay on the road health so\nReally easy one eighty five five five and Jay diet a one eight five five five six five thirty four three thirty eight that the schedule a free go over and one of our offices and the New York tri state area or the easiest way I think is an J died dot com\nOr Ninety nine dollars normally but now as a

locations in New Jersey\nOr New York city queens Brooklyn Long Island\nAre now opening in West Chester as well so everybody knows how much I Love numbers right\nAnd I'm In a number of kick today so\nWe had John who came in he's a younger guy in his early thirties um you know he ... he was having some issues you know he had that typical like a belly fat going on a he was\nOn um he was put on a med foreman already unfortunately hold a early thirties so um and so\nThe sugar yet I buy the sugar yeah for the sugar exactly and he was not diabetic yet you know I was just like a\n... pre diabetic ... diabetic I'm so twenty three days twenty points six pounds down alright everybody ready body fat percentage down in twenty three days from thirty percent or twenty six great muscle mass went from twenty percent to thirty percent\nCool water went from fifty six percent to fifty nine percent which the ideal numbers that sixty five and his blood sugar used to be a hundred and Seventy in the mornings which is why his doctor put him on the met foreman clearly\nThe empty stopped his medications because now he's at Ninety two every morning correct those are pretty cool numbers right early thirties this guy is I cannot imagine and about what the body to coming up the body fat went from thirty percent or twenty six percent tremendous tremendous right I sort of twenty three days where it's great right so you're he basically replace\nPercent about what was right body fat he replaced it with two percent body mass and a muscle mass excuse me and a two percent or more than two percent water so really that's exactly how those numbers it's\nSupposed to work that's exactly what it is now to muscle weighs more than fat that also has more water in it uh and so when you get rid of the fat basically taken the fat out replacing it with water and those are numbers exactly which was really great what ... what was what was his weight loss and how much\nA twenty points six pounds and twenty three days in tough yeah and you know it's interesting he really um if you look at him he he does not look like\nA big guy he's not a big guy but he had that like belly hanging now and you
