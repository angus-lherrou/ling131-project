of\nWhat was Rod Rosenstein doing in that meeting\nA immediately prior to the point when Robert Mueller as special counsel\nAnd are these allegations that are in the New York times actually true\nAh I think that can be a lot of life can be shut on that if the documents we've been requesting for quite some time are made public so as a result of that of is when you\nDie if they're not produced by

the country\nUm I've since learned through previous interviews that when you would go to Russia where your work brought you that you often would be debriefed by our intelligence community and you had a good relationship with them correct absolutely Sean yup yup bitten by intelligence I mean CIA FBI gosh absolutely and other intel\nCommunity people for decades yes for decades and I assume they like you and trusted you\nAbsolutely you know and we would sometimes disagree on things in terms of our various assessments you know similar to any um international relations or security discussions that I Would have back in the Pentagon et cetera but that's you know an honest debate\nRight but okay but they wanted there was never a time where you you met with anybody that wanted you to spy on your country that you love no but I again I'm happy\nTo share insights and ideas just like I Do you know used to at New York university when my students yeah that's what we're pretty open guy\nBut so anybody I guess that would regularly go to Russia because they are a hospital regime at and they've been hostile to the United states um we do know that in fact that who does have a network of\nOf their own deep stayed operatives that are trying to create chaos in America by using social media and et cetera right that you don't doubt that\nWell in terms of creating chaos in America if you compare everything that the Russians did\nVersus what the what the DNC did with their lives and millions of dollars they spent on that you talk about election interference particularly their conspiracy with the deep state you know the OJ FBI CIA now that we're learning all these details much much worse than anything Russia that\nAdded the DNC ever get away with never handing over their computers to the FBI [noise] um I don't think I'd get that consideration an option and now we're going to hire a room people what was it like when when did you first know that you were being spied on\nWell I started a I had some hints about it you know people I Know in Washington mentioned it in September of twenty sixteen right around the same time when I started getting phone calls from the New York times CNN Washington Post about these DNC funded lies and they mentioned to me that there were a\nDemocrat hired operatives working in Washington who we're paying for these ah these operations and you know soon thereafter dies I found out about the you know the hacking of my emails and wiretapping of my uh\nEndless of first happened in August so you found out pretty early\nYeah and actually I I first started getting phone calls I didn't know about the intelligence operation I just got a call ... ...\nThat they had this buys a warrant against you in the media knew about it\nOr you believe they knew about it well the first news report ah I think came out with his a lady Louise mensch in October of twenty sixteen ... within just a couple of days of all and the uh first Pfizer weren't with I think my first\nRan with the story in March of Seventy yes and that's when we said wait a minute there is a buys a warrant on the Trump campaign\nOr were you aware of our reporting at\nThe time ... it's funny Sean right hey interesting story I haven't talked about it in the media before but in March twenty Seventeen that's what's been leaked in the Washington Post that I was having all these meetings with the FBI\nI remember you know in these long series of ten hours plus meetings one of the meetings I'm walking out I mentioned\nThat well I had a long interview in detail with Catherine heritage and it's going to be airing tonight on the on the evening shows on Fox what they say they were quite a you know they they gave me a bit of luck let's just put it that way but they again because\nIt's all about you know media perception what were they asking\nYou at the time what do they want to know their spying on you and then they're bringing un simultaneously you've never been charged with anything there's no indication you're ever going to be charged with anything at all you don't fear that that in any way you're going to be charged right\nYou're a crafts in Washington well guess what they want to destroy the progress we've made the last two years\nI Hope you'll get involved this November go to tax cuts work dot com now tax cuts work dot com and by the way it will make it easy for you to send emails and tax knock on doors\nAnd help the president continues agenda tax cuts work dot com and don't forget you don't show up you get the government you deserve\nTax cuts work dot com do your part don't get out work this November tax cuts work dot com go there and now we continue with Carter Page who is with us in Studio ... today\nUm so tell me what the future lies you know for you and and I think this was all going to end soon\nAs my guess and I don't think so I don't think the president was involved in any collusion he never was I think the big story here is the abuse of power I'm putting the fix for Hillary what happened to you with the ... application warrants\nA I think the abuse of intelligence to weaponize of our intelligence is another big issue and I think there's a lot more to come I think when you hear the News Tomorrow I think you're going to be pretty shocked again that these things really did happen and I don't I in the end I don't want this to hurt law enforcement I Love law enforcement\nI Love oriental community but you can't turn the tools of intelligence as powerful as they are on the American people\nI fully agree Sean and one of the big ... problems as you're alluding to is secrecy so much is just undercover and\nYou know and even as funny over those ten plus hours of lab in last March when I was talking with the FBI agents you know eventually they were asking me a lot of questions and then as as we went further and further into the interviews towards the end of the er the long conversations\nThey started saying well our bosses want the U.S [laughter] you know and they I think they saw through it but they knew you know that was back during the ... and we'll have era as maybe one of the lessons never go visit Russia ever\n[laughter] don't go to a lot of ... Russia stay out of a President Trump has done a lot to fix that situation I think you know those are his his courage I I'm inspired by that and I think there's even that it's going to be fixed overtime I'm confident Carter Page thanks for\nBeing with us we always appreciate you being here eight hundred ... a number thank you sir\n[noise]\n\nThe voice of New York [noise]\nSeven ten W O\nSixty five degrees at five thirty good evening I'm Lisa gee Governor Cuomo says the limo driver and the upstate New York crass should not have been behind the wheel the Seventy fourth annual Columbus Day parade marched along Fifth Avenue today and the a LDS series shifts to the Bronx tonight yanks in Red Sox tied at one game apiece\nTo support the rocky by time share the team and you're stuck paying your time shares annual maintenance fees if your time share is no longer working for you and you need out called time share a Fifteen April for nine six one exit a for for nine six one exit or visit timeshare exit team dot com\nCloudy skies this evening sixty three clouds return tomorrow but warmer high Seventy seven Wednesday partly cloudy with a high of Seventy eight degrees here next update is that six breaking news at once wake up at Len Burman Michael read all in the morning six to ten am tomorrow and the ... war and NBC News radio station\nAnd hear the Boston with your traffic report and they filled out forty five minutes and upstairs at the George Washington bridge from eighty Ninety five thirty minutes of the lower levels that are from the rest of the palisades\nPark about a Fifteen to twenty minutes later and bound across from lazy Sunday third avenue that and they get that our founding pockets of delays from Portland far down to the cross Bronx Bronx River pocket simulation than hell rode the cross Bronx\nLights dump rich heavy to clean frogs named ... is a little bit better\nLincoln Tunnel now he's forty five minutes late inbound the outside Fifteen Holland is twenty minutes and\nAnd that's the only Fifteen to twenty on the outbound side\nThis report sponsored by maximus smart security lights at Costco imagine getting ... video of all activity at your door from your smartphone naturally maximus smart security lights do plus much more\nTalk live with visitors from anywhere better than a video doorbell and so easy to install get maximum security lights at your local Costco and Adrian ... and our next traffic updates excel five on seven ten wor\nBeing Uncle Sam accountable to you every day and it is on\nA twenty five now till the top of the hour eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the program oh All right let's get to our phones I Know a lot of what voters wanted away in a lot of news happening today twenty nine days till election day there is a lot at stake and I think the biggest case to be made is are you better off\nThan you were two years ago\nHave things in America change for the better do you want this party of slander the party of blood Janine people's characters do you want them rewarded because this is who they are this is what defines up the ... the not the party of due process than not the party\nOf the presumption of innocence they're the party of bludgeon\nFirst and win at all costs that's what that's what's at stake I Know it's hard to get people motivated for mid term elections oh I Hope this wakes you up I Hope this motivates you I Hope you know the stakes are high I Hope you know there's a lot in play here\nNow we know Harry yet another institution I'm Broken and the kind of Trump Supreme Court Supreme Court is heading into a crisis of legitimacy and uh and when when not if when judge Kavanaugh helps them to chip away at civil rights voting rights women's rights abortion rights [noise]\nUh I don't think it's very well with the country he promised that he'd be a hardcore person and he will be that the one thing he didn't lie about under oath\nMessage survivor Dr Ford is one we don't want to hear from you too if we have to hear from you because we're forced to ring and so that there are no ...\nNot forgive me if people would go to church and we didn't go to the closing themselves morality and that's what we're seeing today\nOr let's get to let's say Hi to Dan is in Charleston Dan Hi how are you glad you called sir\nI'm doing great show and thanks for taking my call a thank you\nThe uh the the O. J. last Thursday indicted or seven Russian hackers for hacking or any doping agencies and Westinghouse here in the United states will watch places in Europe and I was wondering if you had any take on that because\nThree of those guys were named Mueller's indictment so I'm Wondering how it is they could have been doing I don't think there's any doubt there's no\nDoubt at all that the bladder\n... in the hospital regime of Russia be him being a hostile actor that he is that they are constantly trying to\nYou know create chaos in the United states and the constantly saw\nCyberwarfare now has been going on for many many years but I'm going to tell you something that very few people will tell you and that is at some point we've got to take responsibility for the fact that this is happening not only by the Russians by the Chinese and North Korea and the Iranians even some of our so called allies are hacking into stuff\nYou know much intellectual property is stolen it's billions and billions of dollars from America's\nSame ... you know if you look at Julian Assange whose name is probably I guess the most known oh Julian Assange is wanted his mid forties somewhere in there okay but he was sixteen years old and the guy hacked into NASA and the D O D that's how long this has been going on\nNow the the fact allegedly by the way the fact\nWe have not created cyber defenses to prevent all hackers and we have and hire the best people to design the best systems to protect our intellectual property you know at some point we can't blame others at some point we gotta look inward and say uh\nMaybe we're the ones responsible that's what I'm thinking what do you think\nRight I I think you're right about that one one question that I come up with was with this uh\nThe OJ indictment is they were very specific these Russians were targeting things very very specifically I Want to know how come it is the smaller can't find anything that specifically points to exactly what they were trying to do\nYou know the the the OJ has very detailed information\nUm I Hope somebody will get you the indictment if you if you have time to look at over it's pretty it's pretty\nIn depth it damning and you're right you know understand another thing is that not one of these people the mother ever indicted from Russia especially the equivalent of their CIA agents are ever going to be brought to the United states and never pays the trial\nI don't doubt this is happening as a matter of fact it was Devon newness warned everybody what happened in twenty sixteen now every other studies have shown that it has an impact the election in any way but that's not the point the fact that we continue to have this vulnerability", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "New York", "day": "08"}
