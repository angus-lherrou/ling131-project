led northwestern ah drive down early the events do play a lot better to put a good game especially in the first half they did get worn down and have number two\nYeah in in I guess what you can really take from these types of games is you know the film study right what's your adjusting to week to week when you have a wind that close like this as opposed to when we were losing by forty it's like well they're minute details now it's now it's not like well we have to change the whole defense throat you know do the whole thing out\nAnd what are we doing wrong now it's like now we can look to that last driving say at the defense of crime and these are the small things we can work on this we don't have to change the whole defense now because we didn't get blown out clearly something's

I was only New Jersey one plus or that's probably why I was I was running around the other officer you know it's er a you know what's great about what I Would like to know I Would like to have these I Would like to\nHave the before and after a while you're going to be on our website definitely once they're finished I mean we like to you know we like to posted pictures of people being done you know several months out because the whole point really able to keep the weight off of so um and I feel that\nUm our DNA report you know I was just looking over I'm One of the patient's DNA reports um a couple of minutes ago right before we went on air and it's really amazing all this information that's in here\nUm you know we're talking about diet recommendations we're talking about eating behaviors we're talking about food reactions um we're also talking about nutrition and what works for you and what doesn't work for you such things as you know um do you have a genetic risk for decreased vitamin C. do you have a genetic risk for\nA decrease vitamin a and\nYou know and during the training what kind of exercise should you be doing so\nYou're not spinning your wheels who's ... who should be doing more of a robotic or less of this and more of that because it was going to give you that information to lead the way to\nYou know also talks about um how exercise actually how your blood pressure for example response to exercise how your cholesterol response to exercise some loss of body fat how does your body respond to exercise you know not everybody who is going to go run\nThree to four miles every other day is going to lose weight for the same way as somebody who for example will do high intensity interval training you know and wait on you know everybody's a body reacts differently and\nUh you don't necessarily need to be spending two to three hours in the gym you actually probably don't ever need to spend that long in the gym\nSo this is really what the DNA test is all about because it really gives you a road map on what you should be doing once you're through with the program I'm so valuable so cool does not change right it does not change do you have ... you have forever so none of the changes that are so much information it's almost\nA you know ... enough to keep you busy for a couple of weeks just stop trying to understand exactly how the information I'm really apply you and your body right exactly I mean really\nIt's really it's really amazing and and uh you know that that gives the tools you know that's a personal I should ... one of the parts of the personalization that we do the supplements are also personalized each individual based on a hair saliva a DNA testing blood work assessment buyer energetic scans that we use\nA two to personalize the supplements for the weight loss component and then after the weight loss component also\nAnd so that's why we're able to get these types of numbers where people are losing you know twenty to fifty pounds and only forty days and more than sixty days and that's without shots and without hormones and without surgery and they're not hungry or their bodies burning your their own toxic side for fuel and so\nThe numbers are to let me give you the number so you can call and and and take the first steps to to changing what's going on with the right now is one in five five five and Jay diet won eight five five five six five three for\nThree ate a that's a scheduled call up schedule or a or go over in our office to the program at no charge now\nThe easiest way I think they're now when you're calling please remember the people on the phones are just there to\nMake the appointment there and they don't know how the program works in the introduced to the program they don't know your specific need for whatever for the program their own leaders casually appointments so to make the point with them\nOr just keep that in mind and then we'll answer everything when you come in you can skip that whole process and just go to and J died dot com and only twenty seven dollars right now is the radio listener normally it's Ninety nine dollars\nBut only twenty seven dollars you'd come into the office I have an appointment with us do a consultation or we're going to explain everything to you\nHow the process works how we're going to personalize everything we do a body composition of assessment or we're going to take a look at things like you're a visceral fat rating\nOr if you've got high visceral fat that could be actually slowing down your metabolism and making you not be able to lose weight that fat makes you more insulin resistance are unbalanced which affects\nHow your body brings sugars into yourself for energy and if that's not happening properly then it's going to turn into fat stored and why is it so it's so dangerous is because that five is stored than on the liver on the pancreas on the other organs and so that's why obesity in itself is is basically a self perpetuating\nA type of disease really uh so we're going to take a look at the visceral fat rating would take a look at your metabolic age so yeah you're forty years old but if you're a metabolic ages eighty based on the factors that come up on that body composition analysis you're going to have a hard time losing weight\nYou know so if your body is is functioning not functioning the right way than we need to we need to change it around we need to get a goal in the right way so we use all these tools then we personalized\nSupplements based on a pair saliva by energetic testing blood work assessment if you have it using the DNA going forward and that's going to help you not only lose the weight but also keep it off going forward as well and and maintain health\nAnd really you know after the program is complete so many different tools that we give you ten different ways to eat that day to drop the way back down the DNA tested and continued assessment of hair saliva continued assessment of\nBlood work to to try to keep us functional functionally a optimally optimally functioning as as possible [noise] uh and so\nLike I said the whole thing as personalized from start to finish and that's why it works so well that's why it works better than you know pretty much anything I've ever seen a and it's really you know that's that's the whole key to it so that's Andrew dice dot com and like I said it's only twenty seven dollars on line you come in and set up an appointment New Jersey New York\nI'm very Manhattan right queen's Brooklyn Long Island uh and now in Westchester so we've got you covered in the area just have to take the first step in and sort of get a dog now you want to give me your biggest sixty days people or you want me to give you the ... my ... I went for the last time you\nKnow I I um didn't focus on the six today people I had too many people in the forty days that I thought were really\nTalking about somebody on the forty days and then I'll go back and talked about how\nTo do and what I find really I'm cool is when um we have some of the um older people come in because\nI'm I find that at you know more often than not they've done so many different um diets and have been yo yo dieting for probably better half of their life and um\nWe had um Laura who came in sixty nine years old and she lost twenty three pounds in forty days which is a tremendous number four sixty nine year old woman gray um and she really did not need to lose more um\n[noise] she you know almost had her goal she wanted to lose twenty five pounds but you know we always our goals are always a little slightly higher than actually where we need to me you're\nBurning fat sandwich losing they're burning fat and just wait and looked at Les lose twenty pounds of looks like he looks thirty if Berlin she looks she looks\nAmazing though that was great was that um you know she was taking a blood pressure medication for the past um I think she told me nine to ten years and she said that\nIt was making her really nauseous and dizzy pretty much the whole entire time now I don't know if it was a dosage or that type of ... that was and she said that you know her doctor kept on switching\nExplain the personalization using hair saliva buyer energetic scans\nA blood work assessment a DNA assessment for going there and so forth and let me explain it to you and then afterwards you told me anything you've done is anything like this so we ... we can afford a few things so I go through it ... or anything like that absolutely not I've never heard of anything for ... let's move forward\nSo low and behold you know we did the different scans that we do we did the book the functional or assessment of the blood work\nWe take a look at it we give her some fireworks support with the research renal support\nTwenty eight pounds forty days has a great that's really great ... I you know I said she's going to ... I said what are you\nDo and she came and finally she came in last week's show so what do you do with the French fries for the shredded all of\nYeah like I mean I think it's also you know I think we tend to carry a ton of baggage with us we we really tend to go back I think people in general tend to they want to be positive but they tend to be on the negative side especially when they tried so many things and things don't work\nUm you know I think that that's really generally where we're at and I think a lot of people are telling people to throw up their old coal I Do I I I think that is a really powerful a powerful tool once you're done\nUm you know losing weight I I think you really need to get rid of the past I mean a fraud all your clothes when I did I ever I gave them all the way I don't have one single thing from the for um when I was I'm\n... years ago she probably did but at what point out the last thirty seven pounds as you get rid of\nAll I actually well because I started to try on my clothes probably about halfway through the program so halfway through the program was about twenty pounds down and I realized that I kept going to the forty hours a day which I did I Would be way down so I actually started to give them away\nUh throughout the program and of course you know once you start to empty out your closet you have to fill it with something there and so that really is a very very important part of the forty days out of your time for I think so I may still having a good time you know I think I think it's really really important for the mental health\nTo get rid of what's old to get rid of what no longer fits a you know although we just have to um our first TV commercial which was so exciting and um you know we asked a couple of our patients actually participate in it and through thankfully they did keep at least one piece of clothing that they used to have\nThe fat pants or\nUm you know and the case of our patient Diana she kept like some of her dresses from before she look I'm raked amazing little out or what if she had a whole transformation as she was um you know so\nShe uh they were able to bring in their stuff and really it was really fun shooting the commercial because you know these weren't models these weren't ...\nSo it was really exciting because we had to do like a bunch of takes because when you put someone who is not an actor in front of a camera you know no matter how good their story as they start to go up above above but you know so\nBut you know I've super proud of you know they they did really great it was really inspiring to listen to them we did some uh\nYou know uh um some uh back stories almost because actually the gentleman that was doing and producing the commercial he didn't know or patients so he actually asked them to tell\n'em him their stories and it was really fun and cool to sit on the sidelines and watch\n'em you know seeing these patients who were patience of hours you know I mean Diana or what you know lost all her wait a couple of years ago the other two gentlemen that were in the commercial was over a year ago also\nAnd um to listen to their stories and really what led them to our office for me was very interesting because one of the gentleman I actually didn't even know because he was going to one of our remote locations are not New Jersey and so I never met him before and what an interesting story he's\nActually happened to be a semi professional ballroom dance or raw hum and I said that now that he's retired uh you know he told his wife he wanted to take it back up because he feels so good well he lost close to a hundred\nI think a hundred and ten or something like that pounds um and uh he's like I you know there's all these things now that I remember I used to do and now I Want to go back and do them again because I have all the time on my hands um said either you know these are really it was really an inspiring day it was really a great day but\nGoing back to actually thought of I'm a female patient who just finished up she did um\nI don't know you might know this um eat her name is eat us I'm not sure if she did sixty days or she did a two rounds of forty days um I I think she was at the sixty day mark and um she's down over fifty pounds so she is on our website are hard to foreign actors are on our website they are so I'm\nAt just almost a ... it's a it's like a great person over fifty pounds you know one of my kids I think he's fifty six pounds so it's really a these types of numbers are really staggering but what's really amazing for me is the fact that um you know you're losing fat and losing fat\nIs the only thing that works long term I'm you know a lot of these other things out there you know everybody's like well the first week or two you lose all water anyway well that's not true no I ... and it's not healthy um and losing water is not going to give you any sort of long term and\nYou know a weight loss retention if you will um you have to lose the fat you have to hydrate the only way that you lose the fat is through the label some bags the only way that that happens is when they fill up with water and they burst\nThat is the only way you lose fat I mean I don't really care what anybody else to saying out there but that is the only way that that fat goes down and that is also by the way the only way that you will see herself shrinking and your clothes getting better\nYeah everybody loves to close giving\nUs the best part of the whole thing I mean when I was\nI didn't get a chance to keep saying I keep I keep forgetting to talk about the six people hold on third me get back to whenever I keep talking about it so we did the men first they would do the sixty days or the female Laurie ah thirty eight pounds in six days\nPretty good run a big number thirty eight pounds in six days it's almost forty pounds for a woman that's absolutely tremendous talking about a different person that's that's great what certain what certain dress sizes [noise] forty ...\nSo for me um I did thirty I might I'm five eight so I'm I'm taller side if you look at you know of most women I I'm five eight I lost thirty seven pounds I went from\nA twelve to six starts off and that's like we're talking like the design or like the Italian designers ... the ones that basically make everything to sizes down\nRight away like a normal size twelve\nIs not what they call a normal size twelve guys you know everybody outside of the United states for some reason it seems to be center than we are in this country there's a lot of reasons there is a lot of reasons but it's very frustrating because when you have to talk of so that this is you know to go from a twelve to ... um is um\nIs a life changing event to me and you all of a sudden shop at a different store you know because unfortunately most stores um don't carry the higher sizes so you you you ... you actually are moving from one to shouting variance to another shopping experience\nJob so so you're thirty eight so she did the thirty pounds a Steve is in sixty days Steve was down is down fifty eight pounds in six years I didn't have you beat from that guy\nAnd what are your thirty forty nine and thirty four fifty nine and eleven and that that that's amazing\nI mean you know we typically see twenty five\nWe see six twenty five to thirty five and forty days for women we typically see a thirty five to forty five plus for men only forty days or so these numbers are ... are fantastic they're tremendous such great both of them uh you know are off of their blood pressure Mets there's a surprise you lose those forty pounds and sixty pounds respectively for a female in the mail\nYou are going to be off your blood pressure Mets I mean that's not there's no there's no doubt about that are now\nUh so if you've got a five pounds or ten pounds or fifty pounds or a hundred pounds\nOr we can help you uh we we uh we typically see twenty five to fifty and only forty days\nAnd that's where that shots hormone surgery there is no hunger there's no pre packaged foods are monitored every step of the way you're coming into the office you're not doing this on your own you actually get a either the ... of one of the doctors mind one of the other doctors or one of our certified health and wellness coach is you get their information as well so we're always there to help you\nUh and so you can come into the office\nIn order to do that one of the offices in New York area\nAnd you can call one eight five five five and a J diet a one eight five five five six five three for three eight and so what that does is get you a free go over in one of our locations of the program or we've got you covered all over the tri state area a couple of locations in New Jersey\nOr New York city queens Brooklyn Long Island\nAnd now opening in West Chester as well and with your calling to make an appointment please remember the folks in the phones are not they don't ... they don't they're not there to answer your questions regarding the program because they don't have the answers regarding the program is a personalized program\nUh and so the best way to do it if you want you go to and jade diet dot com\nWhere it's normally Ninety nine dollars but as a radio lists are right now twenty seven dollars for a appointment in our offices we're going to not only look at your weight explained the program to explain the personalization\nOf the program explain how we use blood work assessment how we use hair saliva and ... testing\nA to personalize supplements for each individual to help that person get into a ... a cellular level of fat burning a we also explain how we use DNA your DNA testing going forward to help to look at\nAlmost fifty different a genetic factors best ideal diet types exercise regiments nutritional needs so which vitamins to to to use more of\nBut also it slows down your metabolism because it makes your insulin more disrupted which ... which affects\nHow your body is able to uh metabolize sugar and if those triggers aren't burned for energy your body is no other choice but to turn it into fat and store it so we have to take a look at that as well\nSo all these different things that we're looking at to personalize the situation for every single person ... and and and get them the results that do you need you want\nI almost forgot like what time of year it was now it it really almost um\nYou know at past me that\nUm you know if you get started now you're you're going to be all set for the holiday so you know this is one of the um is one of our busiest times of the year for for many different reasons you know people start to layer of their clothes and then they realize they have to go on vacation you know your winter break and they either have to put on a bathing suit or they have to put on a ski outfit\nAnd you know here's the deal you get benefits on both sides right he put her in a bathing suit you're the new you you put on a ... year then you you too because I knew what you have a lot more energy going down the slopes you feel a lot better you're breathing better and\nYou know if you start now where we would do we have forty days before the holidays we have ... we we've got four days before the holidays you know you haven't seen so many families you know this is a funny time of year for us because what starts to happen\nIs you know we've got this huge influx of patience right before the holidays and then right after the holidays what we have happening it's all of their relatives and all of their friends that saw them during the holidays I saw my cousin my aunt my uncle or whatever they lost all this weight so now I'm here so\nIt's a very interesting dynamic of what happens in the next couple of months that our practices that um\nYou see some of the you know if you will the guinea pigs coming in her whole family follows along\nAnd you know we actually had um a very interesting as thing we had a patient come in and he is doing his second round the first time around I think he lost um thirty five pounds I think he wanted to lose another Fifteen or twenty so he's only doing a shorter period he's not doing a full forty days\nBut he said to us he said does anybody ever complaint you guys that it hurts to say when you lose all that way\nAnd so I thought it was kind of funny in law was put off his ... yeah\nYeah but that well that's the thing where you don't even think about that right when you're sitting you're sitting on you know a quite a bit of soul and adding and whatever it is the Adams says if there's some muscle there he said I didn't realize that he's like my heart's like understand what's hurting he's like\nI said to him I was I guess what as they get up and get more active and you know\nI'm you know this is actually somebody who doesn't sit a lot he's it extremely active human being but I guess he started realizing he doesn't have as much padding over there anymore\nBut that'll do it right oh he's like down almost sixty pounds and the total not sixty he's a little bit over fifty pounds but you know and the total of his weight loss he now started to feel well he should have been feeling like four years right here in his heart\nAs well yeah and so his muscles are all very sad but I just thought it was such a funny thing to say like this has kind of what's interesting right when you're talking to all of our patients some of the things that are no lead there's less padding on the last ... exactly exactly\nAnd you know you see a lot of what's also I'm kind of an interesting dynamic as someone who is very set and who does work out on a regular basis and comes to us to lose that whatever twenty or thirty pounds and they need to lose\nAnd what's interesting is that you start to see their a muscle mass and you actually physically see their arms surely see that definition laying there under fat\nRight uh because we have so many of those patients that do work out on a regular basis we've actually had such a huge number of personal trainers that come in to do our program right because just like\nA you know a regular person unfortunately they come to the point where they don't understand why they're putting on weight and so once we get them into fat burning it's quite amazing because then they really start to look at it I mean you see all that muscle and all that work that they've done over the years it's still there doesn't go anywhere\nNuts gray and the results what's great about this is the results are so fast like I mean\nPeople don't believe it you know you're you're losing twenty five to fifty pounds in forty days that's what we typically see with men and women so the results are tremendous you guys are coming in women within the first week people come in they go how fast am I going to see results are in the ... I\nSaid by the first time you are and we have people come in within like around ten days after they start the program but you tend to visit women are down anywhere from\nEight to twelve pounds met her down anywhere from ten to Fifteen pounds and when I say that to them they look at me sideways absolutely that's what we see here that asks\nWe see and when people are coming in they're losing fat they're not losing the water the water is improving because of the personalization of the supplements the water levels are actually increasing in the body\nAnd it's not only a matter of getting people to drink more water because a lot of times we have to people have people lower their water consumption 'cause they're drinking so much but their minerals that are out of bounds so their body isn't absorbing it properly which ones are slowing down the metabolism\nAnd so we we we have them kind of keep it around a star number depending on where where they are and that's individualized also but that's what the thing so like Tom\nComes in this is sixty five year old guy he comes in this week\nFifteen pounds he's down in in twelve days\nRight it's great so he he came in you know we did the ... we did the uh ... the ... the about what the by energetic testing we did the blood work assessment he needed is a long standing skin issues\nHim arena looted to that you were talking about that earlier about you know who the skin detoxify that's largest or again absolutely he got liver support\nThat is one of the main supplements he he had it's usually a liver toxicity when it comes out on the skin like that and so you you know skins improving already\nThis is to less than two weeks in from severe skin issues for a long period of time to the attorney improving now ah and he's down to Fifteen pounds and twelve days I mean it's it's a tremendous tremendous number and we're not talking about a twenty five year old guy you're sixty five year old guy\nAnd so this is this or that these are the types of things that we really see it so one eight five five five and Jay diet is the number is the number to call here uh and so you know you're going to come in we're into the body composition analysis or we've got you covered all over the tri state area a couple of locations in New Jersey\nOr New York city queens Brooklyn Long Island\nAnd now opening in West Chester as well\nOr if you call one eight five five five and she died that's where I go over in the office of the program and at no charge right so you can do that and a twenty five five five six five thirty four thirty eight a and we can explain to how without shots hormone surgery know hunger how you're going to lose weight\nFast how are you going to lose it where you want to lose that because that's why people start in different areas because the body's protecting those areas because the different hormonal imbalances how the program is going to balance your your your hormones a detox to find themselves the Oregon the tissues almost everybody in the first week says the same thing I have more energy I'm sleeping better\nHave more energy I'm sleeping better uh and so we've got a bunch of locations in the area in Brooklyn and queens and and a New Jersey and Manhattan in Long Island and now west Chester a and so if you want to lose that twenty to fifty pounds and only forty days you call one eight five five\nFive and Jay diet that's one eight five five five six five three for three ate\nA and that's a schedule a free go over a in one of the officers over here\nTwenty five to thirty five pounds for women is what we typically see in forty days thirty five to forty five plus pounds\nFor men is what we typically see in forty days\nAnd so you can either to the phone call you can also the best way in my opinion is you go on line you go to and Jay diet dot com or and normally it's Ninety nine dollars for the first visit\nA as a radio listener only twenty seven dollars gets you an appointment to the office where you're going to come in and we're going to take a look at it not just your way we'll explain the program to you and the personalization of it but we'll also take a look at a body count will do a body composition analysis with you we're we're going to take a look at your weight your body fat percentage\nUh your body water level you're visceral fat rating so important to take a look at metabolic age so if your metabolic rate if you're burning let's say\nIf you're a guy burning Eighteen hundred calories a day but your body's functioning like you're taking in three thousand calories a day you are not going to be able to lose weight because you're gonna oh twelve hundred calories at the end of the day so like I said very important\nAnd Jay ... sat com only twenty seven

doesn't have to suffer from chemo she's tolerating very very very poorly sad to say\nBut luckily she came to us and luckily she understands thorough options that I can tell you that our success rate in treating them\nFormal where we attack the cancer is immensely high and then I Want to talk about a man with a head and neck cancers the man who had a cancer of his mouth he went to one of the big hospitals had standard chemo and radiation\nJust last year it standard came on radiation and the\nTreatment doesn't work the cancer was growing through the skin through as chin right it is ... the lowest Jenny at a big mess like a lot of temp ping pong ball flushing mass of cancer that kept growing causing pain he had\n... had radiation each other surgeons or the other place\nThen yet none of it worked he came to us and we offered him radio surgery which is a few treatments pinpoint noninvasive and the cancers gone I can tell you the pains gone the cancers gone\nHe is happy his wife's happy and I can tell you we are too We're very happy for the good results that we're talking about fifty nine year old man born in Guyana West Africa his PSA rapidly rose from seven to Seventeen he has a\nPositive family history says multiple risk factors number one is PSA is rapidly rising number two positive family history his father died of prostate cancer and he\nHad a biopsy showing cancer at age fifty died this gentleman we got the pathology we offered treatment this man is a hundred and sixty two pounds he's five foot nine he is otherwise in great shape\nI examined him he works for the M. T. A. in New York City and we have many people who work for the MTA his prostate was bargain exam you had the rise of the pie as say the biopsy showing cancer we offer treatment and William good news is PSA\nAfter treatment has gone from Seventeen to want to use it or mission symptoms are better he's feeling fine he's pleased with treatment call with outpatient treatment here\nFocus treatment on the prostate cancer that's the work we do even with this man who has a high risk cancer a positive family history of the hype is say at\nOur high PSA velocity that means that was rising rapidly and rose to a high level Seventeen he is now cancer free\nIn remission doing while avoiding radical surgery avoiding robotic surgery avoiding prolonged radiation and he's kept a sex life and his urinary life intact\nAnd I want to talk about a gentleman with a bladder to emerge he's sixty six years old he is married he came here with a bladder cancer he had blood in the year and nothing was done a month later he had more blood and went to a hospital get a CAT scan he had ... that\nMeans the doctor looked inside the bladder and then the doctor or a section of bladder tumor\nHad superficial cancer but the CAT scan showed big masses in his pelvis this man's a smoker and I can tell you that smokers have higher rates of bladder cancer is\nSo the paradox was the pathology showed that there was no invasion of the cancer and yet there were big masses in the power of a sudden the CAT scan so what do you do when the cancer does not show impatient such should be a pre cancer and\nYet the CAT scan shows big masses well the urology doctor wanted to treat him as if he had stage for cancer stage for cancer means of cancers traveled with this man came to us because he was confused how can you know\nA superficial cancer and the bladder but the CAT scan shows big masses and he's being told as you go home to die that there's not curative therapy boy came to us we saw him I saw him\nAnd we stage them up and we actually got a biopsy those big masses in the pelvis they weren't negative there was no cancer so lucky for him\nHis life has been changed by coming to radio surgery New York instead of having met a steady cancer he does not have met a steady cancer has a superficial bladder cancer and most likely it's going to be doing very well with easy treatment for his\nBladder cancer this is a work we do often people come to us confused unable to understand or information that just doesn't make sense to them\nAbout their cancer and we tried to straighten it out and communicate for this man the biopsy showed no matter steady cancer even though I've been told elsewhere it one of the big hospitals that he had stage for cancer\nThis is one of the happiest pieces of information I can tell anyone that there is no invasive cancer there is no matter set a cancer and hopefully it will stay that way forever for this man but right now he's in good shape with good news that's what we do here registered in New York\nThat we're talking about another gentleman eighty three years old who came with many medical problems hard stance valve replacement heart attack bladder cancer\nHigh blood pressure is diagnosed with kidney cancer last year I came to him and his kidney cancer he went to the emergency room he fell down at blood in the urine\nAnd he had a scan showing a kidney cancer yet a biopsy showing that kidney cancer and he saw ... just ... just as a specialist who operates on the kidney and we're all just hold him he should not have ... should not have radiation but only surgery\nAttacked by the eighty three year old man with with hearts\n... valve replaced my credit on fire and high blood pressure and cholesterol the surge of age eighty three is telling this man he has to read it loses kidney while he's had more bleeding had more pain is way it was a hundred and eighty it dropped twenty pounds going down from two hundred two hundred and eighty pounds I examined\nHim or he has his biopsy proven kidney cancer is a smoker which is probably the cause of heart disease and the kidney cancer I saw him and he decided to come with us for non invasive treatment of his kidney cancer even though his urology surgeons surgeon told him he had\nThat surgery he can't have radios surgery well he came down a little less is brave you came to us he called us a two one two choices he called us at two and two two four six forty two thirty seven he made a day I saw him we talked about all the options I said you can have surgery if you want why would you want to lose the kidney and why would you want to take the risk and you might die\nOn the table then why would you want to lose that kidney function for the rest of your life and he decided to come with us recruited him last year just a few treatments each treatments ten minutes painless not invasive treatments for his kidney cancer\nAnd I saw him this week a year or cancer free and the new scanned these cancer free examined him he's doing well he's feeling fine\nI can tell you that he's very happy that he had non invasive it visible beams of radio surgery for his kidney cancer or success rates very high in the kidney and also beyond\nMany people come to me with kidney cancer even kidney cancer spread and they want to have the best possible chance and want to avoid surgery I also see lots of people who unfortunately have already lost their kidney before\nOr they come to us and they tell me uniformly to the surgeon never tells them that they could go see Dr Lieberman and have radios surgery on the kidney cancer has said so I think every doctor should be telling a patient what all the options are supposed to be selling what we're doing we're supposed to be informed me\nAnd I'm happy to talk about surgery Shimon standard radiation but I'm also very happy to compare those options to radio surgery and often\nThe best treatment clearly is the radio surgery in this case this man as a non invasive treatment pinpoint tree but it took ten minutes he walked in go to treatment turn around and walked out what the Macy's or\nBrian Parker went home or to work but that do hospitals they know downtime know adverse effects\nAnd now he is cancer free from his kidney cancer that we treat last year and we have scans\nPeople often ask Dr Lederman how do you know the treatments work and look I Want to be able to prove that to you as well and I wanted to prove to myself and others and so of course we follow every patient patients follow updates top appointments to come in and get scans independently of us so they could have an independent\nReview of the answer before and after treatment and then we give you copies of the documents so you have the proof yourself it's not just were saying that to you but you have to prove I've seen so many time doctors telling patients all you're doing OK you're doing OK at the cancers growing growing growing\nNo we don't do it that way here British or to New York here we give you the proof you have the documents you have the pictures and you can go home and studied yourself you can get a second opinion yourself if you want\nWe believe that you deserve all the information all the facts all the choices that's why our phone number is two and two choices\nTo into two four six forty two thirty seven to get information to get the book was to get the DVD or just to make an appointment fun um central Lederman we're short break we'll be right back\nWhen Dr lead them and came to New York from Harvard Ninety seven percent of women
