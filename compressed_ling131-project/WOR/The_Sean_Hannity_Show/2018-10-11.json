Chevy ... wouldn't have done a defining men as as a practice and tyrants or history in a in an absolute lie there had been crimes against women where they have occurred we must condemn them\nThroughout history have given their lives and their land or from the support of women and children and this is an element in second wave feminism and to me and said extrapolate ... on the part of the matter is that they were talking to this movement\nNeurotic system on the part of the ... we're talking psychological disorders that have now assume to political identity or political issues but man is she right on the money with this the feminism she says she admires never sought\nTo denigrate and destroy managed to miss current was never a male versus female thing and she of course this and she you know she is a ... she's an arts expert an analyst and a cultural professor University of the arts in Philadelphia I'm\nHere this this one this next bite from the same battle of Ideas Festival in London a couple of years ago this I predict will sound familiar\nTo human beings need religion they only just perspective cosmic for perspective and getting rid of the office max religions because there was too conservative simply led to the new religion of political correctness I and I and it's the same kind of fanaticism I may have found that the second wave feminists in fact the Spanish\nInquisition I'm not getting any anything with any form of dissent within feminism is treated as heresy and they actually talked to destroy you\nKnow you would think that a an ongoing professor\nIn this modern era would be recommending and advocating for modern day feminism but you wouldn't be that she's she's right on the money for those of you haven't heard this little stories sixty minutes once profiled me way way back when they thought I was harmless and\nThey profile her at some point to and it came time for them to have their twenty fifth anniversary dinner thirtieth or whatever it was\nAnd they it was at the temple of dengue dar exhibit at the museum on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan\nAnd they invited me and they sat me at her table because they thought that there would be fireworks they thought that I Would refuse and that I wouldn't get into arguments and I would have basically walk out and I we got along famously and during the night\nThere Steve Croft walking by take it all I didn't get it at first and then ... safer what started walking by a ticket and in ... so what are you guys leaving their tables they all expected fireworks at our table\nAnd they were hoping to see it and of course they didn't get it because we uh we had a lovely time that night so [noise]\nJust just amazing it's it it and I it took me a while to figure out you know what they were what they were doing with this when I was naive back in those days at any way that that brief break before we wrap it\nUp to his own ... rush home again I miss\nThe Rush Limbaugh show on\nYou know my folks the IRS does not mess around you know this they have the power to take everything your bank accounts your paycheck even your home in business\nNow if you own back taxes it's about to get worse the IRS has added a small army of private tax collectors and their job is to find you to track you down\nYou need to call optimist tax relief they're the good guys the experts who do this best they're experts in a fresh start initiative that's a special IRS program that could save you a thousand\nEven tens of thousands if you're qualified one call can start the process to stop the demands letters stop the aggressive collection actions optimal while you have options eight hundred nine seven three Seventy seven hundred eight hundred nine seven three Seventy seven hundred\nUh we have a tough race by the way it's going to be a tough race\nFor Scott Walker in Wisconsin who I think it's done a phenomenal job a as it relates to you know the state\nOf Wisconsin and I hope the people of Wisconsin finally remember that but we now have Walker one poll finally up by one but it's very very close\nA we have a Georgia governor race that's also closer than I Would like for comfort\nOr with the Republican camp up by two and so we're following that raised pretty closely um in some of the other races that were watching the president's approval rating now is doing very very well is that what fifty one percent and rest musician\nAnd so we'll watch that but I think if you look at Heidi Heitkamp I think she's going to be and should be defeated in North Dakota I Hope the people of Montana will pay attention and understand that you basically have Chuck Schumer junior because John tester always goes with Chuck Schumer\nAnd the people in Montana can take back that state which is a red state\nThen you've got other states like Indiana I think Joe Donnelly can be defeated in Indiana\nI think definitely Claire McCaskill she ought to be sent packing and I think Marsha Blackburn is going to be a phenomenal senator from the great state of Tennessee should've been a longtime friend of this program in recent polls now have her up as well\nAnd then we get to the all important house races I'm not going to spend the time here it's more of a visual thing that we're doing on television\nAnd we're picking ten important house races at night and we're identifying those specific districts that are going to make a difference on election night and twenty six days and that will literally they these these districts were putting up hold the balance of power in the house of representatives\nI mean because of gerrymandering up a big portion and percentage of seats I ended up being safe for both Republicans and Democrats\nSo we'll find out for voters by the way Trump more help now to these candidates in the president's got what he's out for days this week and he's going to be campaigning for everybody and these tight races and an attempt to help them all out now am\nI honestly think that the Republicans would adapt just a little bit they don't have to take the style of Donald Trump\nBut if they go out and and passionately support making the tax cuts permanent\nIf they passionately talk about ending the bureaucracy the way the president has been doing it\nIf they will sign on to building and fully funding the border wall if they will do the alternative health care solutions that we talk about all the time on this program like health savings accounts and health care cooperatives et cetera were just going to have a better country\nAnd and the more prosperous country you you cannot deny the success\nOf this president and the fuel the the pure force of personality\nI mean Donald Trump is a force of nature and I know that he breaks dishes I Know he's an icon of class I Know he's a disruptor\nBut if he's not fighting then we're not winning and when he goes up even against their own allies and says you're not paying their fair share and NATO and we're paying the bulk of money for NATO and then you're stupid enough Chancellor Merkel to go make deals to help make Russia and Vladimir ... rich again while you're basically\nIt's your counteracting everything that made it was trying to do which is prevent a hostile regime from ever having the power to turn off the picket and turn off the life blood of western Europe's economy\nIs a simple basic things nobody ever thought that the president would get along with little rocket man fire and fury apparently Mike Pompeo the secretary of state at a phenomenal meeting I talked to two sources\nA phenomenal meeting with little rocket man and now a little rocket man is dead he's serious\nAbout getting rid of any nuclear ambitions denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula the guy that everybody in the media said was going to start World War three that guy is bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula\nYou look at Seoul South Korea you know you look over the DMZ and what do you see thirty million people live there\nA nuclear armed North Korea is not something that the world needs if you care about human life\nAnd as a result I Would assume that you know markets would open up to North Korea the people of North Korea been suffering you might even see a reunification one day of north and South Korea Korea how great with therapy for the world\nAnd I got a president that's not dropping cargo planes full of cash and other currencies and on the on the tarmac for mullahs around that hate us in chant death to America death to Israel that's not happening either you know I Want to get in Michelle Obama\nWas on the today show earlier today and an interview with savannah Guthrie asking about recent comments from Eric Holder about kicking Republicans let's go to holders comments and Hillary Clinton's comments he can't be several with anybody that disagrees with us listen\nTo all over [laughter] my wife really tight scares me [laughter] so you know when they go low [laughter] long [laughter]\n[noise]\nWe'll just have a credit card he\nCannot be several with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nThat Clinton's ... he can start again [noise] but until the end of the only thing that the Republican team to\nRecognize an for its strength [noise]\nAnd you heard how the Republican numbers led by Mitch McConnell\nReally demeaned the confirmation process\nAnd we we can't be\nSeveral of we disagree with them no give us power and then we'll be civil you gotta be kidding when you when they go low you just kick up\nOn Michelle Obama said fears is not a proper motivator hope wins out and if you think about how you want your kids to be raised how you want them to think about life and their opportunities do you want him to be afraid of their neighbors and you want them angry the one dimensional wondering Michelle Obama say anything when\nBut they can't have her you know the guy they got all the time like a guy\nIt was something that I put\nIt made me feel like Superman made a super hot and humid for ... for me the guy that looks up so you are right around American guy not critical\nNotes on it however you want to do if\nI say to lay off half right now you have to go to\nHeat when I when I was Fifteen we're we're going to move into a billion dollars a year now we are thirty eight billion dollar mark and they call the easy\nI mean it just was a phenomenal moment and I think an opportunity\nI'm going to get into that when we get back because the narrative that we always hear that ... the the minorities that Democrats have a ... a monopoly of compassion for minorities\nBut they're doing better when Ronald Reagan as president and George Bush is president and when Donald Trump is president matter of fact now they're doing better than ever\nAre we going to take a break we'll come back we'll continue eight hundred nine four one Sean is her toll

Obama national security adviser Susan Rice or something happens to be a conservative\nIn fact his name is John rice camera and he's the president of the Stanford University college Republicans and is now saying that he was assaulted by one of these violent democratic a Democrat protesters during the pro Kavanaugh rally that they had last week\nAnd the Stanford Daily reports that rice Cameron who is the president of the Stanford college Republicans claims that a classmate Belinda Hernandez quote shoved him in the chest with their hand during a verbal disagreement\nAs a student news outlet citing a Stamford department of public safety spokesperson said Hernandez was placed under private person arrest at rice Cameron's request and issued a citation for battery\nStamford daily quoted a law enforcement source saying there's no obvious physical injury to either party involved and rice camera refused evaluation by paramedics Hernandez along with multiple other witnesses dispute that

Portland where literally people driving their cars are being stopped their cars being kicked\nGod Forbid if you had to make America great bumper sticker on your car or or wearing a make America great hat God help you\nIn that particular case it doesn't\nAnd all of this was being encouraged by the so called leaders of the Democratic party and that's what you that's all we got to understand here\nThis is the modern left the Democratic party there is no vision there's no there's there are no solutions being offered there's a lot of hate being pedaled around a lot of innuendo now we know the not the party of the constitution and due process and presumption of innocence\nYou know these values have served as well as a country for a long time\nAnd now with a very pathetic and sad and frankly no alarming state and I honestly think that Rand Paul is not off base when he says that this rhetoric is going to lead to somebody getting killed at some point\nWhen Democrats they get up in their face they need to realize it's there are a lot of unstable people out there there are people with anger issues there are people that are prone to violence they might even live next door to you and you don't know where these people are wrong we shouldn't do is incite people to violate the problem is is rational people my back down\nWhat's gonna happen when the guy comes with a gun to a rally or comes with a knife to a rally there is going to be an assassination if this doesn't ratchet down and I think the other side needs to really calling the rhetoric down\nYeah they need to calm the rhetoric down but it's not like what are they going to do they're going to go out there and say well we're running on raising your taxes\nWere running on open borders in eliminating a nice we're

think this has now on the Welsh stationed domestically and so I think many Democrats are looking at it and when you see how far\nAre we going to get a new line but it's never been the case Jonathan I mean that's why we\nChronicled us every two and four years and I think we saw the worst of the worst with judge Kavanaugh you know immediately I Believe\nI think people that make serious allegations like was made in the case of professor port they've got to be listened to but she gave the names of people including an eye witness that didn't corroborate their story\nYou you know the the problem we're we're having now Sean is that we don't just have the same rhetoric that politics have every year we also have activists out there we have um\nDifferent groups like an tougher and are by all means necessary be am in ... these people are actively going out and causing fear and intimidation using violence as we saw in Portland, Oregon when you combine all these things\nThe the rhetoric the violence\nThe on the ground in your face type of ... they're going in intimidating the politicians and ah then speakers when they're out eating what you're seeing\nIs an escalation far beyond just rhetoric which we've had before and even when you have somebody like Dr Ford given testimony it gives mass to gets covered up whether it's serious or real there's evidence or not this stuff gets so covered up by a motion\nUm and that it's gotten completely out of control now to a point where\nUh there there is no truth I mean you look at these statements that Eric Holder made you can't double speak you can't say kick people and then say let's not do anything illegal that's double speak\nBut then you know this has been your party name one thing that does your Democratic Party you're below party is offering the American people besides impeachment endless investigations keeping the failure of Obamacare wanting the crumbs back of the tax cut open borders eliminating ice what what what are they going to do for the\nMen and women in this country um after eight years of failure with Brock Obama what are they gonna what are they offering what are they running on except hatred\nYou know the different again I I take great and conditions Medicare and Medicaid Medicare that environment or they don't want to\nAsk what are they going to do they had eight years uh Brock Hussein Obama as president\nThirteen million more Americans on and on food stamps but Moran poverty\nAccumulated more debt than every other president before him combined the lowest labor participation rate since the Nineteen seventies and the only president in history never to reach a ... percent GDP GDP Growth than a year\nYou know they had that they had the football they they they ran backwards the country went backwards now we got\nEight million Americans out of poverty for a million of food\nDams for a million jobs manufacturing jobs over almost five hundred thousand of those those are jobs Obama set of never coming back why should anybody vote Democrat 'cause all we hear is as lies negativity et cetera et cetera\nNot George W. Bush and ended up oh my God you're talking about what what what are they are suffering\nToday forget about George Bush ... that's a century ago what are they offering people now and how they change from the Obama years what are they offering besides I hate Donald Trump\nWell like I said we we care about Medicaid\nCare that\nI we got a bad line again I haven't been to China than what is it\nYou know suddenly you just said a second ago about how long ago George Bush was\nIn office and they're still talking about this what I what I hear you saying when I don't hear Daniel saying or any liberals for that matter\nIs the fact that we're here and now and there's things that have to be fixed now we can reflect on the past eight years because it just occurred and we're still suffering from that\nBut we we have rhetoric in Washington DC\nThat is not trying to fix anything and in fact it's as if they are trying the Democratic party is trying to crush or the will of the American people so they can go after the constitution get rid of the electoral college change the number of Supreme Court justice is ridiculous stuff like that and it's\nHow do you become a party that doesn't

about all this stuff to have to do with the Russia investigation all that if you did a list on your show of all the things that the Democratic party is trying to do to get away from the way we live the constitution due process all these things\nI think people would be shocked at how much they are trying to get us away from the founding fathers instilled into the constitution it's shocking\nHow how do you run on the idea that I Want you know the tax cuts the largest in history putting a thousand two thousand dollars and and the average family's pocket in this country that's real money for real families\nThe first pay raise they've had since like Nineteen Ninety\nIn terms of real dollars and what they call it oh those are just crumbs but they want the crumbs back yeah I mean how do you want the crows by how many more Americans are going to lose their doctors their plans and pay you know a hundred percent more yeah and and that's over the course of a year in some cases\nYou find any one show on a\nHorse liberal on some of them for free of course not Janet last name that's it that's off by your phone if you promised on the bus stop this football finally break\nIt on the air it's ridiculous how many more phone calls or we have to make for you I mean All right I'm going to wait I'll see you next week I think that's maybe a good idea to show up and up because the phone thing

from the ...\nOh okay but he put thirty million more Americans on food stamps and eight million more in poverty\nAnd the years in the ... okay yeah eight years to fix that meant Trump is done on the link to years that's the point has\nThat kind of white men have Hispanic kind of blend in\nAny way last word are good for you know nothing going\nYou know showing you been doing this for a long time over Thirty years he's been doing this I've never heard a worst phone then [laughter] and then you'll McLaughlin\nAnd in in that than those Thirty years you see I wash interviews where people are they're asking young people if they're going to vote they're going to say there's they know because they're not really into this you have been in the middle of his wife was out doing law enforcement you weren't integrated into all this politics\nHave you yourself ever seen ... uh the Democratic party ever leave any sense of normalcy of what this country is all about I mean I remember when Reagan was in office the Democratic\nWay they would say is that when Newt Gingrich came to power I remember it was right after the the Clinton care fiasco they tried to do socialized medicine didn't work out the Republicans when they took power Clinton was smart enough and I think through the advice of people like Dick Morris and others\nTo move toward to the center right\nAnd we were able to get to a balanced budget it was one the Republicans put together they finally got Bill Clinton assign it and it worked but it was more at a political necessity than any any principles that that he held deeply liberalism is a failed law the ideology that never works\nIt's deemed great on paper free healthcare freed the daycare free free free\nYou know we got this guy running out the Gavin Newsom in
