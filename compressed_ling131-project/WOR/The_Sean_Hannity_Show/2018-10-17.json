unfair with us trade wise\nWell if you don't say that you're gonna have a tear up against them they're never going to negotiate and the fear the tariff has caused them all to negotiate means more jobs at home look at you know look at the the the new deal with a Canada Mexico\nThat helps American workers in Ohio in Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania you know bringing back manufacturing look

Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nAlso have a Turkish newspaper reporting as much\nGood show gay did work for the Washington Post a vanished after visiting the consulate he had lived in Saudi Arabia he's not an American citizen but he he wrote for the Washington Post for many years Saudi council and it can be hurt on the tape saying during the show these tortured do this outside you're going to get me in trouble\nOr in another tape and unknown person again I Can't corroborate this I'm only telling you what the New York post and and the British newspapers are reporting on one Turkish newspaper if you want to live\nWhen you come to Saudi Arabia being quiet\nAnyway return to Riyadh on Tuesday ahead of a plan search of his residence part of the official Turkish probe and took the show gave this uh parents that is the the Saudi council he's back in Saudi Arabia\nMiddle East English language website holding a Turkish sources saying that there were no attempt to interrogate could show he but that us Saudi hit team came to kill him\nThe source told the site that his dad took seven minutes forensic physician doctor Salah ... body listening to music as he began to cut to show these body while he was still alive\nIn New York Post Turkish authorities believe could show that he was killed by a special team of Fifteen Saudi officials though the kingdom the crown prince of Saudi Arabia denying that says these claims are baseless this report comes as Mike Pompeo met Wednesday\nAfter being in in Saudi Arabia now meeting with the Turkish president air go on and the Turkish foreign minister\n... rubber arriving from reality where he said the Saudis promised a thorough investigation\nMy palm pay on Wednesday refusing to blame Riyadh said he didn't want to talk about any of the facts adapt to the president said there's got to be a presumption of innocence but he wants all the facts\nTop us deployment diplomat Wednesday refusing to blame Riyadh blah blah blah blah several of the members of the alleged hit team were found to a close ties to the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nSolomon according to a a photo by the New York times Turkish officials have shared an audio recording with the U.S in Saudi Arabia that they say ... was murdered by Saudi operatives of except the president saying they didn't get any tape but this time\nYou have a pro government newspaper reporting that could show geese apple watch recorded the interrogation torturing killing well I Would assume if that watch exist and this happened and what we believe that he might have been taken out and body pieces not sure that they wouldn't take the watch at that point but\nBefore leaving Riyadh aid Pompeo told reporters at the Saudi leaders made no exception on who they would hold accountable\nAnyway so now according to the British newspapers are saying circus of fish or Turkish officials have a recording of blah blah blah and that had to pack up and down the apple watch and you have some of the other people saying it's highly unlikely that show that you could have broadcast signal from his apple watches it was too far for Bluetooth connection\nYou know I think what's happened clearly as the Turks and the Saudi ... had the Saturday counseling wired they have transmitters and the Turks don't trust any diplomats that have been into most of the embassies most consulates in Turkey and they listen to what's going on\nAnd we'll find out in this case um my take\nI think it probably all happen but I don't think we should\nRush to judgment because the truth is going to come out probably sooner rather than later joining us now Dr Sebastian Gorka former White House advisers brand new book is phenomenal by the way why we fight defending the feeding rather not defending the feeding America's enemies with no apologies\nAlso Dan hop and Fox News contributors thirty or CIA up operations officer a duck the Gorka I assume you agree with me that all signs point to the Saudis assassinating murdering this guy in a a far Paraguay that's what I'm thinking\nYou know the ruin in warfare or report from the battlefield must be questioned uh I think this man is that\nWhether or not these audio tapes exist is another question but it's absolutely certain that this individual was caught between two nations that wants to dominate the Sunni Muslim world\nThat's the new often I'm an avid wand regime of turkey and the birth place of Islam Saudi Arabia and this man was cork in the middle\nHowever however this isn't the fake news we've got to be accurate this man was a journalist was Americans or they're trying to spin it was a foreign national read them and it\nWas a common faith that you wrote commentary and he has a long decades long history of ... the Muslim Brotherhood and there's also related to the figures out of um the ... of the twentieth century ... so all of these things are total statement for factual\nWhat do you think a missed the hot but it's been a while my uh my friend Dan is good to have you back I Know this has been your life and your business for so many years um my gut is pretty clear on this uh I think this man was murdered and the most evil root for brutal way possible\nAnd I think that the president is wise knowing that we're going to get to the truth now there's no doubt we'll go and we're going to have the truth rushing

Mexico people don't understand is\nIf you don't threaten to pull out of a deal and you don't threaten terrorists you're never gonna get the deal and nobody ever thought in the past to ask for these things and the fact that he not only does it then wins then the American workers all across this country doing better and that that's what brings us to this election\nAnd I'm thinking I don't see any good ideas from the Democratic party that's going to improve the lives of Americans make us more prosperous or secure I don't care but I Want I Want this country to be with us for us\nHe also did something that the mainstream media is not reporting on the twenty fifth of July the declaration of a cease fire in Europe was absolutely brilliant Sean because he was able to\nPressure on China from Europe he's effectively and people are really reporting is pretty ... joined forces with the Europeans the Europeans also have these trade issues and he's treated ... grievances with China\nAnd so what the president did is rather than fighting a war in two directions you declare cease fire in Europe he knows he has to deal with them\nBut they're applying maximum pressure on China and I'm going to make a prediction right if you're on your radio show ... owned by me back I think you get to trade deals with China before you get a shot and if not by the end of the year it's a very early in\nThe ... let me tell you why because when he did when he applied these sanctions and tariffs on China China what happened there economy took ... thirty five percent dive so\nThat was telling me by now they're probably and I don't know for sure but I'm assuming they're\nBanging on his door begging that they can get those back\nQuestion yeah seven percent hit to the currency thirty five percent it to the stock market\nAnd their their economies grinding down and uh we know about China is they need to create twenty five million jobs you're\nJust to break even Sean and so uh if if if the locomotion of growth and progress is stalled uh it'll be cataclysmic for that political system so I Believe they will be at the table or maybe they don't get it done at the G ... which is at the end and um\nNumber but I bet you they get it started shortly thereafter or because we both know the president's personalities hitting very very or a but he's a very fair guy and he'll hit the intersection of fairness with the Chinese government\nAre and what is best for the American working family so\nAh and that's why he's doing so well ... and by the way you know ... do a lot of traveling around the country I was in Detroit last night I spoke to order people I'm Down here in Miami Today and whisper rate is up you know that whispering were ... down on people that they don't like Trump but then they\nPull you aside at his age Sean by the way\nI happen to really like otherwise isn't that what this group\nThere is an intensity of his supporters and there are people that will never tell anybody

I mean I've talked to people on the left they you drive the nuts I mean you give them fit so fury that I thought only I could do\nIs try to see things just order this guy and I think one of the things that they're ceding most about that what they're most\nHating right now is the fact that both Claire McCaskill and Phil Bredesen neither Senate candidates one of them is the United states senator had been forced to respond to these videos all over the local media coverage you mean it's it's it's critical mass in Tennessee in Missouri their their their local TV stations are calling me\nAnd the D.C journalists do not want to talk about this in fact I just got paid like all the Washington Post he's tweeting at me and he's and he's saying well you know she's been public about some of these position I did what about other things she's saying here but she hasn't been public about so they they very much hate Sean for good reason\nWell listen when you expose fraud what this is now what's supposed is something that I've been pointing out for a while we Maxine Waters on tape saying they keep telling me not to say it and every time they tell me I'm going to say it anyway impeach forty five impeach forty five\nThen we see the center for American Progress warning every single Democrat running for office told talk about immigration we know\nWe know we won't open borders and eliminate ice\nBut don't tell the people the truth about what you're really gonna do don't tell them what you have is a massive fraud propaganda light campaigning being perpetrated by a party that has lost any sense of moderation\nThat has no agenda that they're willing to talk about the ... that is a really scary scenario for the country\nAnd for people that ... that's the only way they can win is polite and ... who they are\nThat's what the stories about these red state Democrats have been on your show now on the fourth or third third video between Tennessee in in Missouri and one of the staffers agrees McCaskill quote essentially has to lie to get elected and this is not just one staffer these are staffers throughout her office hiding\nHiding in masking the source of contributions one staffer says it's acting beautiful it's great when it works for us not against us\nTo take the money ... indirect means\nIn order to I guess appeal to moderates as a front page New York times story today about how these pro life pro gun Democrats are shrinking constituency in Missouri\nThe Democratic party have voted these people out but the ... still have to appear moderate so that she can get elected so it's it has a truism that in order to get elected in a state of Missouri or Tennessee you basically have to mislead voters to get elected as a Democrat and that's what these stories and cover\nYou know the thing is to me um I think we ... the American people had it when the Democratic party abandon any sense of due process under\nThe law equal application under our laws you know immediately I Believe her but they also said the minute Kavanaugh was announced we are going to oppose them any way by any means\nNecessary and then when all the the the allegations are getting more severe more severe and everyone's saying well I Believe her not even want to hear from judge Kavanaugh presumption of medicine at all and when corroborating so called corroborating stories fell apart they still didn't care\nAnd I think the American people are watching that we have a story out today where you've got these anarchist middle class of ventures attacking to Minnesota GOP candidates are assaulted one is a woman\nOf her name is state representative Sarah Anderson punch by an anarchist trying to stop him from kicking her campaign site\nI mean this this is now the Democratic party and you're exposing it and the ... and yeah you're going to be hated but I think shining a light on truth I thought this was this stuff that sixty minutes used to do\nWell you know I'm not involved in it and um\n[laughter] and maybe one of the states coming um\nWell let me ask you what are you involved in Nevada are you involved in Montana you involved in North Dakota and Indiana are you involved in Florida are you involved\nIn the states you just mentioned except one [laughter] well we we got a lot coming shot at and\nWe in fairness to the stories you want to get the local media is covering them and and that's really critical because nobody outside of the state's votes in those states for the local media is covering it the candidates are reacting Clarence reacting I'm getting calls right now by phone from local TV stations so it's it's going to be a very big couple of weeks Sean\nWell thank you for sharing it with us thank you for what you're doing I frankly think you're you're performing

said that the average European American walking around his point one eight percent Native American [noise] she's half\nSo the idea that she continues to double down on this why is the most disgusting thing to me is the fact that she's in the public eye she continues to use is and what she was trying to do was put to bed so she could run against President Trump in twenty twenty and it is backfiring on her and I I'm Glad to see it because she was she needs to come out and apologize to all of us\nI'm not running for president I'm not running for president I'm not running for president I Am not running for president of the United states are you going to run that I Know I'm not running and I'm not going to run\n\nHi I'm Geoff Diehl running to be your fulltime US Senator you don't need a part time author part time senator and part time presidential candidate I'm going to put Massachusetts first\nI'm just deal the guy who stopped automatic gas tax and now I'm not a partisan gridlock in Washington that's why I'm running for Senate against Elizabeth Warren same Elizabeth Warren they call the least officers races front to back\nI call them heroes\nMy campaign isn't about already calling about getting the job done [noise] Massachusetts I'm Jay Field I approve this message\nOr that is the ad glad you're with us by the way twenty five now told the top of the hour eight hundred nine four one Sean ... is our number\n... ads by Jeff deal Elizabeth Warren well she does have to get re elected a senator she wants to think about running for president from the great state of Massachusetts in the commonwealth look\nHere's where we are this week Elizabeth Warren has claimed for ever that she is\nNative American we can go back to Nineteen eighty six to Nineteen Ninety five she lifted herself as a Native American and the director of the association of America law schools she identified as a Native American during her tenure when she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania all teach you got to Harvard law school\nShe was described as quote the only tenured minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her mother and father were forced to a low\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage she was featured in a Native American cookbook that isn't titled\nHow while chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a justice week well it turns out she is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty four\nNative American let me interpret it another way that is less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American journal\nAll of human genetics that's less than the\nAverage white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American and our professional career her political career\nFor personal gain claims a family was discriminated against as a result of all this\nThen tries to prove to her detractors that she's right and release of the DNA tests showing less than point one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer you know identity politics the worse than I mean you know it's a national embarrassment what's going on here\nNow the question is I I Know that Massachusetts plans solidly left I Know it's a solidly blue state but you really want to elect somebody that has lied on such a spectacular level to advance her career all throughout her career as your senator\nWell Geoff Diehl is the candidate running against Elizabeth Warren I Know it's a long shot but you know Massachusetts also different points elect the guys like Bill well than\nMitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible ... that are the people of Massachusetts can wake up how are you doing\nAnd showing great to be with you thank you hey this is the state where I'm and you know Scott Brown won when he ran again or\nA ... state that was the models were they on Affordable Care act so\nUh if we can definitely when this and I'll tell you something the Boston patrolman is association is never indoors to Republican for the U.S Senate they've done in this race the last Republican was H. George W. Bush\nUm when Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist printed that she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety in here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House and twenty twenty", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "New York", "day": "17"}
