correlation between the fact that ... ... eighty years old he's a cancer survivor\nHe's taking it I didn't say to you know he's in it you know your nine year down right away the few sound like you're\nThirty though so that's a good thing is there any thing Dr Howard that you think that might be a a a reason why he's been able to kick the cancer and also go to the gym three times a week and\nThe great grandchildren with the kind of lifestyle he had being a firefighter does balance of nature held in that way\nWell sure and I don't know if I'm Still how long have you been taking

good\nGrade and then I Would say yes it's been several years is a part of a part of your chemistry has been a help in in New kicking those\nBut again we go back to the triads I don't know if they've talked about that try to help that triangle of of the physical part of health the mental emotional spiritual part of health and the nutritional and you you have mastered some of those other areas that have helped you through this because I Know this because I've talked to fill before and and I I Love\nBut his books he's written some books to be able to shed some of his some of his stress and and hardship inside of him he's written it in a book and those books are wonderful my I tell you what my father was a fireman and um and he he actually died of effects of being a fireman and um\nSo Phil was kind enough to send out the a couple of books to my mother was a\nGracious note in there and she loved those well he hasn't left family would be in her room and all of that in the\nHouse laughing all to herself in there and I knew she was reading your book [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nWell I wrote the first book because like you said that things are bothering me that and I didn't even realize that I was like the press I was division commander in Brooklyn for uh twelve years\nAnd from Nineteen Ninety One to two thousand and one right before nine eleven [noise]\nWe lost twenty four guys in a line of duty in my job and a twenty of them were good friends of mine and guys that I worked with and it was really getting to me and I didn't even realize it but once I started writing about it put it on paper\nI they're out of my mind I didn't have to think about them anymore and I'll talk to people who've outer and eight times what [noise] but uh I don't have to think about it so that's why I started writing books and then a publishing told me I think you've got two more books and yeah and it was right\n[laughter] and they're great they really were and the\nThing is is it it it really supports the whole aspect of of that try to help that spiritual mental emotional side is so important\nAnd and that's another part of it and put that with the chemistry and sure it's going to boost up fills physical side just just if we boost up two sides of it it's going to boost up the third\nAnd I and that's just awesome and that and these\nAre the reasons your the reason feel that that I was inspired to do this product I didn't set out to make a product I Love being a doctor but when it when it hit me I thought I Need to do this about like you did you you need to write those books\nRight right at the ... the first book [noise] the title of the first book has left or tears and muffled drums and I had to put laughter in there because I had to put some funny stuff because it was just so many tears you know\nYes yeah but ...\nBut I was having a depression and that was before nine eleven ... that was the ten years before nine eleven from made it a Ninety Nineteen Ninety One to two thousand and one then nine eleven hit\nAnd that was like a and I was supposed to work that day I work the day before and uh which was my birthday September tenth\nAnd that was relieved by two of my

the conduct of tissues like of the muscles and bones and the ligaments all that treatment failed the cancer came back and she came to me after being told from the ...\nAre just from the most prestigious cancer centers in the world that she should go home and die while this woman the second woman came to us [noise] asked if we could help I talked about all the options I examined her we staged or up and we implemented pinpoint treatment because we know\nThe freezer comas the usual kind of treatment surgery and came on radiation just doesn't work very well so commonly fails to work\nAnd yet we were able to treat this woman and make the cancer go away now two years later she just came to be a few weeks ago for a checkup and she comes from our checkups here she is PET scans here the same day\nWhereas back home in her country it would take months and months if at all to go to scan attacked in her country they said to her home to die whereas we've been able to treat her get her in remission\nAnd the second woman I'm Talking about is living a healthy life in remission doing everything she wants with no side effects even though we had to [laughter]\nWhen she asked us to treat or we had to go in with non invasive treatment pinpoint treatment invisible beams to attack the cancer\nAnd the same area where she had the surgery and chemo and radiation before so and into

patients with cancer who are left in pain and suffering without proper treatment medications or therapies and were able to focus and hit the cancer most likely shrink the cancer and get this woman out of pain\nSo it's easy to understand why she chose our treatment\nAnd for the second side because the cancer the lung cancers wrapping around the airways interfering with the oxygen getting into her

doctor Lederman we're talking about cancer living better than being smarter and understanding more and helping yourself and your neighbors and your loved ones that have been the person down the street who is suffering\nThis is what we do every day on the radio I got an email from a man who said well maybe your statistics are wrong and I want to explain to him how exactly are statistics are for example prostate cancer\nSo if something on a man has Gleason seven cancer Gleason seven is how the cancer appears under the microscope\nMan has Gleason seven cancer or they have a PSA from ten to twenty and you go to a usual hospital have radical surgery or robotic surgery or standard radiation the success rates about sixty percent\nIf that patient comes to us the success rate is Ninety percent okay and he's talking about how do we calculate the difference between sixty nine well simple\nLet's just say hospital ... super duper pooper ... hospital acts treats a hundred men and sixty of them are cancer free and forty of 'em have recurrent cancer okay that's a sixty percent success rate\nIf we treat the same hundred men with glee seven or a PSA ten to twenty hours success rate is Ninety percent\nSo nine the out of the hundred men or cancer free so the other place has sixty percent we have Ninety percent so lined the men out of a hundred versus six\nThe men out of a hundred while that's fifty percent better why because sixteen man there\nIf you add fifty percent to that sixty man that'd be another thirty man and I'd be Ninety man and that's how we get our statistics that we are fifty percent better than the other guys and when does that come into play why see so many men who go and have treatment elsewhere\nWith markedly less success and you're talking about a disease with two hundred thousand many years let's say two hundred thousand men a year have prostate cancer\nAnd their results as to say altogether if our results or Ninety percent of all the results are sixty percent\nYou're talking about tens of thousands more men every year would be cancer free if they came to us versus going to have radical surgery robotic surgery here I Am a tea or other other methods of treatment so that's how we get the data sixty out of a hundred\nMen there\nAt the most prestigious centers versus Ninety out of a hundred men here now and say well\nIf you go to Atlantic City and your gamble hundred dollars in one casino says you have a sixty percent chance of winning and other casino has a Ninety percent chance of winning where would you rather gamble your money\nAnd

drivers have a whole set of rules about the health that they have to actually being or achieve show with our job driving a big old month strong right but you you know you would think like ... or policemen or I don't know like a\nA doctor should have certain standards that they're you know\nTough guys are driving a giant truck craze so there for hours and hours on end and it takes a ton of indoor and right\nBut you usually don't think of that right so what was interesting is that one of our patients um who was saying you know during these checkups right so one of the patients that was sitting in our waiting room I'm struck up a conversation with somebody who had just been in the consultation is actually signing up and\nUh the gentleman said to him you know does this program work and the other gentleman said yes actually it does and a new patient started asking him some questions and\nThe existing patients said um you know the reason I came here is because I had this a checkup that my job prescribed and I was basically told that if I didn't lose the weight because I was borderline diabetic borderline you know very high blood pressure cholesterol issues\nOr if I didn't lose the weight and if my health and improve I was basically out of a job\nFor and no it's not and so what I found to be amazing is that the potential patient turn to him and said oh my God he said that's what I Do for a living as well and racist Haitians looked at him and he said\nAnd you haven't had that check up yet and the guy said no I haven't but I'm sure glad I'm Talking to you about it [laughter] so yeah so I\nI didn't realize this but you know lo and behold um our existing patient his name is Paul he said I don't recall the new patients name So Paul said to him you know the side does work and it really is amazing it's really easy to follow 'em\nAnd it's really easy to follow the law while I'm On the road when he never thought that he'd be able to actually do a diet because of that\nBecause you know these guys are always on the road down the road for hours and hours there's not a lot of stops of places to eat it and if there are there usually extremely unhealthy so he says that he's actually been able to find really healthy options and all of these places that he used to stop and now he's eating according to the islands of the program he's almost done with the program by the way I think he's down close to like\nThirty seven pounds of forty days well that's all he really had to lose\n'em and under some tremendous amount of he's taller guy so he carries it well but clearly the health issues where are the more concerning notice um and you know just going back to my original point of the beginning of the show is that really what we're doing is we're changing people's lives in terms of\nHealth and that's kind of the most important thing here I'm right because with all that fat laws come so many different benefits as far as getting you better feeling a better so\nTalking about the commercial driver's ah Jake uh who you actually saw\nThis week is done with his two sixty day rounds and he is down a hundred and twenty pounds I'm also a commercial driver um\nAnd he says that you know he he always meet up with some of his friends along the way along his route that he does and he says people don't recognize them anymore and I was like well listen a hundred and twenty pounds is you know it isn't just around two six zero to ... to to their to sixty day rounds of the\nProgram though would he be the he would be the big you know he would end up now for the\nFor the guy who was first before you already beat him while we had somebody who lost sixty nine and six they also I Know that perfect for the week yeah know learn how to roll right he's pretty high up there for a hundred and twenty you know basically a hundred and twenty pounds and a hundred and twenty days last right it is up in the middle east up in the middle reset\nAnd he got caught up what's really cool about his story is you know the great science and between\nThe grounds you didn't put anything wrong because now you know give them the tools that your weight goes up by two pounds here's what you do here is how you knock it off he's got the DNA test he's got the blood work to help keep his body belts he's got the personal I supplements and he's not going to it's just it's not going to put it back or\nHe he couldn't figure out how to get enough calories to eat while he was on break from the two six today rounds\nHe couldn't eat enough food yeah sickly or that kind of where that was that but the interesting thing about his story is that what he said to me was his doctor kept track of his blood work the whole entire time that he was on the program for 'em\nAnd he said that each and every time that he did blood it just kept getting better and better and better and he\nWas saying that before he started the program he was basically a\nPre diabetic they wanted him to start taking seven hundred milligrams of met foreman I'm\nJust you know it's really luckier at his weight I Know ... not a very lucky is very very\nLucky but he told me that I'm at the end of the day all of the medications that they wanted to put him on would have cost him\nOut of pocket seven hundred dollars a month well okay let's calculate that I Believe this gentleman is in his late fifties I'm not a hundred percent certain of his age loved him he ... he lives until he's eighty so let's let's give them another twenty five years ... that's twenty five years times twelve times seven hundred knows go to court and that's out of\nPocket that's insurance not covering answer and you know what we don't even know if these medications are going to be able to control whatever he had going on so that was actually what he focused on just as you understand how much money I'm saying that I'm like I Do I I that's just\nMind boggling numbers hundred and twenty pounds a hundred and twenty days and we've saved a potential seven hundred dollars a month for the rest of the who wants\nTo take those medications even if there were for granted if insurance covered all of it who wants to go on and you know most of these things that people are taking the medications for for for obesity they're really you know every doctor patient that that\n... ... it's almost a hundred percent curable because they're all affected from what I'd rather it was all told her all the result of of of being overweight and that's and that's really tremendous so\nThese are these are typical result twenty five to thirty five pounds for women is what we see thirty five to forty five plus pounds per month\nAnd that's only in forty days it's without ... without hormones without surgery it's all natural solutions supplements that are personalized each individual from uh from blood work for parents live a bar or Byron ...\nDNA testing as well a beginning and end and and really you know that's what makes that go with the personalization of how to how to balance each how to help balance each person's body when they come in and so you can call one eight five five five and Jay diet ... five five six five\nThirty four thirty eight because that's the schedule an appointment and one of our offices\nAnd we're all excited about ... about prince and opening a lots of people have been coming up\nFrom South Jersey saying when he can open when you can open so we're finally opened up place down there were I see patients fare and it's really great so twenty five to forty five pounds is typically what we see a little bit more on the men's side sometimes and the twenty five five five and Jay diet and like when you're calling to make a phone call when you're calling please remember the people on the phone [noise]\nThey're just there to schedule the appointment they really don't have the answers your questions most of them are just hearing scheduled appointment so don't yell at them or you can go to Andrew dice dot com or the easiest way only twenty seven dollars just go to ... dot com\nAnd uh you can also go to\nAndrew dice dot com that's easiest way to do it usually it's Ninety nine dollars but right now is the radio list are only twenty seven dollars\nFor a full body comes a consultation with us a full body composition analysis where we are going to take a look at not only weight but others certain important things like your your water levels your body water so give me an example of how important is as if your body of water is very low and the people with the lowest body water by the way are obese women\nYou just shrink and you look great cause you're we're making sure staying hydrated and increasing your water and do you how your body is absorbing water so she says she lost twenty twenty two part she goes I Swear I I look I I I'm wearing I can get into clothing now that I I couldn't get in when I was thirty thirty five pounds\nLighter a and so she's just she says she came in she's super thrilled I'm going on a monster shopping spree she says her ... her husband is going to kill her as you go into a shopping spree a and put what's great you know she came and she had a bunch of share the history of of major digestive issues\nWhen she was coming in and you know every time she ate she says within like\nTwenty minutes to a half an hour she's gassy she's bloated a she and she feels that way for hours this was this was beforehand\nAnd we you know she came in\n... weather obviously a we looked at a bunch of different things\nUh we did the hair saliva or with the energetic ... a buyer and drug testing well we took a look at some blood work that she brought in we were able to do a a ... a toxicity support\nA digester support or minerals and vitamins support and so boom twenty to twenty two pounds um in in forty days which is fantastic\nA little bit below what we typically see but still you know like she said she looks like she's thirty pounds\nShe looks like she's thirty pounds a lighter she looks and feels that she's thirty pounds lighter and\nYou know she's going to go spend some money on somebody get get get help the economy a little bit of a shopping yeah shot shot in the arms of the economy a little bit get herself shopping by some clothing and uh it's always good right she looks like she's thirty pounds a lighter she looks and feels like she's thirty pounds lighter and\nYou know she's going to go spend some money on some get get get help the economy a little bit of a shopping yeah shot shot in the arms to the economy a little bit get herself shopping at a bind some clothing and uh it's always good right\nAll good I you know I think that there is nothing that feels or um that feels better then\nI'm buying yourself a pair of jeans that earth size or two sizes smaller than you were only like hello twenty thirty forty days ago or so in my opinion it's like you know for a man who is tightening his belt buckle right and and you get to see that mark\nAnd that he's had there for like whatever eight years and now that markets you know now that belt is on a different a whole and I think that that's I think it's really special and I think um\n[noise] and I think what really matters is the fact that\nYou know every single day you're accountable to yourself now and you know what you're doing and you know and\nYou kinda feel comfortable in your own skin now you're no longer afraid of the snack attack you're no longer you know having these cravings and we had Stella call the office this week so she's been off the program for three years by the way\nI'm and she I think she lost about thirty seven pounds three years ago and she is sixty four now so she was sixty one uh\nThree years ago obviously she called because she wanted to know\nAbout the DNA testing 'cause that was really interesting to her and also because she gets the complimentary hand saliva evaluation every three months she comes in and she does that and she gets the appropriate ... by told her about that too but so one of the things that she said to me that really\nChanged her\nAfter the program was that she's no longer afraid to walk into a supermarket she's no longer afraid to go sit down at a restaurant because she knows exactly where she's at the track like she's completely control in control your ...\nAnd she said that this wasn't the situation three years ago she had completely lost control\nAnd that's a scary place to be at and I'm really proud of her that three years later on and she said to me\nShe does you know it's a daily thing for me now she says I wake up in the morning and I think about\nWhat my days going to look like and then my second thought as what my days going to look like food wise and it's an interesting thing right we wake up in the morning we think about what we have to do during the day well why not think about what it is that we're going to eat during the day\nOr ... you know that's what fuels our body that's what determines how much energy we had that really\nDetermines how we're going to feel the next morning right but a lot of people don't think of it that way but she says\nYou know it completely shifted her paradigm and think like she's completely on a different wavelength in terms of what happens to her every single morning she has a routine\nYou know she knows what she's going to eat she knows what she's gonna do that day and that really helps her and three years later all the way to sell off and she's doing great\nYou know it's great it's great and then that's what you do you empower people when you have control your empowered and you you can handle it and you know what to do and and so each person is given\nTen different ways to get the weight off her each person as the weight set point reset each person or is given a a DNA test that tells them all these different things for over forty different metabolic factors and so that's what it's all about without any shots and hormones in surgery we typically see twenty five\nTo thirty five pounds and women are we typically see thirty five to forty five\nPlus pounds with men and that's mostly fat that's without shots without hormones without\nSurgery or without hungrier eating natural food uh you're you're you're not hungry in the program because your body is burning so much toxic side for fuel that were just basically rerouting what your body's using for fuel and then we were out it back in and so it's really monitor you every every day you have my\nPersonal cell phone number my email address so nobody's ever alone a on this process\nIt's really easy to just go to and Jay ... it gets started to go to Jay died dot com normally Ninety nine dollars but as a radio listener uh right now you go on line is twenty seven dollars for a full body composition analysis [noise]\nUh where we take over and take a look at a bunch of different things we do a full consultation body composition analysis we look at not only weight but we're also looking at a visceral fat we're also looking at your basic metabolic rate and so we're also looking at daily caloric intake and so the difference in those two numbers is important because\nYou know if you if your if your body's functioning your basic metabolic rate let's say you're burning off Seventeen hundred calories a day but your body functions like you're taking in thirty five twenty five hundred calories a three thousand calories a day\nAnd you're wondering why you can't lose weight that might give you an answer yeah and so we take a look at metabolic Lehigh your body is working\nAnd so then we we then do heroin saliva with and do\nThe buyer and genetic testing uh when decided to go forward with the program we didn't take a look at blood work that people bring in\nTo see what supplementation to support them with\nAnd we look at it a functional level or we just tighten up those parameters a little bit so we don't you know if you keep the parameters within a functional level you have to worry less about being diagnosed with big without the ... by those problems getting worse and being ... God Forbid diagnosed with something so\nWe want to keep it in a healthy range and keep your body balance and if we're able to do that then there's less chance you know upstream downstream if you if upstream you're able to keep the body balance and you have to worry about less disease downstream and so that's n J died dot com\nOr for twenty seven dollars for a a a only twenty seven dollars for a full body composition analysis in a in a consultation with us where we can\nShe started and gets you going on the way to help you if you want to call you can ah ... the number is one eight five five\nFive and Jay diet that's eight five five five six five thirty four thirty eight a that's a scheduling appointments and one of our locations we've got prints than opening a that's open now ready to see patients so that prints in Queens\nOr Long Island Brooklyn a New York city close to New Jersey I think I missed something I don't remember but anywhere print since ready to go in and people have been real happy about that so\nUh that's great and so you can come in scheduled appointment or you make a phone call just remember when you are calling\nThat the folks on the phone are only there to schedule appointments or they're not there to you know put you on the weight loss program uh [laughter] they still get mad at the fabric great now now whatever yeah they they get mad at the people on the phone a lot of five I don't know why\nBut uh yeah so yeah they're just they're just because of the appointment they don't have the answer is just go on and then we'll talk to an end will give you all the answers about the program and so forth [noise] um\nSo bill came in this week and it's really you know it's amazing when you when you\nHave a lot of extra fat in general and a lot of visceral fat testified on the organs\nFish try levels of visceral fat really cause inflammation in the body inflammation in the body will cause is one of the causes to all the different chronic no systemic sort of aches and pains so it's not just one area that hurts a systematic shoulders and elbows in choosing the joints and that's why\nAre people that are obese more more more a ... percent susceptible to arthritis and things like that and just generalize inflammation the body\nAnd so\nYou know bill comes in and got all these different aches and pains\nOr he is he's got high blood pressure\nOr he's one of these guys you know typical belly you know the body stores fat in different areas to protect their is because of different hormonal disruptions generally in those areas so if you get somebody with like that you know floppy overhanging belly fat you're looking at a dream knows if you're looking at that that apple shape you're looking at a thyroid if you're looking at\nA um a pear shape are you looking at reproductive Oregon imbalances so bills Scott there's belly you know he's got one of these one of these skinny guys with a big old belly like everything's in the belly\nA all day long uh and so that's going to ask him to make you tired and part of this is just physiology that the fact that his you know his his hormones are off his body is off nothing's work in the right way and when he came in and he says you know I just got a friend to the program is is that just got to get the same results I got to do something there's no way I can live like this [noise]\nUh and so they gave him you know did did all the personalization processes here game which Reno support we gave them reproductive up reconstruct of Oregon support all natural type of supplementation\nA personalized for him and so boom forty eight pounds got 'em going fifty days libido is back no more crashing in the middle of the day is barely even thinks about coffee anymore just has like a little cup in the morning\nAnd and he's a rock and roll and and and so you know that's what it's all about so\nYou know thirty five to forty five plus as what we see with men typically only forty days twenty five to thirty five\nWith women typically a ... in only forty days and it all natural there is no everything is either a avid base mineral base ... supplements that are personalized for each individual based on either by energetic testing\nOr or blood work or DNA as well uh and so without any shots without hormones or last surgery\nPeople aren't hungry in the program because their body would just turn their body into fat burning machine so we we're out what your body's using for fuel you're going to burn at least\nTwo thousand calories of your own fat for fuel you can't be hungry and and so uh it only forty days twenty five to forty five plus pounds across the board\nAnd so that's ... died dot com right now it's normally Ninety nine dollars as a radio list are only twenty seven dollars gets your body composition analysis\nAn appointment with us uh where we take a look at not only your weight and you could give us out on the phone I mean we look at your way we look at body fat percentage we look at body water percentage we look at visceral fat rating I'm engaged folks if your if your your your body is water is lawyer visceral fat as high\nYou know when you get high visceral fat that fat on the organs and makes you more insulin resistant when your body becomes more insulin resistant away your body metabolize is a sugar for fuel is instead of bringing into the cell and burning it your body is taking in turning into fat and storing it\nAnd that's going to make your metabolism work much slower on top of that if you've done a ton of weight yo yo dieting losing a ton of water too quickly\nOr like a lot of times with women that we see your water levels are going to be off if your water levels are often you got high visceral fat you're ... you're in you're forty years old you're metabolisms function like a seven year old you're not going to\nBe able to lose weight there's no way to do it\nSo we're gonna have to take a look at all those things and and then and then personalized these the solutions that supplements are the the for each individual get your body and the fat burning that's one of the things that we look at it as mineral balance metabolic cage daily caloric intake or and so\nIt you know that's that's how we do it on the front end and then and then we personalize the ... the ah the everything for the for you for the for the forty days program as well\nAnd we're all excited about ... about prince and opening lots of people have been coming up\nFrom South Jersey saying when you can open when are you gonna open so we're finally opened up place down there where I see patients there and it's really great so twenty five to forty five pounds is typically what we see a little bit more on the men's side sometimes [noise]\nAnd it's twenty five five five and Jay diet and like when you're calling and make a phone call when you're calling please remember the people on the phones [noise]\nThey're just there to

so\nHad and Jarrett I don't know if you remember him he had a quadruple bypass eight years ago I remember everybody yeah I Know but I'm just saying you know just in case you don't want to remind you so Jared and had a quadruple bypass eight years ago I'm\nClearly not the most ideal situation and really and instead as an working and you know getting better and working at and you know exercising more and feeling life like someone\nUp there I gave him a second chance on life he\nWent and they completely other way and started to eat really unhealthy he really felt it was so unfair that this happened to him and he had this quite triple bypass and all these other things and\nSo he kind of really started to um go downhill and um so he had a checkup with his cardiologist and he basically told him that um\nYou know he's heading down a not such a good road and so\nYeah so he I guess decided his girlfriend I think finally told him that you know you kind of either need to get with the program or sort of you know get out because you know she wasn't going to go through this again what happened eight years ago\nAnd and so he came in and\nYou know this was a guy who was getting every one of his meals and snacks\nUm take out ... you know so he was basically running in wherever eating whatever I'm and I'm\nYou know he used to be a runner he used to be you know all these things he used to do a ton of sports so anyway lo and behold a forty days later\n[noise] he lost\nA forty nine pounds while and uh we are back to running we are back to having known any pain no ankle pain or we are no\nLonger getting every meal out which is really really cool because he says he is my favorite part he gets to spend more money and buying clothes and buying clothes first girlfriend presents for her so you know\nBut [laughter] it's always my favorite part I shopping is key to this whole thing and you know he ... and the best part is that he's no longer depressed because he actually started to feel so much better once the weight started to come off that he realized\nThat his life wasn't over you know the heart was fixed you know the bypass worked eight years ago so you know here we go it's like a second chance in life so he really is thankful he cooks now um you know he says I Can't believe how much money I'm saving by not eating\nOut every meal and\nYou know you're getting it sounds like somebody who's sponsoring like a woman's group is sponsoring you had the one\nI Wish I had somebody may you had you had the one woman on you you want to get her ... aromatic here it every day they massage dare I say\nThis on there should be a woman's support groups warn you I'm sure there is this when you're talking about the fact that she uh what that she's spending money on her getting fed and give them money betting on her yes that's\nWhy they're sure wish I listen I you know it's all good I mean I I feel like there should be like\nMalls that are sponsoring may with the amount of things were telling people to do in terms of getting more clothing now I mean how about all the\nMales patients we guy guys three guys are I'm sure the guys are all through it's a little less than what about all the patients you don't have to get there still made a Swiss are expensive\nYou know you lose twenty five thirty forty fifty pounds man you you need a new shirts new tighten ties maybe not new shorts new pants belts everything they're more expensive than female clothing you know about that I'm I'm tell me\nYou know well maybe not but whatever I don't know about that and I said it's all good but you know what speaking of new clothing Bob ... yeah so was this very important because he came to me to tell me that\nHe went from a thirty six inch waist to thirty two inch waist and forty days Seventeen point five what how what he went from a thirty six inch waist to uh thirty two inch waist in forty days\nHis neck size went too far from Seventeen point five to Fifteen point five and he says that these were his sizes Twenty years ago and what's really funny is that for ... he puts on his old dress shirts and he says they looked like house dresses now\nAnd he makes fun of himself at every couple of days he'll put on one of the shirts and he'll run around now\nYeah of course they did but he says he keeps one keeps keeps on and they said it's a mental thing he he puts it I said I looked like I'm wearing\nRight okay with it I'm right with heart I look at All right floated and now I Know I Know it's so anyway and J died dot com for only twenty seven dollars as a radio

Gilead I'm In the leading cancer and prostate cancer not in the spring and the first New York with Frank native brain radio surgery first in America\nAnd in the western hemisphere finding radio surgery you can also call Dr Lieberman at two inches killington for free informative and DVD hey Dr Lederman what by\nHey we're back and talk a little bit about skin cancer and in fact\nThe sun but you got last year and the year before and ten years before your skin still remembers all that\nAnd in fact some estimate that most skin cancers in adults are due to sun exposure\nWhen we're less than a teen years of age or what to talk about a man who came in Seventy five is getting heart surgery and he's got a skin cancer basal cell in his abdomen and he wants us to treat his skin cancer because he doesn't want to be sliced up\nAnd that makes sense to be true to a lot of skin cancers or treating this man with basal cell cancer on his abdomen if another man\nWith a capital these are called ... which is a kind of cancer that affects the skin it affects the skin in two groups of people there's a lot of sun exposure cancer it's a either and HIV patients or in Mediterranean based\nPeople in general and it responds exceedingly well to radiation we can give superficial radiation just to the area of cancer and we have another man who flew in from Texas with Merkel so cancer now you said Merkel cell cancer of the\nBases heads standard surgery extensive surgery radiation the chemo didn't work you came with about six spots on his face he took a big marble on the on the right set up a face recruited those those are all gone and there's now\nTo more spots reaches them and there's a spot in his chest so with radio surgery for example the spot in the chest about a half an inch but it's active we detected up by a PET scan so PET scan is that as a actually double\nKind of test and the double kind of test is a test\nThat allows us to see exactly where the cancer is and let's see where the\nShadow or masses are so pet except\nRadioactive sugar and the radioactive sugar tells\nUs where the ... the cancer is has more sensitive than a CAT scan or an ultrasound or other tests so this man he came from Texas I encourage them to get\nThe best screening test is already here and so we're going to be treating that new area in the chest as well as the two hours in the face he's been very successfully treated and that's why comes from Texas to New York for\nOur radio surgery and it's worth it for the experience if you think about it we were the first ones of America to perform stereo tactic body radio surgery which has pinpoint\nTreatment when every other facility every facility America every docked in America is given standard radiation which means right in the healthy tissue and the cancer with every facility in every doctor was doing that one said\nIt's not right why radiate healthy tissues when you don't have to why not just hit the cancer I think it makes sense if you have a cancer you want the cancer hip not the healthy tissues yet so that's the work we do a radio surgery to New York to hit\nThe cancer without harming the healthy tissues and if you like that idea noninvasive quick\nPainless treatment he probably will like the care at radio surging New York and it probably like the interaction with the doctor the staff\nOr like our location you'd probably like the atmosphere and all of a billion robots walking around in white coats and stuff the scopes though when you walk in you know who you are you know who we are and that's the way we like to keep up and speaking of success\nOn TALK about a woman who we treated who I treated Seventeen years ago she had a cancer the man double she came quite a distance\nTreated her and the cancer has stayed in\nRemission to this day and she's happy about it now why is she coming in to see me well she's coming in because she has a new cancer one in the breast and one of the growing it's a kind of them former and she wants the same style treatment that we've treated in her job all\nSeventeen years ago to treat the cancer and the breast on the right side and the growing on the left side and that's the kind of work we do we could do it rapidly precisely without unnecessary harm to the healthy tissues as we believe in the first\nOnes in America to do radio surgery we have the experience of the staff of the team work we have the facility we have the equipment we location we take the insurance is Medicare Medicaid if enough information to mail to the DVD about our work questions and answers about radio surgery\nAnd as well we have a DVD about the making of this radio show so you can see the background so this woman\nWe're treating those tumors the breast\nCancer the breast and the cancer and the growing ... whom fama she's going to have these treatments five treatments and the success rate is very high and she's already knows what it's about she's been through the treatment Seventeen years ago she comes in with her loving son she gets her treatment\nGoes home and is happy about it and we're happy to we're happy to serve her is such a good way and to the good news department I told you about a woman who had uterine cancer\nUterine cancer she had surgery she had radiation shed chemo didn't work she came and intractable pain before she came to us just put on hospice imagined that is put on hospice hospices end of life care uh her doctors couldn't\nThink of anything else they couldn't do anything else they put her in hospice ... end of life care her son\nIs a technical person heard about radio surgery he called me says can you help my mother she doesn't tractable\nMonths of investigation you discovered radio surge in New York our program in Manhattan thirtieth and Broadway and he came with his daughter we did a little biopsy it was\nSo adamant against surgery and he was so concerned about a biopsy so we had a little biopsy done which is like a little pins going into the to her with numbed up the tissues the biopsy cut the\nPathology which is a man and she alma growing through this go like a big bump like a half an apple on the top of us had well we started this treatment is down about the third portion of the treatment\nAnd he's already stronger the headaches are going away the right side of his body is coming back before he couldn't lift up his arm now he comes every day and it gives me a Hi fi\nYeah so as a high five is doing well he's getting his strength know cutting no bleeding he's happy or unhappy with great results another great results for benign tumor I just talked about acoustic Roman this woman this beautiful one from a neighboring state now this man with a massive\n... going through our\nFocused being treatment after refusing open crony autonomy open surgery at two of the biggest hospitals in New York\nWow what a difference it makes if you come for a fresh second opinion I Know some people are skeptical new should be skeptical there's a lot of stuff on the radio a word of mouth yeah there's a lot of stuff\nWe tried to provide the data examples\nIf you look at our brain tumor booklet go see scores scores of examples of patients we've created with glioblastoma as ... as a metastases and ...\nThat we've created over the years over decades and the beautiful thing as you can have a doctor with that experience triple board certified who takes your calls it could be the case with you you went up to speak to a clerk\nOr a student or a resident or PA or nurse now he can speak directly to the doctor that's how we think it should be\nAnother woman who came in an eighty four year old woman with a loving children she came in from the islands in the Caribbean shed rectal bleeding\nThat comes to a patient change about movements she's lost weight satisfied with their care she's coming to us and were staging are up and getting into the diagnosis to find out why she has rectal bleeding conservation change and Bob movements and way laws well\nObviously we're concerned about her having a cancer and obviously we're going to get to the bottom of it and our goal is to make or better healthy happy before she goes back home and then we had another man who came in he's a fifty year old man handsome man he's had hepatitis since uh since about Nineteen Ninety in the two thousand he was\nTreated with medicine for the appetite us get an MRI and two thousand eleven of his liver which was negative me a blood in the urine unrelated yeah the CAT scan and the number I Would show to mass in the liver and this primary doctor's central gastroenterologist to send them to a surgeon who spent the set about\nFour minutes with him and said you have a liver cancer you need surgery I'm going to take out your whole life lobe of your liver and it was scheduled to remove the left global liver\nWell we do for him like we do for\nEvery person in need said we reviewed his scans and actually the scans that he had were inconclusive\nWasn't clear that he had cancer and yet he was scheduled for surgery without a biopsy without confirmation they're going to remove the whole love love of the liver well we reviewed his scans we got one more scan\nTo determine what's going on we still couldn't be confident but instead of finding one area we found two areas biopsy both areas and in fact they were both\nCancers so had the surgery to remove the level of liver or they would have missed the second cancer\nWhich had now the man knows the diagnosis\nMost of the ... knows that there's two cancer's not one and he's chosen to go with radio surgery which is focused\nOut patient non invasive treatment British ... just to name by the way radio surgery has not surgery with us there is no cutting no bleeding it come in\nLate on a table the moves around the cancer you get up and go home or go to work or go to the movies or go across the street to ... Times Square do anything you don't do is you don't stay in the hospital you don't have\nA caught and you don't have a bleeding you don't have anesthesia know British reduce all non invasive outpatient therapy narcotic no bleeding and that's the way we like it can stay out of the hospital you can stay away from those super\nInfections you can stay away from the risk of complications and this man\nAfter seeing multiple doctors including is primaries gastroenterologist insurgents and others has decided to go with focused radiation and we did all the preparatory work\nAnd he'll get to start with his first cheap and\nSo yes we do treat liver cancers and the success rate is high it's about Ninety percent where we trade with non invasive focused beam treatment going to learn more about it we actually have a book with a DVD cause during the work week or two and two choices\nTo one to two four six forty two thirty seven to one to two four six forty two thirty seven it'd be happy to mail you a book with a DVD about her work and obviously it's best to meet\nIn person the booklet can't describe the details of your particular case it gives you a general information and that's\nAll they

fifty years old with this are combing his pelvis how could he have been managed differently and sort of radical surgery instead of chemotherapy that didn't work instead of not telling them about the mass in the chest\nWe would have staged them up at radio surgery in New York for a mass in the chest we would have told him most of the you can have the chemo if you want everything you can have if you want because you are your friends or neighbors or the president of their body that came out really doesn't make much sense to the disease whether it's seldom works number two if the cancers already traveled\nWhy put them through a radical surgery and\nTwenty one days in the hospital infections and taking away a sexual function imagine a Fifteen year old man\nTaking away as sexual function and even the feeling in his pain that's when the cancer seems to have already traveled had registered in New York you could have had five treatments noninvasive too that mess in the pelvis\nAbsolute already proven to be lifeless are calmer and avoided the surgery avoided the chemo and if he wanted we could also treat the mess in the chest\nPeople often call and say doctor Lederman do treat stage for cancer and I say that's what we do every day we treat a localized cancer the creek advanced cancer we treated lymph node involvement primary met a static large or small most anywhere in the body and we have data over twenty five years we\nWhen every hospital every doctor every facility thought standard treatment was okay we stood up\nAnd brought new technology and
