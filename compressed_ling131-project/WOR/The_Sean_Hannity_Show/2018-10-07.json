understood that he had stage for cancer offered biopsies this fine or ... if he wished\nHe got the pet scan it reviewed it with him we talked to an all the options we talked about surgery removing the breast or not or over the lump or not as a man five Senate or mass\nMost likely be removing the whole breast we talked about different forms of chemotherapy we talked about radiation\nAnd we talked about all the options and that's what I Do with every person man or woman we're talking about all the options and then he chose when he made it very clear that he did not want to have chemotherapy\nNumber one number two he did not want to have surgery on the breast and not wanting to have a radical or modified radical mastectomy knowing that the cancer\nAll righty traveled he made his decision that he wanted radio surgery only pinpoint treatment to the breast and to the metastases the spot and start them and this is the work that we do and that's how we treat every person so that every person comes to us learn all the options and every person\nDecides on their own rather than having a surgeon push them for surgery and I came up person pushing them for chemo now we talk about all the options if he wants to see a surgeon or chemo person I could arrange that as well [noise]\nThis man had all the options we talked about it and he's now on treatment doing very well and that's how we like it someone who's informed knows all the options before hand knows this stage of the cancer before hand\nDoesn't have to choose radical surgery then there's the next day said oh by

[noise]\nAnd for twelve years she's been taking more or less concoction ...\nFor the first one year he had hormonal therapy he chose loop run and Cassidy ... these are methods of a treatment to suppress the testosterone and therefore to suppress the cancer [noise]\nSo he took hormonal therapy for one year most men with prostate cancer don't really like hormone therapy very much especially by itself because by itself\nIt doesn't cure the cancer number one and number two lots of side effects or suppression of libido erections weight gain of hot flashes and other side of the facts as well [noise]\nAnd then he had a repeat biopsies so he doesn't get treated really did a successful treatment\nAnd then he had to repeat biopsies a year ago shows the Gleason seven cancer so the cancers becoming more aggressive remember originally it was a Gleason six [noise] when they initially presented it was a Gleason six PSA three point four\nWell if a man comes to us with a ... that's how the cancers in the microscope the essay three point for our success rate in getting rid of the cancers about Ninety five percent\nSo then he had concoction ... concoction ... concoction is and the Gleason score rose which means the cancer is more aggressive [noise]\nHe had a ... a year ago showed suspicious lesions in the prostate another biopsy showed more cancer [noise]\nAnd now he's come to me wondering what to do this a man who lives in California He's head concoction for a decade he had one year of hormone therapy [noise]\nHis father had prostate cancer so he has a positive family history and he traveled here just to me to talk about what the best option is and so I told him the best option in my view is the option that gives the highest success right\nWith the least toxicity that keeps his sexual life had urinary life intact\nFor Gleason seven cancer our success rate is Ninety percent fee looks at surgery radical surgery robotic surgery which most commonly causes the man to be impotent incontinent the success rates only sixty percent\nSo with us it's outpatient therapy no hospital no radical surgery know robotic surgery most likely keeping his sexual life and you're in your

and I want to talk about it eighty four year old man he's a man with high blood pressure on aspirin and he was um [noise]\nSeeing me because he has a new cancer of his nose he has a cancer the part of the nose between the tip of his nose and the upper lip so by the inferior part of the sap them or the front of them\nIs a cancer and he was seen by a dermatologist he had a biopsy and the ... just insurgent wants to do what's called Mose MOH as surgery Mose surgery on this part of his\nNose which is really not part of the skin itself it's really part of the nose to nose cancer\nAnd if you do at Moses MOH us I Know there's a lot of Moses and knows and Moses nose to nose and mouth closed but Moses a technique of treating skin cancers a surgical technique where the\nSurgeon goes in and started slicing slicing slicing slicing slice it kind of like a slice of salami supposedly until you get to the last piece of cancer well to\nThe doctor really can't see the last so of cancer there's slicing until they believe grossly they've removed at all\nAnd this is a location which will be very difficult because it's getting into the nose I could tell you that Moses surgery for the nose is not usual and often will lead to lots of destruction of the nose which most likely the nose will not be normal\nAfter Mose and that's why I came and that's why many people's skin cancers and also knows cancers and catches run the eyes and ears and miles and hands and feet\nCome to us for treatment because there's a huge difference between ... it was really just keep on slicing slicing slicing ... regardless of the extent of loss of the body\nAnd then they take out some tissue from the ... or somewhere else and saw it on where the skin is missing which looks you know usually off for like a calamity whereas with us there is no slicing there is no transfer of tissue from nearby talks or somewhere else\nTo your nose which would be so visible and so I have to probably so unappealing with us we use pinpoint radio surgery to focus on the cancer to kill cancer cells without cutting without bleeding without sewing without hospitals without operating rooms\nWith us and recruited thousands of skin cancers ... square missiles and carrots why Ken thumb and other cancers of the skin were able to treat the cancer non invasive Lee and that's why this man came to us we talked about all the options\nAnd again it's I Know this sounds like an old story but again\nThe surgeon didn't tell the patient all the options she said he didn't say walking cut off your nose or you can go see Dr Lederman you didn't say that you just said you have to cut off your nose and number one that's not really fair to the patient\nIt doesn't tell the patient all the options I went to medical school to help people and doesn't how people to\nTry to solve surgery or sell radiation or sell chemotherapy we should\nTalk about educating educating like we're doing here on the radio today and that's what I Do every day is to educate and offer all the options\nAnd if someone wants our our our ... great if they don't our option that's great too because we're here just to educate and if that patient for example has his nose cut off and [noise]\nHe chooses a surgical options well then we don't feel that\nBad because he was told all the options and he chose that he chose that over non invasive treatment where I feel really bad as when someone gets his nose cut off and he's never told about all the options the number is told a certain lets them believe that only surgery as an option when it's\nNot when it's not [noise] I don't want\nTo talk about a gentleman who was here born in New York City sixty one years old geezer home contractor he has a daughter is married [noise] he was fine until last year when he had abdominal pain went to the emergency room he had a pancreas mass\nHit a needle biopsy and biopsies showed cancer went to one of the big hospitals in neighboring state and he had a\nContrast CAT scan an endoscopic biopsy what does it end the ... beans that means that the doctors went down with the scope into his stomach and through the stomach to the biopsy the pancreas showing cancer\nHe never had a number I never had a PET scan his cancer marker for pancreas cancers ca Ninety nine and I tell you that so you know about that see a Ninety nine\nAnd ... was a hundred and twenty five\n[noise] and he's been on chemotherapy has been on chemotherapy for a year\nAnd the first chemotherapy didn't work and then he went on a second chemotherapy and with the second chemotherapy it really doesn't work normally properly and he's on third line chemotherapy with radiation\nAnd he has a lymph node that is growing his lymph nodes around the pancreas was one point one centimeters before he started the came on the standard radiation and afterwards it was one point nine [noise]\nAnd the patient came and saw me and I pointed out to the patient and so often it's the case so often I'm able to tell things to the patient about the patient that they don't know themselves like this man he did not know that\nIs live float around the pancreas said doubled and we spoke to the radiologist I got the radiologist on the phone from that hospital\nAnd the radiologist confirm that mess has been growing had three weeks of radiation daily treatment which didn't work and the the dose they gave him was a dose that you wouldn't expect to work so why would they give radiation and the dos it's so low it wouldn't be expected to work\nIs losing weight two years ago was to forty eight now he's two hundred pounds he's lost fifty pounds he's six foot three raises a big man [noise] his cancer\nMarker is going down well what does it mean when the cancer markers going down and the cancers growing well when the cancer markers getting better but the cancers growing and means that the cancer's not making that cancer marker anymore cancer markers don't work forever you have to think about the cancer marker and the patient and the imaging\nAnd he's got a growing mess he's got a growing massive\nSlim flow that's growing confirmed got a PET scan has so I went to the legs we asked to get a duplex because blood clots are the number two killer of cancer patients that many people with [noise]\nPancreas cancer do have blood clots in their legs so getting him staged up for the first time has been diagnosed nearly two years had year chemotherapies not working\nAnd in two months to cancer grew from a tense other major mass now it's like twelve centimeter maps\nSo tells you a lot about cancers cancer doesn't sit still cancer doesn't wait for you\nThis is a woman most likely she's had this cancer for some time she now has come through with a twelve centimeter mass before was occupied the left upper out are quieter browsed now it's occupied and entire breast the brass to swell on and hired\nTender and she wants to be treated now she wants our treatment on and we see many women with early breast cancer just microscopic dots of cells and we see also women with massive cancer\nWith a whole breast has inflamed with cancer and that's what this woman has [noise]\nThen she wants to be treated she wants to try to keep her brash Ron so void surgery she wants to have no chemotherapy and we're starting treatment immediately we've talked to her about all the options she knows all the options you see in the months of being worked up months being seen by other doctors\nShe's heard about all the options and chosen our treatment only\nAnd I can tell you the most likely will have a good success and tricky down this cancer and will tell you about it as time goes on\nSpeaking about a woman I was like sixty year old woman who has one son and she had a light pole sarcoma she was in good health and she noticed a mass in her left thigh\nAnd it was about five inches inside she had an MRI biopsy showed us sarcoma sarcoma as a cancer of connective tissue so in muscles and fat and bones get cancer often it's a sarcoma\nAnd shed radical surgery she went to one of the big hospitals in Long Island ... radical surgery\nThat wasn't radical surgeries done I'm not advocating but what does does the doctor should cut out the cancer\nWith large margins around the cancers other cancers less likely to spread well when this doctor cut on this woman the margins\nWere paper than\nThe other cancer was ten by nine by six centimeters is alive pour succumb the fat\nStages and does the tea to be shed standard radiation close to home so she had surgery she had standard radiation\nAnd then within months you start having terrible pain in her hip and difficulty moving she had paid in the knee she was seen again by the orthopedic surgeons they gave her medicines\nAnd then she got to scan maybe six months later and there was a leash than the left hip measuring six centimeters it was PET scan positive six centimeter mass by the hip bone by the joint they tried a\nBiopsy another three months went by they tried to another biopsy that was not ... that was negative didn't show cancer\nThat are surgeons told her to wait another four months a year she went to a year with progressive pain and suffering and difficulty walking a year with snow and telling her what's going on and then she had a ... second lesion of the gluteus muscle those muscles Lubbock talks\nShe had difficulty moving and painted the hip was using a cane could barely walk and finally\nShe just gave up on her doctors are doctors who did the surgery and gave her standard radiation they couldn't make a diagnosis you went to one of the biggest hospitals there could make a diagnosis came to us caged or a got a biopsy put a little NATO into the mess and sure enough\nIf it was ... sarcoma those spread from a leg to the hip and it was growing there for a year without being diagnosed causing pain and suffering a difficulty walking [noise]\nWe treated her with radio surgery rather than weeks and weeks of standard radiation jihad weeks and weeks of standard radiation jihad radical surgery the radical surgery left cancer behind the weeks and weeks of standard radiation doesn't work very well for sort of Columbus Columbus are known to be resistance to standard radiation\nWere able to treat her with focused radiation pinpoint treatment\nOn the cancer only few treatments but very focused very intense just to the cancer was high degree of success a great success and by the way I should tell you that we treated her five years ago and she's now in remission she came to this week for follow up testing\nShe's cancer free so she had met a static cancer return to after surgery recurrent after standard radiation\nWhich are there five years ago she has cancer free just after

Hi\nIs eighty and cloudy at four o'clock good afternoon I'm no woman late twenty people are dead in a limousine accident that took place up in a popular upstate leaf peeping down more than that from W ours mark around the lard\nA particularly it affects really are obese people but it's certainly ... women obese women in general or if your if your body water is low and you're walking around with a bunch of water and you're walking around with a book with drinking water all the time and meanwhile your water's low\nUh you're gonna that's gonna affect how your body's metabolism is going to work it's going to affect ah your muscle is like the engine of your metabolism\nAnd so if that's not happening um because your body isn't absorbing water properly maybe one of the reasons you can't lose any weight so we put you on that machine will be able to see if that's the situation there\nUh they said and J died dot com it's only twenty seven dollars and you can schedule appointment come in and we'll get you going on the road to health and on the road to possibly shopping and different parties\nYeah so I got you beat on that one what what what was your number your number one for days and\nBruce was sixty days fifty six pounds in six\nTo ... I got you beat on that one I got I'm yeah I'm a I'm ashamed to say well I'm not ashamed to say I don't really know his first name because he's in Brooklyn officers on them and and and so and I I Believe that his pictures has the foreign actors actually on our website already a sixty four pounds and sixty days\nOh yeah I Know you're talking about three sixty four pounds in sixty days yeah yeah and he took a great profile picture of himself this gentleman is wearing a white shirt and tie and so the profound pictures fantastic so if you guys get a chance definitely go to and Jay died dot com and take a look at that profile picture sixty four pounds and sixty days is very impressive\nMan and woman it doesn't matter how old you are I mean it really is that um [noise] it's an\nAt an astronomical number in my opinion officer Amos I I think something to that effect again I don't know the patient personally because I don't go to the Brooklyn office but\nAh you know this is just staggering number and really just the health benefits of gas officer any trace of criminals around I bet you can do it much easier sixty four comes down I Would think so I definitely I think that's probably a much better situation for them especially in this heat that we've got going on so we asked them\nSo we improved we've we improved the safety of our city just yes that's correct if you can chased on criminal yeah ... yeah no yeah when I went wow ups yeah when when\nOne at a time right so but you know that the pounds of great but I think that um\nA lot of what we see in our office is really the health benefits of what happens and um\n[noise] you know just losing ten twelve or Fifteen pounds can make such a huge difference in how you feel and\nUm what you are a blood tests are and where your numbers are so we stand who are just um was in and he's on day thirty three of the program he went from two Seventy one to two forty four\nA which is a twenty seven pounds in thirty three days which by the way is not a tremendous number for a man typically you know for a man that um has a lot of weight to lose you know in thirty three days we'll see anywhere probably anywhere between thirty six to forty pounds however lover pounds however his\nA health uh results or hit overall uh health um benefits have been ridiculous so his blood pressure\nIs now one of four over sixty four\nWhich I Would say probably a little low [laughter] if I write his cholesterol ah when I'm Down to one oh nine\nFrom from two twenty eight wow so his HDL is at forty six and his LDL is at forty two down from Ninety seven ... his triglycerides are now a hundred and seven down from two fifty eight\nThis is day thirty three of the ... well\nI mean I I I Would think well that's basically what his doctor actually said too because I guess he had a doctor's appointment like\nThirty three day and to the program which we usually tell people you know wait until you're done with the program and then go to your primary care physician and kind of do the blood work and all that other stuff but his appointment was already scheduled so he figured he'd go why not write so his primary care I fell off the chair absolutely\nAt just blown away he asked him what he was doing he was like I don't understand he's like you were here a couple of months ago you know your your numbers for a disaster basically you know and his eyes I can understand I have so much energy I'm doing this and doing that I feel so good\nAt you know but that that's really what's cool I think right thirty three days and and\nLiterally um he's basically almost off all of his medications trauma it's tremendous tremendous um but I think that those are the coolest results right and we talk about that in the office you find\nThose to health part of it is the best part and were able to do that because of the personalization of the of the of the system and\nPeople come in with his hair and saliva ah we use blood work analysis we use DNA Analysis as well and from saliva and uh we were able to look at your blood work in a functional level and and then to\nSee what supplements with support people need and and it's so everybody gains weight in different areas for a reason\nThe body is generally trying to protect those areas because of heirs hormone\nA disruption and so you've got the different body types who got to be with the floppy overhanging belly fat or could be an internal issue for treating hard belly fat deliver 'em the day that that ... issue with the apple shape apple shaped generally thyroid imbalances\nOr the pear shape reproductive imbalances doesn't really matter\nOr it could be a Ninety number of things are and so we're able to use the buyer energetic scans that we use from parents water use blood work assessment tool or to see when a functional level to keep to keep a ... to keep the body functioning better not so much diagnosing disease\nAnd so then personalize the system personalize the supplements for each individual to help get that one person or into fat burning and unable to\nBasically get people into the secular state of fat burning and then the body starts bouncing self out body starts detox of flying itself\nThe hype and found this which is the uh the main hormone controller and the main thermostat of the body starts resetting itself so when people are done they're not going to put the weight back on because the thermostat is basically re set at a new number just like a house thermostat you punch in Seventy two phases Seventy two\nSo that's what we were able to do the problem is that the reason a lot of times people can't lose any weight is their thermostat is set up to fifty and no matter what they do they're going to say to fifty\nSo then we get them their bodies bouncing come down to let's say two ten and re set the thermostat a two time you're going to stay to tech\nAnd then we give everybody tools going forward as well so if you're going to\nYou know if you if you will give you ten different ways to eat if your weight even pops up by two or three pounds would tell you how to what to eat that day drops the way back down so you should never really be above two or three pounds over a year you know day forty or or a six year and a program where\nSo ah you know to the system it's personally from the beginning of ... at the end at the end we also use DNA\nTools but we do a DNA test\nAnd so the DNA shows a different eating a types or exercise for each individual a central the need for central vitamins and minerals\nOr ... different or metabolic factors are assessed so we're looking at over forty different genetic factors to help people not only help keep lose the weight but also how to keep it off going forward so\nIt's basically all encompassing from beginning to end this person lines to each individual because everybody's going to be a little different camping one uh can't be a one or what one thing that fits everybody so it's got to be a little bit different that one size fits all travel to switch these things up and get the people\nGet people work and get their bodies work in the right way and then when you lose the weight and your body's bouncing the health problems start to go away as well so\nIt's really uh it's all it's all about getting that weight off it's all about getting healthier\nAnd so the number to call for that is one eight five five\nFive and Jay diet twenty five five five six five thirty four thirty eight\nAnd that's the schedule of free go over the system and one of our local five locations in the New York tri state area\nOr the best way to do it I think is to go on line you go to and jade diet dot com and that's normally Ninety nine dollars for only for only twenty seven dollars right now you can come in will do a ... an appointment with us a body composition and now says we're going to look at not just wait\nAre we going to look at body fat percentage were going to look at body water percentage were going to look at your ... your your metabolic cage so you're going to look at your basic metabolic rate and how much your and your daily caloric intake so those two numbers needs to be close to each other\nFor you to be able to lose way we've got people routinely coming in and they're burning off let's say two thousand calories a day but their bodies function which are taken in three thousand ...\nYou know plus they're reading on the program so losing one pound to lose ... pounds thirty five hundred calories we routinely see people losing a pound a day plus or eat it so we're talking about the body burning anywhere from four thousand around four thousand calories a\nDay minimally a ... to to to lose the weight uh so you're not you we re route where your body's basically using for fuel your body's just using your own toxic fat for fuel so to\nTo get that done it said five five five and jade diet one eighty five five five six five thirty four thirty eight uh that's good to schedule an appointment a for free\nGo over one of our officers now when you're calling and you're talking on the folks at the at the call center there they're just an appointment they're set appointments right so they don't have all the answers to your questions I can guarantee that uh that's why we were moving all the ... just come in and get a check up get a get a check up and all that\nUh and so just don't get mad at those people have people yelling at him all the time all the time uh and so\nJust come in and and and uh and the U.S\nAre there and uh but you can also go on line A N J died dot com and that's for only twenty seven dollars normally signing nine dollars only twenty seven dollars\nOr you can um come into the office will do an appointment with one of ... with one of us\nAre you also will do a body composition analysis will take a look at your weight will take a look your body fat percentage your body water percentage of visceral fat rating your metabolic cage basic metabolic rate daily caloric intake we're looking at a bunch of different things\nA body of water so important it should be closer to sixty percent\nOr if you're in the forties you can't lose weight and you're wondering why and you're walking around with a bottle of water all the time to drink and a hundred ounces of water and you still can't lose weight\nI guarantee your body isn't absorbing it the right way you have a mineral or electric light imbalance we see these imbalances with things like yo yo dieting you'll see it with digestive issues or you'll see it with certain medications like directs that are used to control blood pressure\nOr because you're overweight or you'll see it with a with a an acid medications a lot of times you'll see it a lot of times with antidepressant medications it's one of the reasons they cause weight gain or and so\nYou know that might be one of the reasons you're having a problem so we take a look at that and then we can personalize the program for you and you could still lose that twenty to forty pounds more than likely you are not going to need the blood pressure medications and some of the other medications as well so we see this all the time we've seen people come off of all types of different things so there's no limit\nTo what the body can do when you get it working helpfully body is a is a wonderful healing organism sometimes it's just had some a lot of barriers that it can't overcome on its own it just needs a little bit of push it needs to a few dominoes to be kind of tilted in knocked down and then the body will do everything on its own after that so\nUh starts and end with the customers ... the personalization of the of the program the by energetic scans\nOr the parents live a sample for that or blood work functional assessment a DNA testing or that shows us to over forty different metabolic factors that we assess or to help you use the tools going like a blueprint going forward on how to not only keep laid off but also had a stays healthy as possible so\nReally easy and J died dot com or when a five five five or ...\nDiet or and wanted to tell you about\nA Sondra are we talking about sleep I guess sleep is some some sort of a lot of people coming in with will sleeping issues and you know I Wonder why people are walking around with trouble to triple ... lattes well sleep eat off ease from God Knows where\nHe just sleep deprivation causes sleep deprivation is having like a to take our stomach you know I Know and that was uncomfortable and one of the most awful things you can have\nYou have a lot so people are coming in I guess they they're sleeping and you know they don't tell them necessarily some sleeping issues it when they come in but uh you know when they come when they're done with the price what's cool about the program like people come in and they're very they're they're very very skeptical but they're even going to lose weight and then they stop focusing on the waiting to start thinking about how their health is improving\nA center came in a thirty nine year old female or she lost ... severe sleeping issues she was she was a having a lot of getting up trouble falling asleep trouble staying asleep waking up early tossing and turning just having a ton of issues sleeping\nA and a lot of times it's been a dream no adrenal issue with cortisol levels and and things like that and you know the quarter solo so important uh they're supposed to you know they're supposed to cortisol is grades it's a\nIt's produced by the adrenal glands and and so it's supposed to during the day help you burn fat and the night help you sleep and if your adrenal exhaustion issues a lot of time just to the opposite you can't lose you can't burn fat and you can't sleep\nOr and so she came and she lost a twenty four pounds in forty days so you know ... you know great usually see twenty five to to thirty five with women so she was just a little bit on to that but what's great about it is that she ... she says that after the first seven to ten days at a program she's basically been sleeping like a rock\nFalling asleep eleven o'clock she goes to bed will on weight syrup it's seven she says she doesn't even realize she's asleep anymore she's just kind of goes to bed wakes up boom rich already started day\nRested feeling great no crashes in the three o'clock in the in the afternoon or much less need for coffee in the afternoon which is great which is going to help her sleep say see when you get this thing going in one direction it's going to stay going in one direction [noise] I'm\nTwenty four pounds sleep in like a rock she came in we did ... saliva sample or a ... blood work functional assessment we gave her a hormone support type of family support we also gave her dream do support um got they've got the body work in the right way and uh now we've got the results that we say\nIt's not surprising either right around that age right around the age of thirty nine forty I hear more and more of that ad right between the ages of like thirty nine and forty one I'm a lot of things change in the women's um\nBody yeah ... and cycle right and so it's really it's interesting that every ten years right away ... I think that it's interesting that um you know you brought that up a speaking of at the health benefits so we've had this happen a bunch of times in our office but this just recently happened again\nUh Michelle I'm who am I Believe she's in her mid thirties and she lost eighty pounds she did to round yeah I mean really really a lot of weight eighty pounds ... pounds well what happened was um she had some trouble getting pregnant with her first child and so get a lot of\nYou know um hormone therapy type staff and ... and ... and\nAt ... and all these other things and all of these drugs are really am known for and they'll put on weight I'll put that tell us a ton of weight on yam white him and really just create all sorts of floating in the body and um all sorts of very unpleasant things but you know she got a baby out of it which is really a great positive because of that\nAnd she had gained not only a bunch of weight before she got pregnant but also while she was pregnant and then afterwards really hard hard time taking it off so then she tried to get pregnant again and again more hormones and more and you know are these procedures and unfortunately her second time was not as successful as her first\nBut she was about eighty pounds heavier than she had started out before so she came to us she did to a forty days around which basically means she went pound for pound and both of them um and that's very and\nKnow it it's common because this was not her regular weight right this is wait put on with your mind right so that's why she went pound for pound 'cause nobody really needed it really needed to get rid of all it's great\nSo Shankar pound for pound a pound a day for a man is impressive pound for pound packs a day for a woman his job search\nWe had a number of nearly ... ... so anyway\nSo she comes and she comes and um and she says she goes you guys wouldn't believe she came in for ... saliva test I'm just one after the program and she says you wouldn't believe what I have to tell you she says\nPregnant oh no hormones great\n... no ... no not paying and she says I guess\nMy body got rid of all the talk sense of all the extra hormones I dropped all this way\nShe says and now it's a really great story but you know we've had this happen at you know how many times I Would say yeah half a dozen two dozen times where um you know but she by the way completely didn't expect that I mean her her her and her husband\nFully like just you know we're settled with one child and happy and the baby healthy and so now she's about to have a second\nOne and she said I Can't believe I'm going to have to lose weight again but you know what I think it's going to happen to be honest with you is ... now they're not exactly regulator bodies more regularly or probably gain she'll probably ... has not\nGained a ton of layer already and she even said that with that with the first baby she had gained so much during the first couple of weeks and kept gaining and she said with this one she feels completely different she feels so much healthier and really\nFeels ... not as much knowledge that during the ... really she says it's just a whole different experience for her she feels like herself and it's really great and congratulations to her and uh you know looking forward to meeting that healthy baby\nYeah that's that's awesome we had a chill off so I had a somebody came in was telling me the same thing\nUh Joe came in and she's thirty two years old she hasn't had a a regular cycle in years she says it was she would come and go heavy bleeding for days on end and it wouldn't then\nUh it would go for weeks than it would stop for months and completely inconsistent ah and she came in and I'm similar situation you know she said that it it then the ... cycle totally stopped\nShe's down Seventeen pounds a twenty two days\nWhich is great uh and the cycle shows is it ... it seemed like she was regulating weather cycle she hadn't had it became in the beginning a couple of days no issues with it no pain nothing like that no no no I'm Serious symptoms that way may seem like that was regulated as well so\nSo she did the program for thirty days stopped the program two weeks short before a vacation to get her little ... to get the ... a couple of days and then she came back in and to and she did another twenty days of the programs to set a total of Fifteen days are and what should the cool\nThing is she was away so she stopped the programs to thirty days or lost a bunch of weight\nLoss of twenty five or thirty pounds or something like that and so in the thirty days went away on vacation for for ten to fourteen days\nAnd days and put any of the weight back on all while on vacation which is awesome and then she came back and did another Twenty one days of the program so basically she had fifty days at a program and lost so fifty six pounds total in the fifty days\nThat's pretty impressive yeah that's great to vacation in ...\nIn the middle said you must you must have customize that one for her\nBut yeah we have to have it a little bit of time so she had a she says you know she had a vacation plans she had been away and look I'm not going to tell somebody not to go on vacation so we just customized before we played with it a little bit did it the right way um and what's great is she no more thyroid meds\nAre no more no more sugar medications a siren levels are normal so she doesn't need that ... to ... medications anymore or and when she came in we we were able to do we did the herring saliva\nBy energetic scans gave her a hormone support gave her thyroid support she needed bankers support also\nAnd she lost she lost that way or the DNA we're going to do the DNA is going to be used to also to help keep the weight off to keep her ... to keep her as\nAs healthy as possible uh and you know when your thyroid ... you know it's really important when you're talking about people that are coming in LA Times with mineral imbalances and and things like that\nUh that affects the thyroid a lot the thyroid really that I ... got to get by with sodium to get into the cells of the thyroid a T free to even work so that's why you know if people have a sluggish thyroid a lotta times you'll see weight gain and the problem might not even be with a thyroid problem might be but the fact that your body's not is has a mineral imbalance in the and the uh\nThe the the ... dying may not be with you get into the cello the thyroid gland so you know that conversion the tea forty three ah is really get that that that sort of the the gas pedal to their metabolism so to speak\nAnd if that's not happened the right way so if you're if you're having a hard time losing weight you have a mineral imbalance unlock trade imbalance\nA meeting your body isn't absorbing water properly before because of that you'll be affected on the weight loss ... end of it and now if you're if let's say the thyroid if you've got fired issues\nAnd you're not be able to lose way a lot of times we'll see the thyroid not being able to get to even the chemicals the minerals into the thyroid to get the the whole process going so that'll slow it down also so it's all important your body is just the the ... an amazing amazing mechanism but unfortunately here and there will see\nA few issues come up a few imbalances come up and that's all it takes really is a few imbalances in getting it going\nThe wrong way and you're going to stay going the right or wrong way and then conversely speaking you got to move in the right way it's just the body heal so great on its own then once you get it here on the right way you're going to be able to keep it going that way and and and get on the road to help them stay on the road health so\nReally the one eight five five five and Jay diet a one eight five five five six five thirty four three thirty eight that the schedule a free go over and one of our offices and the New York tri state area uh the easiest way I think is an J died dot com\nOr Ninety nine dollars normally but now the twenty it's only twenty seven dollars right now with the radio listener you go on make an

ready body fat percentage down in twenty three days from thirty percent or twenty six great muscle mass went from twenty percent to thirty percent\nCool water went from fifty six percent to fifty nine percent which the ideal numbers that sixty five and his blood sugar used to be a hundred and Seventy in the mornings which is why his doctor put him on your met foreman clearly\nThe empty stopped his medications because now he's at Ninety two every morning correct those are pretty cool numbers right early thirties this guy is I cannot imagine and about what the body to coming up the body fat went from thirty percent or twenty six percent tremendous tremendous right through twenty three days or ... right so you're he basically replaced water\n... percent about what was right body fat he replaced it with two percent body mass and my muscle mass excuse me and a two percent or more than two percent water so really that's exactly how those numbers are supposed to work\nThat's exactly

A. H. total abdominal hysterectomy\nAnd shed no additional therapy after that ... H abdominal hysterectomy and then two and a half years ago the cancer occurred in The Vagina which is a common place for individual cancers to recover you can say maybe the cells just\nCame down the uterus came down the cervix into The Vagina so two years ago this is now\nTwelve years after the uterus was removed shut\nVegetable bleeding again in a large masters offered standard treatment which she declined the mass was so big it was felt to be in upper bowl was more than six centimeters almost the size of a woman's fist\nAnd then it's been two years is bleeding she has pains as low abdominal mass is given pain medicine she had a CAT scan ALS roses on\nPennsylvania and she has an increasing abdominal pelvic mass she came to us and wanted treatment and we've offered treatment to her\nAnd well she wanted a new scan and get her insurance and all kinds of issues and that's the work that we do we able to treat of ... and Patrick and treat cancer\nAny where most anywhere in the body that's the beauty of our work our work is not invasive with invisible beams of radio surgery so we avoid the cutting and the bleeding obviously that remove all the uterus didn't solve the\nUterine cancer problem and this woman and we're seeing a whole series of cases where the surgery just doesn't solve the problem\nSometimes the surgery like in the man with a tongue cancer creates a lot of problems so we're here to try to remedy that we're here to offer a second opinions have patients one obviously for a second opinions patients need to come in\nTo our office we don't do it on the phone don't do it on the radio because so often we learn so\nMuch more about the patient usually than the patient and their family know themselves that's why it's so important for us to see a patient sit down go over the facts examining the patient and then make\nAll the options available to the patient patient often as many choices and the patient go to the side what kind of treatment a patient once we don't tell people what to want we only tell people what the options are that's really\nWe think the best way to be another woman who came in just before we finished up this week the week uh fifty five year old woman should come and previously with her boyfriend has a strong family history\nOf breast cancer and now I'm trying to kind of ... years fourteen years ago showed a mess in the armpit on the left side she went to a super duper big hospitals super famous they remove the lump of cancer\nAnd ah the search and told the patient he got all the cancer out so when she was told they got all the cancer out she didn't get the extra treatment that would have\nHelped her prevent recurrence of the cancer so again that's one issue with communication where surgeons saying things that is not exactly true if he got all the cancer out from this woman's breast cancer what number of come back well the cancer came back and they came back with a vengeance\nAnd she suffered now for fourteen years fourteen years and she was first diagnosed\nShe also has as much as lung disease and she has congestive heart failure and a heart defect well she had a second biopsy of her breasts that was ten years ago the super duper big place had and still had no treatment and then\nFour years ago had another biopsy and that was still you wonder why are they doing all these biopsies they knew that shit biopsy proven breast cancer this is four biopsies for the breast\nSometimes it seems like hospitals are just doing things to doing things that don't really help how does a mother biopsy help and a woman we already know she had breast cancer she said no treatment so there is no issue if you have a cancer and you have a biopsy\nAnd you have no treatment than you still have the cancer and yet these hospitals kept on doing biopsies she had a total of four biopsies and then she had a PET scan seven months before she came to me and that showed only disease and the left breast and she was having severe pain she was on\n... which is a narcotic is on sub lingo fences all under the under the tongue and tons of all through the skin and Percocet pills as a cottage ... also shows obviously having lots and lots of pain\nIn the left breast area the breast was gone that cancer aid through the breast and it was bloody mess in fact that an eye exam enter and shit mark distortion of the breast pretty much the breast was all gone the cancer right through the breast and the whole area was rather than flame to thicken the integrated\nWith bleeding and pause\nAnd that's how we found her and she came to us and we see so many women with breast cancer some of the early ...\nThis cancer of the little nudge all you could never imagine his cancer and some with fun getting breast cancer like this woman or even worse and why do so many women come to us with breast cancer well we've been a strong advocate for breast cancer treatment for decades when I first came to New York from Harvard\nAt the big hospitals Ninety seven percent of women are getting mastectomies were losing their breasts at the big hospitals still many do today in my practice Ninety percent of women keep their breast still due to the\nSo the difference in mentality the women were the same but sometimes as surgeons and doctors and hospitals seem to want to do the maximum cutting whereas with us we're trying to preserve a person's body man woman or child to keep the body and tack number possible to\nTry to avoid radical surgery or modified radical surgery and so have a strong\nPresence and then the strong voice for women to examine their own breast to get mammograms to get treatment that is keeping the body intact that that's the work that we do this woman had our treatment I can tell you that she was treated two years ago and she's in remission she's had followed\nPET scans and physical exam and all that fun getting leading mess in the breast is now gone and the skin is healed up and she's benefitted tremendously from our achievement she wanted our treatment only know came mono hormones our treatment only\nAnd with our treatment the breast of sealed up the mess is gone the pet scan so
