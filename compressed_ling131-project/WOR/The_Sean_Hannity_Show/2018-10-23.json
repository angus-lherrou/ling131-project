between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation and Cory Booker would be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband would be having an FBI investigation\nAnd Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life but\nThey're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs the caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on parallel economic success\nFourteen state record for states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor it in I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican then that stupid the party leader so stupid you know but the man on the street they're able to see this process it they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that this a caravan is not simply a random occurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly deciding to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for better jobs they can see the orchestrated\nAnd some people are going to vote the party regarding this but the others say listen I'm tired of this because out of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left and the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I am the lady so you know they said well we don't like\nThat some of the behavior the president during the campaign but you say they have it to another level and you're you're propagating\nYou're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at that picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty six team was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million Moran poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama said we're never coming back\nWhile the president didn't get credit when you break down votes demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus by night and there are a lot of ... and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is going is not what they told us that waking up and you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating\nAt twenty or thirty percent to the fifty six six six percent believe me his message just rent Kareem tell him as a message with amazing the black community I come\nFrom a traditional democratic family years voted party forever blacked it in my family and our sphere are now so ... to it that they're either going to not vote at all which is which is really up for\nWhat we're doing with the conservative movement or\nThey're going to vote with us because they're starting to see that this is a charade here you know the media constantly but right and President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN blacks used to go and get their news from CNN their politics from CNN and MSNBC they're starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we've got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey what's going on how's it going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular side he's going to get on the black vote than any other Republican president\nI'll throw this day but if if we all believe in in God the father Jesus is okay and I think all of us here do\nIf we believe that that we all believe one thing and that predicated on that he created every man woman and child on this earth we agree with that right okay yeah so in that sense where\nBrothers and sisters we're all Americans to right and if we really believe that in every human soul God put some talent some ability\nAnd our goal is to to create an environment where that that talent that natural talent flourishes\nThe word education from the Latin is in ... to bring forth from within\nThat tells you that God put their our job is to put enough sunlight and water on something make it grow and help people and that's what I see Trump's doing and it's and it's now hitting the forgotten men and women David that's a great story of the two years at Trump so far\n[noise] yeah yes and and we want to get that what Trump is trying to do when he says I Want to make America great again it means to restore its founding principles is Judeo Christian founding principles which is based on the idea that we're all created in God's image and that's why we had an alien Abul lights it flows from that\nBut I think the leftist authoritarian by nature their economic coercion can lead to political coercion and that's where they are and I I think the left as losing it because they don't have any ideas that worked and I don't have any proposal so they're frustrated and they resort\nTo identity politics and changing the rules and this identity politics dividing people on the basis of race and gender\nIs every four to four years at the same thing rich versus poor versus young black versus white a rat race a sexist massage in this Tacoma ...
