right thing to do um but with that said um now it is a to point raised two polls I've looked at\nOne with mansion up and the other with his opponent the attorney general of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey up and that means that West Virginia is now in play that means that Joe Manchin can be replaced\nA joining us now is the attorney general from the great state of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey sir congratulations seems to be a very big comeback I'm early polls didn't look good in the beginning but I guess maybe we're getting more accurate polling as we get closer to a election day\nWell Shawn thanks so much for having me on and\nI think what you're seeing in West Virginia is that voters are really focusing on\nThe differences between the candidates as you can see from my ads I'm a conservative fighter will help advance the Trump jobs agenda and mansions or dishonest Washington liberal the more and more people drilled down on mansions record he's starting to lose support so we feel very good\nAnd we're going to win on election day we just have to keep out working on the way we out\nYou know I was really worried during the Obama years about our friends in West Virginia because of the the burdensome regulation driving coal miners out of business you know it's one of our our best resources and we have clean coal and we have\nYou know people brave enough to go in the minds I have great admiration for anybody that does that because frankly you know you go so deep into the ground and it's dangerous work but it's but energy in the life a lot of our economy and\nOnce Donald Trump got elected which by the way would have never happened to Joe Manchin out his way 'cause he supported Hillary Clinton um you know look at what happened at the state of West Virginia all those coal mining jobs are coming back thank God\nFor well thank goodness for President Trump and I have to tell you I spent a lot of the last six years suing the Obama administration uh Shaun we were the office that took the lead nationally to go against the Obama power plant one that very big victory at the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd you look at Joe mansion Joe Manchin supported Hillary Clinton even after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal on the issue of life on the second amendment\nThere couldn't be a bigger contrast in America between two candidates and the more people are hearing about that the better off we are\nAnd I basically help serve as a bridge to President Trump's really strong policies that West Virginians really appreciate that so that's one of the president's coming very strongly behind me he knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because\nIt's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked at before having you on today uh I meant to actually at one point what percentage of the time does Joe Manchin boat with Chuck

anymore the Sean Hannity show eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number Paul is in Ohio Paul you're on the Sean Hannity show glad you called sir\nYes sir thank you for taking my call what's going on how are you\nA good good first of all want to thank you for your exposure of the left and liberal for you know who they really are and um uh the reason I'm calling today is concerning a repeal and replace Obamacare\nA I Know other stories or you know kind of take the lead now but we really don't hear a whole bunch about a repeal and replace much anymore\nIt was just wondering if you could give us an update about Republicans are doing\nIf we in two weeks to have a ... a more Republican senators which I think is very very possible and west\nVirginia being and plays huge if we can hold on to the house you know it doesn't matter what the margin of we hold on which is far more difficult I'm worried more about the house races then the Senate races\nIf we can get those two victories I guarantee you that Obamacare will be repealed and replaced and then we're going to have and by the way pre existing conditions the big lie that's being told all over the country or the Republican bill dealt with pre existing conditions nobody's going to be denied coverage because they have a preexisting condition but\nYou know innovative solutions like we've been talking about I've been able to get Dr Josh amber atlas MD in front of a lot of politicians that all love the paradigm he's created in Wichita\nHe's duplicated in and close to five hundred cities now and that is fifty bucks a month unlimited concierge care for adults Ninety five percent productions in in pharmaceuticals\nOr even breast cancer medicine certain medicines he's getting for six bucks a treatment for people and you couple that with catastrophic care which is very inexpensive in case you have a heart attack in cancer or a bad car accident\nAnd you have the best concierge charity ever dreamed up twenty four hour access to a doctor or your primary care doctor you get your check\nUps every year you got great reduction and pharmaceuticals and if something really really bad happens you have the hospital care at a very reduced rate because it's it's catastrophic it's only for the worst case scenario and it's much less expensive so I think all of that health savings accounts there all the table and I'd love to see that for every American imagine\nConcierge blue ... medical treatment for every American we can do that but it's not going to happen top down from the government you know or if you block grant the money to the states where you have you know fifty states have been invasion\nLet me tell you what's going to rise to the top those they're going to want to turn over every nickel in those states to make it work for the people of those states or they're not going to be in power and I think that is far more economically efficient so there are a lot of good ideas I was disappointed with the Republicans last time we know John McCain had a chance to to fix this and decided against it last minute\nBut does the president's not done the individual mandate is done thankfully things to the tax bill that was passed\nUm but we've got a lot more work to do on an absolutely just like you need to fund the border wall that's also something that'll get done if we hold the house and Senate in in twelve days are but I'm focused on these house races all say it again\nEvery single house race matters some more important than others we put up the most important on my website ... dot com\nAnd the top races that are going to tip the balance of power in the house of representatives but you know if you don't get out and vote in every it we have four hundred and thirty five house races in play here even if you think your guy said go vote even if your guys behind go vote\nDon't take don't leave it to chance Democrats are going to come out as soon as we have history working against us\nBut I Do believe that we can pick up the Senate seats look I think we can win Florida we're a little behind them Florida with Nelson and with the Centers for governor Marsha Blackburn who's going to join us later she can and should win Tennessee Claire McCaskill should lose to Josh Hawley a Dean Heller needs to hang on in about\nA we definitely need more than ...

Sharif gesture should face and focus Democrat Party and say oh well that ends will justify whatever means sit where we're using and people are out and how they are conducting get the south\nSaw the British ... first reaction to the tape of a his staff calling people of the people of Tennessee ignorant and by the way Tennessee happens to be one of my favorite\nBill like right at the top three cities in the country and I\nWell that's because they all they love you in Nashville in Tennessee you\nWell I mean even the guy was Ninety miles south of Nashville are just off a sixty drive and I used to go up to Nashville all the time I ... I Love music city and I love the people of Nashville and I've got to imagine they were\nDid a and a little bit shocked that somebody would be that duplicitous behind the scenes and then when he he said well those are just college kids volunteers and we find out no that's his full time staff are I'm sure that uh he was embarrassed again\nI'm certain that they should have been embarrassed whether or not but of course he didn't they start saying\nWell let's see opponent it was our campaign my campaign to put somebody in there which is not just as a project maritime project they started saying well all these other excuses but to ... they got caught and they got caught saying we made this decision\nBecause we want to go fool people about where he is don't worry he's got to be a good kept crap when he gets there\nSo you got to say this that and the other in order to get him there and it's\nLike as a parent I mean when your kids do something wrong my kids to do something wrong\nWhich rarely happens are kidding but you know what it's not I'm I'm never is mad at what they did but if they try to lie to me about it then they're in big trouble\nNot a little trouble I don't care what it is I can deal with the mistake I Can't deal with you lying to me in looking in my eyes and just outright lying to me and my line to my kids is\nYou know I I Am not stupid stop treating me like I Am stupid\nI'm fries it frustrates frustrated dodge swear to God I Swear and when you know darn well they did it that\nWell that is true and in any of our relationships whether it's family members or does that we work with or wearing church organizations which we expect them to tell us the choice to have that integrity to speak\nThe truth and when you don't then it causes are raft and that is what you're seeing with the British and campaign\nAs people are saying look if she didn't mean at all I did you say and what people know about me\nIs that they may not always agreed with me but they are always going to know where I stand and that is has been central to me as a part of my public service and people expect that and I\nKnew a long time so Congress woman and I know you'd make a great senator and I hope the people of Tennessee understand that um what are the issues because the economy's doing very well in Tennessee\nThings are looking up we've had two years of great economic growth since Donald Trump's been president out of the people to Tennessee feel about the president's policies and and the important vote the boats that you will be casting that if you become the next great senator from Tennessee\nIf people are so supportive of president Donald Trump and say look to see his policies succeeded they want to give my senator he's going to be a conservative and it's going to support President Trump and his policies say well look constitutional Supreme Court justices and federal judges\nThey want to keep the tax cuts the economy is so good in Tennessee [noise] it has the fastest growing median household income and the southeast\nAnd saw some battered for you know the fast they deserve a tree\nYes absolutely and I tell you something else building the wall secure that southern border and it was just caravan marching through Guatemala and Mexico people are saying\nLook secure that border theirself rightly or wrongly to come to the United states we've among people to come to the right way respect the rule of law\nYou know what Congress owner that wall was up I'm very concerned because we have to protect our or constitutional republic we've got we're based on the rule of law we have borders sovereignty issues here if\nThey ever get if we had the wall up nobody would be marching they would be following the law and the proper process and necessary betting if they want to come and visit or maybe even come and say we don't care where you come from we just need to know you you are\nSomebody that accepts our values wants to be a part of our family and doesn't\nHave any intentions to cause any harm or doesn't need assistance the minute you get here\n[noise] that's right and then in Paris, Tennessee today and Camden\nAnd I'm telling you shown that is what\nPeople say this is why we need the wall this is why we need to make certain that sanctuary city policies are in that because we want to protect our communities without it every town to border town in every chance a border state and I've been with some of our shares shutting off our mayors\nShutting off our state legislators today and every single one of them's hey Marcia\nWe need to secure
