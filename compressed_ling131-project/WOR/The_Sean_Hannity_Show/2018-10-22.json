Google Plus never amounted to much of anything but they did have some people who signed up and a half million people private information was lost so rather than things that they shut down the platform\nOr not it wasn't on purpose of course but the glitch in their software was there for nearly three years uh nobody's reported being an identity theft victim yet and it may be a matter of time before it's determine whether it be exposed data will be used against somebody but for Google it was enough to shut\nDown Google Plus band is just another example of how much personal data is available online and how hard\nIt is to make sure your data is protected and we we keep circling back to this but folks it really is the case lifelike is the answer to this\nIdentity theft as a crime that most people are unaware when it happened to it can be months before your stolen data is used [noise]\nBut when it is is when having life lock counts because they spotted\nWay ... you become a life like memory you automatically created on line profile based of how you deal on line including your online shopping an activity that profile as a computer algorithm it's not identified to you by name Google or rather the lifelike people can't go figure out what you're doing\nIt it's all with computer numbers and it's it's all encrypted it's just when an aberration happens in your profile that's when the red flags ... go off\nAnd that's when lifelike let you know that there's abnormal activity on your account they ask you if you are not if it's not you didn't they get in gear trying to shut it down\nThey have a restoration team that does nothing but work with you to fix it all and put everything back to normal and they don't stop until that happens\nNow hopefully it's never necessary but if it is there's nobody in life locks league at dealing with this kind of identity threat the new life like plan includes Norton Security they give you that it's a\nIt's a software package that protects your heart where your laptop computer or your uh your desktop or whatever against malware and ransomware now always remember that no one or no one company can prevent all identity theft\nNobody can management and monitor and managing every transaction out there but\nLife flock is in a league alone all by itself in offering\nThe best identity theft protection areas sign up by going online that life lock dot com use my name get ten percent off\nAnd day twenty five dollar Amazon gift card or you can do it by phone eight hundred for forty forty eight thirty three either way lifelike dot com or eight hundred for forty forty eight thirty three and make sure\nYou use my name when you sign up you know I've had a soundbites here I'd have a chance to get to it but CNN and really didn't get a [noise]\nA trick they they play the sound bite me that was an excerpt and trying to make it look like I was up the opinion that whatever happened to them all to show me it was okay because it was a buddy of bin Laden's\nA John came to I I Can't I Can't believe that they left out me saying but none of this about your show he is intended to say he deserves to die don't miss the west\nThat out of the bite they play everything I said up until that\nI was going to share it with you today but it just didn't reach the top of their priorities stack maybe I'll hold onto it till tomorrow it and get it in with whatever\nSomebody has to have much to us to say\nRussia's probably ... be met for\nI'm ... Cox owner of blind store dot com you know I made my life's mission to convince everyday people that measuring it installing custom blinds is one of the easiest do it yourself projects there is not blind stir are consummate blinds are not only easy to install our prices are often less\nThan those off the shelf blinds you'll find it big box retail stores\nAnd now it made it even easier\nCheck out our new no tool cellular shades\nThe first and only shades installed without any screws or tools\nYou heard me right customs shades their insulin without any tools what can be easier with my personal fitter free guarantee I guarantee your bonds will fit their own remake the free of charge you only pay shipping now there's no reason to ever pay a high price professional\nSo it's not the issue they care about it's always about the power and the politics behind it you know Republican bad let's go after them throw the book at them let's know due process for them no presumption of innocence for them\nAnd then you've got a case that allegation made about Cory Booker now over the weekend on top of statements in his own words that he had made some years ago when he was Fifteen\nOr apparently some people are taking that seriously Claire McCaskill's\nHusband being accused of some type of me to issue out there in Missouri and you notice the double standard it's everywhere I'm here's what is anecdotally something that I think should give you a lot of hope um and I don't make predictions I can only tell you this\nHave you on a prediction it's simple Rick Scott is in a very very close tight race in Florida with\nBen Nelson you know but Rick Scott has done a great job for the economy down in Florida and through a great job as a senator but he's also run is you know notoriously close races down in Florida\nFlorida's important Florida I think he won his races by one percentage point each time and and each time he keeps proven the people of Florida that maybe not the best politician with the best gift of gab or ... or but boy when it comes to getting the job done when the people of Florida need Rick Scott he's there for you\nAnd the same with ah we've got infinite whatever reason the media is falling in love with Andrew Gillum down in Florida\nAnd in Iran dissent suffered a great debate last night and he is now fighting to to prevent Florida from getting a forty percent business tax that Gillum would support\nGillum as we use some of the most harsh rhetoric against police that I've ever heard before he's fairly radical in his views he's trying to hide it just like every other Democrat is hiding who they really are they can't be elected by being honest with their constituents in who they are what they believe and what they really want to fight for\nWe saw that with Brett is it and the project berets as tape and the great state of Tennessee anyway you know run the Santa sees in a fight for his life down in Florida we've got Marsha Blackburn who's going to be a fantastic senator from Tennessee but\nYou know for whatever reason Brett us that is out there trying to convince the people of Tennessee that he is something that he is not that he's a moderate liberal and these tapes blew that out of the water as they're calling the people of Tennessee ignorant people in his office and saying that his public position on Brett Kavanaugh\nIs just for show and we saw the same thing in the tapes in Missouri with Claire McCaskill\nYou know we've already found out she was a phony but now we really know she's a phony\nShe goes on a an RV tour of Missouri except she's taking private jets Phillips is an RV tour with with wings unbelievable\nBut some anecdotal evidence now there I think the Kavanaugh hearings I think this caravan is now becoming a massive campaign issue\nAnd just the fact that there's seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border to create some type of confrontation oughta tell Americans what the party of sanctuary cities sanctuary states the party that wants to eliminate eyes open borders means\nWhen you look at the amount of money illegal immigration has cost the American taxpayers it is in the billions and billions and billions of dollars because if you're in this country illegally and you're arrested for something we paid the criminal justice cost\nIf you go to a hospital hospitals not going to not take care of you we pay the health care costs we pay the educational costs when your kids are in school nobody's against illegal immigration\n... nobody's against immigration everyone's against illegal immigration we're saying we have a process\nThat we have sovereignty and we have borders and they deserve to be respected\nAnd what does it say about the people that do go through the process legally improperly that's now coming to the forefront of the president's call for a wall is right sanctuary cities and states are wrong there's been so look at the crimes committed in Texas alone when I was down there for that security briefing with Rick Perry\nI mean the six hundred and forty two thousand Texas alone victims of crimes some very serious including murder\nAnd then it gets downright scary now we have more instances Mitch McConnell over the weekend confronted some guy banging on his table at a restaurant taking his leftovers and throwing them throwing those out the the door of the restaurant now it's almost happening on a daily weekly basis we got a lot of new tape that we're going to play for you\nBut I think the biggest thing that people need to know is Democrats want to stop all progress what do they want to take us back to what we know failed after eight years of Obama\nTheir signature legislation Obamacare\nTheir fundamental promises which was keep your doctor keep your plan pay less millions of Americans lost their doctors plans and are paying in some cases one hundred two hundred and three hundred percent more than they ever paid before for in theory or coverage\nWe have many states where you only have one option one the health care option that's it\nSo it has not worked out well for the American people it was from the beginning it redistribution scam where you're forcing the young and healthy to buy plans they never want needed or desired and forcing them by threat of a fine\nTo literally subsidize the sick the elderly and and the disabled uh Americans when all they really need is a catastrophic plan and one office visit a year or and they catastrophic plan would be like fifty bucks a month and that's for God Forbid you have a bad accident get cancer and heart attack\nBut the anecdotal hope that I'm Talking about is political even says looks like Chuck Schumer his dreams of becoming the Senate majority leader or a evaporating before his eyes\nEven his Democratic colleagues don't think it's going to happen anymore democratic hopes of winning the Senate have faded in the final weeks of the twenty eight to an election with a party now needing to win every one of the more than half a dozen\nCompetitive races to capture control the chamber it's a far cry from pretty much the last year and a half oh we're gonna we're gonna take control of the house and the Senate\nHeidi Heitkamp seat has slipped away it looks like it's going to be Republican pickup Martha mix Sally is going to join us later I mean every day gets worse for Christ in cinema\nI mean there's just an unmitigated disaster for her I mean you know she thinks it's okay for Americans to join up and support it skipped Mitt treason against their country and support the Taliban we've got that\nWe've got her on tape saying that her state of Arizona the people are crazy and it's the ... lab of democracy and then of course you know attacking border patrol people inviting radicals like the lawyer for the blind shake into town\nAnd meanwhile Martha ... Sally twenty eight years of service serving our country six tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan what a comparison\nSo now we have ... Democrats are urging caution on the blue wave to temper expectations new Fox\nAnd they come down to this is this is extraordinarily dangerous for the country here but I Am telling you\nPolitically the American people fundamentally this white Kavanaugh mattered they believe in the in the core values that this country was built on of due process and presumption of innocence they also believe that we are a nation of laws otherwise why have the\nAnd Americans in thing to believe don't like the idea that people think they can march right across the border into our country we don't know who they are we don't know where they came from in some cases most cases we don't know what their intentions are\nNow the president has already said we're going to begin cutting off substantially or substantially reducing foreign aid for Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nAnd he says every time you see people illegally coming are attempting to come into the country blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic laws and that would mean building the wall that he wanted to build that we can get done\nBy the president just spoke out about this will play it when we come back we have a lot to get to more than ... much more straight ahead [noise]\n\nThe voice of New York [noise]\nSeven ten W O are busy and cloudy at three thirty good afternoon\nI'm ... late in a new poll is good news for President Trump's ahead of the midterms that caravan of migrants continues to make their way towards the U.S today it's been a week since Jamie closest friends and family last saw the Thirteen year old Wisconsin girl and investigators say they're no closer to finding our ...

that this new way above\nA caravan or is this comprised quote a mostly young men who appear able bodied and could easily fend for themselves back in their home countries video footage posted by Telemundo news shows hundreds of the migrants\nYou know by a chain link fence said the Mexico Guatemala border some of the men scaling the fence others violently shaking it causing the barrier to break apart and as the gap in the fence white and then of course a lot of the men from that moment we're able to cross into Mexico\nAnd this is now a confrontation that is coming to the southern border of the usa I've been down to this border what twelve Thirteen so why why ever many times I have seen it it's wide open\nWhat are we gonna what's gonna happen if we have to send our troops to the border what kind of crisis is going to be precipitated because Mexico won't do their job and now according to some reports is even helping the caravan ... make their way to our southern border\nPresident has also said that Guatemala Honduras El Salvador they're not doing the job stopping people from leaving their country and coming to the U.S illegally that is now but down the process of cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid that we give it to them\nBut the president's also right in that every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming into the country you can blame the Democrats\n... they're the ones that love these policies they're the ones that have been saying they want to eliminate ice they're the ones that say they won't open borders they're the ones that keep saying they want amnesty\nThey're the ones that like sanctuary states sanctuary cities and sanctuary policies that allow even criminal aliens to come into this country illegally\nWe have one case this was a out there well you know it just I mean it's basically a national emergency if you look at it\nYou have a Spanish language reporter who spent weeks embedded with the migrant caravan and a report friday said that they met people from ... dash\nJoining the people from Guatemala into Mexico Univision corresponded Francisco Santa Ana reported that the bridge separating ... while the mullah and Mexico the bridge has been packed with thousands of migrants demanding access to Mexico this was going back to friday the ultimate goal crossing into the U.S illegally\nShe writes the Bangladeshis were detained and an immigration facility though it's not clear what happened to them after their detention the borders in Central America not as strong as the U.S which makes it impossible for people from Panama and Ecuador to cross easily\nA said Anna on Univision they cross from Costa Rica way to go through Guatemala and eventually make it in our country\nAnd yesterday they were traveling through Guatemala we noticed people from El Salvador even people from Bangladesh can you imagine what they had to do to get here they infiltrated themselves in the caravan and tried to cross with the crowd that would have been benefitted them greatly\nUm so you've got the care of and continuing their march now a couple of other things that you've got to

D. and you've seen your doctor about the little blue pill you know it can be expensive and seeing the doctor and waiting at the pharmacy can be a hassle what if I told you that a certain little blue pill just came off patent December eleventh and that's the active ingredient that's in the little blue pill is now available and generic\n\nGetting sicker every day I mean notice the same thing the Maxine Waters\nYou know you get a crowded you follow these people and to grocery stores in department stores and gas stations and you tell them we don't want them here anywhere anymore you know telling Henry Kissinger leave the country Mitch McConnell not only did they tell Mitch McConnell to leave the country\nBut then they're talking about the guy smashed literally ripped\nHis leftovers I guess just maybe it's taken a meal home to somebody else and throws it outside the restaurant door banging on the guy's table somebody's going to get killed here you watch somebody is or hurt severely it it's going to happen then nobody on the left ever\nCan critique their own side for the rhetoric they're using Anthony Scaramucci is with us I just finished cover to cover his ... brand new book uh and it's phenomenal and it's the Inside Story about Donald Trump it's called Trump the blue collar president\nAnd held billionaire living on Fifth Avenue identified the struggle a blue collar Americans that won the presidency and all those are the forgotten men and the forgotten women in this country and I don't think they're liking this mob mentality I don't think they like to weigh judge Kavanaugh was treated much\nAnd I don't think they like watching this caravan of thousands marching towards our border\nI mean they they literally are mishandling everything and so we're with what's happening is uh the the president has almost like this light showing like you know you and I grew up on Long Island in the summer or parents would hang up that insect light\nWell the president has that the Trump Twitter\nInsect light and they're all going towards the late in their vaporizing a Senator Warren she's got to get a DNA test she's less of a Native American than you or me into the vapors Asian big caravan issue the way they're handling the care of an issue it's a galvanizing his base that Kavanaugh's thing was absolutely ridiculous they were making up\nOne story after the next they figured okay\nMe too movement seems to work there is no due process and the meat you know\nLet's take this guy that did very well credentialed judge\nOr he's got an impeccable adult life let's try to destroy him\nGoing back to Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen eighty two and so again right into the Trump Twitter\nInsect vaporize or so so for me I'm enjoying this the polls are tightening up and ah the president's base is actually going to turn out much higher percentages and people predicted in so\nOnce again he's going to defy logic here I think we are very good chance to possibly ah keep the house we're certainly going to gain seats in the Senate and it couldn't happen without the energy and the for tutors for a President Trump\nWell if they do when I say this he's carrying a lot of these people on his back but\nKnow what if you like Nancy Pelosi the dangers are what we're gonna have endless investigation higher taxes keep Obamacare open borders\nAnd the president is is battling back on all these fronts in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says there or not we're not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S\nNow we will begin cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid we routinely give them an Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people they legally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally\nThinking blame the Democrats were not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix it with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us but\nBut it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that it's not just all it is is he or she is recognizing with a legendary built for even one set about any country\nIf you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your Puerto Rico's free market forces dictate that people will cross over that quarter\nTo participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states so they don't get\nA you know ... on on promoting my my uh my book that today in the last couple of days mom a lot of left leaning shows and they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's response all\nYou want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents and democratic elected officials that of voters in the last I don't understand why just enforcing those laws\nHave everybody ... charm ... will get their ... so\nWhy don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago by every single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created\nThe number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more\nBottom the bottom ten percent of the society shut the wages are up\nI mean ... percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months but as a direct result of the president's policies but also the fact that he cut the slack at the border and so it made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving lower middle class families shot you know kept reliving wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us author of the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot comments on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons so it was either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get on each call them the blue collar billionaire yeah and I said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put in President he was gay he resonates with these people for a reason\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years\nHave us a scenario that is not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any better than in your mouth\nActually weren't so mean after all when people came on hard times they would work with people and help people\nThat's absolutely true story that's actually care and want a family in thirty forty your friends and stuff and I wanted to relate a story you know an auto it quickly\nFred Trump showing up to collect rent with his twenty six year old son Donald J truck in and they're walking through the uh the garden apartments knocking on doors\nCarolina family cannot pay the rent the father as lost the job he's a blue collar worker Fred and it's sort of looking at um saying okay no problem\nThere very often guy let's wait a month let's see what happens I suspect you'll get a job\nAnd behold a sixty short days later a he gets a job pays the rent that he was owed a and it's just a wonderful story about their family never\nGoing to be told by the mainstream media\nAbove people talk about what does the president of compassion for these people does the president that after the the answer is yes she learned at the uh riding shotgun with his father was he was either building these buildings helping to build buildings are\nCollecting rent for blue collar people that were living Sean so so I wanted I get a ton of research on the book\nI wanted to tell the story arc of Trump's family which is a great American success in many ways the additive family is also an American success story the arts are different and the generational transfers are different uh put their goal part of America that both parties fabric of America\nYou know the the generations that built this country that none of your Scaramucci Hannity Trump it doesn't matter but the generations of built these this country are just amazing people the immigrants that built this country by grandparents all for coming from Ireland\nUh anyway the book is called the Trump the blue collar president Anthony Scaramucci it's up on
