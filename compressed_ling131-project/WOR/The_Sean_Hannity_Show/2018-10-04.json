Ramirez the New York times wouldn't even public publish it because they discovered nobody that corroborate her story number one\nNumber two or own words that she was ... they'd quickly had gaps in her memory and the fact that we now know that you know so many different things that we didn't know before and that Mrs Ramirez was actually out there soliciting information from her fellow yo classmates the New York times reported that because she quote couldn't remember sitting\nIn the case of Julie sweat Nick we saw her backtrack dramatically from her original story and her claim that judge Kavanaugh was a serial\nDrug or and rapists of teenage girls would give me the evidence in cooperation to any of these women story that's what I Want from you Danielle and don't duck and don't dodging don't hem and haw that I'm asking a tough question give me any cooperation you have\nI don't hit the cooperation because I'm not do and I and I'm not the one who was investigating that's right and we talked about this last week\nWait a minute what everybody's talking and\nIt was a full and fair and ... get married at twenty cooperating witnesses to the I Know and in the FBI it\nSkews I mean every main person that was mentioned in the case of professor Ford and the case of missed for me or as the New York times tried to corroborated they spent an entire week interviewed dozens of people\nAnd then she herself was calling around to other yell classmate saying I don't I don't remember do you remember I'm not sure if it was him that exposed himself and then we all watched Julie sweat Nick\nAlter shift and backtrack from her original allegation which was gang raping and systematic drug gang of women so\nCould you have any cooperation for any of these incidents at all\nI'm not getting any suggestion that I don't expect the ... and I did\nBut I Know you're following you can't find any cooperation either can you as a matter of fact we're getting just the opposite of corroboration people are saying those they don't recall those stories at all that it or that to happen that way at all\nSo the judges are college roommate and being on at the last twenty four hours a day looking about uh the judges drinking oughta honestly I I think this is horrendous for shy and the idea\nOf not answering my question I'm asking you if the people make serious claims allegations on a serious real\nTopic because there are real evil horrible ... predators in this world and they mentioned that there are specific people have you interview them that they're going to tell you my story is true and it turns out to be the opposite don't you believe in the presumption of innocence Danielle McLaughlin yes or no\nOf course I Do short timeline get something\nOf course I Believe and the and the and the presumption of innocence but I also have to leave that the FBI should've been allowed to do a full and fair investigation and that is why you're going to see on the left a huge ... and I understand that this is energizing the G ... hey\nI'm not talking point what I was on a second once you interview looking in the case of professor Ford before people she identified were at the party and none of the four have any recollection of the event and the one eye witness says it didn't happen\nWhat else are they supposed to do because we don't know where it happened we don't know when it happened we don't know the location she doesn't know how she got there got home from their what else to the FBI to do that already given sworn statements under the penalty of a felony\nAnd all they did as reiterate those statements that the FBI what else could they possibly do Danielle in that case\nAnd being on the opposite side of it ... at the FBI just\nJust not that was can they pass certainly do knowing the facts as we know that we don't know where we don't know when we don't know huh\nOK okay she thinks the fact that she doesn't run into where I where and when exactly it's not ...\nDon't you now you're you're trying to watch your training ... look follow the bouncing ball about ...\nIf there's four people that were eyewitnesses but we don't know where we don't know when we don't know how she got she got home\nWe don't even know the house but you mentioned four people were there they for people under penalty of fellow they all said that didn't happen the way she said\nOne witness or didn't happen and my question is what the FBI do if they don't know the location that can't be looking parenthetically for anything quick break we'll come back more with Jonathan Gillum and Daniel McLaughlin here on the Sean Hannity show\nHey I Want to talk about your home security protecting your family that simply St Paul security the best own security system on the market

grader\nSean Hannity show sauce\n[noise]\nDon't know anything and so as you go out in a perimeter away from the people who the victim says was was there and you interview other people that may have heard somebody say something or hurt here say it becomes here say you know that from being in court that\nWhen you have a just eight minutes with no corroborating evidence that case quickly falls to the side\nAnd I certainly agree with Jonathan totally and the problem is that and then also the fact that the FBI is being used outside of their authority for political matter and that scares me as a former FBI agent that scares me because that is the that's the thing that totalitarian I'm a governments do\nAgree I think that one thing that's important to got to this was a standard here this is not\nA criminal investigation uh this is an investigation and to conduct that may or may not have bearing on way to get a lifetime appointment um and I understand and I agree that this is an extremely political an extremely emotional and I think that's partly because\n... is an important question do you have any corroborating witness for\nAny corroborating evidence at all you can say right now\nAnd it's an on the question that has an unseen\nReally I got an unfair question Jonathan I don't think it's unfair to them\nWell I think when we say fair or unfair I think what it is I Want you to make question I'll tell you why didn't you know because\nAgain angry and people are saying I Believe her I Believe him but in this case there's just no other witnesses there is no other evidence and so when you're asked if you feel this passionate about something and somebody says what other information do you have that courage intimate question because\nThere is not and the FBI who was secrete it into this investigation has come up with non either and I can guarantee you if anybody would have earned could or it would be them\nRight and on his side there is no corroborate evidence as to where the judge was on any given day with the he was there and I think I think people are emotional for for ...\nAnybody actually has a copy of is summer calendar that year but we don't have an exact day anyway so right right and you know what you're saying is that you know he has to prove his innocence or is he innocent before proven they ... they haven't been proven guilty\nWhat what do you believe in is innocent until proven guilty again this is so he hasn't been proven guilty and you know has he he has not been proven guilty and it's gone on a long time\nNot to a legal standard that would be required in what ... not that I don't believe that at the end if yeah and I write\nThank you both we appreciate it eight hundred ... all one Sean toll free telephone number final our free for all

welcome to the Sean Hannity show\nThanks Sean I grew up and spent most of my life in Arizona where my family's still it and I'm I'm actually a distant relative of Jeff Flake and I do think he is a decent man and I think he has a\nA good heart but I really feel like he's getting played here by the Democrats and the left and I just really really hope that uh that he'll make the right decision tomorrow or Saturday it sounds sounds like\nAfter his comments today that that's more likely but uh it's just you know I I Know there's a reason he's not running for reelection and it's just hard to see a secret people leave to Washington and come back a few years later and not be able to really recognize that I feel like that happened with McCain and I feel like it's kind of happening with just as well\nI think the most shocking statement that he made was on sixty minutes when he when he actually admitted\nWhen asked if he would be voting this way if he had to face the voters he had an absolutely not um and I'm like oh so you're you're only stand on your principles when\nWhen you have to face the voters but that's not how you really feel it really sums up how I view a lot of politicians you know I\nI just look at a guy that can't doesn't know his own mind at times and doesn't right\nNow is the\nSame guy that wanted to be on the survivor show and you know ... you know look at him and uh you'll find that funny Sean but we're we're actually related or I think it for three or four generations back a great great something grandfather he was actually the founder of snowflake Arizona which I thought you would really love\nThe you know his somebody told me that yesterday I might practically really no there is a snowflake Arizona senator Snowe for like\nUm I Hope it goes the right thing if any Republican senator now especially Murkowski Collins flake after they they got what they wanted they got their delight they got the FBI weighing in\nA Joe Biden said it would not going to offer recommendations and they're not going to offer opinions here\nAnd all they're going to do is give you a straight data and that's what it was given and everybody seems pleased by that his comments Susan Collins comments seemed to satisfy them no core operation of any of these claims as we've been claiming\nAnd as we've been telling you and so the allegations have been problematic from the start it you know assuming assuming for a second here judge Kavanaugh where to get confirmed we we have got to have a deep analysis\nIn this country over where we want to go forward in terms of going forward because if we allow this to happen to good people it it's it is so ... it's so dark I'm having a conversation with a friend of mine who's religious\nAnd we were discussing you know look at the ten commandments why is one of the ten commandments\n... shall not their falls witness against the neighbor because it's devastating for the rest of Brett Kavanaugh's life\nPeople know that this is what he's been accused of and yet in spite of the fact there's been no corroboration shifting stories and a media hysteria that's ... that's why\nTo the extent that people can literally destroy other people with innuendo falls uncorroborated claims a shocking to me they did it to Robert Bork they did it to Clarence Thomas they've been doing it to Brett Kavanaugh they do it to Republicans conservatives every two and four years they're racist or sexist\nThey want grandma to die all these things that they've come out as a matter of of course because that's their playbook\nI
