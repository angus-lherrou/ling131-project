was only committee package responsible for the content of this advertising the majority committee and not authorized by any credit for me to learn more and hold them ... dot com video next [noise]\n\n\nOr you one of a million ... with the IRS ten thousand dollars or more in back taxes if you weren't being threatened by bank levees wage garnishment fees and penalties for fear or you could lose your home or business listen carefully to this important denounce meant the IRS has recently enacted\nA debt forgiveness program that will allow applicants a one time settlements on all the money they owe this program has led to unprecedented tax write offs worth hundreds of millions with the expert guidance of ideal tax solution your debt could potentially settle for a fraction of what you owe right now\nIdeal tax solution is currently enrolling new applicants but don't wait caseloads alright an unprecedented volume for this one time IRS debt settlement\nI uh thirty four thousand dollars in a very bad position thinks the idea of taxation and I got was negotiated down to three thousand dollars\nIf you oh ten thousand dollars or more you may qualify for immediate enrollment but you must call now called eight hundred eight four zero to eight to zero that's eight hundred eight four zero to eight to zero\n\n[noise] no I think I think you're right I think we have to let people know that that's the plan now [noise]\nI mean [noise] I mean\nRight now or whether\n\nThis is Glen Winfrey another McCaskill campaign staffer the way he details a plan for impeachment of President Trump is revealing\n\nHoles all want to get the moderates [noise]\nWhat are we talking a modern redrawn than men hammer\n\n\nAnd all of you know\nWe discovered that McCaskill is receiving money from democratic US Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer\nLet me get money from marijuana to our link pack okay another one of those things where we can get the money and mine you know even on the deal yeah I was in our lifetime or anything or\nI think [laughter]\nWhat I'm saying is if they ask the enlisted specifically asking voting for the wall we shouldn't let them go they need to think so I think she may thanks for the wall and they don't ask me and let them think that right\nAnd if they don't ask let them think that that's what the rule is now for the Democratic party even the center for American Progress sending out don't talk about immigration Maxine Waters admitting that she's being told don't talk about impeachment just shut up about it we we know we know we're going to do but we're not going to\nWe're not going to help people the truth before an election that's Claire McCaskill and and people on her staff people just can't know that she wants a semi automatic rifle ban and that\nThat of course she would vote yes on gun bans of course she supports the semi automatic rifle ban\nYou know she's quiet on guns because she has a bunch of Republican voters but secretly she says she supports say hey gun control group\nYou know in our staff is saying well wait till after the election to bring up Trump impeachment to voters get over it we can't do it now we got a line now with you know three weeks Twenty one days collection they why would we ever tell people the truth people just can't know McCaskill\nAn Obama essentially the same views on everything wow now the people in Missouri I Hope you're paying close attention but it's bigger than that a project Vera tosses Scott this undercover video they got the undercover video the week before about former governor of Tennessee Bredesen Marsha Blackburn is now what by fourteen points\nBecause on that tape it's the same line he'll he'll do the right thing when he gets there of course we don't agree with everything Trump says no not at all do what ... what we're saying we both for cabinet of course he wouldn't vote for Kavanaugh\nI mean this is all part of a wide campaign propaganda campaign and it's all about power and it's being exposed to very high level\nI mean this is really you know seeing people how they really are is should be so enlightening to the people in Tennessee in Missouri a James O'Keefe is with us She's the founder of project Vera toss\nExposing these senators I you know I watch this and I'm just like what a bunch of liars that's all I think when I see those great job\nYeah Sean this is a pattern you know we really the Tennessee won the Tennessee Senate candidate bread is and you know responded by bumbling and bumbling his words caught red handed these are all the staff or Sean inside Claire McCaskill's office they're all saying essentially the same thing when it comes to Obama\nGun control impeachment they're all saying that we have to do one thing before the election and do another thing afterwards someone that already it was a little hard to hear but\nOne of those powerful pieces was when the sky Glenn Winfrey wanna McCaskill staffers explains to our journalist when we asked so what do we tell the moderates what after we did the impeachment because we're going to have to mislead them and\nThe guy goes will tell them get over it\nAnd that's the that's the ... it's that this is that the guy next arose field organizer tells us he says a quote people just can't know unquote the cast on a bomb had the same views no I confronted Nick on the street yesterday with the microphone ethnic why don't you why don't you tell the truth\nAnd of course the reason is and this is true in Missouri it's true in Tennessee is true in North Dakota\nOh how nice red state Democrats they have to lie to the voters to get elected it it's a necessary condition so we're doing is exposed\nYou don't want you know I don't agree with that point they don't have the lie they have to lie if they want to win\nAnd ... it's a question of whether or not they will put aside any any sense of decency honor honesty and embrace any level of truth and they won't and that's the point and you know I think that everybody on this showing on TV\nYou look the houses and play the senators and play if you vote for any Democrat in the house you're voting for polo see\nIt'd be a boat for Claire McCaskill or British ... or a high camp or cinema or Donnelly or Bill Nelson you're voting for Schumer because that's who's going to own them in control them that's what they're going to vote to be their leader\nWell you know and and Sean in some of these states like Missouri in particular the pro life Democrats and pro gun Democrats used to be a thing decades ago misery with the stalwart when I came to those things but that's a shrinking\nGroup of people and and people like Claire McCaskill half state in order to when they have to or they think they have to mislead\nAnd again this is a Greek chorus of staffers these staffers are not necessarily villainous I suppose there is honest because they're going along with it but they're just telling the truth so tiny very interesting to see British and after we played those tapes on your radio last week\nBritish and talk to local media this is the kind of the Senate candidate he told all the local media stations well in all these ... these young guys were caught and kind of misled staffers who while they don't work for me when in fact they did he apologized so it's going to be\nVery uh by the way that was a lie to the first thing is that well they're they're just college kids no they weren't they actually work for\nAnd the guy I Apologize this guy brown who is that the Democratic spokesperson for the British in campaign he actually apologize to the media can you believe that Sean apologized\nFor misleading people without our videos so it's very interesting to see how McCaskill's going to respond now this guy Josh Hawley the Senate candidate to turn against a McCaskill has responded he's tweeted out this video um he's jumping all over it so the question is the really interesting thing is because\nWe're going to get him on the program and a lot of this week I mean we're basically following the work you're doing you know the one of the question is going to ask but go ahead finish your thought\nWell I was going to say that McCaskill has in this video it's of course I'd vote on a ban some type of gun ban we asked her staff or what type of ban is that he said semi automatic rifles now this is an issue that nobody wants to talk about Missouri particularly Claire McCaskill so\nWe're hoping that she gives a clear unequivocal answer about what her positions are on the gun issue and that's going to be very interesting if we can somehow get her to speak on the record publicly about this now that we've caught her red handed\nAgain I think that you're rocking the world the big state Senate candidates and

C. A. as people with preexisting conditions have been paying more yeah higher premiums and they were paying before\nMany lost the doctors that they loved taxing Americans who chose not to use it which by the way the individual mandate with tax the president has gotten rid of the ... rid of that taxing companies who choose not to elect to pay for what your neighbor needs it was one big redistribution scheme\nNow if you deal with direct primary care direct access to doctors\nAnd we've talked about health savings accounts and we also talked about\nAtlas MD Dr Josh ... and Dr Lee s gross this model now has been duplicated around the country and what happens is there's no pre existing conditions prejudice at all if you can afford a cell phone you can pretty much afford a\nA direct access to your doctor no insurance no problem you pay for what you need fifty dollars a month for an adult ten dollars a month per child\nAnd where are you with Congress though in other words these are solutions no insurance no bureaucrats\nYou know doctors being able to do what they do they are the innovators in this up front pricing lower costs no government meddling All right well that's true how do you get Congress how many people are in Congress that are supporting your model I Know\nFor example Rand Paul and I think Lindsey Graham or two people say well block grant the money and then let the states determine how to do it themselves which would that would I think open a path for people like you to expand I didn't even greater level\nOf health care is local I mean that's the important thing you know the health care should be between you and your doctors and one thing that's clear the cavalry is not coming from Washington to save us\nNow if we wait for solutions from Washington it's not coming we need doctors and patients to get the other fix this problem themselves and that's exactly what this loop and the movement does is it to eliminate\nAny asking for permission from from Washington to take care of our patients\nYeah well look I Hope that these people in Washington and here you but it's it is interesting that the one look every American worried about their health care

there John Cox he's a great businessman his his problem is simple math and\nSort of like New York city although it's happened in New York City is even happened in New Jersey Chris Christie Christie Todd Whitman um and and and all the other occasions Tom Kaine is another example where Republicans were elected after Democrats make a mess\nI guarantee you that Cox could wind now that the sanctuary state of California wants to put up a sign in same free health care\nFor everybody in the world it's a sign you're basically have a governor saying illegal or legal doesn't matter resident non resident doesn't matter we're going to give you free health care\nNow if the average Californian is that is taxed at Thirteen and a half percent statewide on income if you're OK with that good luck to you because it is unsustainable it will bankrupt your state there's my prediction\nBut if people want to experiment with is that you know what am I I'm not there to tell people\nCan't really have any and can't get on with the thinking gotta get out of California you can't afford to pay taxes and all that\nI mean it's unbelievable look why do you think there's a mass migration out of New York and

so that the people that ruin California and left might do the same thing a Texas so unbelievable which is what the beta O'Rourke has been all about from the beginning anyway\nA good luck um I Would

is in big trouble\nAre we now see Heller was very important seed in Nevada he's now a by seven in the latest poll the only state I'm really worried about right now is Florida and Rick Scott just has done an amazing job for the people of Florida\nWell yeah and then the hurricane obviously that that was devastating but but the response next to hurricanes I remember that benefit there in the last year where where Scott has really showing the if you remember Shawn the two thousand twelve election right here in Jersey uh that's for Hurricane Sandy hit and then President Obama had the advantage of\nActing like a commander in chief and going to the devastation while Mitt Romney has basically left helpless and they say that that hurricane may have tipped the scales back to Obama because Mitt Romney at all the momentum in the world are going into that storm so yeah look a Jim Messina who was speaking of President Obama in two thousand twelve he was the campaign manager [noise]\nAh for Mr Obama at that time and he said yesterday is and why did Senator Warren has to do her announcement with our DNA\nNow he goes why can't Democrats ever stay focused and I think this Elizabeth Warren\nRevelation or lack there of will only hurt the party further because I don't see how you could ever say and many media outlets by the way Shawn said that this was definitive proof right I'll give you literally the the headlines\nThat feeling around it and she's Ninety six percent European I mean at that one one thousand twenty four she has perhaps maybe Native American ancestry of some type I mean but it is it but her she literally personally change\nHerself to minority status when at U. Penn and then at Harvard that she was billed as the first minority female professor there a Native American heritage that the Cherokee Nation has spoken out and said this is just outrageous they're out there outrage by it\nDry it and that was the turning point right when they when they came out and said this is wrong this is inappropriate this is a mockery then where are you going to say is attacking was with Warren is it still conservatives or is it actually Cherokee Nation but I mean that that the headlines yesterday Associated Press Warren DNA shows I have Native American heritage\nA CNN Elizabeth Warren releases DNA tests with strong evidence of Native American ancestry ABC News Elizabeth Warren relief reveals proof\nOf Native American ancestry again what proof at this so backfired on her ... nation got involved in and all the mockery that that ensued from there this is going to follow her I Know people think that she is a front\nRunner but the fact that she lied about our heritage to advance her career I could see the signs already at Trump rallies in twenty Twenty one one thousand twenty four just written and that's it\nBecause now this defines her and this is not something you shake very easily and suddenly she's kind of morphed into Hillary Clinton where you can't really trust what she says and then on top of that she has no real economic message at outside of you didn't do that so\nYeah I Know they're going to see who the Democrats settle on ... and twenty twenty because I think the left wing of the party has taken over and that's not the way you'd be President Trump\nOne of the things that I've been pointing out I don't know if you had a chance to look at the center for American Progress and there was a group formed by none other than John Podesta but\nThey're running their reelection now ... very revealing the Maxine Waters says they keep telling me not to say it I keep saying I'm not a lot but I'm going to keep saying it anyway meaning impeach forty five\nSo they're hiding their agenda we learned that in this project very past tape with Claire McCaskill in her own words also\nBut now we know that they're being told directly not to talk about their immigration and all you know a sanctuary attacks packs a punch says the four page memorandum [laughter] I'm like yeah OK and anyway the New York times were obtained a copy of it\nAnd Democrats and strategies to prepare the memos said\nThe Democrat you spend as little time as possible ever talking about immigration itself pivot to a more fruitful issues\nHealth care and taxation it's very difficult to win on immigration so nobody's talking about what they really are going to do their ... to ... Democrats too when they have to pretty much lie misrepresent con be quiet about what it is they want to do how they're governed\nAnd and the types of agenda items they really have\nThat's not an enviable position to be and I mean ... all the criticism Donald Trump takes he's pretty authentic he made promises and he keeps them\nThat's the thing I mean when you look at the record right everybody focuses on the rhetoric of the president too much right you look at the results and it's a completely different ball game\nIsn't that would kill to have a GDP above four percent unemployment below\nFour percent rights or something like seven point six million job openings that was that was reported by CNBC today I think in the country that's incredible we have Ninety eight percent of the ISIS caliphate\nEvaporated in Iraq and Syria when North Korea is no longer lobbing missile over Japan threatening Guam and the United states these are all very substantial victories the trade deal he just did with Canada and Mexico\nI'm not sure leading here I'm Talking about the pillars of the presidency in terms of accomplishments Trump is winning right now you want with capital as well even that CNN did a\nSegment last week John Avalon where he says the president is on a winning streak and the polls are showing it he's back around forty four percent forty five percent among registered voters member that\nNobel raspy as soon as the most accurate and twenty sixteen has them at fifty one\nRight fifty one percent everything is trending upwards at the wrong time for Democrats when you go into this election because to your point\nThey have no message like they had no message and twenty sixteen I don't know what Hillary Clinton's platform was outside of that guy is bad but for me so I can be the first woman president and I I Would say the same about Mitt Romney two thousand twelve I I think that I Can't remember what his platform was but I remember Joe Biden had bin Laden is dead and GM is alive a that's easy to remember and it's\nA it was good enough right who was it was America's\nGreat again or keep America great again the Trump can run on his record and Democrats just go with personal attacks like they have a it it's going to be a long long election you know you're going to hear about how Trump's in trouble like you didn't two thousand sixteen but\nAgain a in till they have a message in ... Michigan Pennsylvania Wisconsin to win over those voters that see jobs coming back and companies coming back\nI unless they put up a centrist fiery centrist candidate to have a lot of problems on\nThe one poll that shocks me the most the latest one out of Wisconsin had Scott Walker who I think that a phenomenal job in the state of Wisconsin and now he's always had notoriously close elections he's always had all of these groups and millions and millions of dollars pouring in from outside of Wisconsin that he's had to deal with I'm not sure if all\nAlways tell everybody play like you're behind and you're losing and you've got you got to make up ground and anything can happen between now and election day in Twenty one days but\nYou know I don't see Heidi Heitkamp making a recovery I think a Christian seminar is falling apart in Arizona I see a surge of just the right time for Dean Heller in Nevada which will help him\nUm I I look at these other races Donnelly now is beginning to fall back in Indiana Marsha Blackburn is emerging in Tennessee thank goodness Claire McCaskill I Believe this tape is absolutely going to help to feed her or if the people in Missouri if this was widely disseminated 'cause it's outrageous\nAnd the only Democrat that might be safe at this point seems to be Joe mansion in the Senate yeah\nAnd and the Senate in order to win that back you had to go through this narrow paths if you're a Democrat through Arizona red state Texas Red state Tennessee read standing\nBeside the way up I'm going to he's up by eight in the latest poll I'm actually going to be down during a town hall with him this weekend around the Houston area I'll I'll give out that announcement later in the week\nOh there you go yeah and and remember better or more money than any capital my gosh are eight million dollars and he's tattered already has a twenty twenty presidential candidate you know\nI I think we'll probably be twenty to twenty five candidates and that's not an exaggeration because Republicans and Eighteen but yeah that would have been a very big symbolic victory of ... somehow could've unseated cruise but that's going in the right direction for Cruz as well so the Senate you got to think they're probably going to pick up three or four seats and now I Would have told you two months ago and like I don't see how\nDemocrats don't win twenty three seats to win back the house and given the history Eighteen in the last twenty mid terms I have got against the party in power by an average of something like thirty three seats a bottle of sixty three seats in two thousand ten so I was thinking you know what I Can't see that not happening now I I think it's a toss up at fifty fifty that Republicans keep asking if that happens\nAfter all this negative press that President Trump has received the Republicans have received to overcome that and keep all three branches oh my goodness\nBut I I Will tell you I think the fact that you're you've hit two things the fact that they have no agenda\nIs part of it the second thing is is that they're catering to a mob mentality\nAnd we saw that in the cabin on hearings and we've seen a post Kavanaugh hearings and you know when you say as Maxine Waters did about cabinet members and high ranking officials in our government you create a crowd and you you follow them into department stores and gas stations in grocery stores and you tell them\nThey're ... they're not wanted here anymore anywhere anymore I'm like that's the party because I say in it\nCustomer reviews check pricing and\nBook appointments for free what's the website again home advisor dot com or just download the bring home advisor at [noise]\n\nYou Joe ... is with the hills all the coverage\nStormy stormy stormy kinda was a big deal that California judge throughout her case and demanded that she paid legal fees for Donald Trump but for the president tweeting about it today I don't think anyone would is willing to cover it at all\nYou know I I I'm trying to figure out who's having a worst month um the New York giants\nElizabeth Warren or Michael ...
