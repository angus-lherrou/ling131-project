New York\nNew York some of the states feels rated number one seven Dan W O R voice of New York I lie\nIt's fifty three and cloudy at four o'clock good afternoon I'm no one lady in Pittsburgh where they continue to investigate Saturday's mass shooting at the tree of life synagogue police have released the names of the dead including a Ninety seven year old woman a married couple in their eighties and two brothers in their fifties\nA hair saliva or ...\nBlood work a also\nPersonalization with DNA to make sure you were able to keep it off a so it's it's it's completely for you it's for each individual and that's that's why you know we got these some tremendous results twenty five to forty five pounds a and and that's what we typically see\nIt it became a interesting because we've had so many and\nWe kind of go in waves in terms of like the professions that we see in the ...\nOffice which is really weird I Know it sounds weird but it kind of makes sense now that I Know more information about it so this week we had\nJust one of your off the cops so now it's ... yeah I Do a lot of the ... well you know you can remember I set up front right I I'm generally at our reception desk all day long so\nI hear and see so many different things and I really try to tune in and listen to what a lot of our patients are saying when they think nobody's actually listening to them right\nAnd so this week we had um a number of commercial drivers and our um you know\nFront desk waiting area and so some of them were ... patients some of them were new patients that were just about to get started some of them were just new patients that had just heard the goal over we're about to get into a consultation\nAnd what was interesting was that I didn't realize that commercial drivers have a whole set of rules about you know that the health that they have to actually uh being or achieve\nShow with our job driving a big old ... strong right it's like if you you know you would think ...\nPolice man I I don't know like a\nA doctor should have certain standards that they're you know\nTop guys are driving by a giant truck craze so there for hours and hours on end and it takes a ton of a door and\nRight but you usually don't think of that right so what was interesting is that one of our patients who was saying these checkups right so one of the patients that was sitting in our waiting room I'm struck up a conversation with somebody who had just been in the consultation is actually signing up and\nI'm the gentleman said to him you know does this program work and um the other gentleman said you know yes actually it does and um\nYou know the new patient started asking him some questions and I'm\nThe existing patient said um you know the reason I came here is because I had this a checkup that my job prescribed and I was basically told that if I didn't lose the weight because I was borderline diabetic borderline you know very high blood pressure cholesterol issues\nI if I didn't lose the weight and if my health and improve I was basically out of a job\nFor and no it's not and so what I found to be amazing is that the potential patient turned him and said oh my God he said that's what I Do for a living as well\nAnd they exist to Haitians looked at him and he said\nAnd you haven't had that check up yet and the guy said no I haven't but I'm sure glad I'm Talking to you about it [laughter] so yeah so I\nDidn't realize this but you know lo and behold um our existing patient his name is Paul he said I don't recall the new patients name So Paul said to him you know this diet does work and it really is amazing it's really easy to follow\n'em and it's really easy to follow the blow while I'm On the road when she never thought that he'd be able to actually do a diet because of that\nBecause you know these guys are always on the road down the road for hours and hours is not a lot of stops of places to eat it and if there are they usually extremely unhealthy so he says that he's actually been able to find really healthy options and all of these places that he used to stop and now he's eating according to the islands of the program he's almost done with the program by the way I think he's down close to like\nThirty seven pounds of forty days well that's all he really had to lose\n'em and and some other were tremendous amount taller guy so he carries it well but clearly the health issues where the more concerning um and you know just going back to my original point of the beginning of the show is that really what we're doing is we're changing people's lives in terms of\nHealth and that's kind of the most important thing here I'm right because with all that fat laws come so many different benefits as far as getting you better feeling a better so\n[noise] talking about the commercial drivers a cake or who you actually saw\nThis week is done with his two sixty day rounds and he is down a hundred and twenty pounds I'm also a commercial driver um\nAnd he says that you know he he always meet up with some of his friends along the way along his route that he does and he says people don't recognize them anymore and I was like well listen a hundred and twenty pounds is you know\nGerms it ingests them around ... or ... or to to\nTo sixty day around to the program would he be the he would be the big you know he would end up now for the for the guy who was first before you already area beat him while we had somebody who lost sixty nine and six they often do I know that but I'm saying for the week yeah no I got it wrong or right he's pretty high up there\nFor a hundred and twenty you know basically a hundred and twenty pounds and a hundred and twenty day or that what it what it is up in the middle east up to the middle reset\nAnd he got caught up what's really cool about his story is you know the great science and between\nThe grounds you didn't put anything on because now you know give them the tools that your weight goes up by two pounds here's what you do here's how you knock it off he's got the DNA tests he's got the blood work to help keep his body belts he's got the personal I supplements and he's not going to you're not going to put it back or\nHe he couldn't figure out how to get enough calories to eat while he was on break from the two six today round\nHe couldn't eat enough food sickly\nUh that's kind of where that was that but the interesting thing about his story is that what he said to me was his doctor kept track of his blood work the whole entire time that he was on the program for 'em and he said that each and every time that he did blood it just kept getting better and better and better and and he\nWas saying that before he started the program he was basically a\nPre diabetic they wanted him to start taking seven hundred milligrams of met foreman I'm just\nYou know it's really luckier than his weight I Know you can't really already not a very lucky is very very lucky\nBut he told me that I'm at the end of the day all of the medications that they wanted to put him on would have cost him\nOut of pocket seven hundred dollars a month well okay\nLet's calculate that I Believe the gentleman his in his late fifties I'm not a hundred percent certain of his age levels him he ... he lives until he's eighty\nSo let's let's give them another twenty five years ... twenty five years times twelve times seven hundred knows go for it and that's out\nOf pocket that's insurance not covering answer and you know what we don't even know if these medications are going to be able to control whatever he had going on so that was actually what he focused on since you understand how much money I'm saying that I'm like I Do I\nThat's just mind boggling numbers hundred and twenty pounds a hundred and twenty days and we've saved a potential seven hundred dollars a month for the rest of the who wants\nTo take those medications even if there were for insurance covered all over the who wants to go on and you know most of these things that people are taking the medications for for for obesity they're really you know to every doctor ... good\nHundred percent it's almost a hundred percent curable because they're all affected from what I told her all the result of of of being overweight and that's and that's really tremendous so\nThese are these are typical result twenty five to thirty five pounds for women is what we see thirty five to forty five ... pounds per month\nWhen that's only in forty days it's without ... without hormones without surgery it's all natural solutions supplements that are personalized each individual from uh from blood work for Harris saliva by our ...\nDNA testing as well a beginning and and and really you know that's what makes the girl with the personalization of how to how to balance each or how to help out each person's body when they come in and so you can call one eight five five five and Jay diet where they started five five six five\nThirty four thirty eight so that's the schedule an appointment and one of our offices and we're all excited about ... about prince and opening a lots of people bring coming up\nFrom South Jersey starring when even open when are you going to open so we're finally opened up a place down there were ... patients there and it's really great so twenty five to forty five pounds is typically what we see a little bit more on the men's side sometimes [noise] and a twenty five five five injury diet and like when you're calling to make a phone call when you're calling please remember the people on the phones [noise]\nThey're just there to schedule the appointment they really don't have the answer to your question is most of them are just are scheduled appointments so don't yell at them or you can go to Andrew dice dot com it's easiest way to only twenty seven dollars just go to Andrew dark dot com\nAnd uh you can also go to\nLighter a and so she's just she says she came in she's super thrilled I'm going on a monster shopping spree she says this is her husband is going to kill her as you go on a shopping spree a and put what's great you know she came in she had a bunch of the history of of major digestive issues\nWhen she was coming in and you know every time she ate she says within like\nTwenty minutes to a half an hour she's gassy she's bloated a she and she feels that way for hours this was this was beforehand and we you know she came in\nTo the ... weather obviously a we looked at a bunch of different things\nUh we did the parents saliva or with the energetic a buyer and drug testing we took a look at some blood work that she brought in we were able to do a a ... a toxicity support\nA digester support or minerals and vitamins support and so boom twenty to twenty two pounds um and and forty days which is fantastic\nA little bit below what we typically see but still you know like she said she looks like she's thirty pounds\nShe looks like she's thirty pounds a lighter she looks and feels that she's thirty pounds lighter and\nYou know she's going to go spend some money on somebody get you know get the help the economy a little bit of a shopping the shot shot in the arms of the economy a little bit get herself shopping at a bind some clothing and uh it's always good right she looks like she's thirty pounds a lighter she looks and feels like she's thirty pounds lighter and\nYou know she's going to go spend some money on somebody get get get help the economy a little bit you're not going to happen the shot shot in the arms of the economy a little bit get herself shopping get are buying some clothing and it's always good right\nAll good I you know I think that there is nothing that feels or um that feels better than\nI'm buying yourself a pair of jeans at our size or to size or smaller than you were only like hello twenty thirty forty days ago dry so in my opinion it's like you know for a man who is tightening has dealt thought All right and and you get to see that mark\nAnd that he's had there for like whatever eight years and now that markets you know now that dumped it on a different a whole and I think that that's I think that's really special and I think um\n[noise] and I think what really matters is the fact that\nYou know every single day you're accountable to yourself now and you know what you're doing and you know and\nYou kind of feel comfortable in your own skin now you're no longer afraid of the snack attack you know longer you know having these cravings and we had ... call the office this week so she's been off the program for three years by the way\nI'm and she I think she lost about thirty seven pounds three years ago and she is sixty four now so she was sixty one I'm\nThree years ago obviously she called because she wanted to know\nAbout the DNA testing 'cause that was really interesting to her and also because she gets the complimentary hand saliva evaluation every three months she comes in and she does that and she gets the appropriate ... if I told her about that too but so one of the things that she said to me that really\nChanged her\nAfter the program was that she no longer\nAfraid to walk into a supermarket she's no longer afraid to go sit down at a restaurant because she knows exactly where she's at is you know like she's completely control in control your ... and she said that this wasn't the situation three years ago she had completely lost control\nAnd that's a scary place to be at and I'm really proud of her that three years later on and she said to me\nShe goes you know it's a daily thing for me now she says I wake up in the morning and I think about what my days going to look like and then my second thought as what my days going to look like food wise and\nIt's an interesting thing right we wake up in the morning we think about what we have to do during the day but why not think about what it is that we're going to eat during the day or ... you know that's what fuels our body that's what determines how much energy we have that really\nDetermines how we're going to feel the next morning but a lot of people don't think of it that way but she says\nYou know it completely shifted her paradigm it seems like she's completely on a different wavelength in terms of what happens to her every single morning she has a routine\nYou know she knows what she's going to eat she knows what she's gonna do that day and that really helps her in three years later all the way it is still off and she's doing great you\nKnow it's great that's great and then that's what you do you empower people can't and when you have control your empowered and you you can handle it and you know what to do and and so each person is given\nTen different ways to get the weight off each person as a weight set point reset each person or it is given a a DNA test that tells them all these different things for over forty different metabolic factors and so it it that's what it's all about without any shots and hormones in surgery we typically see twenty five\nTo thirty five pounds in women are we typically see thirty five to forty five\nPlus towns with men and that's mostly fat that's without shots without hormones\nWithout surgery without hungrier eating natural food uh you're you're you're not hungry in the program because your body is burning so much toxic side for fuel\nThat were just basically rerouting what your body's using for fuel and then we were out back and and so it's really monitor you every every day you have my personal cell phone number my email address so nobody's\nEver alone or on this process\nIt's really easy to just go to Jay ... to get started to go to and J died dot com normally Ninety nine dollars but as a radio listener uh right now you go on line is twenty seven dollars for a full body composition analysis [noise]\nUh where we take over and take a look at a bunch of different things we do a full consultation body composition analysis we look at not only weight\nBut we're also looking at a visceral fat we're also looking at your basic metabolic rate and so we're also looking at daily caloric intake and so the difference in those two numbers is important because\nYou know if you if your if your body's functioning your basic metabolic rate let's say you're burning off Seventeen hundred calories a day but your body function like you're taking in thirty five twenty five hundred calories a three thousand calories a day and you're wondering why you can't lose weight that might give you an answer\nAnd so we take a look at metabolic Lehigh your body is working and so then we we then do hair and saliva with and do\nThe Byron genetic testing uh when you started to go forward with the program we didn't take a look at blood work that people bring in\nTo see what's supplementation to support them with and we look at it a functional level or we just tighten up those parameters a little bit so we don't know if you keep the parameters within a functional level you have to worry less about being diagnosed with big without the ... by those problems getting worse and being a God Forbid diagnosed with dumped themselves\nWho want to keep it in a healthy range and keep your body balance and if we're able to do that then there's less chance you know upstream downstream if you if upstream you're able to keep the body balance and you have to worry about the less disease downstream and so that's n J died dot com\nOr for twenty seven dollars for a a a only twenty seven dollars for a full body composition analysis in uh\nConsultation with us where we can get started and gets you going on the way to help you if you want to call you can ah ... the number is one\nOf eight five five five and Jay diet that's eight five five\nFive six five thirty four thirty eight\nA that's a scheduling appointments in one of our locations we've got locations everywhere in the tri state area\nOr New Jersey New York city queens Brooklyn Long Island and now west Chester\nHuh that's great and so you can come in scheduled appointment or you can make a phone call just remember when you are calling that the folks on the phone are only there to schedule appointments or they're not there to put you on the weight loss program\nOr get mad at grade now now that yeah they they get mad at the people in the fall is a lot of time I don't know why but uh yeah so yeah they're just they're just because of the appointment they don't have the answer is just go on and then we'll talk to and and and we'll give you all the answers about the program and so forth [noise] um\nSo bill came in this week and it's really you know it's amazing when you when you\nHave a lot of extra fat in general and a lot of visceral fat that's decide on the organs\nTry levels of this real fat really cause inflammation in the body inflammation in the body will cause is one of the causes to all the different chronic\nNo systemic sort of aches and pains so it's not just one area that hurts systematic shoulders and elbows industries in the joints and that's why are people that are obese more more more ah ... susceptible to arthritis and things like that and just generalize inflammation in the body and so\nYou know bill comes in and got all these different aches and pains\nOr he is he's got high blood pressure or he's one of these guys you know the typical belly you know the body stores fat in different areas to protect their is because of different hormonal disruptions generally in those areas so\nIf you get somebody with like that you know floppy overhanging belly fat you're looking at a dream that you're looking at it that apple shape you're looking at a thyroid if you're looking at\nA um a pear shape or looking at reproductive Oregon imbalances so bill Scott does belly you know he's got one of these one of these skinny guys with a big old belly like everything's in the belly\nAnd no matter what he does he's no matter how you lose try to lose weight just becomes a skinny guy with a big belly he's just got that big old belly\nHis body is off nothing's working the right way and when he came in he says you know I just got his friend did the program it's just I just got to get the same results I got to do something there's no way I can live like this\nAnd so they gave him you know did did all the personalization processes here Cambridge renal support game reproductive a reconstructed Oregon support all natural type of supplementation\nA personalized for him and so boom forty eight pounds got 'em going fifty days libido is back no more crashing in the middle of the day is barely even thinks about coffee anymore just as like a little cup in the morning\nAnd ... rock and roll and and and so they are sort of it's all about so [noise]\nYou know thirty five to forty five plus as what we see with men typically and only forty days twenty five to thirty five\nWith women typically a ... and only forty days and ... all natural there's no everything is either a base mineral based ... supplements that are personalized for each individual based on either by energetic testing\nOr or blood work or DNA as well uh and so it without any shots without hormones last surgery people are hungry on the program because their body would just turn their body into fat burning machine so we we're out what your body's using for fuel you're going to burn at least\nTwo thousand calories of your own facts for fuel you can't be hungry and and so ah it only forty days twenty five to forty five plus pounds across the board\nAnd so that's an J died dot com right now it's normally Ninety nine dollars as a radio list are only twenty seven dollars gets your body composition analysis\nAn appointment with us where we take a look at not only your weight and you could give us out on the phone I mean we look at your way we look at body fat percentage really look at body water percentage we look at visceral fat rating I'm against folks if your if your your your body is water is lawyer visceral fat as high\nYou know when you get high visceral fat that fat on the organs and makes you more insulin resistant when your body becomes more insulin resistant away your body metabolized as a sugar for fuel is instead of bringing into the cell and burning it your body is taking in turning into fat and storing it\nAnd that's going to make your metabolism work much slower on top of that if you've done a ton of weight yo yo dieting gloves and a ton of water too quickly\nA like a lot of times with women that we see your water levels are going to be off if your water levels are often you got high visceral fat you're ... you're in you're forty years old you're metabolisms function like a seven year old you're not going to\nBe able to lose weight and there's no way to do it\nSo we're gonna have to take a look at all those things and and then and then personalized these the solutions that supplements are the the for each individual get your body and the fat burning that's one of the things that we look at it as mineral balance a metabolic age daily caloric intake ah and so\nThat you know that's that's how we do it on the front end and then and then we personalize the pro at everything for the for you for the for the forty days program as well\nUh we've got you covered all over the tri state area a couple of locations in New Jersey or New York city queens Brooklyn Long Island and now opening in West Chester as well\nTwenty five to forty five pounds is typically what we see a little bit more on the men's side sometimes and it's twenty five five five and Jay diet and like when you're calling to make a phone call when you're calling please remember the people on the phones [noise]\nThey're just there to schedule the appointment they really don't have the answers to questions most of them are just tearing sketchy appointments so don't yell at them or you can go to and J

do it so we\nHad and carried I Am sure remember him he had a quadruple bypass eight years ago I remember everybody I Know but I'm just saying you know kissing if you don't want to remind you sell Jared and had a quadruple bypass eight years ago and\nClearly not the most ideal situation and really and instead as an working hand you know getting fatter and working at\nAnd you know exercising more and feeling life like someone up there and gave him a second chance\nOn life he went and they completely other way and started to eat really unhealthy he really felt it was so unfair that this happened to him and he had this quite triple bypass and all these other things and\nSo he kind of really started to um go downhill and um so he had a checkup with his cardiologist and he basically told him that um\nYou know a piece heading down a not such a good road and so\nYeah so he I guess decided his girlfriend and I think finally told him that you know beat you kinda either need to get with the program or sort of you know get out because you know she wasn't going to go through this again what happened eight years ago and and so he came in and\nYou know this was a guy who was getting every one of his meals\nAnd snacks um take out you know so he was basically running in wherever eating whatever um and um\n[noise] you know he used to be a runner he used to be you know all these things to do a ton of sports so anyway lo and behold a\nForty days later he lost a forty nine pounds swell and uh we are back to running we are back to having known any pain no ankle pain or we are no longer getting every meal out which is really really cool because he says he\nIs my favorite part he gets to spend more money on buying clothes and buying clothes for his girlfriend and presents for her so you know but\nIt's always my favorite part shopping is kids think I'm you know he ... and the best part is is that he's no longer depressed because he actually started to feel so much better once the weight started to come off that he realized\nThat his life wasn't over you know the heart was fixed you know the bypass worked eight years ago so you know here we go it's like a second chance on life so he really is thankful he cooks now um you know he says I Can't believe how much money I'm saving by not\nOut every meal and\nYou know you're getting it sounds like somebody who's sponsoring like a woman's group is sponsoring it had the one time\nSomebody may you had you had the one woman on you you want to get her ... her manicured everyday massage dare I say\nThis on there should be a woman's support groups or the I'm sure there is this when you're talking about the fact that she uh what notes you spending money on her getting getting gifts and money on her yes but\nWhy there should be you know wish I listen I I you know it's all good I mean I\nDo I feel like there should be like malls that are sponsoring may with the amount of things were telling people to do in terms of getting more clothing now I mean how about all the male patients we\nGot three may I I'm sure the guys are all through it's a little less than what about you don't have to get their students remade switzer expense you know you're twenty five thirty forty fifty pounds man you you need new\nShirts new tightened ties maybe not new shorts new pants delta everything they're more expensive than female clothing you know but I'm I'm tell me you know well maybe not nobody ever heard of a sudden it's all good but you know what speaking of new clothing Bob closer yeah\nSo this very important because he came to me to tell me that\nHe went from a thirty six inch waist to thirty two inch waist and forty days\nSeventeen point five what how much he went from a thirty six inch waist to uh thirty two inch waist in forty days\nHis neck size went too far from Seventeen point five to Fifteen point five and he says that these were his sizes Twenty years ago and what's really funny is that for ... as he puts on his old dress shirts and he says they looked like how stresses now\nAnd he makes fun of himself at every couple of days he'll put on one of the shirts and he'll like our on our on our yeah of\nCourse they did but he says he keeps one because he keeps on and there's it's a mental thing he he puts it says I look like I'm wearing\n... with a I'm Sorry I look at it was alright floated
