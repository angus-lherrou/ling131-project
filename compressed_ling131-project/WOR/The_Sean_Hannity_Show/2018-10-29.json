had too many shootings at schools at churches in this particular case this is the largest anti Semitic shooting and history\nThe United states and you know when the president says that you know having armed guards at school or I've been advocating for a long time now retired police retired military\nOn the perimeter in the property on every in every hall of every school and that's one way to protect our children and I always ask a simple question and it's not to me about a gun debate if you find yourself in a building with an active shooter\nWould you prefer that there are that you know that there are trained professionals in that building with firearms as a first line of defense especially knowing that most of these shootings are over ... seconds\nAnd even when you get the best response times from the greatest police departments it's usually by the time they get there it's it's they're just counting the casualties and and trying to protect in in an orderly fashion those who either or injured or weren't injured\nSo it's a thought um it's been used before but that's not a big story of the day the saddest thing I watched all week and I watch very closely\nAnd even hearing my name brought up a number of times and you know I'm just shaking my head because people obviously know nothing about me they know nothing about\nYou know they don't take the time they either bother to watch or listen to this program if you've been listening to the program\nYou know we have been decrying going back to Kavanaugh the angry mobs\nIn Washington confronting bidding at senators not letting them closed doors there\nWe've been talking about how dangerous the left wing mob mentality has gotten we've talked about the incidences of Sarah Sanders and her family or kids trying to get something to eat secretary Nielsen trying to get something to eat\nYou know we've talked about Pam Bondi trying to go see a movie\nMitch McConnell walk into an airplane numerous times and Mitch McConnell have been his his tables slammed on food ripped off his table just last weekend Kevin McCarthy's office having a Boulder sent\nThrough it you know and I've been saying it it's we've got

cabinet members you get a crowd well what does she thinks going to happen when the crowd is formed and you follow the inter restaurants and the department stores and gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted any anywhere anymore\nWell how is that going to end well told the story when I met senator\nWhat's that guy's name from Connecticut again ... looming ball when I was coming out there was it was in the middle of the capital hearings you know I don't I don't understand being rude to somebody just because you have a political disagreement\nWe had a very pleasant conversation\nI invited him on my show I don't know what came of it but nothing obviously but I don't know if we're thinking about it what is the point of being rude to people are getting in people's faces says Cory Booker Spartacus says why is there this anger out there\nThat we have you know all these bombs that are sent out\nThe first one went to George Soros and I said that day I said this this has got to stop\nWhen George Soros is no fan of Sean Hannity's funds groups that wants me to be silenced and go away but that's not what we do in this country we protect people you're allowed to have political views and spend your money the way you you see fit in life\nAnd even if it's being spent to silence made you know what I still believe in freedom\nOr the ... you know I don't want to see any politician hurt and I have consistent consistently over the years said that\nWhen President Obama and people you know threatening him and people race how do we let how does somebody get into the White House says that happened we've got to protect our elected officials we have one president at the time we got it that represents the United states and that represents all of us\nAnd at the end of the day the powers in the ballot box but you know you watch something like\nWhat happened this weekend and you watch the Democratic party their lap dogs in the media wasted no time you know trying to politicize this terrible shooting over the weekend pin blame the massacre\nOn President Trump look if the president says fake news is not serving the people of this country\nYou can chronicle it\nCan watch it they don't see it which is sad their abuse and they're biased and they're abusive a platform but the reality is they live\nAnd they have an agenda and it's constantly on display at is not in any way shape or form of calls for violence\nSocial media Pittsburgh shooter those guy Rodney ... hours by the way he hated President Trump which is barely getting any play they're making you assume that he was must have been a Trump supporter\nNot only attacking people of the Jewish faith but President Trump for his closeness he hid this shooter hated\nThe fact that President Trump and I think he could make an argument after so many presidents had promised to make Jerusalem the capital of Israel that this president has has aligned with Israel more than any other president in modern times you know Trump surrounded by a slur for Jewish people\nAnd then he the this killer lamenting there's there's no ... as long as there's a you know bad word of a quote ... infestation but despite those facts you have people\nYou know pretty close to blaming the president and conservatives for the shooting Joe Biden widely expected to run for the presidency seemed to do so when he tweeted to the president's words matter silences complicity what is he talking about\nPaul Krugman New York times suggesting that Trump was to blame at least in part\nSpeaking sarcastically Krugman tweeting a link to the story with the caption but no but none of the white supremacist terrorism as anything to do with Trump oh no\nGuy is a fanatical racist anti Semite hates\nTrump and um you know it just as sad and now we've lost eleven people six still fighting for their lives we can't forget them and in our thoughts and prayers\nYou know and you watch some of these people out there pulling out all the stops all weekend long to tie Saturday Saturdays anti Semitic massacre to Trump\nIs too big facts getting in the way\nWhile the Republican Party rejects anti Semitism out of hand it's it's the Democratic party leaders I never get in a rural what Louis Farrakhan unless I was going to get into the grill and drill him about is anti Semitism\nHis racism the shooter this guy Bowers despised President Trump because he thought Trump was quote controlled by Jews and not only that part of Trump's family is Jewish\nAnd and so on and so forth you know apparently a you know as\nRon ... rightfully said oh this weekend on Fox News that you know these burial an anti Semite can come from any side of the political spectrum and if you look at the persecution that has taken place and this was something that the president raised the Jews have endured terrible persecution over the years\nWe've rented we've studied it they've gone through it all\nAnd we still see so much of it it is growing by leaps and bounds sadly all across Europe it's getting scary\nAll these countries that seek Israel's destruction radical Islam is Iranian mullahs chanting death to Israel or president said we will seek their destruction\nWhich is standing holy behind in the right way Israel or as so many people\nHave been you know victims of anti Semitism you know\nSarah Sanders pointing out is there any tragedy the Washington Post won't exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because the president is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community in the state of Israel\nWe haven't had a president in modern history that has stood by our closest friends and allies Israel in the middle east ever\nAnd what an act of courage was apparently but there's other presidents have promised it never did it and making Jerusalem the rifle capital of Israel\n[noise] anyway we're going to get to all of that Fox

massacre amen to old but he just said there you know we've had a lot leading up to all of this and you go back to the cabinet hearings I didn't hear many people on the left to cry the angry mobs that were going on in the halls of Congress I I got to the point where I said probably it's better if we cleared the halls of the public\nOr you would think in the people's house that the people will be allowed to go where their elected officials are but it was obviously becoming\nUnsafe for people senators being spit at you saw the treatment of you know we've had in recent weeks what do we have rice and sent or what was supposed to be rice and sent to Susan Collins home during the Kavanaugh hearings ... coat hanger sent to her office et cetera\nWe've watched than in recent weeks race in or what they said Moore's rice and being sent to the president and General Mattis and our FBI Director right and our CIA director Gina Haspel\nWe watched the last few weeks what we watch these mobs and people being run out of restaurants\nAnd it was Sarah Sanders and our kids and family secretary Nielsen Pam Bondi Ted Cruz Mitch McConnell airports and having his table slammed in his food thrown out the restaurant door\nI've been telling everybody that the rhetoric is too hot and too heated and people need to come down but nobody on the Democratic side ever decided to stand up and say this this has got to stop\nOn this program I said it when Obama was president\nGot to stop we got to protect our elected officials\nThe day that they mailed this the first device was sent to George Soros his house first thing I said on the radio I said we've got the ... this can happen in this country\nI Know he's not a fan of mine in any of the people that were threatened by these bombs but the rush to politicize this and turn this into well this is who conservatives are is just one big lie\nWhat you're watching unfold before you're very eyes is you know the race to politicize tragedies thank God those twelve or Thirteen PVC bombs didn't go off and nobody lost their life thank God\nBut that wasn't Donald Trump's fault\nAnd then you can look at this terrible tragedy and they're shooting in the synagogue or this rabid anti Semite racist and also a Trump ... not that it should even be relevant\nIt's getting scary\nWe had real bullets used over the weekend also to shoot up or Republican Party headquarters in Florida\nYou know and that could have killed people\nSouth Daytona police investigating after they said that someone shot out the window of the local county Republican headquarters police set a worker arrived Monday morning saw the damage called authorities we have another threat of a man has accused the guy who's been arrested\nBy threatening to kill Florida congressman Carlos Curbelo\nThat story came out this week yet he's been threatened there was a campaign rally would Lindsey Graham and Marsha Blackburn and you had an angry leftist mob disrupt disrupting that and a half a dozen angry liberal protestors they had to be removed\nYou have been my entire career friends with Bebe Netanyahu going back decades than there during the war and been there at other times reporting showing people the tunnels that nobody else in the media would show them friends who they who Bronx formally Shimon Peres\nLet's name names according to the Washington Post Trump's hate analyze our inciting extremist oh this extreme is in the synagogue hated Trump those are the Washington Post headlights that you got\nTrump to GOP defiant amid allegations that incendiary rhetoric these are the same people on CNN fake news that couldn't identify 'em up for who they are these phony hypocrites\nTrump blames and you know something when the media lives twenty four seven and they get called up that's too bad that is not a call for violence\nUnbelievable the times that we're living in\nNow here is um where we are the Senate is interesting 'cause there's two races you can add maybe to the let's watch call up\nAnd I would say that would be West Virginia where Joe Manchin is down by two in the latest poll and Menendez is barely hanging on to a lead in New Jersey by three now do I think both of those races are going to be won by Republicans\nMaybe West Virginia New Jersey's hard but possible people in New Jersey clearly\nFed up with Menendez then I think it's too close to call on either the gubernatorial race I have no idea why\nFloridians are flirting with Gil almost got a radical agenda in Florida Rick Scott's done a fantastic job as governor and\nIt'd be a perfect complement for the Republican majority in the Senate I think Marsha Blackburn hangs on we got Josh Hawley now in the lead in Missouri we got Dean Heller holding on to his lot hopefully that's an important race in Nevada\nI don't know why Christ in ... cinema well we've got new tape on cinema tonight that will blow that case wide open\nI don't see how somebody who supported Americans joining the Taliban can win in Arizona and calling her own steak crazy and the meth lab of democracy and inviting radical lawyers for the blind shake I don't know how she survives\nHeidi Heitkamp I don't think she's going to win in North Dakota that'll be a pickup as long as the people of Indiana don't vote for the libertarian and split the ticket\nThe Republican their bronze should be able to win that race and that would be a pick up her Republicans\nI think Montana's a little bit and play but I'd say favoring pastor at this moment but tester can be beaten there\nAnd I think the biggest thing is I'm looking at real clear politics and the battle for the house race they have two hundred and five likely Democrats and Republicans two hundred and the rest you have some thirty toss up seats that are going to define or tipped the balance of power\nJohn James by the way is now only within six against stabbing out he was one soundbite twenty\nYou'd be he's a totally great rising star in the Republican Party and I think it'd be great we'll see what happens but you know I think the house can slip so there are three possible scenarios\nA week from this Wednesday the day after one is Republicans rock the world and shocked the world again and they help hold on to the house\nPick up Senate seats that's the ideal for eight days and there's a split decision they hold on to the Senate pick up seats but it's speaker elect below sea that's split decision\nAnd the worst case scenario speaker elect below sea and Senate majority elect Chuck Schumer\nAll these important race as we have

till election day one week from tomorrow that was the president talking about the Pittsburgh should have gone synagogue shooter\nUm we're letting getting to know a lot more about Robert Bowers and who he is he was a very ill and anti Semite he\nWas a huge critic of Donald Trump\nOr in a lot of ways um and the president you know to keep for saying what that means maybe and we've talked about this after school shootings and after other church shootings where the president said well maybe we need to have retired police and military it's a sad state of affairs\nBut um as a line of defense but that doesn't take away from the horror and the vicious evil\nThat took place here you look at the victims I mean it is heartbreaking to see the faces of those slain for their faith was the cover of the New York post today and as you read about the the lives of these people it is one heartbreaking story after another\nAre sadly too we watched the media do what they always do and that's rushed to blame and pulling out all the stops to blame Donald Trump for the Pittsburgh massacre when in fact the prime minister of Israel ... the ambassador of all said that the president's comments were welcomed unappreciated\nOn every front um we'll get into all those says we continue rose ten and I'm the host of Clinton rows and rows um plugged in Pittsburgh, PA ugh long friend of the program and David shown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney thank you both for being here\nUh you know how much I Love butter friends in Pittsburgh rows of very very sorry your thoughts and prayers go to everybody uh the fact that it's been so viciously politicized within minutes makes beat my stomach turn and those trying to cast blame against the president make this a campaign issue is just nauseating\nIs shining you or so left in Pittsburgh as well as soon as I heard the story the news Saturday morning\nI mean my heart went out and I was almost afraid to hear that list of victims their names because\nThis community it's such a lovely place it's a very popular ...\nI go there to shop and to dying and and in fact my son told me just about a month ago that's for the the neighborhood is considering moving too so we we love that community it's a tight knit community they are very involved though in so many aspects and not just their community but the out if the surrounding communities\nAnd as it turned out you know of course I grew up with a girl who's ... and lift the two brothers\nThat perished on Saturday but there were so many people that have done so many great things in this community and the Pittsburgh area and it's just it's heartbreaking it really is to say that this happened but as soon as I thought those things\nAnd immediately I got sick thinking that this is starting to become political and\nIt's like you can count the seconds ... there's an interesting side note that there is no throw this to David I'm how democratic candidates increasingly turn against Israel\nAnd our mutual friend Alan Dershowitz you know I had a pretty powerful\nColumn that he put out linking the the mass of good at the Democratic party's tolerance for anti Semitism most recently we saw Bill Clinton two seats down from Louis Farrakhan I'd never ever get in a room with a vicious racist anti Semite like Louis Farrakhan or picture that emerged to with ... and\nObama that was hidden from the public for eight years while he was president that existed that they had had a relationship\nUm and if you look at some of the most pro Israeli president I think we've had\nSince the the forty eight partition plan un partition plan is a is Donald Trump\nMore recently making Jerusalem the capital of Israel which so many other presidents had promised that never had the courage to do\nA ... any person who would suggest for a moment Donald Trump as anti Semitic bone in his body is out of their mind look in his family et cetera but you're absolutely right and what you pointed out ... ... if you believe that words matter then it goes much further than just a President Clinton sitting in a room\nWith Mr Eric on their pictures of President Clinton President Obama Cory Booker shaking hands and smiling with Farrah Khan members of Congress doing the same Linda source or another hater\nOr get an honorary degree at City College an honorary doctorate is that bomb a nation what climate dizzy away just wrote a press release about some of these kinds of things and listen this is Linda ... praises\nResume Oday ah terrorists to Palestinian terrorists who killed two American college students she's been praised by Christ in dealing with a Democrat she hasn't praised unfortunately by Stacey Abrams is running for Congress here in Georgia now um it's words matter and those things matter a great deal\nAs it should be expected when you normalize Israel bashing and the hatred of Jews\nIt should be expected all the way that I Would put it I thought it was pretty powerful you said they can't be any tolerance for anti Semitism and I agree\nWe we have to have a zero tolerance policy President Obama meets with Farrakhan shame on him President Clinton sits on a platform with Farrakhan shame on him Keith Ellison joins Farrakhan was one of the greatest purveyor of anti Semitic hate he's right\nI'm just because he's black doesn't give him in the past four is anti Semitism and any liberal\nWas any positive association with Farrakhan as as part of the problem not the solution and you know just last week Farrakhan was making anti Semitic statements and it was only two months ago that Al Sharpton Jesse Jackson of Bill Clinton were all sitting next to each other with Farrakhan at a wreath of Franklin's funeral\nI Would not go to any funeral that he was ... I'm Sorry I just you draw the line\nAnd trying to find me here too and there's something I like your listeners to know because\nI I noticed a couple of headlines today on Sunday there was a letter that was published in written by eleven members of a group called bend the ark and they have a Pittsburgh affiliate right here and they sent a letter to the president is blaming hat and they said that you yourself called the\nMurder evil that yesterday's violence is that direct combination of you were influence\nAnd they said you're the pantry eerie ear work and your policies have\nInviting that's involved in this\nAnd that you know what was interesting is I had so many messages and phone calls\nFrom listeners today they they pretty much agree first of all of that than they are just that your listeners now is not representative of the Pittsburgh Jewish community they did not speak for that and that is what many of my listeners said these people are are there and obscure left wing group\nI'm a very progressive chase and and they don't speak to the Jewish community here in Pittsburgh I've been told by many this morning\nYou don't have everything with David\nGo Harry important very important point by the way I Wish they were obscure Peter Beinart as a matter of that group that's in Israel Vassar and Haider from start to finish\nRecorded then George Soros his grandson is a member of the group they report to speak to this ... for this wonderful Pittsburgh community I been to the tree of life shall I was a guest of the rabbi there for about ... ... it's a wonderful place they're not haters they're not people who want to politicize anything and the president by the way can't win for losing the guy who since those\nPipe bombs around a claim he was a follower of President Trump this guy the shooter the killer in Pittsburgh it's President Trump called him a global list there's no longer in Salt in the work world\nConservatives by and large mainstream conservatives David are the biggest supporters of Israel in this country I've been friends with prime minister Netanyahu for twenty five years friends with a hoot Brock and and Shimon Peres a and

the top of the hour eight hundred dipole one Sean our number you want to be a part of the program Ralph Reed is back with us a\nHe is the founder the chairman of the faith and Freedom Coalition and CEO of of century strategies\nAnd look he was part of the Christian Coalition back in the day when they paid played such a powerful force in American politics in many ways he has rebuilt the Christian Coalition in terms of\nGetting out mailers and and making contacts with voters all around the country key races\nNow in the Senate will watch in Florida it's a dead heat and that's both a Senate with Rick Scott and that's for governor and run to sentence has a couple of points behind and that's not looking good I'm also worried about panhandle and people showing up in the panhandle\nYou had a very tight race for governor in the great state of Georgia although I think that's moving back towards camping back towards the Republican\nIn Tennessee it's ... if you want to keep the Senate it's a must win seats in Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn against bill Brett us and we have British students team on tape saying that he was lying about cabin on that he's going to govern as a liberal\nAnd I think that really is taking people back also on tape staffers progressing calling the people Tennessee ignorant I don't think that's helpful so I think Marshall holds but people have got to get out to vote 'em we see Josh Hawley is doing very well and he's up by a couple of percentage points in Missouri against the phony Claire McCaskill\nAnd she's bragging about how she really politically it's just like Obama but she too like bread as soon as hiding who she really is\nHeidi Heitkamp in North Dakota's down by double digits she also is exposed by project Vera ... uh we now have in a Braun in Indiana he's up by a couple of points against incumbent Joe Donnelly a Democrat\nThe only the only factor there that I really see is there's a libertarian that's drawing votes away from the Republican so if you're in Indiana don't vote libertarian or else that's like a half a vote for Donnelly we've got to hold the seat\nHeld her seat in Nevada right now he's currently up in the polls but it's always tightened Nevada and then Arizona I have no idea why poll came out this weekend showing Christ\nIn cinema the Democrat up on war hero twenty eight year veteran\nSix tours of duty Iraq and Afghanistan Martha make Sally especially with cinema calling the people of Arizona crazy and saying Arizona's the\nMeth lab of democracy and inviting the attorney for the blind shake the Arizona State university and saying right after nine eleven was perfectly fine of Americans want to join the enemy and joined the Taliban I don't have a problem with it anyway he believes that he can help get out the vote Ralph Reed is with us\nThat's the Senate do you agree with my assessment\nIdeas Sean we're uh we're currently are contacting twenty six million evangelical and pro life and pro family Catholic voters and Nineteen states we knocked on a million nine hundred seven thousand three hundred and twenty eight doors a through this weekend Sean not that we're counting and\nAs of this weekend five point eight\nMillion of the voters that we've contacted have already voted we expect that number to exceed ten million by election day\nWe think we're going to have the biggest turnout of Christian voters we've ever had in a better term election well\nI Hope so I'm I'm a little worried about the house uh I look at ras muses number of the president has not had a higher approval rating than he does now which is perfect timing\nThe president literally has been going state by state and out doing everything within his power to make people aware that this was really hard mid term election history is going against the tide here\nIf we are to hold the house and hold the Senate and pick up seats in the Senate but I think will definitely pick up seats in the Senate I'm worried about the house real clear politics average has the Democrats at two o five Republicans at two hundred and you know basically you've got these dirty toss up seats or or thereabouts that are in play and that's going to make all the difference\nYeah that's right and and Sean ... are in by the people right now certainly the thousands of volunteers that are out there and knock on doors and distributing voter education literature through our organization is ... ... the polls ignore the press ignore the pundits do your job get the ...\nAnd everybody tells me you know I make a living for people not ignoring\nYour except it okay but I think you're right though\nSo I agree look anything is possible I ... I don't take things for granted\nI'm I was one of the few that really believe that Donald Trump could when I saw something happening but it was I was out on the road\nI also see it happening this time anecdotally you know I can see it in ratings every single night it's a you know Fox is audiences enthusiastic 'em and you can see CNN fake news and\nAnd that mess that they're just desperate then they'd like not doing well they seem almost the audience seems depressed but\nThere are three virtual outcomes here one is we shock the world Republicans picked up Senate seats hold the house that would be the best case scenario then there's the split a situation where Republicans get seats in the Senate\nBut below sea become speaker and then there's a worst case scenario you wake up you know ten nine days from now and you find out as speaker elect below sea and Senate majority elects Schumer and\nIt's really up to the people which decision which outcome they want but we'll get the government we deserve you stay home well that's a half a boat from below sea and Schumer if you don't vote for the Republican you're basically voting for below sea ensure\nYeah and I and I really believe showing that the intensity gap in the enthusiasm gap that wants to separate the two sides has closed significantly since the Kavanaugh nomination\nYou know you see different polls would Democrats with a high enthusiasm maybe Seventy two percent of them Republicans maybe sixty eight to Seventy percent but anecdotally I'm telling you I'm seeing stuff out there that I saw on twenty sixteen I was in Des Moines Iowa last week at an event with the vice president we\nHave a very strong organization out there we have over a hundred and fifty people walking door to door just in Des Moines neighborhoods and\nThis one gentleman who was volunteering told me she was at the president's rally the previous a friday and Cedar Rapids they filled an arena\nThere were over two thousand people who couldn't get in they stood in the driving range for two hours and watch it on a jumbo Tron\nThey stayed there to show their support you simply cannot quantity ... quantify that with a poll

... am on the voice of New York seven men W. or\nBreed founder chairman of the\nAnd Freedom Coalition um and I think that the ... look there are many factors I think Kavanaugh is\nPlaying a part in this I think the Democrats none of them have spoken at all about the caravan there's sounds has been definitely you know and then they'll say is well Republicans talking about it means that they're they're racist and Xena phobic it no it just means we believe in the rule of law\nAnd we're not going to wait the four weeks till\nYou know seven fourteen thousand people make it here\nSo I think that's playing a part I think all the incidence of the mob on the Democratic party side we have some real bullets used over the weekend shooting up a Republican headquarters in Florida we saw the terrible shooting in the Pittsburgh synagogue this weekend you have a Florida Man arrested for threatening to kill a Republican congressmen\nHave an angry leftist mob disrupting Marsha Blackburn campaign rally would Lindsey Graham um we've seen two Republicans punched in Minnesota uh there's a lot of anger and a lot of violence out there on the left you see Republicans being run out of restaurants\nUh Pam Bondi run out of a movie theater secretary Nielsen oh Sarah Sanders Ted Cruz and his wife Mitch McConnell Kevin McCarthy's office it with a Boulder busting his office window so there's a lot of left wing violence out there and it's a pretty dangerous time\nYeah and I think anytime you're dealing with uh this kind of pervasive dark the most important thing that you can do is light a candle and I think what people have got to do is they've got to resist that hate with a love for their country a love for their fellow man\nAnd hope for better future for all of our citizens staying positive stay prayer full and work hard you know I when I was coming up Sean and me in the eighties I had a friend of mine who was running for Congress to sign in the campaign headquarters I never forgot\nIt said work like it all depends on you and pray like it all depends on God that's not a bad way to live then it's not a bad way to live now\nNobody really well said Ralph Reed he is

decision\nAnd this could lead to a surge in\nIllegal immigration these are students teachers they're doctors or lawyers\nAre Americans in every way but on pay those the center of the country illegally and those who employ them disrespect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law\nBut we simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states pundits acted undocumented unchecked circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently unlawfully does become immigrants\nWere more means establishing a responsible pathway to earn citizenship\nAlright no news round up information overload our eight hundred number one show and if you want to be a part of the programs amazing the criticism that has been out there or what should be good coverage of the president President now sending up to five thousand troops to the border\nOr a significant display of solidarity for our sovereignty our borders the rule of law as he should we\nSaw about a week ago when at the Guatemala and Mexican border that let people got to the border knocked down the fence charged over the police and walk right through Mexico and we now have estimates as high as fourteen thousand people maybe less somewhere in there in around that area that are trying\nTo make it to the southern border the United states and the president and the secretary of homeland security and made it perfectly clear the vice president made it perfectly clear\nThat that's not going to be allowed to happen and we're a nation of laws to turn around\nThat to do with the right way to do with the legal way and in spite of that the marchers keep coming although the president of Mexico did make an offer for some of the migrants if they wanted would be given special consideration to work in southern Mexico um but not many takers apparently according to what I read this weekend\nYou know a lot of people have been asking well okay how did they get so organized to organize them\nAnd who's financing all of this\nUm there's been a lot of conspiracy theories that I've never believed that the only one that made any and it's not a conspiracy I'd I'd when the vice president said last week\nThat he felt that some of the leadership\nIn Honduras was responsible for promoting the caravan and some countries are from South America Venezuela particular we're we're helping a finance some of this\nThat's the only bit of information that I found that was somewhat viable as a potential truth um anyway Sam Faddis is with us Sam Faddis sees a senior partner a and former CIA operative with Thirty years of experience in conducting intelligence operations in the middle east South Asia Europe\nAnd he's worked against the most dangerous of terrorist organizations the planet has ever seen has extensive first hand experience with their methodology and tactics and a welcome to the program so glad you're with us thanks for serving your country\nThank you for having me no pleasure\nWhat so you're you wrote a column and night but I haven't read the whole column ... my read a bit is as you think that the vice president was probably right on the mark\nWithout question let on the mark I mean the actually good actually a great mystery here I mean the guy's been organized this sort of folks somebody party called ... which is a Honduran Marxist Party\nA number of years ago supportive of of of the president ... who basically tried to overthrow the constitutional making ... ... they are in bed with the Venezuelan\nAnd laid out in front of God and everybody all over the Internet there will and organizing a posting videos pictures from a more so again no great great mystery this is the work of guys allied with Venezuela Marxist is\nIn effect a giant covert action campaign designed to make the American\nGovernment look bad and our allies look that\nWell I mean look the America doesn't have much of a of a choice and and this has to be obvious to people ... and I'm listening and watching the comments and some people sort of\nAssociating this with ... with anti immigrant sentiment or dino phobia or whatever the the charges it's not true all conservatives are saying we don't care where immigrants come from the president talked about a border\nWall with a big door and that people should respect our laws are constitutional republic American sovereignty and come in and if you want to come in we just need to check out make sure that you don't come here with radical ideas that you have the ability to assist\nIn yourself and don't need our help and then we can let you in and you could become a part of our family to the extent that you want to go through the process and maybe become a citizen I don't think that's too much to ask that is called the legal wet\nIt without question this doesn't have anything to do with us ... does not seem to do with race\nThis is yeah we're a nation of immigrants were also with nation of laws and according to legal immigration procedures period which don't simply get to walk across the border I have always wondered\nBy the way those folks really don't want to control the border why is it the only people who can walk here should be allowed to get it just added stuff that's the principal\nWell what I'm not I don't want anybody to get hurt because America the president means what he ... and if people rush across our border beat at a port of entry or along the border that has not fence\nAnd that our military is on the border the military is going to be given the order to stop them now we don't want anybody hurt I don't want and I'm assuming Ninety nine point eight percent of the people coming here\nUh coming here because they come from impoverished countries and they want a better life for themselves and their family that's my guess but nobody can vouch for every single person in that caravan\nAnd for the sake and safety of the American people we can't let that number of people rush across the border have no vetting of the people and sadly maybe amongst the fourteen thousand there's one or five people that come here with intentions to bring us harm\nBut I agree ... percent we don't want to be hurt and also it is undoubtedly true that most of these people are simply aren't being utilized by folks hostile to the U.S stuff\nProbably been lied to I'm again\nI'm told that when they get to the border will be allowed to cross on so they are being put in the in the middle of this I'm simply used typically as human shields on Conan harder on the behalf of\nFolks hostile to the United states that is a horrible tragedy because these are mostly just average people will be used\nOf you know okay Larry and all that and that's where we get sicker than ... uh like\nMean Trump so I think that just they just want to silence and they're going to just vote Republican\nLeaning I I Am a realist and I try to look at things as I studied these numbers more than you know\nIf the election were held today I think we'd lose the house by about five seats Bush\nIf the election were held with the Senate today where we would hold Tennessee we pick up Missouri we pick up Arizona we barely hold Nevada I think we have a if people don't vote libertarian in Indiana will win Indiana\nAnd we'll win North Dakota Florida too close to call Montana too close to call West Virginia leans Democrat although the secretary of state there is now up to in the latest poll Menendez is a long shot to be beaten in New Jersey but he can be beaten\nThat's that's where my head is that today and uh well I'm trying to warn people that this is real that you know here we have history running against us so there's only going to be one of three results on the morning after the night before\nAnd it's either going to be while the Republicans picked up seats in hold the Senate Republicans while they held on to the house\nThat's going to be the best case scenario or it's going to be a split decision they pick up seats in the Senate but lose the house\nIt's going to be a disaster and that's you know speaker elect Nancy Pelosi Senate majority elect Chuck Schumer\nVery Frank with you I can see any one of those three scenarios unfolding with the third one the least likely\nSo you know I'd rather go full for the gusto and when it all one of the big problems for the Republicans as they've had forty five retirements\nThat's forty five unknowns on the ballot and the Democrats you know they're getting all of this money poured into these house races because they've given up a lot on the Senate races there going all in the get the house\nAnd to really try to get in people's minds and\nMake them understand that for the Trump agenda to continue we really do need both houses\nBut is Nancy Pelosi as speaker and Maxine Waters is a committee chairwoman and Adam Schiff into committee chairmen and Gerald ... is a chairman [noise]\nIt just it's a disaster for us eight hundred dying for one

Democrats locked into two hundred and five seats and the remaining seats are up for grabs in other words they're toss ups in other words if\nWe win the seats and that means that Republicans will
