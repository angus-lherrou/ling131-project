President Trump and congressman Kevin McCarthy put ... house\nA north easterly turned a it'll be a little south of Atlanta Atlanta is not going to get the brunt of this at some point tomorrow but Gus the is going to be hit really really hard so draw a line from Panama City Beach Florida straight to Augusta, Georgia\nAnd if you're in any of those surrounding areas you are right in line of of the path of hurricane Michael and it's moving at a pretty rapid pace which means that will be there sometime tomorrow and then make its way up the coast through Columbia South Carolina into North Carolina\nAnd then we expect at that point it's probably going to go out to see a little bit but the bottom line is\nA this is a cat for borderline cap five hurricane\nAnd the strongest one ever to reach the Gulf Coast area there in the panhandle area and uh on top of it we got catastrophic storm surge\nThese destructive wind gusts hundred and Seventy five miles per hour and even higher ... over a million power outages we expect to occurring and not just near the coast but also inland after now this is hitting as we speak rainfall flooding is going to be a significant threat\nInto the Carolinas so uh everybody if if you're in\nIf you're in Georgia if you're in South Carolina of you're in North Carolina you know you can make their preparations now and I would listen to local authorities if they're telling you to get out get out and uh you can come back take whatever important pictures valuables you need to take with you packed the car move inland and protect your family and\nUh you know our thoughts and prayers are with everybody in harm's way today this is this is the real deal this is you know Florida governor scared to death for those who state\nThis is why you know at times they make predictions they tell you they're leaving it it's not as bad as they say it's gonna be this is one of those times it's as bad or worse than they predict that it's gonna be\nThe worst the worst hurricane ever for the panhandle in Florida that's how dangerous this is as it goes inland we're talking about in Augusta, Georgia you're going to be having eighty to a hundred mile an hour winds tomorrow same thing as your head up to Columbia South Carolina into the\nInto North Carolina so a lot of bad stuff happening our thoughts and prayers are with everybody and just no help will be on the way we live in the greatest country on earth with the most generous people on earth and whatever our friends and Florida Georgia\nThe Carolinas are going to need I Know that people will be there to to help in any way imaginable a we have some breaking news on the deep state as it relates to Rod Rosenstein others has really outrageous\nRod Rosenstein I'll think of everything that he was involved to think of how conflicted he as bad as it relates to all things deep state that we have been telling you about now for a year and a half he is the person\nIn May of twenty Seventeen recommending the firing of Jim Cole me he is the guy that appointed special counsel Robert Mueller\nHe is the guy that signed the third ... knew the fourth Pfizer application to spy on the Trump campaign associate Carter Page\nOr the bulk of the information in the ... of warrants as we all know now where the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for phony Russian ... that even its author\nChristopher Steele doesn't stand by and of course that was funneled money it was made to look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but a legal expense now he was now are supposed to testify but those three people now Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the former deputy FBI Director and James Baker again we just learned this you know this week\nJames Baker now the third person\nAre all saying that Rod Rosenstein talked at length about surreptitiously going into the oval office\nTaping the president of the United states by the way that would be without a warrant and then hoping he can get some information something from the president\nThat could then at night or ... or start the process of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove the president from office\nNow he's the dying it said he was being sarcastic said it was he was joking about it but the testimony of Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker all contradict what Rod Rosenstein is now saying\nWell Rod Rosenstein was scheduled to testify tomorrow to the house Judiciary Committee but unfortunately this hour there at an impasse and the impasse is over the terms of the testimony\nBecause lawmakers are calling for what is the standard congressional task force interview and insisting that Rod Rosenstein give a transcribed interview and that the interview be under oath\nHe's refusing to do so and those close to Rosenstein say they prefer a meeting and I'm sure they do or a briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers they don't want any paper trail they don't want to be under oath at all\nNow the house Judiciary Committee aides said on Wednesday they left the door open for a possible resolution there should be no resolution the resolution is to subpoena Rod Rosenstein and having testify under oath did he or did he not\nAs Lisa Page as Mick Andrew McCabe is James Baker all saying did he or did he not talk about wearing a wire against the president and the hope of getting something he says to help and both the twenty Fifth Amendment\nEither he did it or he didn't do it\nAnd then we can also talk about why he signed the the fourth and final buys a warrant application as it relates to Carter Page\nWhy why did he sign off on a document himself talked about well with regards to ... warrants you know that as an affidavit in career law enforcement swears to the validity of truthfulness\nAnd if they're wrong there's consequences well we all know the bulk of the size of applications including the last one\nIf there's one that shouldn't have been signed by that point they knew Hillary paid for it they knew that Dan St paid for it\nThey knew it was full of uncorroborated on verified information we're now nine months in two surveilling Carter Page by then you think they would have figured out that the CIA was phony and made up and even its own author\nOr couldn't prove any of its contents when questioned in in in Iraq a tour in Great Britain and said I don't know if any of this is true of just raw intelligence and people just pay and things like to hookers urinating in a bad in front of Donald Trump or in Moscow and the Ritz Carlton\nWell nobody ever verify that or corroborated that and it is if you're going to get an affidavit is is the law especially if the application Pfizer warrant\nAnd protocol that you verify the contents and the information you're presenting to a coat\nThe judge Kavanaugh compared to fifty four percent of Democrats a that is a good sign for twenty seven days and on top of that Democrats keep Everytime they open their mouth and they expose what they're real agenda is its investigation it's impeachment it's take the crumbs back\nAnd eliminate the the tax cuts that have been helping the economy so much then of course they want to keep Obamacare and actually\nQuote strengthen it\nIn other words making worst and on top of all of that eliminating ice and open borders is a lot at stake\nI when we come back a category for hurricane landing hundred and fifty five mile per hour winds\nIn the panhandle of Florida job is starting whether bell dot com he'll join us and

judge Kavanaugh I was a little worried about the enthusiasm gap that existed between Republican voters democratic voters\nAre that gap is now closed completely and in most instances when there was a

search warrant\nIn order to get five or a search warrant you need an affidavit signed by a career federal law enforcement officer who swears that information the affidavit is true and correct the best of his knowledge and beliefs\nAnd that's the way we operate and if this wrong sometimes it is if you find out as an incorrect in there that person is going to face consequences\nAnd if you find that anything's wrong in there that person is going to face consequences you got to fix your signature to this you know it was signed up for David they get a ... a warrant signed by a career law enforcement person\nSwearing that what you are presenting to the court is true and that you know it to be true and affirmed it to be true well\nThat didn't work out what the third renewal buys the application in the case of Carter Page a which is the fourth buys a warrant issued but the fourth one that was signed was signed by Rod Rosenstein\nAnd we all know that the bulk of information that was put in the ... and ...\nWell that was based on the pony Clinton bought and paid for ... that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day and that was never verified never corroborated and has turned out to be mostly debunked\nWhich is among the many other conflicts that Rod Rosenstein has of course he's the one that recommended firing Jim Comey\nHe's the one that signed the visor warrants he's the one that appointed Mueller\nAnd uh now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under oath and a two sources now telling Fox News at this hour\nThat Rod Rosenstein scheduled the parents before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse over the terms of the testimony\nAnd he doesn't want to have a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional taskforce interviews\nAnd those close to Rosenstein say well he prefers a meeting or a briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers where there's no paper trail where there's no under oath part well the question is why would he be afraid to go under oath\nWell here to weigh in on this and much more\nUh as as impasse continues Mark Meadows he is the Freedom Caucus chairman and congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio also a Freedom Caucus member a and by the way would be in the house Judiciary Committee\nAll the interview of Rod Rosenstein um we also have learned in the last three days Mark Meadows I'll start with you that we now know that Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the deputy FBI directors under criminal investigation Lisa Page who is out at the FBI James Baker the top attorney the FBI they all are telling the same story that Rod Rosenstein said that he wanted to surreptitiously record the president of the United states\nIn the hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we there's a lot of questions were Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein\nOr not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name and I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness has you know your lead in had Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to tape the president but he wanted to use those tapes a to effectively have a de OJ who on the president of United States\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think the biggest thing is uh Shaun is is a let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one and I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measured\nWere not accurate and and yet somehow they get put in a a three oh two and they get used as a justification to actually a further investigation in terms of the president United States it's just sick and it truly is sick me\nAll right so what's the next step why isn't good latte and Gowdy demanding that that Rod Rosenstein appear tomorrow under oath and answer these questions whether or not he talked about several viciously taping the president of the United states for the purposes\nOf of ... twenty Fifth Amendment we need an answer to that\nYes we do and the American people need an answer and that's what we'll be pushing a chairman Goodlatte do he indicated that he would do that so now at the time obviously to get that done and that sure Mr Rosenstein gets in there to answer these\nImportant questions now that we know that there's there's actual documents that talk about what took place in that meeting back between may ninth and may seventeenth\nOf twenty Seventeen or he allegedly said that he was going to record the president and now that we have a ... individual who's come forward and said he took it seriously after talking with page and I'm Mr McCain who came right from that meeting so look we've got to subpoena we've got to bring him in so we asked the question\nI Will take a quick break more with congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina congressman Jim

minister\nIt's so worth looking into there is the reason is growing so fast so if you want to find out more here is a number for you eight\nFive five Ninety four Bible at eight five five nine four B. I. B. L. E. man\nWe can you\nCongressman Jim Jordan and congressman mark\nMeadows part so the next step then is what I mean do I do I need to give out the numbers are ... office and chairman Goodlatte its office and say call these men and demand that they subpoena under oath Rod Rosenstein ... well I don't know why that would be any hesitation\nConsidering that he is up to his eyeballs and everything the firing of combing the appointment of Robert Mueller the signing of the third buys a warrant and three people now saying that he's talking about taping the president of the United states in the context of possibly invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment what else do we need to get a subpoena for somebody\nWell uh hopefully I I Want I Would not encourage giving out anybody's phone number in your great at holding people accountable but here's what I Would say\nIs the fact that you're covering it you're listening interest and the people that that truly tune in on a regular basis to listen to you they need to make sure their member of Congress feels the heat and understands how important this is\nBut the other part of that is is Gemini or are trying to work today\nOr to to stress the importance of why transparency and and the fact that the deputy attorney general must come yet\nHe must raise is right in and say this is what I did and this is what I didn't do anything shy of that\nAre really uh would would be an indictment on his credibility\nYeah what about the president now talked about the classifying and releasing the un redacted Pfizer applications especially pages ten through twelve Seventeen through thirty for the final Pfizer warrant the one that Rod Rosenstein sign have either have you seen that particular Pfizer application\nI had not a song we need to see that we need to see the notes to take an after every time roots or goes in and talks with the FBI remember Mr ... told us that after each conversation he had with Glenn Simpson and Chris steel he would then contact present the FBI and he would sit down with them\nWould take notes we went to see all those notes of all those conversations we know they're at least twelve of those so the so called real too as we need the those and remember when the president first talked about classifying what we all asking to do this\nThree weeks ago he talked about any communications from Andy McCabe ... all those documents as well that would include McCain number so we we need all that information and again if you're ... find that reading your debt talks about how our great system of justice works\nSeated at a transparency give us the information that we need to see more importantly the American people need to be\nWell do you want to call chairman Gowdy it's too old to two to five six zero three zero be polite please do oh two two to five six oh three oh\nA chairman Goodlatte is too old to two to five fifty four thirty one too old to two to five fifty four thirty one we'll put them up on Hannity dot com and again be respectful but\nI think with all that's going on and they should demand that he testify under oath or thank you so much congressman Mark Meadows thank you congressman Jim Jordan and we appreciate your push for the truth\nWe need to get to the bottom of the [noise] All right we've got to take a break when we come back we got a lot more to come dam bond Gino Greg ... more on this also the latest on this hurricane that his pounding the Florida Panhandle as we speak\nHurricane Michael I'm much more Hannity tonight nine eastern on the Fox news channel we got a great show will tell you about that in a minute [noise]\n\n\nI'm Michelle milk and hear the gods now movie opens on October twelve dean Cain and the entire kept doing her job bringing this to during the big screen\nThe woman goes into a clinic comes out of there is no police report you might be\nWorried at the movies too scary it's not the mother of two I promise you can bring your teenage children to bring friends and family we have a unique opportunity to change hearts and minds of ocean don't miss out\nCormac God's mail is perhaps the most prolific serial killer in America you guys know rated PG Thirteen\nVicious the Democratic party can be\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics of the past with the Republican Party mature intimately familiar with where\nDemocrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night on Fox or you know a racist besides just you know the the phobic ... kind of stuff these identity politics grenades and Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapists line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics and for the first time shot in a long time\nWe had a president the White House who said we're not going to back down and cabinet we're not going to let you back then I work at a back\nYou up and we won one and that when I Believe is really just ... and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it but based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Martin County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior in a fight or in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or disgusting label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really\nA spice up the Republican base and I think we may have a we may have a a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and people are motivated or like the Rasmussen poll says\nUh than it would happen to them and looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy than Democrats are in a more determined to vote and the upcoming elections uses a dramatic twenty five points shift in just the last six weeks Greg Garrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend and and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks [noise]\nUm and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a massive amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim\nYou really can't ruin somebody's career and their life and you know the reputation a ... that they built up in the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of issues unfair now there are liberals and the media which is redundant\nUh who are show rabbit that they don't care about fairness today just care about their own political agenda however misplaced in wrong it may be\nAnd show you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is and they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country\nOr they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump they you know Republicans celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal um so all of this is in jeopardy damned bonds you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have they went so far in the cabin okay some frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed split the\nAnd you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempt to sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American I have a better life\nRight and showing the media and Greg just nailed it by the very you know the media and the Democrats\nSo it's it's it's symbiotic guy I mean it it's a host\nAnd a parasite at this point they're the same thing they have ginned up this rage not all but many of them against Donald Trump to such an intense for me to think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rapists Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic\nHe's been he's been called treasonous they ginned up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves and the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose the train rapists or whatever it's sick name they call the capital\nSo that that's what's leading to this psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen\nWhen is enough enough you attack this this American patriot and cabinet or you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's space and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their base\nFollow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans it is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nA the investigation and in peach ... Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize you is wrong and preposterous I could certainly explain how in a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible for Brett Kavanaugh but the more that these toxic individuals and all of the ones I mentioned\nEspecially Hillary Clinton are toxic uh the more that only drives Republican voters to the polls\nTo make sure that these people are are not ah in positions of power and will not be able to run the accomplishments\nOf Donald Trump which you've been incredible you know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than ... Obama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth and prosperity in modern American history and that is not\nJust made up I mean the statistics demonstrate that and so if Americans want to\nMaintain that prosperity 'em and add money to their wallets into private ah from government officials who loved to squander hard earned money from American taxpayers are their choices easy\nWell I didn't like what Kevin McCarthy introduced which is a bill to fully fund the Trump border wall\nOr the president has already spent about what three three and a half billion dollars you needs about twenty three billion dollars more to get the job done and I think that is certainly one of the big issues that Americans would be motivated to go out and vote for and the other I think\nYou know the president rightly said he could make as many as four more Supreme Court appointments\nThat is a massive issue at this point it is it's a tipping point for the courts you know if you think of the age in the health of some of the justices that there is no doubt there will be vacancies in the in years to come in the\nNear future ... and don't forget showing that the circuits in the district court the Supreme Court gets all of the attention you know it's the sexy story the highest court in the land quite obviously\nBut his Greg can tell you most of these cases that are ... reports to American businesses American individuals moms and dads out there are settled that the circuit court level they don't even make it to the Supreme Court and Trump already has\nWas uh twenty six appointees to the circuit courts and there's a couple of more are getting ready to to to be confirmed as well so this is a really big deal now um we have of course the Ginsburg seat a you know they could come open if Trump wins reelection bid may come up and\nI ... and I say that Sean I'm worried I mean I mean it I'm actually worried what will happen to the country if that seat if Ginsburg decides to step down I mean look what we just witnessed with cabinet can you imagine what's gonna happen if that seat comes open as a potential six three conservative majority and the courts\nLives

latest one that Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker of all said that that Rod Rosenstein or talked about surreptitiously taping the president\nThe United states in the hopes of getting something on tape but that might invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment\nThose are the same Rod Rosenstein that is up to his eyeballs and conflict having written a letter and recommended the firing a James call me the same guy the signed the fourth and final buys a warrant that we should have on redacted I'm released the American people that hasn't happened yet and the same guy that appointed Robert Mueller\nUh why wouldn't you want to testify Greg Jared under oath\nDoesn't wanna transcribed interview or anything under oath or which chairman Goodlatte and others are demanding why\nIf it's not recorded or not under oath Rosenstein can do what he always does this leave and the lie with impunity without putting in self in legal jeopardy too what Rosenstein really want to say\nOh you know Mr good lab which is Jude I sit down and have a cup of coffee and we'll chat a little bit too if Rosenstein words ally as as I suspect he might\nUm he doesn't he's not looking at a fashion misleading statement to Congress he's not looking at perjury because he can always deny the conversation ... ... remembers the which which is why this is so critically important\nWell they've got to do and they shot a subpoena him

middle of it\nAnd uh it's more devastating than we even thought it could be\nWell we had it going through as a category for my company from Sunday and as a matter of fact I Know my dad used to always say to me the if you have to tell somebody said something you must not say it loud enough but not everybody hears things a few days away so it was actually a that we put it out publicly with the Patriot post\nWhich is a conservative blog I Do a Monday morning\nTelling people that it's going to be but look here's the thing with this storm folks the first thing is this is not climate change or any evidence of it okay so you could see this coming you could see the whole pattern come back on TALK\nOf Sean ... on the sixteenth of September I said I'll I'll be seen you get an October probably because of a big golf right now you said it right on the show I Know\nRight right on the show and you could see the pattern setting up everything got together and that's why you see that every once in

weakening off its peak most of these hurricanes have we've been blessed and not like the thirties forties and fifties that hit on their peak now as far as the storm it's as if it made landfall\nAs a
