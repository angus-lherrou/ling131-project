Kavanaugh hearing s and McCain had still been alive what\nA great question I'd like to think so I ... I ... I I'm Sorry what was that\nI that I Would like to think so too but I Know how close he was it John McCain was\nBut you know what it it's it's one of these if things that really doesn't matter he did it he did it and that's what counts up I Will say that since McCain has passed away a Lindsey Graham's seems\nMore like the guy I knew back in the nineties that's all I'll say\nYou are listening to Rush Limbaugh America's gifts to broadcast the bumblebee I see Mitt for\nSeven can double you\nAll right to all of our listeners out there who are aged Seventy five are older and only one hundred

and only play book\nAnd we have chronicled this now for years on this program\nBut the stakes couldn't be higher for weeks from tonight I'm you might hear the words Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker of the house\nAnd committee chairman Maxine Waters and committee chairman Jerrold Nadler of New York I born Jew over and over again they don't have any vision to make your life better\nOr they do want to destroy Trump they want impeachment open borders ice eliminated keep their crumbs and Obamacare\nShort of that what else do they stand for\nSo if you got to start it's important to remember that you know it's an uphill battle in mid term elections the party that controls the presidency has only gain seats in the house of representatives three times in the last one hundred years\nYou have also on top of that you've got about forty retirements to deal with which means that the names on the ballot or new and different hopefully better in some cases\nBut are you better off today than you or two years ago as a matter of America better off today than it was two years ago\nIs America stronger than it was two years ago if the economy better off than it was two years ago\nIs the president keeping his word is promises to you the American people\nAre we know that on the issue of the tax cuts well at least kept his promise on the issue of ending burdensome regulation is kept his promise on building the wall he hasn't fully been able to do it because it hasn't been fully funded Kevin McCarthy introduced the bolt builds a day to fully fund the wall\nBut he has spent three point three and a half trillion dollars to\nFund the wall in our record unemployment and fourteen states we now have the lowest unemployment rate in over fifty years the last time it was this low was Nineteen sixty nine when the New York Mets shocked the world that won the world series that's how far back that goes\nHispanic American unemployment record lows African American unemployment record low women in the work force record low record low for Asian Americans also record low for a veterans who have come back from war they're getting employed as well to\nPresidents kept his promises on ... dealing with rogue regimes like Iran and North Korea the sanctions in Iran are now paying off\nWe see the Iranian economy about tank every day we see the whole issue with little rocket man we don't have a rocket being fired almost every other day that seems to be remaining on track the president hasn't given up anything in regards to that\nPresident has opened up an war we now have one of the largest oil reserves that was on available because of environmental extremism it's a vast wilderness and we just let it sit there\nAnd we haven't been able to tap into those resources or building the Dakota pipelines or the Keystone Pipeline that's all in the works now too\nIt's not a small deal is it that the president kept his promise and put to original is on the U.S Supreme Court they've now been confirmed he gave us the names of people that he was select from any selected from that list\nPromises made promises kept too short years and we see the benefits of the country\nAnd in twenty eight days for weeks from tomorrow from tonight you're going to tune in and we're going to find out what the results are the good news is is that you have the power here a lot more power than you even think\nPelosi's picking out the drapes Maxine Waters is thinking impeachment Jerrold Nadler once endless investigation nobody's thinking about what they're going to do for you we the people\nWhat are they going to do they're going to now finally come out against Obamacare no they love Obamacare they gotta now say you know what these tax cuts are working and it's creating jobs they're not going to do that either\nYou know we've learned a lot in the last couple of days and we're really going to dig down deep do a Hannity investigation and the next hour\nYou know while we've been so busy in the last three weeks covering the the blood joining of judge Kavanaugh leading up to his confirmation\nThere's been a lot of news that we have not been covering one of them is John Solomon Sarah quarter you know Byron York everybody Catherine heritage have all been breaking stories but\nYou know we have all the evidence now that things were far worse regarding the effort to literally on do\nAn election of the president first we know just to remind you can bring you back words a little bit\nRemember Hillary Clinton the single greatest obstruction of justice case slam dunk case in our history we know that Hillary Clinton obstructed justice when she deleted some painted emails and then use bleach pet and busted up devices with cameras were had her age do it that's obstruction\nBut of course she had friends in the deep state they took the case away from the field agents and brought it in a house with the upper echelon of the FBI and that would be called me and struck in company\nAnd told me and struck in particular they wrote the exoneration of Hillary in May of twenty sixteen long before they ever interviewed Hillary or the main people involved in the whole thing\nAnd then all of a sudden they interview her Peters drop one of the interviewers\nA man that thinks that Hillary should win a hundred million to zero and they exonerate Hillary three days later and then they launched the Russia investigation\nAnd exoneration before an investigation that means the fix was it if the field agents if they were allowed to do their job it never would have ended up that way because they would have followed the rule of law they would have they would have kept their pledge of equal application of our laws\nWell now the new evidence and remember then all everything goes back to the dossier that Hillary bought and paid for but\nWe now know that last week while we were covering the cabinet issue that the FBI general counsel James Baker remember he reported directly to James ...\nWell he told congressional investigators last week that an attorney\nOr by the company ... that's the company that Hillary's campaign and she was controlling the DNC money according to Don and Brazil well they were funneling money into Perkins Kuwait which is a law firms so it would show up on campaign finance report says illegal cost\nIt turns out they would hire fusion GPS in our research group\nThen went out and hire the former and my six agent or the name of Christopher Steele Christopher Steele uses Russian sources he himself doesn't even stand by any of his sources he doesn't believe his own dot CA when push came to shove and an inter August ... Great Britain\nYou want me to put on a wire and tape Trump anyway but it appears that\nKnow that's not how top FBI officials took it\nThe thing that struck me the most was the serious look on Baker's face when he was describing it according to a source\nClose to the investigation of of bakers house interview he was saying that may have been page took it seriously because they took it seriously but as he took it seriously other words they all thought he meant it\nWhich is now I Know the president met yesterday with Rod Rosenstein apparently that's a meeting on air force one\nStatement says they got along you know fine but\nNo Rod Rosenstein is up to his eyeballs and everything involving this thing [noise]\n\nThe voice of New York [noise]\nSeven ten W O\nSeventy six degrees at three thirty

next traffic update four oh five and seven ten wor\n[noise]\n\nRaining swab politician at a time this is Sean Hannity show\nTwenty five until the top of the hour scary hurricane season continues and hurricane Michael now is headed straight for the Florida Panhandle looks like it could hit land at a category three\nA and there's a massive storm surge risk for the panhandle and and the entire area that would be destined Fort Walton Beach uh and surrounding communities and uh is hurricane warning storm surge warnings have all been issued along the Gulf Coast\nAs I understand that we have some evacuations now taking place and it looks like it's a really big threat to the panhandle thoughts and prayers go to our friends down in\nThe panhandle area we check in with both job of started the official weather man of the Sean Hannity show and of course he's with weather bell dot com and spin I'm being told that the worst storm to hit the Florida Panhandle and like decades how bad is\nWhy I say I think it's going to be the or maybe the worst on record in Panama City\nOr that area particularly last major hurricane to hit coming in at this angle was a hurricane ... back in Nineteen Ninety five hurricane cage\nIt there in November believe it or not have Ninety eighty five that was a major hurricane in the Gulf but a week into a category too when it went through there\nSo this is probably going to be the benchmark storm for that Panama City area now the fortunate thing is if we want to cover the a sort of the silver lining here\nPensacola and mobile are going to get north wins and mobile I don't think this is a big deal and mobile Pensacola go forty ... sixty maybe three four inches of rain\nBut once you start moving east southeast would down the coast and especially in Panama City area\nThis is going to be as bad as you see in that particular area\nThe weather pattern you remember Florence was off its peak when it hit the north Carolina coast this one because of the weather pattern is intensifying as it comes to the coast and I don't expect anything to stop it from being a strong category where he perhaps even\nA a borderline category for upon landfall very well telegraph in this pattern you remember Shawn last time I was on with you I said I'll I'll probably see for a week in October\nWhy why why is this now getting stronger the way you're describing and ... what does it mean to look to the average person including me has no idea why the actual angle of the ... when it reaches land matters so much why does the angle of the storm matter\nAnd it's also the overall pattern one Florence was coming into pattern in the western Atlantic was a weakening as far as tropical cyclones on September twentieth believe it or not Japanese meter optical agency it's maps came out and said look out October of ...\nThrough about the nineteenth and the Atlantic basic you notice all the tycoons have shut down in the western Pacific completely and he said well what is it has to do with us well when the action stops there like\nA good last year it shifted into the Atlantic basin and that's what you see going on folks as you can watch this stuff\nComing to three weeks away now I Can't tell you well is it going to New Orleans or is it going to Tampa oh or whatever I could say this general area has got to look out during this time that's what we saw it once we got so last Thursday and friday you know than showing knows I emailed him down all this stuff to get him ready about this\nYou could see this coming right up into the Gulf of Mexico so that area has not been touched remember we hit Louisiana and Mississippi with Gordon Alberto\nWe hit it off to the east over there with or it's this is going right in between and instead of coming western North West setting it's heading into classical fashion from the south west corner race through the Carolinas so you folks in the Carolinas you're going to have a fast moving tropical storm go through there and unfortunately\nA lot of these areas that were hit by Florence is going to be another three to six locally ten inches of rain\nComing Thursday night into friday morning friday the storm will be between Kate Patterson Norfolk go right out to sea to the south of New England no problem in the north east from it but it is going to be a big problem even in the Carolinas\nOr because of the fact that there's more rain coming\nSo you're going to you're basically saying this is going to come up through the Florida Panhandle it's going to sort of veer right hit the Carolinas hard and then go out to sea\nOh I'm Out of style they don't like that is combative they don't like that he breaks dishes they don't like that he fights they don't like that he is at times not polite\nUm they don't like that he's a disruptor ...

application for the Pfizer Warren wiretap on the Trump campaign was done\nAt the direction of a political opponent Hillary Clinton and that's entirely illegal for both the FBI department of justice

elite strategy to destroy Trump before the election oh hookers in a bad urinating into an the Ritz in Moscow\nAnd then literally linking it strategically to get the special counsel may you know using the same source of information but making it appear like there are numerous sources here so they're all saying the same thing so creating enough smoke\nSo that there would be right fire\n'em and all the FBI guys they all knew it wasn't true from the beginning Lisa Page even testify to that in fact\nThat's right I mean you cannot use double triple quadruple here say from anonymous sources to launch an a counterintelligence investigation that is strictly prohibited yet shown that is exactly what the FBI and the deal jaded and John\nThere's a you know there was a guy that if I had a few weeks ago that they can get a lot of attention 'cause he's a nondescript guy but his name's bill priest that he was ... strokes boss he was the chief of counter intelligence that the FBI he told he told the congressional uh a committee that\nAt the time they were admitting that price\nBeing that information from Christopher Steele ... they had just gotten betting if they hadn't been and yet the standard for the fight is it must be substantiated before you can submit it to the court records it exactly right they they hadn't even begun to substantiate process and get through using it in presenting it as a fancy to verify the court when you look at this\nPoint they willingly lied before Pfizer port and light it as an advisor court application and they also purposely withheld key information like an act that Hillary pay for it or how much of these are crimes ear\nOh you know you just defies alone is deprivation of rights under color of law known as abusive power so-so perjury because they signed off on it or under penalties of perjury it's obstruction of justice\nIs also a conspiracy to defraud the government to fight the court is in existence\nBecause when we get all

listening for the Justice Department nightmare guy who said hey there might be some problems here we don't really want you to do this he should keep in mind this is the Justice Department that hit

right there John Solomon great work well have you on Hannity tonight Greg jar we'll see you on Hannity tonight eight hundred nine four one Sean is our toll free telephone number\nA weird twenty eight days away for weeks from today the most important mid term elections one of the big issues on the ballot is health care or going to explain why and what the Republicans ought to be offering as an alternative to Obamacare next [noise]\n\nAnd let's say God Forbid somebody and and I would ... the fifty dollars a month that I pay for your care which is unlimited that takes care of the Ninety eight percent of whatever my needs happen to be\nBut then I have to get a catastrophic plan the God Forbid I had the bad heart attack or the God Forbid I get cancer or the God Forbid I got in a bad accident right\nRight and you you don't have a car insurance for gasoline you don't have home owners insurance for lawn care insurance just for the big things and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last eight ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled we need to do is insured less which is how every other insurance product works they keep it that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nMath and how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility the atlas MD and Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors and over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your age and you give concierge care at all I could pick up a phone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches and it's an emergency you know a lot of history and phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and\nUm you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet health care is access to your doctor yeah\nAll right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model that they have duplicated how you you've been out and about and a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this modern last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota\nAnd then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr grows in terms of your president of duck a doctor patient care foundation you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation was a physician or on health policy think tank because doctors never seemed to be at the table whenever we're having some conversation about health care\nSo we put traditions are backing off the table to have conversations\nPersonally I I also have a primary care practice much luck out what Seventy here in southwest Florida the practice of any health are plus when you was you know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services solid does is create obstacles to access some\n... ... ... ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us from all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country was coming down medical tourism\nAre and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing about health insurance we're just using it for all and you know when somebody is\nYou know pay twice the amount of money for a service because the ... one of the insurance is using insurance drives up the cost of the other products\nSo an MRI cash price for us is two hundred and twenty dollars while using her your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops ticket it authorized\nYour co pays five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again the more people are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or I'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical\nI'm an ... solution so but I'm pleased to see the worst shifting the conversation from a coverage for everyone I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care\nThat the real close enough I was about to testify on us some help committee on the ...\nIt be a better idea I mean I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shock to gather news and who is now offering free health care for everybody it whether you're a taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally\nEverybody's going to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick um because people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance and that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay\nFor every illegal immigrant in the country but the ...\nHow it is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas empty and I would be your patient Dr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my\nDoctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved for service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much does the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it but the big things heart attack a accident or cancer how much would one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars to family five hundred dollars per year or a month a month\nOr so and the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage if the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars\nPer household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household a the the real ... and the the politician there has in California is to send him an originality this throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it\nWhat we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get Mets cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable\nI'm actually looking at ways it's fundamentally fixing the system fast what we need not just promises of more spending\nWay and if I could add add to that just a a you know plus the cost of care you know people ask us as well how can I just get major medical you know we\nWe can afford what what services the ... armored care practices providing but we just need something catastrophic well mama care made that illegal or so little stretching just brought by\n... with access these major medical plan called ... short term medical plans and some would argue that these are actually true insurance they don't cover anything except the major medical expenses for Seventy five dollars a month or\nWhat it is this can be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model it already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for outlets MD and they have a preexisting condition or Dr ... denied them service\nThat everybody's welcome everybody's price the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients ... will not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to be judged by their illness\nHow did you get to who directly negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\nBoy I Wish I could say was because we're so darn good at it um that the truth is it's so much more simple than that I\nHave a doctor's in forty four states are allowed to work directly with pharmaceutical wholesalers so just like you can go to Costco and get something for much cheaper because you pay a membership\nWe do the same thing and we're able to\nGet the you know the actual cost of medicine might be at ten dollars for a thousand pills and because we don't have a staff of seven people per physician fighting insurance we can\nLower the cost and and pass the savings on directly to the patient that this is a win for everybody we we don't take care of of Republicans or Democrats we take care of people\nSo how does somebody had a group of doctors in New York say implement those cars they're going to look at this and say fifty bucks a month I Can't make ten cents off of that\nWhat they're gonna have to move to New York because they don't make it easy but they could work with a pharmacist in New York state's one of the few states that make it a very difficult but then a pharmacist could say um if you do a five dollar a month membership with them then you get the medicine that cost that would be an amazing model it it would cut down there\nRight let's take her to York out of the equation or California out of the ... let's say any other state Louisiana Florida huh hum I don't know Missouri yeah how do they do it\nIt's as simple as signing up effect shopping on Amazon there's there's almost nothing to it um\nYou know we have one supplier that makes it very easy overnight shipping and that's just it if I Want to buy a bottle of a hundred pills of blood pressure medicine I can if I Want to buy a thousand pills I Can't and it's about the same price um but it's fundamentally cheaper than\nWhat about Lindsey Graham is saying that what only block grant the money that we're already providing to individual states and let them come up with these innovative you know like centers of innovation all around the country and I think naturally people would move toward your system\nI I I Would agree with the logic or the federal government's basically saying we've given your money with strings attached before and we haven't received full value for that because we've wage you down with regulatory burden so we're going to cut those strings and just give you the money and say go forth and do the best job that you can\nMake a quick break we'll come back more Dr Josh amber outlets MD and Dr Lee s grows president ah docks for a patient care foundation\nLeone groceries the president of docks for patient care foundation and the founder of
