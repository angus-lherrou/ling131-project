I saw him near the punch bowl and he was given out red solo cups too people that's not drug in girls on a nearly weekend basis and lining up in the halls to gang raped women\nYoung girls and you'd have to believe that if that happened that regularly and was that well known there would be some cooperation\nThat somebody would have told at the time or a law enforcement official a teacher a parent that this was happening or this happened or their drug young kids and and then lining up to rape young girls\nAnd it's gotten so absurd now that you have the senator from Hawaii wanting to investigate the ice throwing incident from Brett Kavanaugh apparently through ice in a bar when he was in college\nPolice documents that show that Brett Kavanaugh through ice in someone's face during a bar fight why he was in college do you feel that that is in any way just qualify for someone who's in a Supreme Court [noise]\nJuly we need and has the ins and because there are a lot of allegations as far as really are about how he behaves by hand truck\n[noise] All right so we're at the end of this process now it's interesting that the Senator Grassley in a written declaration release late last night that\nWe got a hold of at the Fox news channel an ex boyfriend of professor Ford's uh was the California professor accusing Brett cabin on that particular case\nAnyway directly contradicting her testimony under oath to last week that she had never help anyone prepare for a polygraph examination\nFormer boyfriend whose name was redacted in the declaration also said the poured\nNeither mentioned Kavanaugh ... mentioned that she was a victim of sexual misconduct during the time that they were dating from around Ninety two to Ninety eight and he said that he saw for going to great lengths to help a woman that he believed was a lifelong best friend prepare for a potential polygraph test\nAnd he added that the woman I had been interviewing for jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office in further claim the Ford never voice any fear of flying even while aboard a propeller plane that they were on\nSeemingly having no problem living in a very small five hundred square foot apartment ... look\nThese are the small details to me I and I some of you may think this was all significant\nAnd at the end of the day she said there were four people\nThat could corroborate her story none of them\nCan corroborate her story most don't remember any party like this and the one eye witness that she placed in the room at the time of the alleged assault said it didn't happen so at that point you've got to presume somebody's innocent\nYou don't know the place you don't know the time you have a date you don't have a location is nothing that the FBI can do except take your statement and assuming that the for people that have already been interviewed again under penalty of a felony\nYou got to assume that they didn't commit perjury and commit a felony when the FBI came back to ask the same questions and if they\nDid then okay that would be a pretty big deal there's no indication up to now based on reporting that has come out on all the people that have been spoken to a lot of people are making a big deal over the fact well they haven't spoken to professor forward but I mean professor Ford has now told their story multiple times and I've got to believe and assume\nThat they're they're thinking\nAnd that well her story hasn't changed you just said at last week before the Senate Judiciary committee I'm just I I just there's there's so much at stake I Want to get into what this all means\nBecause what it means matters you know at the end of the day what this means for the country for the future of the country all that matters\nLindsey Graham is saying Clinton sects accuses were treated a hell of a lot worse than professor Ford and I I think the Republicans held the\nActually did something well I think they handled it with the level of seriousness a

Kevin\n[noise] by that was Lindsey Graham has been very powerful all throughout these hearings\nAnd he had a moment last week during those hearings were bred cabin on Dick Durbin wanting is FBI investigates the alright they've had the FBI investigation now we know that we can have an up or down vote in the Senate so who's going to vote yes and who's going to vote no because we have one party\nThat in every single case even though there is no cooperation even though facts on the ground continue to shift didn't change where we don't know a data location people that are supposedly eyewitnesses to alleged\nActs of violence say it didn't happen\nAnd the stories change about well they're putting drugs in the in the punch\nAnd boys are lining up almost on a weekly weekend basis to rape girls are lining up in the halls while he was around the punch bowl when he gave out some red solo cups that's what that evolved into you know at what point is there no shame here at what point do we not understand how\nDeeply dangerous this is for every American because we're throwing due process and the presumption of innocence literally out the window\nNewt Gingrich is with us a former speaker of the house with thirty four days away from an election best selling book Trump's America the truth about our nation's great comeback while I guess that's on the ballot and thirty four days how are you\nI'm doing well and I think you know you can't have shame if you're only interest is raw power and that's where we've seen a Dianne Feinstein deliberately holding the letter was about raw power\nOf the fact that you have a democratic senator who says if you're for Kevin all your complicit with evil such\nRaw power or the kind of smearing dishonest questions and the accusations that we've seen that raw power and that is what this election is about this election will decide what kind of country we are\nTo Iraq how ... how many Americans are really comfortable for this kind of character assassination dishonesty and all out effort to destroy decent people and I think that's gonna be in it that is truly on the ballot even if it's not on the ballot because all of us have now seen\nRight there on television and editing without distortion we've seen how bad these people are\nWell I just you know on a level that we've never seen before and I guess it really comes down there are five people but I think it really two of the Democrats that would've considered voting\nFor judge Kavanaugh there'll only do it I Believe in fact there's enough Republicans to get them over the finish line but it comes down to Susan Collins that comes down to Lisa Murkowski and\nSenator Jeff snowflake who is on his I Want to be president trip to New England as we get most of the week and his media tour which is second to none so how does this end up\nWell I mean I think in the short run that\nI I'm an optimist I think that the the basic decency a judge Kevin all of his family ah the sense that most Americans have that he has been a smear treated with a vicious personal in fact all those things I think means that\nThe Susan Collins who was going to vote yes and he's going to be confirmed probably by Monday or Tuesday and Wednesday and he'll be on the court but the deeper underlying lesson that all of us should learn\nAbout who these people are how they operate how truly dishonest and vicious they are I Hope to that stage for a very long time\nLet me ask you a thirty four days out of an election you were there as a strategist when Reagan became president for the first time in forty years you ran on something and you got the entire\nCaucus of Republicans house and Senate to agree to nationalize an election and make promises to America you call the contract with America and that you would you\nPromised you would vote on ten specific items in the first hundred days of which you did accomplish that task and Republican for the most part with a few bumps pickups in the road\nHave been in power since um how to Republicans now I think the anger of the bases beyond anything I've seen in recent years rightly so over what's going on with the Kavanaugh hearings and the Democrats\nDemocrats don't have a vision for the future we had I ate horrible years of Obama we've had two very successful years of President Trump what is the pitch what what should the Congress men and women and senators be saying\nWell first of all the president has done a great job he watches various trips sessions Mississippi will be in Minnesota and he's laying out the case\nThat if you want results you have a team called Republicans\nAnd if you want resistance you've got a team called Democrats\nAnd he's been laying up and and you see it and the numbers than people realize the lowest unemployment for African Americans in history lowest unemployment for Latinos a continuous economic growth many good things that are happening thank the president is set the stage now to pit and spent the last five weeks\nTelling us what's coming next\nWe got this much damage you know ... I loved the vice President Pence said and I said America's coming back you know what I'm saying we're back yet because we're not\nWe still have a lot of work to do but we're coming back and now you have a chance for the president's leadership and I think this will actually be about which kind of America do you want us to be we want us to keep coming back keep creating jobs do you want us to control the border to save our children ... Thirteen gangs\nProfessional and promote people that are you prepared to be part of a chain ones constitutional judges not radicals I think we got campaign could be stunningly successful and we can have as much fun on election night as we had in two thousand seven\nWhy I mean I hear optimism in you that I look I'm going to be honest I don't quite share it I'm not there with you I think it can happen I Believe it's winnable\nI Believe the Republicans can keep the house I think that Rick Scott can win the Senate in Florida I think Republicans can defeat Joe Donnelly and Indiana a U.S a Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nClaire McCaskill in Missouri I think they can beat Heidi Heitkamp I think Martha ... a great candidate out in Arizona I think Dean Heller can hold the same Nevada but I think they're all tight races and then you've got then we've got about fifty competitive house races which could tip the balance of power they're\nShown course now that's probably have campaigns but we've got we've got thirty five days out here to go out and when and and I remember it and you remember 'cause your air two thousand six two weeks out I Do an interview Megan Kelly\nHow we're going to lose

your health insurance they're talking about bankrupting the country and I think that we just have to go out and wage campaigning I must say\nPresident Trump is doing as good a job of getting out on the stump telling the truth laying it out as anybody I've ever seen and I I Believe in the American people my optimism grows out of a belief that the average hardworking decent American his disgusted\nBy what they just saw happened to Kevin ... is is committed to a work ethic due to a better future and as the Democrats get more radical I think you're going to see\nThe Republicans continue to do a you know for example\nA government run health care means tax paid abortion well they're very few places in America where there's a majority for your tax dollars paying for abortions

don't believe it's going to be able to legally go down that road but this is what they do this is who they are in Sean I Want to see is the last couple of days you have done a fabulous job winning out the hypocrisy here [noise]\nUm I mean if if we're going to have a serious conversation about drinking in high school and drugs in high school and adult conduct of a domestic violence when you have incumbent democratic\nMembers of the Senate with court records well out there well discuss uh and and and suddenly this is no longer part of the conversation or can't be discussed I mean this is crazy this is crazy I mean I think they've gone down the road here that they're going to regret long term because every\nI I don't I don't think so because it's sort of like what Harry Reid lied about Mitt Romney Adam pay taxes in ten years\nAnd then he was asked after the election if he cared about lying about Mitt Romney's way there is no we won the election what's the difference and the ... the means for the I think the left so believes conservatives are evil that they feel justified in whatever it is that they say that's right you know but the problem is here this is so serious an allegation\nAnd you know I'm not the biggest fan of the Republican Party I'm not a Republican I've been very critical when they're weak in timid and stupid and I would say they have handled this what the appropriate amount of serious this they have ballot\n... what is a fair system they've given every possibility shadow of a doubt and now it's time to vote now the question is Kelly where Susan Collins where's Lisa Murkowski and where it's just not going to vote\nAt at writing I'm Down to three any Mitch McConnell I had been a real war here and pushing for a look at Germany Grassley knocked on the Internet and I think that in a crap\nYou're exactly right it would have been taking a week ago if we would have like ... or ... or San I named him here that we might not arrow in the air and I think that not because I had any faith and Democrat\nAt the high that they have clinical calculation didn't mind you have your mansion looking at it gate or\nThirty percent margin that people are getting out what the ... and ... ... margin to people of North Dakota once the cat and knock at first it would be a little bit\nMore high camp or match in Oregon and we can not vote for that nominee don't get people to get that God might get out of their own political okay\nWell that's exactly right well I mean yeah I mean high camp and and Manchin but I think\nI don't think they go that way a less Collins and Murkowski or a combination of of Collins and and flake or or Murkowski inflate once the Republicans have the vote then they'll have the freedom to go and I don't think the Democratic leadership because of of flying hoot about their\nConstituents in West Virginia Florida North Dakota\nIndiana Missouri because if they did they would say vote your conscience I mean Jeff Flake the hero of the Democratic party\nWhy because he admits season on principle man that would never vote the way he really felt because he's only doing this because he's he's lifted up the burden of having to face the horrible voters again\nAnd that was a horrible admission on sixty minutes\nYeah yeah and I I mean [laughter] don't\nGet real does wrong principle is a man that stands on yet I'll use\nIt as a man who wrote a book mimicking Barry Goldwater's the conscience of the conservative ... and it you know if he is then now we have a moment to stand up\nHe thinks he's going to be president let me just first to tell Jeff Flake Jeff delusion [laughter] you\nAre delusional you will never be the president of the United states not in my lifetime All right out of your thank you both for being with us he couldn't get his teen votes I mean he was like at nine percent of his own state race it off to the northeast\nNew Hampshire's not interested in Jeff Flake and neither is Iowa\nI mean so out of touch and its own nobody's interested in the guy that says though I'm only voting this way 'cause I don't have to face the voters again oh so every other vote was because you wanted to get reelected and you didn't care about what principles were involved in a particular vote\nRight quick a break we'll come back coming up we'll Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova as we continue from our nation's capital

IRS call right down this number eight five five four seven seven twenty to fifty five\nEight five five IRS called on the Web it's rush tax resolution dot com\nYou on TALK we'll rated number one seven ten W O o voice of New York and\nYou have to have some corroboration for what you said thirty six years ago if you say there's an eye witness to an event the eyewitness contradicts what you say that's a problem\nIf you're giving different recollections indifferent sent us a cases in scenarios that you've outlined that's a problem if all of a sudden you're accusing somebody\nOr something and it gets printed by the New Yorker and the New York times of all places well they spend an entire week calling dozens of people and they learn that the accuser is calling former classmates asking them if they remembered what happen because the accuser saying to them well she's not really sure what happened\nThen you got the whole well they were putting drugs and they were ... girls almost on a weekend basis I went to ten of these parties myself\nAnd and he's one of them and and boys were lined up in the halls and after these girls were drug they were gang rape train raped as they were lying in the hall\nAnd the NATO balls into while I saw him near the punch bowl and and I saw him give red solo cups to people and well he wasn't standing in line but I saw him he was in a whole um that is so over the top\nAnd the fact the media would run that interview with so many inconsistencies in all cases\nNo corroboration not the case of professor poured not the case of Mr Ramirez and not in the case with Julie sweat Nick know co-op corroboration Joe ... tore tons to go with us the gentlemen\nOf being welcomed both have you back to the program I'm Victoria and start with you get your take on all those\nWell the new media standard is very very interest for Republicans it's it's you can say John Smith rape somebody oh we can't prove that we don't have anybody else you don't have any witnesses so we're telling you you know what our problems are with our story but nevertheless\nJohn Smith rape somebody named that's that's what the media's going with John I it's really important that your listeners know about what happens here in Washington when there's a high publicity investigation because I was involved in one in the Nineteen eighties with Ronald Reagan's\nUh the CIA director bill Casey\nAnd it was all over the the papers how they you know how soon we all forget about these things but it I was with the Senate intelligence committee and we got fetch far ranging\nBizarre accusations about Casey\nCasey met me in a park and held me up with a gun bill Casey took all my stocks and sold them kept the money for himself I mean they were just radically out of a wild and that happens all the time in these investigations and you know what we didn't make any of the public and even the Democrats back then\nDid not make them public and yet we have Kamala Harris\nI'm I'm told she's a lawyer she was the attorney general was California She's supposed to know due process she released an anonymous chain do accusation that's how the person signed it about Brett Kavanaugh committing some lurid sex acts\nIs there no decorum left in the U.S Senate anymore aren't going to sanction her in any way\nOh Alan Dershowitz was saying that isn't the case of Julie sweating that can particular that\nIf in fact she you know she made the statements and they're probably falls that he would want a full complete investigation into perjury allegations um you know Joe I I I don't know what the law enforcement should do I do know that\nIs I Know that we have now we examined every single case\nIn every case there is no corroboration in every case there is multiple inconsistencies in the last case Julie sweating like there are so many inconsistencies in his mind numbing that NBC would ever aired that interview but they are today anyway\nThe eyewitnesses are the witnesses she mentioned one is dead one doesn't even know who she is and they can't get an answer from the other two\nAnd now the last minute 'cause they're desperate now they want the FBI investigating ice throwing incidents in high school\nYeah well I think um what has happened with Julie sweat Nick is that the Senate committee after the confirmation vote occurs needs to make a criminal referral\nTo the Justice Department or the U.S attorney for the district of Columbia to investigate her for obstruction of a congressional proceedings by submitted false affidavits and for perjury is written testimony very easy to investigate and it has to be done in order to send a signal\nTo everybody out there that you cannot simply make false statements to a congressional committee in a confirmation process to get your self publicity that is very very important that miss what may\nBe investigated by a federal grand jury to act as a deterrent against others from making false accusations there is no substantiate for her story there is no substantial issues permits Ramirez story and I just wanted to say something that I Know\nUh probably showing you don't agree with she has repeatedly lied and liked her lawyers did not tell her that the committee was willing to come to California to interview her that is alive\nLawyers did tell her that no good lawyer would never community\nShow I got I got to tell you I don't think they told her if you remember in that moment when professor Ford was asked when I forgot maybe it was Lindsey Graham who or whoever it was said we offered to go to maybe Senator Grassley I think both Senator Grassley and then she said\nI ... there was genuine surprise remembered Dianne Feinstein was working behind the scenes together a radical left wing activist resistor as a lawyer this is Deborah cats\nThey ever catch by the way who said well Paula Jones only spend ten or twelve minutes with with Bill Clinton it wasn't a big deal that wouldn't constitute sexual harassment in the workplace and also defended\nIn the case of Al Franken but I I saw genuine shocking surprise and she goes well but I didn't know that but that was very nice do you if you offered that I didn't know why should\nThey should he referred to the D.C bar then for violation of professional world\nI I may I may very well come to conclude that eventually and I'm perfectly happy to accept that I can buy that and I'll tell you something that really bothers me about her story and as an old prosecutor who tried sex crimes cases\nHere's here's the one thing about her story besides everything else we talked about that doesn't make any sense any victim in a situation like that goes to where people are for safety now why is her story not include her going to those people\nBecause if she had done that if she ... literally if if what she says the Kurds and if she had gone to those people get what they would have remembered that in order for her to have a story that holds up without anybody knowing about it she had to leave the house\nI don't know though and look maybe you know 'cause we're talking about the we all know that there are real evil predators\nThere are people that do murder and rape innocent people there are people that will drug and rape people I eat look at the bill Cosby case\nWe know that and and this is why I think that the Republicans credit they took these allegations in charges seriously\nThey handled it professionally they imported every combination which was the right thing to do but for the Democrats they just they just now have pushed this so far\nInto a ... ... ... any allegation no matter how many inconsistencies no matter no evidence no matter no cooperation whatsoever and we saw that they hated the guy from the beginning\nOh I don't I don't know what I don't know what victims remember or don't remember Joe and I don't know what how they act or react I Would assume was probably ... people react differently like you go to a funeral some people are crying some ...\nI was I was perfectly happy to accept anything that she had to say and I listen to her testimony carefully at the time and his and then I went back and I looked at it repeatedly and it may very well be that she believes everything she said\nThe problem is there's not a sin pillar of evidence to corroborated and conveniently enough\nEverything that could have happened that would have made her story corroborate rubble is nonexistent the shorter than happen that just doesn't happen\nSean ... let me just say well you know we make our living trying to look at stories like this and picking them apart are supporting them there's another problem with her story listen she said that they they're rich music on an upstairs bedroom that's kind of weird because the party was downstairs that let's take it and they turned them music up so nobody could hear her\nAnd then she likes to south in the bathroom and she can hear them talking going downstairs what you think these guys and it just turn the music ups and one could hear it went over and then said let's turn it down so many flaws in what she does say\nJust don't know what look I I it's very hard I don't want to get into that whole aspect of it I got to take a break we'll come back more with Victoria Toensing Joe diGenova next\nAnd then your calls coming a
