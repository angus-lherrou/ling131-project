Bush didn't care about black people because of the way he handles Hurricane Katrina\nNow the left hates him because he is embracing\nThe president and saying to black people take a look at this guy substantively rather than automatically being always on the side of the Democrats I spoke with the president and a couple of weeks ago and suggested he talked to kind of a gym round the football great and Tiger Woods the great\nSo that's why it hurt don't told Trump to bring these guys in the I shouldn't unknown\nI should've known Geraldo told Trump to get Kanye West and Erin Jim Brown and tiger tiger hasn't been yet but you know that Geraldo did bring up a or something I forgot it was\nKanye West who told George W. Bush\nThat\nHe didn't think he cared about black people because Hurricane Katrina boy that remember when Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans the left was out there saying that Bush wanted blacks in Louisiana New Orleans to be hurt so that they would leave\nAnd go to Texas or someplace to lessen the strength of the Democratic party in Louisiana they were out there saying that the Bush also a was able to steer the hurricane\nAnd that Bush was responsible for the Lebanese being weak because he didn't hold people accountable when they didn't spend the money to shore them up but it was Kanye West so can you hear all kinds of crab back then in two thousand five rip it in the Bush they loved him\nBut the love was sleeping obviously be right back\nTo Russia Mickey I met were Rush Limbaugh\nWhen my cardiologist told me I needed to take a stat and robbed to lower my cholesterol he also told me that it can lower my natural levels of co Q. ten [noise] he told me to take ... it has the number one cardiologist recommended\nForm of co Q. ten a very important nutrient for healthy heart and healthy blood pressure levels with three times better absorption as the number one cardiologist recommended form of ... take to know them better co Q. ten [noise]\nTonight tonight central on ABC finish the sentence for millennia Trump is the first lady the\nInterview can women in the me too movement call us support or no questions is off limits you're not the first first lady to\nHave to deal with her husband's alleged infidelity has put a strain on your marriage tonight what will the lawyer Trump say let's talk about the jacket this\nWhy did you wear being ...

James O'Keefe is going to join us and a Democrat reticent who's running against Marsha Blackburn who's now began to pull away in the polls a little bit there him and his campaign and his campaign staff caught on tape absolutely saying he's lying to the people of tendency\nBut the very purpose of getting elected and they say it not once but they say it over and over and over and over again I don't play for you later in the program today but I mean it is it is mind numbing that people have zero\nTruth or or ability or character that they can be honest with who they are and what they believe and the problem for Brett us in just like the problem for people like Claire McCaskill or Heidi Heitkamp or Joe Donnelly a or send them all oh wait do we get to the tape on sentiment today\nOr you know some of these other Democrats that are running Jon Tester\nIs they can't be honest\nWith who they are and be honest with their voters of what they're going to do when they get to Washington if they get to Washington\nBut then when they get their here's what they're going to do even though they're in red states that overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump\nThey're going to get to Washington and they're going to vote for Chuck Schumer of that sort of first vote and then they're going to vote with Chuck Schumer Ninety eight percent of the time because that's what Democrats do there is no voice of moderation in the modern Democratic Party\nI got to get one little tip part of the hat to Joe Manchin of West Virginia frankly why he stays a Democrat in this day and age I have no idea\nWhat Republicans also offering\nSolutions and answers and solving problems and the numbers Barrett out all across the board which is why you know historically in mid term elections people don't like to show up but if you don't show up all of the progress that we've made in the next two years is in jeopardy\nAnd you're gonna get endless investigation possible impeachment they have stated publicly they want their crumbs back they have stated publicly in other words they want to raise taxes well that's that's what created the last eight years of Obama\nWhich put Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps eight million more in poverty and he became the only president in history ever to never reach three percent GDP Growth in a single year and he gave up on manufacturing jobs of post jobs so never coming back\nWell in less than two years Trump brought back more than four hundred thousand of them\nHalf the time he brings it back not only by ending burdensome regulation and asking businesses well what ... what can we do to help facilitate you working here and building here in\nCreating factories manufacturing centers here and tell them well you know it's costing us you know a thousand dollars for this regulation per unit and a thousand dollars per unit for that ... because of that regulation\nWell the president's wiping those regulations off the books\nAnd then on top of that is created a tax incentive for business to build in America and then when that doesn't work he just gets on the phone and just walls humiliate publicly any company that is not building in America\nAnd then on top of that he challenges even allies of ours that have taken advantage of us economically on bad trade deals over the years and he's telling them hey ah you're treating us unfairly this was a one sided deal I'm pulling out\nAnd we now successfully navigated thread the needle negotiated better deals with for example most recently Canada and Mexico have you don't fight for a better deal you're never gonna get a better deal pretty amazing\nI Know everybody is that all hyped up about Kanye being in the White House you know I listen very closely what country it was saying and I'm like\nWell I Do think we need some prison reform I give me an example when the president ... commuted the sentence of ... marine Johnson remembers a woman at a given like a life sentence one of ... a fence\nA grandmother apparently she'd run in a horrible economic difficulties that like there's no new ones sometimes in our criminal justice system\nAnd we spent Twenty one twenty two years in jail I had an opportunity to interview or\nI absolutely fell in love with this woman she comes rushing out of prison after President Trump does this for her right into the arms of her loving family I've got to meet her sister and I got to meet somebody a lawyer that was working for her pro bono and helped make this happen\nAnd then she goes to the microphones and she says to America thank you\nThank you for giving me a second chance I'm not going to let you down\nWell I Want to find all the Alice Murray Johnson's imprisoned that or like car with that attitude that deserve a second chance and you know that would that maybe but given heavy sentences for reasons for whatever the reason happens to be I agree with you we can find those people\nYou also talked about saving neighborhoods we need safe neighborhoods I disagree with him on stop and frisk only because the murder rate in New York well I've been hearing the Rudy Giuliani went from about twenty five hundred a year down to three hundred three or four hundred Bernie Carrick was a big part of the success of that program\nIt just works unfortunately got to go into the neighborhoods where the crimes are being committed with the shots being fired wherever it happens to be and you have a grasp of resources and policing of those areas so every man woman and child can go to sleep at night\nAnd not worry the bullets are going to be flying through their windows and the next hour it's unbelievable that nothing is ever been done\nAt this point to pick Chicago\nI mean it's it's sad it's unnecessary ... our our human\nOur human family and talent or being literally you know are literally evaporating before our eyes it's unbelievable we can do better we ought to do we owe it to people to do better\nAnd then he's talking about bringing jobs making with things in America and creating jobs in America\nYou know the ... they shouldn't be about conservative liberal Republican Democrat but liberalism fails socialism redistribution has failed and we see it we had eight years of it and width hasn't done a thing\nAnd why as a any African American conservative that speaks out is just beaten up and excoriated on a level that his downright racist and disgusting\nWhy is it matter if somebody happens to be\nAfrican American and a conservative and it happens all the time and somehow in this era of political correctness it's acceptable to say the most disgusting and atrocious and obnoxious vicious viral thing you can\nListen to some of the things said about Kanye\nWest is what happens when they grow they'll read flat folks aren't that crane tiny ... now the sudden ... because he's ...\nHe's an attention more like the president have all of a sudden now that the the model folks person he's he's the token negro of as the Trump administration's this was an embarrassment ... mother is rolling over in her grave\nBut watching Democrats on hands does pretty amazing right we've got tapes on

we're going to look at the polls that all the major races with our pollster John McLaughlin and dug shown\nAnd believe it or not the Republican candidate for governor in California has a shot these within five points is it possible because we really shocked the world will get into that more as we continue [noise]\nHoly\nGentle giants dog food Batman I Burt Ward Robin from Batman would you like your dogs live as long as twenty seven healthy active years my wife and I created gentle giants dog\nRace with mix Sally in cinema well that's Sally now is up in the latest poll there by six\nAnd that's before the release of the tape that we showed last night\nOf cinema and twenty eleven calling the people of Arizona that she wants to vote for her crazy I don't think that's going to go over well nor do I think it's going to go over well that she invited this\nThis radical attorney to Arizona State university ... a university a lawyer convicted of aiding and abetting an Islamic terror organization and its leader in the lawyer in question represented someone who was one sentence to life in prison\nOr set sentence for in the nineties for blowing up a plotting to blow up the UN and an FBI building so I think a cinema is going to see a dramatic drop in the polls there and I think things will look up for Martha ... he was a rock star a person who has served their country with incredible distinction\nUm and here to go through all these latest numbers and what it means and whether or not to this is going to be the blue wave or is it going to be a shock the world twenty sixteen Donald Trump all over redux\nA we have our good friends John McLaughlin and dug shelters with us welcome both the back to the program thank you thank you\nI don't think there's any doubt the Kavanaugh overreach and the loss of due process and and even simple principles like the presumption of innocence\nHas now definitely hurt the Democratic party I think these tapes of bread a sin and in Tennessee and send them out in Arizona are going to hurt those candidacies and when you have thirty two house seats really you know going to tip the balance one way or the other which way does it go John McLaughlin\nFly to I think without a doubt by the way one of the things you've got a notice this week you notice the market went down its up a little today but went down in the past couple of days and it was triggered by interest rates stuff but in the meantime I had some analysts telling me\nThey're afraid of the Democrats taking the house of representatives and\nThey would want to raise taxes again they would stop Trump from doing all the good things that he's done a regulation the businesses with the economy and they would want to raise taxes again\nAnd that would cost jobs that were slow down the American economy and you've got an economy now that's really growing at about four percent higher than any of the expectations\nAnd what they're really afraid of is that Nancy Pelosi could become speaker again I agree with you showing that the Republicans are going to pick up Senate seats in the Senate seats looking really good because of what happened with the backlash\nOf about the whole cabinet are hearing it how unfair it was and you can see we had a poll this this week where I'm McCaskill was losing to Hawley the Republicans for the U.S Senate and\nThe way that I also Joe Donnelly is now down right in writing Heidi Heitkamp is finished she's down by double digits\nRight we have polls there because of the the energy sector is so important to the state that you're seeing that you're seeing these these polls um you know people want jobs\nAnd what Gary is in the last three weeks where you're going to decide is\nIf you want the economy to keep growing or do you want do you want it to slow down your closer to raise taxes take what you got to take away the jobs take away the pay raises\nAnd the vast majority of Americans don't want to go back to that I mean we have holes in September with were Nancy Pelosi has fifty five unfavorable among all voters she has she has a fifty three percent\nUnfavorable among independent women\nThat the independent women are going to decide this election and and they don't want to go back to the way things work before Donald Trump took over and started to drain the swamp and get things moving again for the country to these house races you're talking about\nOverwhelmingly most of the ones in play or Republicans those Republican incumbents or the or the Republican or a candidates in the in those open seats they're the ones who are going to vote to keep lowering taxes to keep the economy growing and basically to stop what you saw the last couple of days where\nYou know the smart money on Wall street saying hold that she's if she's going to be speaker\nAnd they're going to oppose the president's agenda they started selling off\nI mean it'd be a disaster for the country\nDoug shown 'em I honestly don't have a feel yet for the house but I think the Senate you have to admit is looking very good for Republican pickups\nI think when you have thirty three races now that will that will actually tipped the balance one way or the other in the house of representatives a little too close for comfort because as somebody that knows Nancy Pelosi I think that would be a worst case scenario and we'd have endless investigations and impeachment and higher taxes and\nAnd you know it then they want to get rid of ice that won't fund the border wall et cetera it's gonna be the same nonsense all over again with them\nWell I my sense is that the house is still a in democratic hands where the election today so it's getting closer or the real clear averages gone from a thirty one or thirty two seats for the Democrats to twenty six twenty seven so it's moved the same direction as the Senate races but not quite\nAs far and I would have to concede much as I Would like not to that the Senate races have moved decisively andme interaction\nKavanaugh had a lot to do with\nIt yeah I Do I think they're really two realities there's the reality of the world that we live in on the east coast and west coast and the reality of the rest of the country who thought that a lot of what happened to him yeah I was kind of like an island\nAnd the middle of that east coast I'm not the rest of the east coast I don't represent the value of a New York and I've\nNoticed which is a pretty hard core left wing state even as a Governor Cuomo doesn't even want me in the state did\nYou know that I didn't know but if I don't know I got taken it no he actually said those conservative\nThat their problems not me themselves are streaming shows\nMe where it is that there are conservatives who says he knows that it's not because\nIt's simple no one has tons within a rifle me\nUh I'm right to life I'm pro Second Amendment\nUh and uh although I Know I'm libertarian on people's personal lives I think we ought to lead people to hell alone\nUm so but there's no place for me in the state of New York you said it himself when that happened I had a bunch of governors Florida Texas North Carolina South Carolina all calling and inviting me to move to the states I Want to take them up on Mr shown that would be a governor and everything you love and vote for once me out of town\nSo am I speaking for myself and wanted you to run as an independent for president I think that you run an Alabama one of your old stomping grounds Doug Jones would not be a senator and I would be happy to be part of the bipartisan committee to keep Hannity in New York or to promote Hannity\nOffice would like to run for it I think my friend John and I can ... the ...\nWell you disabuse our friend Doug of any notion that I can win any office I don't even think I could win dog catcher\nNo I I I think look you're still the kid for Franklin square you're still you're still am you're working class roots and Andrew Cuomo is trying to make you move out to join because we\nNew York that's our biggest export is is the people on taxpayers of New York state we send them to places like Florida and Tennessee in Texas where they have no no income tax and no state income tax may have jobs\nBut by the way it does hold an ad on us because his client right\nDoug you still work for a a former mayor for New York Mike Bloomberg\n... I heard it Oh yes I don't I ... I tell you you know people are speculating he might run for president but Andrew Cuomo is clearly afraid or because he's moving so far left\nChat it's unbelievable he's gonna get whiplash\nBut but I don't even think I don't think they'll make should get through Mayor Bloomberg or get or a Democrat primary these days because they're so radical and that's my point about what's going on right now the country's realizing in the next three weeks what's at stake is this is the most as Sean says the most important in midterms\nIn our lifetime because you really have a clear choice from a country that's gotten back it's got its footing back\nWhere the economy is moving while we're stronger in the world are we we we are basically the heartland is feeling that people are paying attention to them that the swamp is being put back in its place that that the average person might have something to say about how their lives are going to be garden governed have control of their own healthcare\nBut but if Nancy Pelosi becomes the next speaker she will be the most powerful elected Democrat in the country she'll be the national face and voice of the Democratic party and that is just frightening\n'cause it let me tell you something we're not just friday is a frightening Republicans Doug shown does not want this do you\nDo oh I Want democratic candidates at all levels in the house to say I will vote against her because that's the way to get votes in these marginal rights is absolutely thought she should go period style\nAbsolutely and and does point about in previous times or have been on the radio is you know you know what the president's message was when he ran for president was making America great again once the message of the house Republicans to get re elected this time what should it be it should be better stop Nancy Pelosi's from getting\nWell I think it's got to do that or not I I think look if you if you like the success of the last two years if you want your tax cuts to go permanent if you if\nYou believe in secure borders if you believe in energy independence if you\nBelieve in the health care plan and the free independent market healthcare plan that actually would work for the American people like the concierge care for blue collar workers that we talk about all the time with our buddy Dr Josh ... all of those messages and constitutional originalists on the fourth I think those are all winning issues\nTown we now in our\nRat [noise] you\nKnow we\nWe\nAnd the wind the Cain and stop all only bring them rein that in no man [noise]\nAll broken hard\nA day I'd be feeling alone\n... they [noise]\nThey made\nMe", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "New York", "day": "12"}
