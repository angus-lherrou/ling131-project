hundred and thirty five so they're all important\nEvery ... every one of you listening to my vote I don't care if you think your congressman as safe or not you better get out and vote because otherwise if you don't vote that's pretty much a vote for Nancy Pelosi and if you have a Senate race going on in your state that's vote for Chuck Schumer\nThe second potential outcome is a split decision split decision would be Republicans hang on to the Senate gain a couple of seats\nAnd Nancy Pelosi them become speaker and Maxine Waters is a chairwoman Adam Schiff is a chairwoman and let's say Gerald ... chairman Elijah Cummings the chairman and it's endless investigations\nInto one of the most unbelievable things that we're watching unfold here\nIs what we have this desperation factor of the Democrats I mean even when I think even when I warn you\nOf what they do every two and four years racist or sexist besides you know just seeing a phobic Islamic phobic homophobic you know dirty air dirty water kill children pro granny over the cliff just one you think\nIt can't get worse it gets worse\nAnd the echo chamber if you've ever doubted ever doubted who the media in this country is pulling for just just watch any so called cable news channel besides Fox\nFor thirty seconds because it's every second every minute of every day hate Trump destroy Trump help the Democrats\nAnd if it means falsely accusing the president of being responsible for the synagogue shooting over the weekend\nAnd not even tell the people there viewers that well the shooter this got mad man power hated Trump because of Trump being so allied and good partners with our closest ally Israel\nAnd the same people you know St Trump cause this Trump's responsible for this you know it's it it's it's a sense of madness but it also does show a desperation that has now kicked in for the Democratic party they are desperate\nYou know one thing I I think I'm going to talk about polls a little bit in the course of the program today but I'm also on the other hand seems like I'm Talking to both sides of my face I'm really not\nI'm I'm gonna tell you to just ignore the polls at this point doesn't matter you still have a job to do and if you want to to keep the progress that we've had you want to prevent hearing the night of one week from tonight\nAnd one day after one week from tomorrow when we talk about the results if you don't want to hear the word speaker elect Pelosi Senate majority elects sure then you're going to have to do something about it\nThe worst case scenario is they can win at all and the only way that's going to happen is if you stay home\nThat the reason I'll tell you not to pay attention to the polls is because they get it wrong so often\nJust two years ago the exit polls showed that Trump lost Florida he won it last North Carolina he won it that he had lost Ohio he won Ohio that he lost Pennsylvania He won Pennsylvania that he lost Michigan Wisconsin anyone both of them\nAnd the media nobody they weren't candy because they read these results as I was on the air at five Fifteen I had it before everybody else\nI remember my first break at at the about twenty after the hour I called then candidate Donald Trump and I said somebody's going to come in in about a minute with bad news and tell you that you lost everything don't believe it\nI said I don't believe these polls I said there's no way these polls are accurate and he goes why do you believe that and then I told them the story about two thousand and four\nWhere the median again the polls came back and George Bush and Dick Cheney and lost Florida Ohio Pennsylvania and it was over\nAnd Dick Cheney called the radio program this radio program at you know on election day two thousand and four or five thirty five and reminded people they still had time to vote because he read the same information that I just read that John Kerry was going to be the next president\nYou know if you go back in you know other polls where they've been wrong twenty four team you know let's go back with the election one week away it's coming down to the wire conventional wisdom is Republicans will pick up a few seats in the house or in the Senate but lose the house\nBy a painfully slim margin one of the reasons is look if you look\nReal clear politics that's based on polling polling is not totally inaccurate information there's some things you can glean from polling that are\nAnecdotal maybe the way to put it helpful in other ways right now real clear politics as the Democrats are two hundred and five seats locked solid\nOr leaning Democrat and it has leaning Republican lock solid Republican two hundred that's a five seat difference but because Republicans have\nThe majority of ah right now that means that they have more seats they have to defend is like thirty seats that they called toss ups that can swing one way or the other we've identified these we put them up on Hannity dot com you can check it out for yourself\nAnd the only thing that can make a difference is if you want\nThe progress of the last two years to continue\nYou get to decide how you're gonna feel a week from tonight I mean when the when you watch called back the media in twenty sixteen this five Fifteen they were getting\nWell it's pretty clear Hillary I think it's going to bring on our presidents Frank Luntz was reporting from Times Square at six Fifteen and I'm watching him it's over\nTrump lost it ain't happening turned out not to be true turned out the polls wrong and I'm not criticizing Frank he was reading the polling data I had read the same data\nSo if you don't have the sense of urgency I don't know what I can say or do to give it to you but the media is all in on helping the Democrats get back the house and the Senate and they're doing everything within their power to make that happen\nBecause they've handed Trump since the day walk down the escalator with millennia\nI think it's worth noting now that conventional wisdom does not exactly have a stellar track record this is where I urge you to be cautious about the polls and don't let the polls influence your motivation here\nBut it's not only are they wrong and twenty sixteen they also wrong in two thousand and four they were way off in the last midterm election remember Republicans have been set up because Ted Cruz's fellow buster oh we're going to get cleaned out in the Senate that didn't happen\nOne year before the twenty fourteen ... terms of media insisted the GOP hopes to recapture the Senate were dead on arrival because in October Ted Cruz had filibustered Obamacare and shut the government down for sixteen days good for him makes me like Ted Cruz more\nExperts such a short us a hundred percent certainty in twenty forty Republicans are going to pay huge price when the twenty four team midterms rolled around Thirteen months later the geo ... not only won back the Senate they did it with a nine feet Senate landslide\nNow remembers the night went on in twenty sixteen media was kinda Getty but then that getting this began to give away to a little bit of a little bit of nervousness I think we got it still but uh yeah to get a little tighter than we thought isn't it\nAnd then I turned into what all out melt down depression collectively by the media and they couldn't believe it because you we the people shocked the world\nAll that but an old for it's happened in fourteen and it happened in sixteen don't resent it can happen in a tea you should do it for no other\nReason because you want to keep America on the great growth growth trajectory we're on and maybe for another reason to watch these idiots in the mainstream media these sanctimonious a self righteous they're not news people advocates that they are the extension of the Democratic party they're\nGoing to lose it if the house remains in Republican hands and Republicans picked up a number of Senate seats they will lose it just like they did in twenty six say this is a this is all white flash CNN was reporting that night\nAnyway the so called experts saw the Republican landslide coming that none of them thought in twenty fourteen known very few of us saw that we could wait\nI'll give you the let's go to twenty fourteen final Wall Street journal NBC News survey before balloting and twenty fourteen had forty six percent of likely voters favor Congress led by Republicans forty five prefer democratic control kind of similar where they are now\nThe GOP claimed a similar one point advantage lead\nIn ten states where Senate races were the most competitive with a balance of power in the chamber would be decided those results suggest a narrower advantage for Republicans in in the latest mid term\nAnd you know still they claimed oh Republicans pick up nine seats that's a hell of a field goal\nThey were saying they might they might well twenty ten was kind of a two touchdown embarrassing laws for Democrats this is more Republicans went on a field goal\nThat's right Sean in an investment isn't always financial from a simple insincere thank you tour recognition program to celebrate employees now is the time to express

[noise]\nHi one\nWeek from today the results come in but I'm just going back Nineteen days before the Republican Senate landslide in twenty fourteen is what Nate Silver five thirty eight said this year's Senate election is closed for Republicans have the clear a path to a majority but it is a treacherous one\nRepublicans are favored in Iowa Colorado for example but not by much of Democrats eked out victories in those states\nAnd picked up the seat and Kansas they can control fifty seats and keep their majority Democrats can also pick up seats from the GOP in Georgia Kentucky Republican gains in Arkansas Louisiana or probable but far from certain relatively modest errors in the right states would do tricks for the Democrats anyway that Republicans picked\nUp nine Donald Trump didn't want a single state according to the polls John Kerry was going to be president because of the polls now I don't have a crystal ball and\nI just know when we're in the fight and I just you know I have a natural gut instinct to always wanna play like I'm behind play hard and the way you play hard in this case\nYou make a decision now that you're going to vote for the Republican congressmen and your

anyway Jeffrey Myers the pits Pittsburgh rabbi\nWho watched eleven of his congregants gun down during their Saturday services saying he's now become the political targeted in he's receiving hate

know the rabbi said on CNN Trump is my president he's always welcome to visit\nYou know ever since yesterday morning of the fake news fraud media's been circulating what is just the nation is why that

fears of those like Bower one columnist\nThe New York times Trump is flirted with the deepest racist the Nazis and it is not gone unnoticed the least\nOf all by them blaming the president now not only is Trump historically since forty eight the most supportive president of Israel and the Jewish community\nThe monster that committed this evil atrocity in the synagogue a happen to have Trump why because Trump is so close with our friends and allies of Israel\nAnd Bowers posting online is hatred in contempt for Trump because of its support for Israel but yet the mainstream media's coverage

to see him we did a great job as governor of Florida and I love to see him go to the U.S Senate that too is a a tight race let's talk about the FBI investigator buying what thousand dollar Hamilton tickets for Andrew Gillum and you're saying that there was a quid pro quo involved\nWell this guy was posing as a developer a he went and he paid for Andrew\nAt least a thousand dollars for that ticket that's in a legal gift ended up itself Andrew never reported it\nThis developer wanted a zoning change in Tallahassee and sure enough later he got that there were text messages release were that an FBI agent is a tax thing the the main lobby its body of Andrew saying really appreciated mayor coming through ah why\nWasn't he got arrested isn't that buying influencing corruption\nWell there is an ongoing investigation I mean that's the thing I think that um uh we don't know what's gonna happen because this has been going on for quite some time they've been gathering a lot of evidence Andrew also the same lobbyists that arrange that New York John get paid for a for night stay in a luxury to wreak Avila for Andrew Gillum\nAndrew didn't pay a dime of that and then Andrew turned around and gave that lobby is a two million dollar contract to do a restaurant in the city of Tallahassee now we know in addition to that thousand dollar ticket\nThat the agent gave to go on the FBI agent also under rode a forty three hundred dollar dinner for Andrews campaign nine twenty six team that was never reported which it needs to be and so the question is\nAnd you have reported that after the fact that just basically cover in your tracks CYA so I don't want to say that report\nIt at all the only reason we know about it\nIs because there's an ethics commission investigation of Gillum and and and a response to those subpoenas uh one of the lobbyist attorneys release that said the public so forty three hundred dollars and then at least a thousand dollars for Hamilton Andrew says he's not under investigation\nBut Sean you tell me what other reads and what an undercover agent have to do those things if he wasn't investigating mayor Andrew Gillum\nWell let me ask you to two days ago\nIt was the political reported that apparently his running mate you know claimed that quote Jews nailed him to the cross and read the text message to you know apparently it snow out there many you know people in in South Florida apparently are pretty angry at this remark\nAnd er which seems pretty anti Semitic to me as he's standing by this\nBook I think it's reprehensible Andrew Gillum picked this guy knowing\nThat he had done that but here's the thing about Andrew Gillum he is aligned himself with some of the most anti Israel and anti Semitic groups in Florida including this radical group called the dream defenders which is a leader and the boycott divest and sanctioned movement\nTargeting Israel they actually say Israel's a genocidal apartheid state and so that's one of the Andrew strongest supporters Andrew to this day of poses having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and when a Israel\nFought back against the Moffett fats and may ah Gillum blamed Israel he said oh they just use those attacks as a pre tax to be able to do a disproportionate response to\nWhat what is in a relief endurance organization that he won't disavow\nThey're one of the most radical organizations in Florida or they they believe that the police and prisons have no place in justice\nAnd that the police needs to be funded they paid they said to us as the biggest bully in the history of the world that our military needs to be caught\nThey if they favor or replacing what they consider disaster capitalism is their words with socialists principles that are so radical it'd make Nicolas Maduro flush\nSo he signed their candidate alleged gang that he would support a this radical manifesto so that just who he is he believes and what they're doing is endorse them personally and uh it would\nLose a tape of him I guess that was discovered in June saying that he's pleased I'm proud to sneak food to dream defender activists during a thirty day sleeping protested the Florida State Capitol\nReferring to the twenty Thirteen month long anti gun protest or after the Trayvon Martin George Zimmerman case and I hope you keep at it and he supported them but you're saying that there are radical group\nWithout question I mean they they are anti law enforcement they're anti free enterprise there in the military um they're anti Israel uh I don't know what I mean like that may be a group you would want to be aligned with if you are running for the mayor of the Gaza Strip but not for governor of Florida\nWow well let's go over a little bit of his his background and the proposals that he's making but he's I think it's fairly extreme a number one he was endorsed by Bernie Sanders that speaks volumes to me\nThere's a lot of outside money uh reports that he's getting money from the left wing billionaires like George Soros the George Soros really spend one point two million in this race in Florida to help him\nOh yeah I'm probably much more than that at this point now\nHe says that he supports Medicare for all I Am a champion of treaty health care and as a right not a privilege so he wants what nationalized health care\nHe his and the bill he supports what abolish Medicare and Medicare Advantage for seniors enforce them on a single payer\nGovernment plan it would eliminate everybody's employer based coverage and force them on a government single plan so we're really a fan the arrangements of millions and millions of ... that he thinks it's appropriate for governments to take away health benefits that people have burned and to force them to be\nOn the single payer plan I think that'd be a disaster\nHe wants to raise the corporate tax rate forty percent of forty percent increase ... what's that going to what's\nThe impact that's going to have on Florida businesses and Florida workers if the businesses pack up and leave\nWe will lose jobs we will lose businesses and we're also I mean you know Sean 'cause everyone who works and high tax states\nThey're always thinking about relocating to Florida we have a historic opportunity to really capitalize on that when I'm governor buddy Andrew has his way he'll stop the flow of investment coming into Florida because people are going to invest if you have the highest tax rate in the south east and actually he would raise it to be higher than New York\nYeah and he also was the first democratic candidate Nash nationwide I read to call for the abolish meant a vice is that true\nHe supports abolishing ice and impeaching President Trump\nAnd he wants to eliminate Florida's Stand your ground law\nYes he wants to impose on law abiding Floridians a duty to retreat so somebody up a criminal is attacking you you have to run and try to hide rather than fight back you\nAlso support legalizing drugs in Florida like marijuana and others yes he does\nWell I mean it you're just looks like he is Bernie Sanders on steroids that down there I mean I've got to believe would this controversial background that looks like a almost a phenomenon that the media's just pushing for him and pushing for him\nAnd you know his record I only spent about a half hour and I was able to dig it up it wasn't that hard to find and it seems like most of the media is ignoring who he really is\nOh without question I mean the day he won the primary particularly the national media you know they've tried to elevate him and try to make him into this great candidate\nA they do not like the scrutinize his record uh the fact that those documents released after he lied and the debate last Sunday or the media kind of had to cover that buy at the end of the day\nHe has been given very kid glove treatment so really falls to me and other folks to go out and make the case and let people know and the good news is just one Floridians figure that out or they definitely don't want him as their governor and so we're going to keep making the case for the next week\nI'm worried about our friends not only the recovery of thoughts and prayers go to all our friends in the panhandle\nUm but but the panhandle to so many people whose lives have been up ended and disrupted and some people losing pretty much everything they own\nAnd they have now moved out the panhandle happens to be one of the most conservative areas of Florida are you concerned that people from the panhandle of going to be able to get their hands on a ballad maps and tea or otherwise would maybe be part of early voting\nIs Florida doing anything to assist in and help those people that have been displaced would want to vote in this election because Florida is their home\nThey're doing a lot of everything from mobile voting sites to accommodations for absentee ballots\nAnd Rachel Lincoln Tunnel ...

the way since ... twenty Fifteen\nRunning against the Democratic challenger Katie Hill and a ton of money now we see millions of millions of dollars coming from former New York city Mayor Bloomberg who is supporting all of the Democratic candidates in California\nAnd why not I mean Governor Brown is doing such a bang up job but the people that state anyway he joins us now congressman how are you\nShone I'm doing well thanks for having me on\nI have identified myself about six seven races especially in Southern California Darryl ... old seat Dana Rohrabacher seat or Duncan Hunter see that really are seeing a fortune in your seat thrown at them in terms of\nThese are really being targeted as tipping point races at in terms of the balance of power in Washington one week from today or how much money's being thrown at against you and towards your opponent\nWell I think I'd go back to that old the old commercial for a kind of the hot sauce and say New York city because that's what's happening in my district a New Yorkers are throwing a ton of money out here\nI think we're now number one in California for most money being spent in a congressional district that's not so much I Want it but uh that's what I got and ah but we're running well we're uh we're doing what we do\nIn order your home that I think the colds or what was in the bottom line is they're throwing money and they're running negative ads because negative ads work and money helps get out the vote\nYou know they'll use that for you know people knocking on doors they'll use it to tax people to use it to reach out a hundred different ways and that puts you at a decided disadvantage now\nI kind of believe in freedom of speech and spending ones money the way they want is freedom of speech but why Michael Bloomberg former New York city mayor is so obsessed with California's congressional races\nAre obviously he doesn't like Donald Trump\nI think that's probably the reason but he's also looking at districts that he thinks he can he can do some ... uh this is this has been a held by Republican for very long time and we're going to win the seat\nBut ah yeah there is a it's an unbelievable amount of money that's coming in here it's it's gotten to a saturation point now and people are just so upset\nI think people get up with it and they tune it out like I Do I mean that you're not going to

Senate vote as a boat for sure\nThat we should have a pretty good night a week from now\nBut the best part is that we live in a country where you get to decide that where every American now has the

the reality is tens of millions of Americans lost their doctors lost their plans and everybody paid more in spite of belied the big promise of Obamacare what is fascinating as we now head into the final week of this midterm\nAction campaign is what Democrats won't talk about now we had earlier in the program had project berets house dot com and James O'Keefe on and he's now been able to expose\nIn Tennessee Phil Bredesen the Democrat Claire McCaskill the Democrat in Missouri Heidi Heitkamp a Democrat in North Dakota Kirsten Sinema the Democrat in Arizona\nThat none of these people

watch this implode on Californians it's got to be ugly and the mass exit is out of California will even continue\nAt a greater clip and a greater pace you know so now what's happened is somehow we

of a health care provider forgetting that they lost their doctor from long ago that they really liked and wanted\nAnd they forget that people with a pre existing conditions well with Obamacare you pay more higher premiums than any other plant\nRate hikes that nobody ever expected and they lied to you about\nPeople losing their doctors that was a lie you like it Dr keep your doctor people losing their plans with no choice anymore and this is now becoming the final week of the election this is their talking points all across the country they're saying well we're we're going to ... where we support health care of preexisting conditions\nWhile the Republicans repeal replace planned supported preexisting conditions and they're trying to basically go with the narrow lie that Republicans want you to die Republicans one dirty or water dirty air\nThey want to kill children they want to throw granny over the cliff of course they're racist or sexist massage sticking Xena phobic

hated Donald Trump\nFor being so supportive of Israel let's not let facts\nGet in a way of a good propaganda ally in an election year well anyway Republicans now are beginning to listen and not only are they listening to the fact that repeal has to happen but also direct primary care or what I call concierge care for every American at that this is now gaining momentum\nAnd I've had conversations
