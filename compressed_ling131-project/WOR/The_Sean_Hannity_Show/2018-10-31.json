think that he's perfectly tolerant of racial violent than any amount of following\nIt is oh factually a lie because the guy hates Trump all the evidence is there why he hated Trump\nHated him because of his support for our closest ally Israel how many presidents promise to move to the capital of Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem where it belongs many none had the courage to do it except this president\nYou know it's amazing when you listen to the prime minister of Israel spanking the president no president has gone as far as to say we will destroy the enemies of Israel because there are closest ally just the opposite of what they are reporting and what they're trying to do look\nIt would've been dishonest and I said at the time when Bernie Sanders supporters went out there and shot Steve skull east on the ball field and and shot up these other innocent people you know it it would have been it would have been wrong\nTo blame Bernie Sanders Bernie is not responsible for what one of his crazy supporters to he's just not isn't it's intellectually dishonest to suggest such a thing\nI said it at the time and I even had at the time this is not some accommodation or rationale they would ever give it if it's a conservative just the opposite in this case you don't even have a Trump supporter and they're still blaming him\nI mean you know it's it is in is what it is\nThe biggest donors to the Democratic caused this election season is the media is universal almost at this point they hate Donald Trump every second every minute every hour every day it is hate destroy Trump at

even the own\nEven the author of the\nOf the ... even stand by let me tell you something let's remember when the media bashed Trump a lot of them were moving the embassy to Jerusalem\nAnd the president went against it in many ways what is a new alliance forming that could be\nMaybe at some point God willing a path to peace in the middle east one super all because of the threat of a rainy in Germany in the region now caused an alliance that was unthinkable maybe just a number of years back with Israel the Jordanians Egyptians\nThe Saudis the Emirates putting aside what Saudi Arabia recently did\nI mean if there was an emerging alliance here because of Donald Trump in large part and what he's done but I Will tell you you know let's play Joe Scarborough Joe Scarborough was lost his mind I honestly I don't I don't even it's inexplicable\nThat this guy has evolved into what I think it's just he's he's lost any sense of reality all these people in the media they don't even see what blowing hypocrites they are how they are guilty of the very thing they accused Trump up\nTheir rhetoric that they faint moral outrage about but they are guilty of\nBeen he's been playing the race

most of it I'm radicalized ... up to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nThere was no ban on you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy

start with the president so he seems to be going in on the two pillars of the media continuing hit the trail and attacks against\nAnd migrants continuing to ratchet up the language about them just and and frankly I mean I have to thank you think that the same language that the mass murder at the synagogue used in terms of invaders and\nInvasion for these tragedies work at cross purposes narrative so it's hard for him to celebrate his narrative of ... migrants when again the alleged mass murderer did the same thing\nAnd I don't I don't even know where to go with this joy is\nVery hard not even

David Young appreciate your being with us but they have people that gave us that they're going to give us Obamacare keep your doctor keep your plan and save money\n[noise] [noise] well that proved not to be true right and so they want to double down on health care Medicare for all sounds great\nBut what does that do with the the deficit and debt\nAnd rationing health care it's risky for seniors because they should be the priority when there's Medicare and so there's a lot of scare tactics out there Sean\nAnd what I'm hearing on the ground is we have to keep the prosperity going the economy going the way it is we have two point five percent unemployment rate in Iowa Sean and correcting the record with these lies and it's textbook cookie cutter messages\nFrom Nancy Pelosi across the country and that is scaring seniors regarding Social Security Medicare nobody's acted to cut that and then lying about\nTheir ... they're not being any protections for those with preexisting conditions and we had those protections for layers of it in our Republican health care bill\nYeah a lot of pent listen lying is just a part of it the playbook that the Democrats is always the same I even think it's gotten worse in a look at this this horrible terrorist attack in the shooting that took place in the Pittsburgh synagogue and\nSome of the people some probably a tiny tiny percentage they'd be clear point two percent or you know less sorcerer quarter reporting that she identified him as Thirteen members because of their tattoos that would give that'd be a give away\nUm but actually the Mexican ambassador to the U.

we wouldn't have a risk of thousands of people at once coming across the border\nThe president has sent fifty two hundred troops down there\nAnd he's not going to let the men nor can he but there's there'll be thousands and thousands behind them we don't have room to take it everybody we have a right as a country we have sovereignty ordination built on a on a constitutional republic system the rule of law\nAnd we have border laws and we asked the people respect our borders and our sovereignty and just come in legally and we have an opportunity to vet them and make sure that they are coming for the right reasons they can sustain themselves and they don't want to bring harm to our citizens that are already here\nI'm nearly according to one border official telling the Washington Examiner

permits to the migrants to register for asylum\nWhich I think it was a very you know Mexico's been far tougher on the illegal immigrants that we ever dreamed of big\nUm it's just sad that so many you

eleven and every other bizarre thing she said about the people of Arizona which he calls the meth lab of democracy and the people are crazy\nI'm so I'm just hoping that happens that way and then on the outside you got tester on the bubble even have Joe Manchin on a bubble in West Virginia and Bob Menendez on a bubble\nYeah and it's interesting I was looking at the different levels yeah Menendez on a carry on state where the Democrats should be safe because his personal\nOr gals or when the Senate Ethics committee on a bipartisan unanimous majority finding him guilty of a whole range of things and some very very unsavory\nRumors that were built around all of that now so he says he's now in such bad shape\nMilk adding to pour millions of dollars that they'd like to go somewhere else

there are so sick of\nMenendez or they just stay home that many actually saved three or four house seats in New Jersey that's the kind of dynamic where I frankly I Can't figure out of my own head when you go from state to state to state\nOr how these things are involving right now 'cause they're they're very ... very much in the air and there are I think ... no no very rushed into us should assume\nThat this was over one of the things stay home and then they feel about run out one voted voted by election day you're not doing anything else that day to vote it's that serious\nLet me let me ask you this because let's go with real clear politics than they have to wonder written for the number of house seats that they think are\nSafe for the Democrats and about one Ninety nine for the Republicans or where the with the Republicans have in the majority all of those toss ups put them on defense than you did have forty five retirements for the Republicans that's a big number in any election year um\nThe house is what I'm most worried about and you know the thought of Nancy Pelosi being speaker elect and then speaker of the house once again is a pretty frightening thought\nUm where do you see the house going\nWhy not functionally ah I I my personal range is returning a bottom of about ... between policy where speaker and hiring them around to twenty to thirty which would mean that Kevin McCarthy I think would end up is speaking [noise] um\nAnd I can't have them in all honesty you know I've always been candid about these things I Can't give you a more accurate number I Can't say do you\nSee I Can't either when I really can't I mean and I think now and and look the conventional wisdom\nIs Republicans will hold the Senate pick up seats there and that the answer you blow see what when the house\nUm that's not a great case scenario but that would be sort of like a split decision by the American people also say one other thing is you know some House Republicans have earned the wrath of their voters but it's really not about them it's about stopping an agenda that we know is going to be about impeachment\nEndless investigation raising taxes they want their crumbs back a sanctuary cities open borders eliminating ice and keeping Obamacare\nCan anyone who does not bode\nHas effectively voted for Nancy Pelosi the speaker no one should kids themselves if you

country and their response was let's run English cutting jobs can ... get them medical health but I mean look what their money where their mouth is and let them adopt these ... these families so that they can earn their pathway to citizenship instead of just walking across the border well thank you Mr Speaker\nLuck I think that's that's that's a pretty frankly it's a very reasonable statement on where we are and\nHow we could approach it uh in terms of births when shown a there is no provision on the fourteenth amendment which you anyway Rick orange people who were born outside the jurisdiction of the law\nTo be considered as citizens when she was very clear or debate showing at Congress she'll get drawn punch Clinton if you remove the constitutional amendment ... very clear on what it means um I\nPersonally think the question is far better off to him since ... challenged and Congress to repeal it\nRather than do just as a presidential jak water because there was an executive order the next president he could reverse it but if you turned it into a law there'll be a pony Harvard law I think you can change\nAnd once they got adopted and it's a healthy debate for us to have is a country because it comes back to exactly the same challenges the ... are wind nation\nOnly allowed to do find who is in America are we in a position where we can say to people who are not American you have to meet some test oh to be considered a ... to be eligible to serve\nOh yes I'm now in the ... the only reason that we in orange county are seen as targeted it because that you make your fancy close he wants to gamble back and\nThe only way that she's going to get that gavel back history of California in orange county and in my district it was the first time in eighty years since FDR ran for president did we had a Democrat nominee for president when\nOrange County and found the Democrats think we're vulnerable and that's why they hit zero zero in on us\nWell this is really interesting because most Republicans you don't think of California raised as being that important\nBut now it's become crucial in terms of\nYou know we've identified all of these races on our website Hannity dot com um that they're really focused in and which means it could be a very late night or early morning before we eventually get to know who controls the house\nOr come next January and it could be Nancy Pelosi this is a real threat and I think a real possibility I Would say the fact that you have two hundred and four save democratic seats a hundred and Ninety nine safe Republican seats and all these thirty some odd toss ups\nAre are Republicans on defense that means they pretty much have to run the table and that's why they're spending all those money\nI'm can money at exactly\nYeah so tell us about you know what are the issues there and do you think the people in your district the forty fifth district of California are paying attention and are are being influenced by the money and the negative ads\n[noise] yeah it's a real clear choice in this race I mean you have\nUm a a district where do people want to continue to this America forward I mean we had the lowest unemployment in forty nine years that you know and in orange county it's the lowest unemployment it in Nineteen years people have more money in their paycheck uh people are able to get jobs\nConsumer confidence is that I mean we're really moving this country in the right direction that the choices clear do you want to continue living a America forward or do you want to go back to the Obama era too where are you at overregulation where you have high taxes where you\nHad government in your life and I think it's a clear choice in what we're seeing right now on the early returns\nOr is that the Republicans are just as energized as the Democrats are and in fact in my district\nWe had over ... fourteen point advantage on the AT T the return over the Democrats so we aren't seeing this so called blue wave that you hear about we see that our voters are just as an energized\nWell I think it look if you look at the Senate Republicans have decided advantage and a lot of these races where they're red states that support Trump by big margins\nBut the house it's just harder to figure and I don't know if people fully completely understand that there are a lot of headwinds history runs against the party in power that forty five retirements that's the case for example Darrell ISIS seat\nUm and I you know I'm assuming with gerrymandering and and the legislature out there in California they do everything they could possibly do to maximize the number of democratic seats from the state\nAnd uh so it makes a particularly hard for people like yourself that have done a good job and want to do a good job for the people in your\nState and in your district but the you know you're fighting against the state that has a Thirteen and a half percent income tax with a democratic governor of that are democratic lieutenant governor running for governor who wants to free health care for anybody whether you're a California resident or not whether you're a citizen or not\nIt's a very challenging environment and to be from California and representing California either or for reasons why we need to make sure our voters get out the so that we don't lose any Republican seats we have fourteen members of Congress right now and the Democrats have thirty nine\nAnd found it is really really important that we hold our seats we got to turn the state around you're absolutely right I mean the liberal policies that cannot Sacramento Jerry Brown and now possibly gather news that uh it is getting more and more affordable to live in the state and we need to have it\nGet to the point where that pendulum swing back and I'm going to continue to fight for my constituents that can can you to fight for California and the ...\nOne of the ... you will ever have swinging back is people are so fed up with the regulations and hide taxation of states like California and New York\nIllinois and New Jersey is they are leaving and they're taking their money with them\nAnd you know my only fear is when they go to Texas or Florida or the Carolinas or maybe a lot of in a lot of cases Nevada or that they leave the liberal policies with them when they leave and and don't bring the failed policies that they voted for in their states\nBecause if you look at it it's become unsustainable for young people in California they can't afford to buy our first home they can't afford the high rate of taxes unless like you were in Silicon valley making crazy money\nYou're absolutely right and you're more than one hope I have is that Supreme Court decision Janice versus asked me where you know if you remember\nThe union you no longer have to pay your dues that unions can troll Sacramento and if we're allowed to have a couple of election cycles\nMay start to see that money go out of the hands of that and the unions that may give us a fighting chance at some point in the future in the state of California well\nI got to tell you something there is a fighting chance I Wish you the best out there I Hope people are paying attention Southern California\nYou know have and this was the headline which I think it's pretty scary Michael Bloomberg spending millions for California Democrats in in tight races\nAnd one other article came out said literally spending ... million dollars just on Southern California so uh we wish you all the best is was Mimi Walters California's forty fifth district\nOr and I wish you the best on election day and Dana Rohrabacher and all these other Republicans in Southern California these races all will tip the balance of power\nAnd if you vote for anybody that's a Democrat out there if you swayed by these ads you're pretty much voting for below sea hope the people in those districts to understand that so anyway thanks for being with us\nThank you so much\nOr I Hope it works out for you\nIt's not fun running for office who wants to run for office these days are All right let's go to our phones or we have so much going on today six days out of election day\nLet's go to Mary who's in upstate New York Mary Hi how are you glad you called well New York's on the verge of re electing Cuomo and what was done a thing for upstate New York\nMe to sit my pickup truck every night and you're like wow what kind of inspiration is that can I tell you what you inspired me to do\nBut I Love to tell me I Love inspiring people\nOkay so Iran round telling everybody that I got on your show and everybody was like were you nervous or you're afraid and I think that no no but what I realized was when we're talking about the young and how are we going to get people to tune in to a conservative talk radio\nI laugh when I said well let's see North Dakota right worked in the oil field\nAnd now in the evening I came in after scrubbing toilets I started my own cleaning business out there and the cleaning and catering business right yeah so\nI come in at night and I was in my truck because that's where I could contain audio and I hated the bell at the end zone show and it was created for people that don't normally listening to talk radio so the silent majority Eighteen year old rock next six year old black liberal women were listening to my shown at the highlight of it

read\nAnd do the job that we need to do improve to try that we a hundred percent a hundred and fifty percent support him because it's now the Trump train and and the fat in Newburg has closed the gap for Clovis shower\nWard low is Thirteen percent higher than Alex and there's some really good signs here for going red in Minneapolis\nWell the last thing is I Want to remind people there are very important house races in uh Minneapolis ah in well in Minnesota for this race um that are going to tip the balance of power like Southern California it's interesting New York New Jersey\nOr places like Minnesota Wisconsin Michigan California state you wouldn't expect that's where a lot of these tossup races that I keep talking about our um look but let me ask you when you move to North Dakota and you're and you did this radio show and you started your own business\nDid you make a lot more money\nI mean here I mean we were in such a bad recession and Minneapolis and when I moved out there I mean the excitement and all the jobs are not going to say I want to give us out to the oil fields because contradictory\nTo what a lot of people here about a booming and will stand I met some of the finest people in the world and the most hard working and I got to live the American dream which really didn't exist back then but I\nGot to run you know what I tell you something I Want to encourage

ballads and they found enough new votes\nThat were not counted to\nOr what not conducted the voters to swing the election is that pretty accurate what happened to you know\nI actually think county had
