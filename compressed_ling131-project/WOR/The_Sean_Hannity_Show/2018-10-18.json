listen to this program regularly I Know you can recite them by rote as well\nThe only reason I say it so often is that so everybody nobody can say they didn't know\nBut that's what they want to take

national security this is personal security\nI think I'm the only person in the media that actually took the time over the years\nAnd I've been down reporting from the border Thirteen times site and you've told us that before yeah I've been on horseback yeah Ben and helicopters yeah been out on boats yeah I've been on foot yeah I've been all terrain vehicles I've been on the border all the way from the Rio Grande straight on through San Diego and many stops in between\nI've seen gang members arrested drug warehouse the biggest warehouse I've ever seen in my life floor to ceiling drugs confiscated cast where they were headed\nTo Yorktown your city to your kids that they ingest them and now it's worse than ever but there's now a lot of the heroin that we have we have an opioid crisis

can't afford eighty bucks the pill well then some genius idiot friend or dealer friend quote of there's there's one you try heroin does much better ... totally ten dollars a bag\nAnd they'll start snorting heroin or chasing the dragon as they call it and they light up in smoke it and then eventually you're going to remain lining it and then guess what they're on a trajectory straight into the grave and a life of a living hell and that's the ...\nThe onslaught if you're unable to do so I Will call up the U.S military and close our southern border\nThen he posted in another one continuing to blast Democrats 'cause they're the ones that won't open borders eliminate ice and sanctuary cities and free healthcare for illegal immigrants course free means you pay for it\nI'm watching the Democratic party led because they want open borders and existing week laws\nAssault on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador and whose leaders are doing little to stop the large flow of people including many criminals from entering Mexico or to the U.S and he said that he will poll aid for these countries\nAnd then he said the assault on our country at the southern border including the criminal elements and drugs pouring in is far more important to me as president then trade\nAnd the new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada hopefully Mexico will stop this onslaught at their northern border this is all the Democrats fault week laws that of course they don't want to build the border well\nGuess what it also means\nThat means more drugs coming into every small town and big

world the Maxine Waters get a crowd\nAnd tell them and follow them into gas stations department stores and and and restaurants and you tell them we don't want them nowhere nowhere any point any time I mean is that the New America because I didn't I don't remember that\nThat's certainly the America will just were left because they're losing the more they lose the more desperate they get and it's I think it will get worse before it gets better 'cause I think we're going to keep losing and I think\nThat they they are so alienated from most Americans have left there's this kind of a new street violence\nUh which in the end I think turns people off it's it's it's it's it's also a little scary because it says Steve ... proved when he was shot um [noise]\nYou know if you're conservative and you're in public life there's a certain danger level now that is totally on American and that comes entirely from the left\nYou know the thing is that's missing and and you figure it out I mean I watched the whole process when you became speaker it didn't happen overnight it started with a series of\nVideotapes about running to transform America and it was called renewing American civilization when did you first put those tapes out\nWe first began working on it in uh Ninety two and did the first wave of tapes in Ninety three and then the second wave after speaker Ninety five\nAnd it was all based on ideas culminating in a contract with America and I I think people forget because\nYou know we've had waves of conservatives maybe if you want to start with Gary Barry Goldwater that's one it wasn't successful but it was the beginning Reagan's victory in Nineteen eighty and then subsequently in eighty four that was another big victory and and obviously the Republicans taken over Congress for the first time in forty years with your contract\nAnd I'd argue Donald Trump is the fourth leg\nAnd that is a I everything he is doing in terms of governance is conservative even even threatened trade wars they're not\nThey're not materialized because that's never been as attention his intention to for better trade deals freer fairer deals\nYou know I think look I I think he is the fourth a cycle if you will of moving back from a left wing of America and we've been gaining momentum and gaining clarity and is often tell people you know we didn't have Leonard Leo\nAnd the federalist society with so many good solid conservative lawyers that we could fill up all these judicial appointments and that that's just a huge advantage and they're all grows out of what is now\nIf you go back to the Goldwater of fifty four year movement um but I think it's also coming to a crisis because\nTrump so clearly articulate each a pro American pro work ethic pro patriotism policy that he drives the left crazy and I think as a result the left\nWhich has gotten more extreme they haven't modulated they haven't come back to the center they've decided that their job is to beat up and intimidate those of us who disagree with him and and they and I think just further isolates from\nSo their agenda is pretty clear they get back the house they wanna teach men they want the crumbs back the largest tax cut history which is obviously having a big impact on the economy we you know all the record unemployment numbers the varying demographic groups that are doing better than they've ever done\nUm they also want open borders but John Podesta said don't talk about immigration\nThey want to eliminate ice they want to keep Obamacare\nI'm an endless investigation I Would add to that I don't hear one positive thing that's going to create one job or make this country one bit safer not nothing that they're running on just that and we hate Trump that's it\nWell I think that's right and it's partly because I think if they tried to tell us honestly what they stand for there will be defeated so badly that they just they know that they can't afford to be honest but but I think I mentioned the send your TV show last night I think that we're about to be a magic moment\nIn American history I think the two words that captured in my mind are Kavanaugh and caravan I think Kevin all the way they treated him of the viciousness the smears the character assassination to childish behavior by\nUS Senators incentive meetings I think all that came together to really re galvanized conservatives and I think this caravan coming up from Guatemala should be a major focus of Republicans for the next couple of weeks\nBecause it makes clear the argument about whether or not we have a right to be a sovereign country or whether in the\nFeinstein below sea San Francisco Democrat tradition we have an obligation to open up our border to anybody who can get finance\nAnd remember these three thousand people I I agree with Laura Ingraham is asking the question who's paying for this these three thousand people will probably cost Twenty one million dollars to move\nFrom Guatemala highly four thousand people is now grown too amid a spike among a U.S border crossings but you know ... plus he actually said we are not funding the border wall\nAnd that just is it seems to be an appendage to Donald Trump manhood I mean you know imagine anything similar said about any woman by any Republican or conservative\nI mean it's outrageous the double standard and then so flagrant but\nYou know we're we're already have paid between health care education criminal justice we've already paid trillions of dollars for people that didn't respect our laws and sovereign states costs the American people a fortune and by the way the people of California and now we're going to be paying for their health care for free no questions asked\nBy the way we have in Georgia a democratic nominee for governor Stacey Abrams a who are clearly favors allowing illegal immigrants to vote a says the show's on Romney distinction between the people who are American citizens and people who came here illegally\nUm and that's that's sort of typical Gavin Newsom candidate for governor in California\nWho openly says he wants to have government run health care and make it available to every illegal immigrant who can get to California I mean the Democratic party is becoming the party of illegality the party of breaking go all the point you made earlier and a party which\nBelieves that can't win was legal American votes and so it's kind of try to find some way\nTo turn around the system and it's an amazing thing to watch develop\nOr we're going to get Newt Gingrich has predicted

now surge to record levels and the three months since President Trump and the family separations at the border dealing the administration a deepening crisis three weeks before the ... the terms it's not a crisis\nDonald Trump has said it for ever\nYesterday or last two days\nMocked that the wall isn't the tension of his manhood by Nancy Pelosi for crying out loud how many Democrats have been saying they want to eliminate ice how many Democrats support sanctuary cities\nHow many Democrats don't want a border wall because they want open borders because they calculated politically it benefits them you know forget about you know they haven't been down to the border Thirteen times like I have from the Rio Grande the San Diego\nYou know helicopter horse back all terrain vehicles foot boats you name it cars trucks I've been there\nI've seen gang members arrested I've got the video I met in drug warehouses I've got the video I've caught people while I'm at the border literally beginning their cross at the Rio Grande\nI sat with Rick Perry at a meeting the Brock Obama should have been at and what did I hear six hundred and forty two thousand Texans victims of crimes by illegal immigrants in a seven year period and we played that video and showing you that audio\nA up showing you that video and play that audio for you is how many times\nYou know you see tunnels built from Mexico into the United states want to know where opioids are coming from I don't know where a lot of the heroin is coming from you want to know are a lot of the ... coming from we have nearly a hundred thousand dead people a year now because of drugs crossing our borders\nAnd here the president say no we just want borders but\nYou know we'll we'll put a big door in and we'll just vet people so we know they they come with the best of intentions and\nLove and respect our our way of life and want to be a part of our family it's unbelievable yeah border patrol then you've got the sanctuary city and now we have a sanctuary state of California what does that mean\nWell that means people that we know are here illegally that broke the laws to get in here no respect for our sovereignty no respect for American law\nWell now we know those people when they got caught committing other crimes some of them well pretty serious those six hundred and forty two thousand crimes I mentioned included yeah murder in some cases\nHow many parents angel moms we put on this program and angel dads on this program and they tell the stories about illegal immigrants that were in the justice system that were let out\nYou know you got all these people now that now the or doesn't want to talk or Glenn Simpson pleading the fifth Rod Rosenstein not only not turning over documents is time to talk to the wall Street Journal but no time to talk to a the members of Congress and and it ain't over the documents\nSo I understand it's on track it's a little more complicated than him just saying release it releases the second lawyers are on it as as the latest that I heard my sources\nBut I think I Hope that they get released before the election because I think the American people deserve to see it\nYet it they're trying to put them in jail he needs help himself\nListen I I Will tell you this has been a soft coup attempt\nThere's no doubt about we know what the insurance policy is\nWe know what the league strategy is we know that they knew there was no Russia Trump collusion even in the words of Peter Struck there is no they're they're Lisa Page even saying no we had nothing\nThat's why they started leaking the the phony dot CA information all the left wing or is in the news media they never told them that it was on verified are uncorroborated like they never told the ... the courts\nThat it was on verified uncorroborated they tried to lie to us manipulate us with lies from Russia that Hillary paid for before the election\nAnd they tried to take down a duly elected president after the election so you're right um but I promise you I'm On it listen I can walk and chew gum at the same time but\nThe big but here we got an important election in Nineteen days I got to prioritize the content of the program a but we didn't talk about it as you know in the last half hour All right let's get back to our phones or let's say Hi to Harry is in North Carolina on the Sean Hannity show what's up Terry how are you\nDoing a show and thank you for what you do you love your show\nOh thank you I'm Glad about what's going on and say\nWell you know I I I hear you talk or I

out there on the senator stores in their faces at restaurants that were smart they are not educated than there are calls I don't understand how soon are not out there pushing back on them\nWell I mean what do you mean by pushing back you mean that if they go low we're supposed to kick them do you mean that if they go low that we're supposed to you know get a crowd and follow them into restaurants

ago\nAnd was asked about this he was as serious as you can be in describing what he understood took place in that meeting between Andrew McCabe and Rod Rosenstein where Mr Rosenstein talked about actually recording the president of the United states so he needs to come in and answer questions like I said if it's ... that's exactly what should be a shoo\nSo ... you were in a deposition with with James Baker the first one and you're going to end with him this upcoming Thursday what do you want to get from James Baker this week\nWell first of all remember who said this is this is the FBI chief counsel all kinds of things flow through him so when he says that he believe Rod Rosenstein was serious about this this ... this alleged a statement about recording the president\nYou got to take that with the way that it comes with because if the if the FBI chief counsel so we're going to ask you more about that we had our our previous deposition was cut off early\nWe go we we ran out of time so we need him back in there we're we're going to ask more about that specific meeting that took place and then his conversations with people who were in that meeting how those wins and who all he talked to so the all those things need to be a quick\nBreak right back from Palm Beach it's the Sean Hannity show [noise]\nFamily\nBut then I realized things were different\nI have trouble focusing

the connection\nI'm Len Burman and I'm like all ready to have the latest from its stumble on the murdered journalist and movie reviews Halloween removed and Melissa McCarthy Newark is Len Burman and Michael real in the morning tomorrow sick to than I Am on the voice of New York seven ten wor where you are\nOr leave it leads to pay for that nothing and Peter Struck it said there's no there there but they still had their insurance policy in place than a media elite strategy in place what was the media elite strategy well that was to lead the contents of Hillary bought and paid for dirty Russian dot CA just like the same information\nWas used to obtain the size of warrants against Carter Page you can't make any of this up poor people now say Rod Rosenstein yeah he wanted to wear a wire on the president I'm James Baker is back on the hill today remember he was one of the four people\nThat was very clear about Rod Rosenstein and we're still awaiting the de classification of let's see three oh two gang of eight information Pfizer warrants\nWere also awaiting you know whether or not we're going to get an redacted Pfizer applications pages ten through twelve Seventeen to thirty four remember the bulk of information for the price of warrants\nWas the pony never verified never corroborated Russian dot CA that Hillary paid for there's so much it stinks to high heaven or John Solomon out with an article yesterday in his article\nWhat he's talking about all these FBI pop the oj officials there on all the special interest junk kits\nAnd guess who is probably the most frequent user of the Robert Mueller's pit bull Andrew Weissmann yeah that Andrew Weissmann they went after Paul Manafort that Andrew Weissmann that of course was responsible for tens of thousands of Americans losing their jobs\nAs it relates to Anderson accounting when you go back years and the Enron investigation\nThe same guy that was overturned nine zero in the U.S Supreme Court the same guy the center for Merrill executives to jail for a year\nAnd that got turned over by the Fifth Circuit court of appeals it sounds complicated it really isn't it is the single biggest abuse of power corruption scandal in the history of the country\nAnd I haven't even mentioned\nThe abuse of the powerful tools of intelligence\nThat we give these people supposedly to protect us joining us now a civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney David shown in Carter Page was banned at the center of all of this for the last year and you know Carter I Know that you're moving forward with investigations lawsuits and I don't blame you one bit I mean\nFrom everything you've told me is that our FBI our CIA our intelligence community knew well because as your work took you to foreign lands when you come back\nFrom places like Russia or you would willingly ... feet deep briefed ... and and tell them everything you know to help your country out so uh I guess if you are really the bad guy that needed to be surveilled and\nThey needed to Hillary Clinton's unverified phony Russian ... to do it\nAs the presentation to commit fraud on the ... of course I Would think you'd be indicted right now if you were as bad as they say\nChina it's just it's just getting crazier and crazier every day I uh I think it just uh just this week we have the Saudis that are um owning up to various things that may have happened there and you know starting investigation\nAbout things and they had happened a couple of days or or eat with within the last few weeks\nI mean this is something that is you know people have been covering up here in the United states for over two years so I think as a a you know a symbol of democracy a symbol of\nGood government and hopefully uh hopefully the uh the car just starting to fall here and people will start phoning up to all the uh all the wrong doing that was done and I I think we're getting into that if you've been a a all over in terms of your reporting so\nBring David and David as an attorney in a in a really good attorney you know Congress has a constitutional roles called oversight their job they or their check we have a system of separation of powers and checks and balances part of their oversight is when they are investigating the investigators\nThey been obstructed every step of the way\nRequest document requests we have found instance after instance where they cite national security is a reason for not turning something over only to be turn out to be having nothing to do with national security only an embarrassment to them now we see in in just the last two weeks\nOh Rod Rosenstein who gives an extensive interview to the wall Street Journal here's enough time to testify under oath\nGlenn Simpson has pleading the fifth now that your doesn't want to appear and testify under oath James Baker is testifying today and James Baker and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe one other person all saying Rod Rosenstein wanted to wear a wire\nTo go after the president of the United states or if you are representing\nOur friend Carter Page here I mean I Would think you'd have a multitude of lawsuits and the Carter page ought to be a pretty rich man by the end of all of us\nYeah quarter page has a strong basis for thinking not only information but also damages and relief and he is now by the way a course\nConducting some litigation going after that doesn't Carter Page is very important to St example of how very wrong things have gone both but the ... the court and otherwise and governments you hit the\nProbably the most important thing going on here Congress's role in providing oversight\nUm you know God willing congressman Munoz is going to return after this election his work I'm doing good let's work as vital Congress to no longer bluff though anymore they've got to compel the testimony of these folks I think there's a real argument for a Fifth Amendment waiver from the public statements\nThat these folks make the American public the man's transparency\nAnd they deserve nothing less and transparency and by the way these aren't simple mistake that have gone on you know we've talked about this Ninety nine page report on fire the court a abuses that a director Rogers was talking about\nUm these aren't just mistakes these are conscious efforts an agenda by law enforcement officers to invade the law\nThere is by the way one author or as a new that no one really has exploited yet and that's a fight the quarter review\nThere is a court that just above the five to court there was also under their rule for consider procedural motions there three judges to chief justice of the right now that said just cabana sent telling talent from different circuits maybe ... maybe that court should be the subject\nOf the uh the ... the foreign promotion trees you what's going on in the ... the court also just remembering you have in the ... the court efforts\nBy the ... where are these buys a court judges\nA fraud was committed on every one of them they were that run verified uncorroborated information to spy on the guy you're also talking to on this on this line quarter page why haven't we heard from them yet\nYou're right they should be outraged collie or the judge and the court and these judges other quarter review it violates their own rules rules Thirteen\nAnd it violates the Constitution's and as you pointed out many times the most sensitive area of our government probably because it's part they application for the most intrusive kind of eavesdropping that there is in the world\nNo you know there was an article by John Solomon I Want to just read a little bit of it to both of you and carnival salt would do to get your reaction considering you were\nAs of now you appear to be the victim and all of this unless something changes ... Carter Page that I don't know about you are as\nOf now have you with this horrible person that needed to be surveilled\nAnd not just basically a I don't know shaken the armor to get a Trump and then you become the on winning victim in a witch hunt against him but you know because you were light about they use phony information to obtain the war against you but of all the agencies and the federal government\nSolomon points out that shouldn't be immune to special interest schmoozing the D O D J it's premier law enforcement agencies like the FBI the DEA the bureau\nOf Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives topped the list their independence from influence and their integrity and meaning out the law fairly are essential\nTo their success and the trust\nThe American public puts in them but\nThis week the D.
