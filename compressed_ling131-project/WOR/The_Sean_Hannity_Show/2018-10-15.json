information that was supposed to be verified and corroborated ended up being Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lives\nThat was put together by fusion GPS interestingly funneled money through ... from the hiring of Christ is Christopher Steele a foreign national he doesn't even stand by the information and the CIA and it was\nThe bulk of information to get for Pfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate and the lead up to the twenty sixteen race\nAll this comes down to some simple basic fundamental things and they never told the Pfizer judges that it was Hillary Clinton the paid for this information and it's unbelievable that this could be happening in this country but it looks like we are finally beginning to get to the bottom of it at least I Hope so\nJason

thank you both for being here let's start with Jason shape it's because this is your will house\nAnd it seems to me that it doesn't matter what Congress request as they seek to do their job of

you issue a subpoena when I was the chairman of the oversight commission or committee I can issue a subpoena but the only way to earn for that it's through the department of justice and so the weight of the paper really isn't worth much because the deejay won't enforce its own subpoena the subpoena issued by Congress\n... the name that people need to also familiar ... themselves with is mark and

transactions in the movement of money and I think more and more you'll start to see his name along with you know or and Simpson and all these others\nBut I think the fact that ... Simpson is now saying Victoria that was going to plead the fifth and it can get away with that and make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they can just threatened to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think is important\n[noise] they should make him show up and in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth it's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers and I hope Jason you're talking to your former French and telling them to get them a get hit in\nTo the Congress to take this it and I don't care if they're not going to\nUm ... because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it you've got a subpoena you subpoenaed first and then you negotiate later you don't say oh mine he didn't show up talking trying to work it out now you have to think about CNN said Pina and then you say you can't make it Wednesday then you make it Thursday\nThat I Can't believe there's no ... well\nI mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the ... the gang of eight information that three oh two between\nA Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office uh Joe diGenova but you know the idea of why do I think even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying oh I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on course to get some pages but let me just say this 'cause this is really important all the names that you heard Michael ... Mr liar and said\nOr all those people they are ... to everything that was done in the United states\nWhat's fascinating is what happened in the United kingdom between the Congress as an issue any subpoenas court we now know that the FBI or am I fix and that you do a few\nTo conduct electronic surveillance of Americans said he said it on foreign soil without legal authority to do so and that information was fact conversations of George ... were intercepted and in the course of intercepting those compensation\nThey found out that the top of it was not interested in Hillary email or anything else and they never ... information because by the court\nYou know it seems congressman shape it's that every piece of the puzzle now is falling in place I think we now understand what the insurance policy was Lisa Page testify that in the the nine months of the investigation leading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller\nThat they had no evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all\nUm and by the way even her lover Peter Struck said the same thing he said well I'd be all end up there was something there there's no there are there and then all of a sudden we find the media league strategy that they discussed it this way Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in\nAnd what we see is again it goes back to the Clinton bought and paid ... that dossier information has leaked out to the media creating the impression that in fact there was Russia Trump collusion\nBut they did it themselves they took the again it's it's all they were doing the leaking so that they can appoint the special counsel so that in the which one could be good begin\nI is there any part of the puzzle that isn't clear to you because it's getting very clear to me\nDo it is becoming a crystal clear\nAnd that's why Jim Jordan is exactly right the people that were in that meeting and river the timing of this evening this meeting happens directly after\nA district Colombia's relief of his duties but just before a Mr Mueller is put into place and you have to understand who's in that meeting what was discussed it sounds like bakers being the most candid
