I'm telling you I have the people are Texans are not going to put up with this I Know the people attacks us they're not you know you have what I think they start early voting on Monday in Texas\nUm so that's coming to to ahead I mean barring a disaster I mean it only is is it's like the brains me of Obama in the sense that he's cool\nOh beta or Rourke it's it it is they out side taxes phenomenon\nNot attack it only by the way this is the New York DC thing this is the San Francisco LA thing he gets a full hour on fake news CNN he can't even gone to a million viewers\nThat so that's not just taxes that's the whole country you know we could have put it on short wave radio and TV he could've done a Facebook Live show or Twitter live show and done better than a million anyway so you know then you know taxes by the way we have some examples there\nOf people asking non citizens to register to vote that's now becoming a big problem down in Texas oh by the way even MSNBC held paid or rock as a rock star it can be the twenty twenty nominate\nA yeah try and get through Ted Cruz first good luck with that but we're following all these races let me tell you where I think we are right now I think the Republicans\nI think between the caravan that we now have coming towards us four thousand people strong\nThat want to get to the southern border or the United states from Central America I Know that the secretary of homeland security secretary Nielsen I I had an opportunity to call her office earlier today because I actually do real reporting on this show and get an update\nUh apparently as of now there's full cooperation with the Mexican government\nThat that's not gonna happen\nBut four thousand people still four thousand people and what did Democrats what did they resist that they don't want a solution\nFor the board our problem we have with the opioids crossover human trafficking is occurring you know we they now are using these drug cartels you can't say they're stupid they're evil but they're not stupid they've been using\nIn this I Can't even believe this is true you know these drones that they fly with cameras above him so they'll fly from Mexico into the United states along our southern border they fly drones with cameras on them and what they do is they map\nOut where the border patrol\nWhere agents aren't\nSo then they give like the perfect entry way where it's they're most likely to succeed in bringing in their heroin and their fat and all and drugs that are really being targeted towards your kids your town your cities that's how evil these drug cartels are and how desperate they are\nTo be successful or the president while he offered now we spent three and a half billion dollars so far that's the only amount of money that has been allocated towards the wall these pens every penny\nBut we need twenty five billion dollars total to get the whole job done that in part is what this election is about it's also about a party that has given up any sense of honor\nAnd any sense of constitutional or authority let the rule of law that is based on our constitution that would mean due process\nThat would mean equal or access on there are laws equal application of our laws\nAnd we know that they gave that up any sense of due process with judge Kavanaugh it wouldn't even give him the honor of the presumption of innocence even after an FBI investigation the eighth one that he's had in his like well now they want a nine to one but the way I see it Eighteen days out\nIs that we've got the Senate is looking better Rick Scott has a slight lead now in Florida but it's not big enough\nDo you want if you want rex where Scott has killed himself\nAnd done such a great job for the state of Florida look at how\nThis man is all hands on deck doesn't sleep every hurricane he's prepared to help out those that are victims amazing I maybe doesn't have the most charisma in the world will be the first to tell you that but you know one thing I'm a little sick of\nA lot of politicians with a lot of hot air MPs that talk a good game and just they're lying to us which is part of the whole democratic strategy\nThat's why project very tossed catching Brett ascent on tape\nThis campaign saying oh yeah well he's just saying he'll support cow but he's not going to support cabinet he's not going to\nBe I\nI just can't believe that he

he's going to join us on Hannity tonight\nAnd you take the libertarian component out of the polls and Joe Donnelly toast in Indiana\nYou can't waste your vote on the libertarian and I'm not trying to be rude I Love libertarians I've libertarian positions but the reality is it's ... they're not drawing any votes away from Donnelly they're drawing them away from his republic Republican opponent\nI

that is what eleven o'clock tomorrow morning unused and then we'll be in Beaumont, Texas at three thirty tomorrow\nLooking forward to that and uh I'll be interviewing Ted Cruz and we'll be hearing a lot of this on a Monday obviously CNN as they made their decision or they're supporting which is pretty fascinating anyway we just Eighteen days away from these all important midterm elections\nAnd what do we see we see that Britain has now been exposed this week in Tennessee is somebody that is purposely lying to the people ... the the same with Claire McCaskill we say that Christian cinema is falling apart I mean literally\n... you know she she says oh it's fine to be a fine to join you know radicals um and the Taliban actually said oh and by the way this\nThis is the meth capital of the world Arizona oh by the way you're crazy and she has anti war rallies while her opponent Republican Martha ... valley\nIs that we're fighting for a country that's not playing well very very well right now in the state of Arizona and you see that Heidi Heitkamp totally out of touch with the people of North Dakota so it seems a lot of pick up in the making there for the Senate for the Republicans\nTight race though in Florida both for governor in for Rick Scott who always does an amazing job for the people of Florida are anyway joining us to analyze where we are Eighteen days out is our good friends welcome back to the program John McLaughlin Doug shown pollsters both of them\nJohn Eighteen days out what do you see happening\n[noise] uh well the the house is still in play and the Republicans are a without a doubt are fighting back to have gotten more aggressive but still it needs to do a lot more and and what's really amazing to me is the focus of\nYou know you're exposing the Democrats in what their agenda is all the time but the focus of the Republicans really needs to\nBe to expose Nancy Pelosi once she intends to do I think you played a clip earlier about humor in the Senate and he wasn't very specific about whether they're going up in the polls because the Republicans post Kavanaugh uh have have really done a lot better at ... in a\nIn the Senate polls that have come up I mean when you're talking about uh Arizona modalities now hit by a little in Tennessee the Republicans leading now decisively a sort of ... so the ... the Democrat opportunities to pick on the Senate look like they're going off the table\nAnd on the other hand it looks like the Republicans are ahead in Missouri they're they're they're running close races in in Montana Indiana\nWest Virginia I mean even in New Jersey uh it's it's turning into a competitor\nBut it's really look like the Jersey might be a dog fight for Bob Menendez and the people in New Jersey of had it with him and you know now that his association with the Chilean Epstein guy\nUh that has now become an absolute verbal war between ... and his Republican opponent a opponent and now showing up at the polls are dug so where do you stand Eighteen days out\nWell hey where America's fans in St John and you are right\nOn fortunately I might add is that the Senate has moved pretty decisively Republican I don't think the New Jersey will go all the way because it is a operationally democratic state but the other states you cite Sean I think are moving in what I think are the wrong direction I\nStill have a chance to pull out in Nevada and Arizona but both of those at the terrier rated above it from my perspective it'll last\nWeek and I think Arizona in particular but Dean Heller was in a very tight race for reelection the Republican he\nWas ... it was a to point raised so we could go Donald Trump goes in and now he's up by seven and I saw the crowds when I was out there was massive but the crowd outside was even bigger than the one inside\nWell look at\nIt yeah it was gonna say I I've seen the thing numbers John please go ahead\nThen there's an absolutely I mean the president is motivating his base and and the Republicans need to embrace up because a nationally when he won he had sixty three million voters and when the the uh uh\nUh when the midterms occur we only get Ninety million people usually out might be a little more this time but it won't be as big as the hundred and thirty nine million who showed up in a twenty sixteen\nSo if you can get the sixty three million Trump voters motivated that they're coming out again which the Kavanaugh hearings did\nAnd it appears to backfired\nParticularly on Senator Schumer and the and the Democrats in the Senate or if you can motivate those Republicans to come out\nThose Trump voters those independents and Democrats that supported them they have a very good shot at getting Senate seats and it's probably the only shot they have of winning the house that that and going after Nancy Pelosi the idea of stopping Nancy Pelosi the most popular a\nFoil let me tell you what I'm saying I'm ready on TV if you vote I don't care what congressional district here and there were four hundred and thirty five congressional districts in this country in any of those districts\nIf you vote for any Democrat you're voting for a pillow see if you stay home it's half of ... and the same in the Senate if you're going to vote for tester and McCaskill\nAnd send them on against Dean Heller and Donnelly and you're going to vote for you know Brett us and it was just a phony fraud to the people of\nGetting caught on tape being it uh and and not put more Marsha Blackburn and you know you'll get the government you deserve but you're really electing and voting for Schumer because they're gonna they're gonna tow the line with polo see in the house and told a line which humor in the Senate that's\nYou know and what do we know that they want they want to impeach the president they want endless investigations\nThey want to raise taxes they're actually saying that\nThey're hiding the impeachment begging Maxine Waters not to say it any more John Podesta Center for American Progress and said all Democrats should not talk about immigration for say one open borders sanctuary cities\nSanctuary states that elimination of ice and they want to keep a bomb a care that's not that didn't work for eight years dug and the\nWhite white Donnelly who is holding a bit of both leading Indiana is saying a key pie is saying go the wall and he's saying no impeachment which\nWhen he was the only reason he surviving and not down by five or six now is because you've got a libertarian in that race that is polling at nine percent you take a libertarian out Donnelly is history and Indiana\nWell I wouldn't be so sure on but he is running where Democrats may to being the center and\nIf we were a centrist party rather than a leftist party with new leadership from top to bottom I think we'd be doing a lot better I think you'd probably agree with that song\nHow is it possible that Democrats hold on to below sea and Schumer how was it ... it is a phenomenon to me ...\nAll one word answers on Snowden's money so you know raising enough money yeah ...\nThat's what it's all about ... and and and he's absolutely right because showing that when we asked in September and a national holiday there were packed into when we ask voters if the Democrats took over Congress do you want and she pulls you speaker done only twenty three percent of all voters said yes fifty six percent said now\nBut then when we asked them about the fact that you know if you know that there except in that these candidates are accepting millions of dollars to raise them for their campaigns from Nancy Pelosi or a willing older votes to her fifty percent agreed with that statement only twenty nine percent disagreed of all voters so think\nNancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer hold the mortgage on these candidates and let me tell you for for ... for someone who's involved in congressional races right now trying to defend Republicans the Democrats are pouring millions of dollars in to the races right now\nWhat entered patio and he's made and Republicans\nProject very toss released to tapes and they are stunningly\nYou know revealing in terms of\nThe willingness of campaigns to purposely organized a campaign\nTo lie to the people at Tennessee in the case of Brett us and to lie to the people of Missouri in the in the case of\nClaire McCaskill to say one thing privately another thing publicly it tells me Democrats too when they have to they can expose who they are they can't talk about impeachment which they want\nThey can't talk about immigration and being told not to talk about that they can't talk about raising taxes even though they want that they can't talk about Obamacare even though they want that\nI mean what kind of people are they if they have zero sense of honor honesty character and then I Hope\nYou are exempt me from the uh person\nWill hire them to you but you know nobody's been listening to you because if they were listening to you have a whole entirely different slate of candidates and frankly the Republicans wouldn't have a shot this year\nWell thank you I take that as a real well it's the fact that many notes on sale radical left\nThough I I'm I'm a center right\nListen I your your style a Democrat listen this is the party that kicked out Joe Lieberman Joe Lieberman is one of the most the Thin Man
