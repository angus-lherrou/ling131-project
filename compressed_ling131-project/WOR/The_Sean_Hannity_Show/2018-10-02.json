maybe it doesn't matter to you but it matters to those that are producing eggs and poultry\nThat had been shut out of Canada because we had an unfair deal us drug companies have ten years to sell their name brand products in Canada before they go generic well that's up two years that's billions of dollars in many cases\nThere is no increase protections on intellectual property there are no

has no idea who she is and the other two people never got back to us so they can't corroborate any of this but they say they can and the lawyer keeps saying they can but she backed tracks on a story at what point does the man\nYou know how does Brett Kavanaugh to quote\nYou know infamously radon of anyone saying how do I get my good name back or famously saying you know how does this go office civil discourse in this country\n... ... okay you know I find it particularly appalling that some of these never Trump hers and are these questions and then the entire democratic leftist apparatus had the audacity\nTo make all these charges and slander and and destroy a cabin on in his family\nAnd had the audacity to suggest that he shouldn't stand that independence out and that his dealings with passion indicates\nThat he doesn't have the requisite judicial temperament this are on the United States Supreme court they can hair his righteous indignation his is to our a rant which was totally justifiable than necessary and back to preserve his position\nRon too they compare that to the twelve years on the bench when he had exemplary judicial temperament\nWhich is universally acclaimed I find their uh I find their analysis absurd on its face and shouldn't even be taken seriously this guy has grand you digital camera I Would hate to have that kind of\nGuy and how was somebody supposed how was somebody supposed to act if they're accused of being a serial gang rapists who drug drug young girls as a matter of course on weekends in high school how I mean what is the proper response you supposed to go there is and the guys I just didn't do that\n[noise] yeah ... ...\nWho were falsely accused to react exactly the way that Brett Kavanaugh did ah when you're Regis leaves wrong you're angry and he expressed the appropriate to righteous indignation of an innocent man uh but the most important thing he said was I don't question\nThat ah Christine Blasey Ford was it some time and it someplace sexually assaulted it just wasn't me so he's he's not calling her a liar or what he has a centrally doing is saying she is mistaken\nFor a variety of reasons she may have conflated to different\nUh individuals' or she may be projecting based on you know some uh for some reason that we don't understand a but this was a man who sounded like he was being falsely accused into can damn him for being angry is to ignore human emotion\nWell let's say you're good\nAt it and contrast that with his response on the market in the column interview and I was watching that very concerned I thought he was a flat out that he was a very much to restrain and I said to myself\nAnd robotic if he doesn't quit holding himself that nobody's going to blame them and I'm telling you nobody would've believed him if he had done that same thing but he finally somebody a coach them and by coaching somebody told him quit holding back or he called himself and he was masterful because no matter how many people said\nWhy she was ... she was initially believe well she was credible\nThey they believe that I can in multiples when he testified and he totally indicated itself it was a mashable reporter because I think it was thought that it\n[noise] but what a ... where does it go from here because um I have no I mean Jeff snowflake is Jeff snowflake who knows what he's running for president now and and headed up the Massachusetts New Hampshire I guess he thinks he's going to beat Donald Trump I I don't think this guy could get Fifteen votes at this point\nThen you have what Susan Collins we have no idea where she's coming down on this although she rightly said with Diane Feinstein did is unfair to everybody in the process and then you've got Lisa Murkowski I mean she was a a no vote when she was needed on numerous occasions\nYou know I to me there's only one to answer the answer is thirty five days from now and that's when the American people have an opportunity to add more senators from West Virginia from Indiana from North Dakota from Missouri from Florida\nI'm from Arizona Nevada and but until then you know I don't know what happens I have no faith\nThat anybody really gives a rip that this man's life as been bludgeoned his family has been bludgeoned then there's there's no corroborating evidence for any of it\nBut I think we have to wait to see what happens or in the FBI's report if the investigation finds nope plausible evidence against Kavanaugh this will not only helped to restore his reputation and solidify the integrity of the United States Supreme court at large\nBut it will also give\nA valid reason to senators like Murkowski and Collins a and Jeff Flake and somebody like Joe mansion and and perhaps a couple of others\nAre who are Democrats to vote in favor of Kavanaugh but I find it amazing to me or that we're holding Kavanaugh to an unfair a standard of his behavior in\nHigh school and college as alleged I doubt very many Democrats in the United States Senate could could meet that standard and some of these allegations chili sweat Nick are preposterous on their faces you point out she's now backtracking NBC issued a statement\nSaying that uh we can't confirm any of what she's saying and in fact she's deviated now from her sworn affidavit or in her most recent interview with NBC News so you know that\nA claim what do you think of the view which again this statement only come out a week prior and multiple multiple I mean she backtrack dramatically on very key points\nAnd when you think of the seriousness of drugging girls in gang raping them and now she well he was near the punch bowl and well he wasn't lined up for the I saw him in the hall and nobody else I mean she was saying this was done as a matter

there's NBC News going forward with\nNothing after all this was was absolute ... how\nDoes this task for news story when on top of everything they even admit there's massive inconsistencies from the statement she released just a week ago you would think she can stay consistent in a week and the people that she says what corroborate remember she's charging here\nThat there was a a a systemic party culture where almost every weekend that women girls young girls\nWere being drugged with ... and and ... forced to be in ... and young boys would then lined up outside the rule waiting to gang rape\nWomen and girls and that does happen\nHe's six years ago and nobody ever ever ever told a parent told a teacher told law enforcement and she gives the names just like in the case of\nProfessor Ford of individuals that would quote corroborate this story and it's not corroborated just the opposite well this guy is dead and on top of that than we've got oh this one doesn't even know who you are\nHow does this how do you where is the news handed in any capacity here\nTo put this on the air\nByron York is joining us he's been running a lot of columns about there is not the least of which is how high the bar has risen in the goalposts we've come a long way from oh it's going to be very limited in terms of the FBI investigation it's only going to be maximum a week and they'll get the job done and will move forward with a vote\nNow you see that a Camille Harris she's now coming out with another allegation just today\nMyron hey Sean listen on this on this NBC thing I think everybody's\nGot to be in two minds about it a war on on the basis of the lack of evidence and all of\nA there is no way to stories should ever had been reported publicly just shouldn't have bad but it was given in part a but due to the news networks um thing about Michael I have an anti her lawyer\nSo once it was all out there the fact that NBC has reported this is probably a good corrective or at least where you can see what I think what it was a parent to a lot of people are there just wasn't nothing to this story [noise]\nUm and when she offered um witnesses who could corroborate the stories you just played a one had no idea who she was another was deceased and to others didn't answer the phone so I'm the story is already out there and has already gone to damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know fledged investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work\nBut

a lot going on Mitch McConnell just earlier said that the FBI report will be finished\nAnd we will have a boat on Capitol and uh I assume it's going to happen at some point this week do we have any any timetable idea\nI don't know yet but uh I think that's correct so here with the agreement with our colleagues and Chris Coons was never part of the agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware Chris but he was never part of this agreement what\nCompromise has been reached for Chris Coons he is voting no he's asking for the investigation to continue our around whether or not he's been honest about his drinking habits to Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and mystery Maris and the fall and incredibly incredible lead within a week I think the FBI is about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and see if it's changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalpost Geoff oh did you sing committee\nWith the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopefully get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited in scope and now it is expanded out\nFurther we now see the ... ah your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii he wants men by the way to sit down and shut up\nYeah which was pretty outrageous statement but anyway a senator Hirono now is saying she wants to know the FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report yeah\nYeah that's ... hours so my dad owns a bar\nAnd so a throwing I says like a good day in a bar so the bottom line is that fell bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that said the goal was to delay\nA the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace a Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was the three witnesses that Dr Ford named\nMess for marriage as isn't there any a credible leads within that world of FBI will follow them and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped a huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake is going to end up voting in this I have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do\nA there your colleagues maybe you up some more insight than I Am but\nTo me they're the ones that met privately with Joe Manchin and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but those to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but\nIt'd be a fall one vote short you came up with a pretty\nInteresting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh delay legitimize the\nWay he was treated at the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with their senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kavanaugh the traditional way of doing business is if he fell one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man it's been abused I'm not given up on hand less have an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact most Democrats wouldn't know no matter who Donald\nTrump ... they've already against score sick\nYeah All right so now what is going to happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and\nWell a smart question Martha\n... is a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes\nI don't believe the FBI is going to find anything\nA relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are ... for its claims are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're warning death vi to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking me a hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party\nThat we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota wants a Heidi Heitkamp to vote no\nI agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country and November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to these red state ... state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh [laughter] so you mean you're you're communicating hand I don't I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listed there that are beyond that I doubt\nIf they're lifting I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary\nThe states couldn't be higher this about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know it's about who would come forward after this debacle is about setting the tone and the standard that will destroy the ...\nAnd eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook that if we had to as a last resort we're one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box and about thirty something days\nThirty five we can find yeah find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have a light salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of the states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is a Brett Kavanaugh's nomination is far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nWell it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for Kavanaugh it's only an election year conversion and there were only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to to being a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\nDay [laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or a political scientist I don't care as like you know I'm a bad this I don't care how you find Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh was highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point\nThis has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and that's saying a lot it would change the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's just not a complicated issue for me\nIf we follow vote short a less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the
