get any closer\nAnd ah it's typical of a lot of races that are going around around the country he pulled us out\nYeah it's tough it's not the race just for my life it's for the people that live here it's for protecting the tax cuts\nThe one time we finally got a real tax cut direct money into the pockets of the people that live here instead of all that high taxes and spend that we've received from Albany under Governor Cuomo under the progressive socialist and ... and New York city that basically run\nOur our state and my opponent is one of them he actually had a lower conservative rating than some of the most socialist\nLeft leaning Democrats and the New York state assembly and he's trying to cast himself as a Republican or a moderate in his district keys narrow breathes once the word Democrat\nHe's trying to deceive and cons of voters here\nAnd just say okay I'm a moderate I get along I work with everyone you know when he gets he accepted Cuomo in silver whomever is telling them

are our middle class taxpayers are finally seeing a break free policies from the president\nBut now things to the governor of New York I'll say that and you know the district by the way approves of the way the president's doing his job\nOf according to the latest polls and Trump won the district by a healthy what ten point margin over Hillary Clinton in twenty sixteen I think it was eleven points to be specific and it's a district that has benefited not because of anything Albany has done I mean there was a recent editorial about how bad upstate New York has become\nUnder Cuomo and you know I sat with him and he looked me in the eye and said he's going to open up fracking before the last election he just lied to my face he did the exact opposite right after he was elected\nAnd meanwhile Pennsylvania's economy is growing up because they are now ... securing the prosperity of natural gas that exist in their state and we can be doing the same thing up in your area and we don't do it\nYeah actually we call it the Berlin Wall my district goes into Binghamton Broome county which is on the border\nOf Pennsylvania and you see the stark difference between the southern tier which

districts we've identified on Hannity dot com and people take it seriously and get out and vote\nI mean if every Trump voter once the success of the last two years to continue and goes to vote Republican in eleven days then that means we'll keep the house will pick up seats in the Senate and things will be a lot easier in the work will be getting done faster\nIf we don't do that then you know we get the government we deserve\nYou know I've had many ups and downs following political races in the course of my career wasn't exactly happy the two nights that Obama won especially thought he could have been defeated in twenty twelve alright it didn't happen\nAnd you do everything it can to stop the agenda on their side I'm prepared for whatever Nancy Pelosi an Adam Schiff Jerrold Nadler and Maxine Waters want to do to the country\nAnd we're not going to go away we're not gonna cry we're not going to be cry babies like they've been for the last two years and when they try to do things that are detrimental to the country and the president and they want endless investigations were going to be there as a backstop to tell the American people the truth and then some of you will probably regret that you didn't get out and vote\nThis election season so don't wait until I'm\nTelling you what's going to happen we know they only want Obama Care we do they want to open borders they don't want to fund the wall they believe in open borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states\nWe know they want their crumbs back we know they want higher taxes\nWe know they you know they don't
