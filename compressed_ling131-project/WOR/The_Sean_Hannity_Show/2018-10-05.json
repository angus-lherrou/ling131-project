third\nYear on the Fox news channel and my Thirty years on radio that was one of the most thoughtful speeches I think I've ever heard and I'm frankly shocked I'm Susan\nCollins over the years is frustrated the living daylights out of me were opinion so I think what stands out more than\nAnything else is the the since here come telling amount of gravity that she gave too hard decision\nAnd her speech and the gravity of the moment in an an bringing literally a sense of sanity\nTo what has become an absolute as she said circus around the country\nAnd systematically went over every single aspect of her decision making process from judge cabin on his judicial temperament\nThe questions that he specifically\nAnswered her passion about uh especially at night disagree with her on on roe v Wade but on the issue of constitutional precedence the role of advice\nAnd consent and the respect that she is showing the constitution the process and the whole process of and role of what it means to give advice and consent\nNow with Susan Collins that yes and Jeff Flake saying he is a yes\nOn Kavanaugh that now brings us to well Lisa Murkowski simulators ... know that brings us to fifty or what forty nine fifty one forty nine yeah so that brings us to forty nine\nSo really all comes down to I guess at this point\nJoe mansion and Lisa Murkowski and Lisa Murkowski appears to be a no and I guess mansion could be the yes is our math right on this who else is outstanding at this point because everybody else I think is on record\nYeah\nNo I've got to believe I think Joe Manchin by the way I don't think it'll be a surprise he voted yes\nTwo two and a to start the debate the thirty hours final vote a that'll happen mansion well here we go just broke mentioned is voting yesterday

out somebody better lend them up a private plane has some kind of get them over there\nUm what I had mired I think the most about this speech\nIs the pressure under which Susan Collins has been\nThere's literally in Maine going on now and by the way Maine is not exactly one of the most expensive media markets but she talked in the beginning\nAt length about the process\nAnd what this has now become a and talk about being a a gutter political campaign and millions of dollars and people in groups of people pledging to destroy her into feed her an upcoming elections et cetera\nAnd hum wow this is pretty amazing\nI was just an amazing speech eight hundred nine four one showing us auto for telephone number Lindsey Graham is going to join us now at the bottom of the hour or I mentioned voting yes flake voting yes and now Susan Collins voting yes which means the votes are there to confirmed judge Kavanaugh\nI Want to remind you if you have any sunspots over the summer I

I Believe Dr Ford something\nI don't believe facts show that it was a cat and all but I Believe something happen\nOr someone else it and I think something happened to her I was there was no way no way all the ... what do you pay two women who watched this process unfold her doctor ...\nAnyway even though they have and the\nSenate if I had to come forward I mean just so that's the way the herd trauma they want\nAnd ... and sympathy\nAnd they are her life would have adequate\nFBI investigation in in in four or five from you so much for the for the FBI was do you enjoy it I think there's always with a gun I get I looked at me and I make\nBased on what you see that at a thorough investigation by the way it was for them to live\nThe people that I was concerned about how they said what they said they did a five minute they're still in place for you know I'm just throw us for us to do with what you're up for reelection and difficult rates are you concerned debate going on in this one\nI have a minute on that bought the Thursday you bother me at all\n[noise]\nAll right that is the um [noise]\nWell that's the party of Nancy Pelosi if in thirty today she's the speaker of the house screaming in the background and\nAll the protesting that we have seen in the party of Chuck Schumer and and now we know a party that is willing to put all\nDue process aside fundamental core values constitutional protections like the presumption of innocence aside\nThat will go along with the guilt by accusation I think one of the more articulate moments who's in the beginning of of senator Collins speech today and how she rightly pointed\nOut there was opposition from day one Chuck Schumer was one of them there was nobody that President Trump that was that what was going to be nominated that was ever going to pass that they get many Democrats from the get go and I do believe that that\nJoe Manchin probably a short his reelection with this decision today but I don't really ... I don't really get the sense that the reading his statement in hearing what are you saying and what he's with standing in the halls of the Senate today uh that that really might impact that much at all I got the sense that he did it for all the right reasons as well as articulated by\nSenator Collins and what was the most riveting one hour speech is I think I've ever seen on the Senate floor that actually meant something and how she systematically went through every single not only allegation but the role of advice and consent the meaning of the constitution the interpretation of the federalist papers\nWhat it means to the whole issue in process of\nOf a presumption of innocence and and how important it is to society or even issues where I disagree with her like for example roe v Wade and precedence and and judge Kavanaugh is real record she she brought a level of of seriousness and sobriety to the entire debate\nI I just I I I don't know her and I frankly was blown away by this today and it give us some reaction all this we have David shown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney gray Jarrett Fox News legal analysts author of the number one bestseller the\nRussian hoax a great what was your reaction to that speech I don't know if you have the same reaction I did I was I was stunned I I don't know Susan Collins well but I Know a better today\nIt was nothing short of brilliant a week with uncommon eloquence and sound reasoning she delivered the finest speech on the floor of the U.S Senate that that I've ever witnessed in for a non lawyer\nIt was a compelling legal brief in support of Kavanaugh I thought it was important that at the outset\nCollins condemn the outrageous behavior the distortions by special interest groups activists protesters and some Democratic senators making it clear\nThat their shameful character assassination backfired on them as far as her vote is concerned and and I I the best part of what she said\nAh was ... many of Kavanaugh's opinion to demonstrate they'd even Democrats and liberals should be satisfied if not pleased with Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice\nBut you know she did something unique here\nUh she reported the sexual misconduct allegations\nAnd said in no uncertain terms that presumption of innocence and fairness is relevant in the Senate advise and consent duty and she announced her own standard for considering accusation she said it should be more likely than not which\nLawyers you know in the civil cases is called a preponderance of the evidence\nOr and she said it wasn't there\nThere were no witnesses to corroborate Christine forward including your closest friend nobody has any recollection of it all said so under penalty of perjury so she presented that\nThat was certainly the most impressive I mean her of a real obvious heartfelt caring for professor Ford\nAlso excoriated whoever it was and she doesn't believe it was Dianne Feinstein and she defended both ... and Senator Grassley in terms of the fairness\nWhich I said from the beginning I think the seriousness of the allegation deserved a serious response from the Republicans and often a critic of them and I think they did handle this perfectly on their side\nAnd but whoever did leak this today grave disservice to this woman and there's no doubt about that David shown let me bring you in and get your initial thoughts on what we watch unfold you are now with the announcement Jeff Flake Joe mansion and Susan Collins it would appear that tomorrow's vote expected to be around five in the afternoon eastern time on a Saturday\nOr that the\nThat judge Kavanaugh has the votes to be confirmed to the United States Supreme court\nRight certainly looks that way I'd like to think that senator Collins each brought some dignity back to the process is certainly did for the moment when she was speaking she you know as a student of Senator Bill calling from Maine I was a very close friend of mine with whom I disagreed on some issues but it was ... he thinks that same vein\nYou're absolutely right what she said was so critically important\nAgain it emphasized the language of article ... section two accredited she'll have the power with the advice and content\nWhat's been lost in all of this also critically important that she emphasized the presumption of innocence you know have some legal scholars and commentators during the course of this debate all of a sudden this and one of the presumption of innocence doesn't really apply this isn't a trial it's not a trial based\nConcept in American law that's in a mental block American principle that's the way we go about our business we don't assume based on allegations than a man or woman has built up a career is guilty was important for that\nUm I worry still I have to say about where we go from here because we have seemed to have here by United States senators and has been beyond the pale that I never in my wildest perhaps naive dreams could've imagined with hospitable people who simply don't know anything about\nFord or judge Kavanaugh carved out of the nation you were a bad guy if you didn't wear black to Columbia Law school during the Kavanaugh hearing that meant you might believe judge Kavanaugh this is beyond the pale future lawyers I'm worried about where we go from here the last one I Want to make them this is\nThe very same people who are limb basking printed in for daring to criticize cooking FBI agents who have been proven to be ... et cetera\nThose people for whom stroke was a hero or now criticizing the FBI if this wasn't a fairer thorough investigation they moved the ball or with their criticism whatever it is for judge Kavanaugh was he was a sex offender now is not that they don't like his demeanor because it took it personally when\nThey don't know they don't like is temperament I was once opposed to respond to be a serial drug or ... and gay rapist of teenage girls I I don't know what the appropriate response except if you're innocent just outrage and anger at a level that I couldn't even begin to describe but uh it looks like this goes forward it looks\nLike Kavanaugh has the

commercial free our unless it's really important news and we did that for you to our beloved audience because it was something that I wanted everybody to hear\nThis was a moment in history what has happened in the last Eighteen days can't continue to happen in this country\nYou cannot bludgeon people without any corroborating evidence the way judge Kavanaugh and his family have been bludgeoned you can have political differences and I've had my share with senator Collins over the years\nWhere I really realized today is I don't know her well\nShe doesn't do a lot of television she's not somebody I've interviewed a lot\nLike the most impressive thing that I took away from this is the seriousness\nThe intellect the the systematic be she walked every American through her decision making process and frankly it was flawless it was spectacular nothing\nShort of spectacular now I Know a lot of people are spending a lot of money and it's probably only going to get worse for her because she clearly followed her conscience on this issue and she had it ... it was obvious\nShe missed nothing she had followed every single solitary detail of this process\nDid all the work you would ever want or expect from a representative\nAnd and now I guess the left is about as one hinge did they ban I don't even think it's safe to walk the Senate ... at this point\nSenator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina I Would argue it would not have happened but for him\nAnd he joins us on our news maker line um you know you told me something when I was in Washington earlier this week\nUm tell us about manage and mentioned it yes to\nWhat mansions ESL light Joe and um you know he was a yes but Susan was the center of the storm and I'll say something about like we've had our differences I Know the president's had their differences but Jeff Flake also is that yes\nJeff Flake or is on the other side of a lot of things with Trump but he rose to the occasion and say listen I Want to hear more but I'm In ...\nWhat I Believe I Want to hear from Dr Ford he listened to you also listen to ... and the process her and Susan ... and crazy is going to make Kevin ... a better nominee more legitimate nominee so I Want to thank him too but in the end of the day this is about a person a single person\nWho is sort of the odd person out in politics\nRising to vacation and being that giant and to the extent I did my part thank you I wanted to stand up for a good man 'cause I've known him for Twenty years uh I wanted to let everybody in the country now have despicable and my eyes he was being treated and that they are had\nSenator finest moment and all the way I was on your good ... and I don't know yet as well have more or find him or her final gonna you're going to join\nUs on Hannity tonight will a full reaction it looks like the boat take place tomorrow in five or think Senator Lindsey Graham I wouldn't have happened without you in my humble opinion and ah you had I again I think you find this moment ever and uh and you've had other great moments as well uh eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number\nBut this process [noise] this blood Janine\nNeeds to and we'll talk about that and more and the election on the other side\nOn Saturday Saad seven\n[noise]\nAlright folks you and I both know that off year mid term elections are about one thing and I use showing up now this election is the most important midterm election in our lifetime your taxes\nSavings is on the ballot the American economy is on the ballot your jobs are on the ballot and your kid's futures\nAnd their jobs on the ballot or wages your four one K. is all of this is on the ballot and if you're a small business owner well your tax cuts are on the ballot also and here's the biggest political issue on the ballot who's in charge of America's future if you want to preserve the victories in the past two years\nI urge you right now to get involved this November go to this website tax cuts work dot com\nYou can make calls you can send emails and tax to knock on doors\nAnd of course take a neighbor to the polls go to tax cuts work dot com but there is the only way we lose and twenty Eighteen is if we don't show up\nTax cuts work dot com do your part let's not get out worked in November tax cuts work dot com check them out now dot com\n[noise] thirty two days we have an election not pollsters coming up John McLaughlin and dug shown mansion yes\nOn Kavanaugh Susan Collins e as Jeff Flake a yes we haven't got a definitive know yet as it relates to our fifty one it looks like now for judge capital of the vote tomorrow well the latest details more coming up straight ahead [noise]\n\nOn two years can you believe that there has never been\nDone so much and so little time to use no administrations come\nAnd look we went through a lot of that success earlier in the program and a lot of it bears repeating by the way I mean these are ... for a million jobs created since the election more Americans now employed\nThan ever recorded in our history unemployment the lowest since Nineteen sixty nine\nFour hundred thousand new manufacturing jobs those are the jobs Obama set a never coming back by the way things are only going to get better with the explosion in the energy sector once they can get up and online and Anwar and and continue coal mining the president's saving the coal mining industry in West Virginia singlehandedly\nAnd once we continue to extract more natural gas in the world would ever need and in three hundred years we have all of those ... resources of fourteen states record low unemployment\n... record low unemployment for Hispanic Americans African Americans Asian Americans youth unemployment fifty five year low median household income\nIts highest record ever recorded you know we have the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded for Americans without even a high school diploma and veterans' unemployment has now reached the slowest rate in Twenty years\nAnd four million people off of food stamps and I can just keep on going and then promises about the types of judges he put on the court and gutting endless\nBureaucratic regulation that that literally hamstrings all businesses in America\nPromoting buying in hiring America actively promoting and asking people to come and build their factories in manufacturing centers here and creating the economic conditions\nAnd the regulatory conditions where it's possible I mean that's why all these manufacturing jobs are coming back or reducing illegal immigration course defeating ISIS\nYou know a course pulling out of that idiotic Iranian deal and little rocket man not firing a missile over Japan every other day\nI'd say that's pretty good but with thirty two days out of the electorate a lot can happen between now and then John McLaughlin as pollster founder McLaughlin associates Doug shown is with us also a pollster author political analyst for Fox News\nOr thank you both for being with us well we can see I don't know if you want to call the cabin on balance or the cabinet awakening there's in every single state now Claire McCaskill is down significantly and the latest poll in Missouri\nJoe Donnelly is in trouble in Indiana Heidi Heitkamp is down and eleven in her state\nOf North Dakota or I say that Rick Scott will be the next senator from Florida and then of course Martha ... has been surging lately uh where do you think it stands at this moment John McLaughlin\n... I I think you're seeing a a definitely a cabinet effect but it's really what it is it's three gauge where the Trump voters are showing you know you're done and I talked about two years ago how Trump had to bring new voters and to to win the election and we did\nDonald Trump ignited billions and their voters who came out and voted in twenty sixteen that didn't vote twenty twelve that took a pass on Mitt Romney and\nUp until this time up until the hearing last Thursday a those voters were staying home or a good portion them a good portion of them weren't engaged and I think\nThey act it's got to see the the the actual hearing in the news coverage and the character assassination there were was politics I think the Democrats had looked ... Chuck Schumer is a really smart\nStrategic senator and he's the leader and he looked at that map and he said this thirty five seats up twenty six or eight hours entering states that that Donald Trump won what can I Do to try to take back the majority\nAnd he probably made a calculation if we can embarrass cabin or that the Republicans poll him it was suppressed the Trump voters so that a good number of those sixty three million would stay on because you only get Ninety million come out in the mid term elections so they they made they hit\nThe Republicans stuck from the president stuck with him and the Democrats were exposed to these voters are now outraged that the Democrats would put such a late hit on\nAnd try to smear good person who would remind them of their father their their their son their their their brother and said this was totally unfounded uncorroborated there's no evidence to it\nAnd they're trying to destroy this man and his family and the Republicans are ... the Republicans and independents who supported Trump or coming back out and you're seeing them in these calls that Missouri poet McCaskill behind was a poll that we did for super back she's down ... points down or you're seeing this I'm seeing this impulse every day\nIt's it's not a big explosion but what it is is Trump voters coming back in and Galileo well ... ... that Trump voters worked on what what\nWas a huge enthusiasm gap just a month ago a lot less than a month ago two weeks ago two and a half weeks ago\nUm has now totally and completely evaporated and conservatives have been awakened and and by the way Doug shown the party that we saw protesting and the party that Russia's to judgment the party that doesn't believe in due process the party that doesn't believe in the presumption of innocence for\nThe need for some core operation and the party that defended Clinton and defense Keith Ellison a I don't think they're looking too good here to the American people right now and they they are being shown to be the radical party I've been describing for some time\nSean I mean I don't quite know how to require but al ... and you can say I actually agree\nStay with your characterization and their handling of all of this has been pretty stupid and detrimental um to you know any sense that they have have any sense of moderation in this day and age\nWell I don't think they have any sense of moderation but what they do have is that I'm going to leave the house which I think it can lead to pick up the house can either\nFrom what I see looking at the Senate races there are all very very close within the margin of her but I really think to get a definitive answer will have to come back in a week or ten days after capital is as I think we all expect\nNarrowly confirmed to see whether the effect job than you are talking about Sean is actually going to hold over time I think it really has to play out and I think there is a good chance that the protests you've seen from the Democrats are from women like him or not we'll continue and will ultimately\nA benefit particularly in suburban congressional districts less so Senate races the Democrats\nRight as we wrap up with our pollsters we'll be checking in with them often now thirty two\nDays out of election day and I think the most important midterms in our lifetime\nOf John McLaughlin Doug shown with us All right Doug ... productions what's gonna happen\nAre covered or is going to be confirmed you will have the Republicans holding the feminine are now or wait and the Democrats winning the house but was thirty plus\nThirty bucks [noise] wow that's a huge production for the Democrats um I don't think there's any scenario that I could discount thirty\nTwo days out of this election I think anything can happen and I hope the American people see what they're electing and Nancy Pelosi Maxine Waters and Chuck Schumer that's my of my biggest told John ...\n[noise] I think you're right and uh uh in terms of its its just four weeks out over four weeks ago watching happened but I Will tell you that the key thing is Donald Trump is putting the Republicans on his shoulders and bringing them across the finish line in that he's bringing his votes to beer\nBut it is voters are coming back out but the key thing is just too real opponents right now or Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer she needs to take them on they are going to be a nightmare if they get control either house\nUp for next year so we've got to do is ... national survey ahead of fifty five percent unfavorable rating I mean fifty five percent will be a landslide for the Republicans and they could they could hold the house so right now we're headed to gain seats in the Senate but it's too early on the house\nAnd and prior to cabinet looked like we're going to lose the house but uh uh with that kind of a negative on blows the for her to be the leader to oppose Donald Trump every day for the next two years to his reelection he needs to take on every day about\nTheir role wanting to raise taxes on the economy have open borders having having a back to the elites where the swap runs\nThe country got show or if he does that over the next four weeks the Republicans could hold the house and they'll definitely pick upset achieved All right\nThank you both John McLaughlin and dug shown eight hundred ... all one
