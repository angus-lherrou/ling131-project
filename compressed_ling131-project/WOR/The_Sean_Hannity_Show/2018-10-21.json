{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "More fearful that yeah that's frequent and more fear that drives me crazy when when we're taught and medicine to use fear to get people to do it we want no bounds of nature we use education jobs here means teacher so so that people can make that choice not fear I don't believe in fear factor\nAnd the house Chad is also just magical and ... ... one wonderful thing as a health coach when you're working with people\nAnd sometimes there's decided they helped ... ad that people can't face you know they're just they've been working on it long enough and they're done they're like I'm given up on the physical and I can't lose weight or I can do whatever I'm done I'm not going to work on that anymore and so\n... the health coaches that\nIf you just work on two sides of the triangle the third one comes up naturally on its own so we just say okay let's set that aside for now and let's look at the other two ... and ... it improves and then as things improve than they get more\nWilling to look at that site that's so difficult for them so you have a health coach that takes the customers\nThrough the various ways in which the fruits and veggies interact perhaps with other medications or\nHow much you should take what time you should take them what are some of the different roles that health coach fails when they start taking balance of nature well\nThe main goal of a health coach is\nBecause we are results based company is to make sure that our customers are getting results or we know we all there's always results with balance of nature all you have to do is take it and and we teach our health coaches that because that is absolutely true we've done the research we know that we know the results that you're getting\nOn the human ... if you'd just to swallow them but you don't always feel it\nExactly whether you fill it or not the result is there and you know I I Hope this person doesn't mind that I use the example of ... names anyways but just just yesterday I had a wonderful experience speaking with a man\nAnd um and in relation to what you're talking about what do we talk about with our health coaches his it's based upon the try out of help and that's what I built after five six years of practice and I started to realize and see this that\nEverybody's help is based on three factors and and a lot of people think oh I've heard this before but not this model of it\nBecause we're based upon a chemical aspect of health that's nutrition that the air we breathe the drugs everything in our body it's a chemical we are a chemical laboratory so everything's based upon the raw materials of ... of of chemistry\nAnd then then there's good and there's bad okay and then there's the physical side of help and that's an aspect we have to we have to address always and then there's the at the mental spiritual emotional side of that is all one that's not three different things\nThat one side of your health try out and so we work on goals on all three of those sides to help people really see the greatest benefit and for example I was with somebody yesterday and ah\nAs I was talking with him is a good man and so one of his goals you know they had written down be good to people do kind things for people and those are all important but I just looked at him finally I said\nYou do all those things you are that person you could just see it in him and fill it from him and violent looked at me you know what you're what you're dealing with is fear\nBecause fear and face cannot coexist you can't have them in the same space one chases the other out and so\nWith tears he finally said you're right\nI don't trust I Need to change the trust in my life and he left with a new resolve to trust to trust in the process of his body to trust in the process of things to trust in people\nAnd he he will have a whole change in his life because now we're working all three sides and we had some other goals of walking and being active and and and obviously was with nutrition we had several several goals but until we found that one he wasn't a change person\nHe will see results now\nWe're going to take a short break and we'll be right back with more from Dr Douglas Howard and Susan Howard don't go away\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule\nReally does work I've had a great expense and not not getting the little allergy calls and stuff in the spring and the whole tribute it to that because I shut down\nA ice actually stop my vitamins that I Would say you know sticking a regiment of vitamins and I think sickly stopped all of them and then went on this and this things would be beneficial for me\nThat made me feel better I mean you know at my age if I can keep up with

com and used discount code W O R\nWelcome back to the balance of nature show I'm your host Laura Smith and we are talking about why whole foods or the answer to many health problems versus taking supplements that have vitamins\nI'm the founder and formulate or a balance of nature Dr Douglas Howard and his wife Susan Howard Dr Howard is a medical doctor how real practical Dr researcher and specialist in fighter nutrients\nDr Howard what is new that you can tell us with balance of nature and and truly what do I know you do research continually you're one of those perpetual scientists tell us what you're learning ... even more and more as the results come in\nYou know the company about what the wonderful people who are taking this product what it's doing for them\nYou know what's beautiful the balance of nature is it's not new is the oldest form of nutrition on the earth and that's exactly what it was made for us you know yes I'm always researching and finding and driving of how and why does it work\nBut the beauty of it is we don't have to reinvent it every couple of years and make a special a new because the formula for balance of nature has been here for thousands of years on the earth it's one hundred percent pure fruits and vegetables\nThere's nothing at it and nothing taken away from it except for the water it's pure produce\nIt took years of which fruit and which vegetable and and how they would interact with each other and studying that through and then doing studies with with the electron microscopy to different universities so they could study by electron microscopes\nHow it was affecting the DNA the very best and then some of the studies we were doing was how it would affect the immune system the most you remember the game pacman course okay well you've got white blood cells in there that run around like pacman going you know to to eat up the bad things\nAnd that's what those white blood cells are out there to do so we tested how many of those white blood cells could be out there to eat up the things that shouldn't be in your blood\nAnd how quickly they could respond those immune studies\nThose DNA studies and studies about how the red blood cell could receive the nutrition and receive oxygen so get out to where I needed and also even studies about the ... the blood or in other words the thickness of the blood how it flows through the veins and can get to the smallest possible vessels\nAll of that put together then I studied which fruits and vegetables and combining those until we had sixteen different fruits and Fifteen different vegetables\nThat made the greatest impact on those things and in the DNA for example how could protected the most and how quickly the DNA could repair itself wind damage to those are all things that help prevent aging diseases\nIt's only such a great pleasure to speak with you Dr Howard and Susan Howard from balance of nature when I find remarkable is how easy balance of nature has made it for me to get more than ten real whole servings of fruits and vegetables every day it really is remarkable beautiful benefits of the ... the whole system\nAnd just so much about what good nutrition means and what it can mean for everyone's life no matter what age it's a real pleasure thanks for being on today\nThank you it's great to be here thank you laugh\nYou are\nThe proceeding was a paid program W O ... airing of this program constitutes neither an endorsement of the products offered boy the ideas expressed\nLA you will are when you ask ... eight feet here in New York young

rated number one seven Dan W O R voice of New York\nSo all those things ah were neglected then the patient had the surgery and then he came back to the surgeon and then and then he got his scan and the cancers already traveled within months has already\nTraveled maybe it was there even before and the patient was never told [noise]\nAnd only now after he lost his kidney after he went through the major surgery went through a radical surgery and he got to scan showing the cancers traveled to the lymph nodes only now did the wake up and realize he should've come here first to try to avoid that radical surgery to keep his kidney\nTo have at least the chance of non invasive invisible beams of radio surgery outpatient therapy only without us surgeons hands in his body possibly spreading the cancer maybe it was a surgeon who spread the cancer [noise]\nIt's possible it's very common that surgery can spread the cancer we see that often we'll be talking about that later on in the program and a man who had rectal cancer had surgery only\nAnd within months the cancer came right back where the surgeons hands or around the rectum and the pelvic area a very unusual spread we usually don't see it because we usually don't treat patients the way this man was treated at one of the most famous hospitals in Philadelphia\nBut we'll talk about that in a few minutes we're this man who has kidney cancer now Rick currents spread to the lymph nodes now he understands what he was listening to for all those years and it could have helped him\nHe just didn't realize that's why it's so important if you have a cancer are suspected cancer\nTo give us a call come in for consultation\nWe can't do it on the phone we can't do it on the radio come in sit down and learn about all your options this man should have had he done that he would have had a chance to save his kidney and possibly save his life by avoiding to have that cancer spread right where the search an opera\nAnd this is the work we do first in America with radio surgery first and of course New York with British or the first in the western hemisphere was there a tactic body radio surgery [noise] what is radio surgery radio surgery is pinpoint treatment patient\nLays on the table non claustrophobic does nothing close there's nothing caused a phobic would make a little mold around the body and then we sent from thousands of angles invisible beams to attack the cancer and just minutes usual treatment is ten minutes come and get a treatment and then go home or go to work\nOr go across the street to Macy's [noise] well tolerated treatment with high success rates where we attack the cancer whether it's for breast cancer lung cancer or kidney cancer prostate or ... or this is the work we do including sarcoma\nMelanoma and kidney cancer just what this man had so\nWe learned a lot you know wants to stick with me were staging them up getting a scan of his entire body and then we're apart to him exactly where the cancer is what all the options are\nNot just with the doctors choice is it's not the doctors choice it's the patient's choice to choose what it should be his or her treatment right the patient is\nThe president of United States of his or her body and this is what I Believe I truly believe I Believe that every day and this is the work we do on talking about Seventy\nEight year old woman she is one of us melanoma and her right arm and she's been going to one of the biggest hospitals that we're getting scans over every year well two years ago the her scans were negative a year ago she had a five centimeter mass in the chest\nAnd nothing was done nothing was done for this amount of static melanoma this is a Seventy eight year old woman\nAnd she she was born in Germany she lives here and she came to me this week and she asked why aren't they taking care of me at this super super big hospital and she is going to one of the most famous hospitals famous doctor she has cancer growing in her lungs\nMelanoma and no one's\nTreating her two years ago there was clean CAT scan of her chest\nA year ago or five centimeter mass now is probably much bigger and she has symptoms and she's suffering and she's asking me why aren't they offering me any treatment why aren't they offering me any scans why aren't they following me up are they giving up on me why are they doing that\nAnd if they are giving up on me why don't they tell me that those are all good points if they're giving up on her why aren't they saying hey but um\nWe're giving up on you we have nothing to offer you we can help you but why don't you go see Dr Lederman why don't they say that rather than say nothing and that's why she's so upset [noise]\nShe came here this week it's actually came with two friends who brought her she's got this melanoma growing in the long and treated and evaluated for a year\nSo what are we doing about it while we're checking her oh we're going to stage are up and see what where the melanoma is we have high success rates and tree melanoma melanoma is a form of skin cancer it's one of the most aggressive\nWe treat melanoma we have high success rates where we attacked the melanoma most anywhere in the body this is the work we do [noise] and while she was here I showed her results of our skin cancer treatment including claim a\nSolid base of cells around the eyes ears nose and mouth of the hands and feet trunk and arms and legs this is the work we do non invasive Lee\nAnd her friend that was a man friend who came with her with half as we're missing in a big band aid on and I saw it I didn't say anything he wasn't my patient oppose that are showing them the work we do on the air and face it ... miles an hour work doesn't cut off half the year which is what happened to him\nAnd then he started to explain he said Dr Lederman can I ask you a question about myself as a short tell me what is your question and he said well I'm a ... at this facility at this big hospital this famous place that they want to cut off my ear and put it in a replacement because they have skin cancer and\nNo one at this big hospital ever told me about your work or non invasive work and I don't want to have my ear cut off he's already lost half his ear and its rag that you can imagine like a a big I don't know what a buffalo took a bite out of his ear\nHalf of his ears missing now they want to remove the other half and then replace it and I can tell you that uh I don't believe most surgeons can give this a manned an ear like God gave them originally yet with radio surgery we are able to attack the cancer without removing the healthy tissue\nOur treatment kills the cancer cells\nBut the tissue the ear that knows the eyes of the mouth the hands of fingers the arms and legs to breast\nRemain that's the difference between surgery which is a mechanical removal of part of your body and this man doesn't\nWant more of a zero last he does not want to go through multiple surgeries to remove his air and multiple surgeries to create a false ear he does not want that he wants to keep the ear that God gave him\nAnd that's the work that we do [noise]\nAnd so this woman with melanoma that was ignored by the doctors at one of the biggest hospitals in New York brought her friend also needs treatment there's three people in the room to had skin cancer one was melanoma spreads out along untreated and evaluate it sent home\nTo die when there's good treatment available the other man who brought her as fun getting ear cancer and no one offered him all the options\nUntil they came

I was only New Jersey won ... that's probably why I was I was running around the other officers\nYou know it's ... you know what's great about\nWhat I Would like to know I Would like to have these I Would like to have the\nBefore and after a while you're going to be on our website definitely once they're finished I mean we like to you know we like to posted pictures of people being down you know several months out because the whole point really gave it all keep the weight off up so um and I feel that\nUm our DNA report you know I was just looking over and one of the patient's DNA reports um a couple of minutes ago right before we went on air and it's really amazing all this information that's in here\nAnd you know we're talking about diet recommendations we're talking about eating behaviors we're talking about food reactions um we're also talking about nutrition and what works for you and what doesn't work for you such things as you know um do you have a genetic risk for decreased vitamin C. do you have a genetic risks for\nA decrease vitamin a and\nYou know and during the training what kind of exercise should you be doing that so\nYou're not spinning your wheels asked him if you should be\nSo I looked at it and go look and let me tell you I said you know let rather than be going through everything that you've done in the past which has or water explained the program to explain the personalization using hair saliva buyer energetic scans\nA blood work assessment a DNA assessment for going there and so forth and let me explain it to you and then afterwards you told me anything you've done is they've been with us so we ... we can afford a few things so\nI go through it ... or anything like that absolutely not I've never heard of anything like this I said exactly let's move forward so low and behold you know we did the different scans that we do we did the book the functional or assessment of the blood work we take a look at it we give her some fireworks support with the research renal support\nTwenty eight pounds forty days has a great that's really great ... I you know I said she's going to ... I said what are you do and she came and finally she came in last week's show so what do you do with the French fries for the shredded all of\nYeah like I mean I think it's also you know I think we tend to carry a ton of baggage with us we we really tend to go back I think people in general tend to they want to be positive but they tend to be on the negative side especially when they tried so many things and things don't work\nUm you know I think that that's really generally where we're at and they think a lot of people are telling people to throw up their old coal I Do I I I think that is a really powerful a powerful tool once you're done um you know losing weight I think you really need to get rid of the past I mean\nA fraud all your clothes when I did I ever I gave them all the way I don't have one single thing from before um when I was I'm\n... years ago she probably did but what the last thirty seven pounds as you get rid of\nAll the I actually well because I started to try on my clothes probably about halfway through the program so halfway through the program was about twenty pounds down and I realized that I kept going to the forty hours a day which I did I Would be way down so I actually started to give them away\nUh throughout the program and of course you know once you start to empty out your closet you have to fill it with something there and so that really is a very very important part of the forty days out of your time for I think so I may still having a good time you know I think I think it's really really important for the mental health\nTo get rid of what's old to get rid of what no longer fits a you know although we just taped um our first TV commercial which was so exciting and um you know we asked a couple of our patients actually participate in it and screw thankfully they did keep at least one piece of clothing that they used to have\nThe fat pants or um you know and the case of our patients Diana she kept like some of her dresses from before she look I'm raked amazing little out or what does she had a whole transformation she would um you know so\nShe uh they were able to bring in their stuff and really it was really fun shooting the commercial because you know these weren't models these weren't ...\nSo it was really exciting because it we had to do like a bunch of takes because when you put someone who is not an actor in front of a camera you know no matter how good their story as they start to go up above above but you know so but you know I\nReally super proud of you know they they did really great it was really inspiring to listen to them we did some uh\nYou know uh um some uh back stories almost because actually the gentleman that was doing and producing the commercial he didn't know or patients so he actually asked them to tell\n'em him their stories and it was really fun and cool to sit on the sidelines and watch\n'em you know seeing these patients who were patience of hours you know I mean Diana or what you know lost all her wait a couple of years ago the other two gentlemen that were in the commercial was over a year ago also\nAnd um to listen to their stories and really what led them to our office for me was very interesting because one of the gentleman I actually didn't even know because he was going to one of our remote locations are not New Jersey and so I never met him before and what an interesting story he's\nActually happened to be a semi professional ballroom dance or raw hum and I said that now that he's retired uh you know he told his wife he wanted to take it back up because he feels so good well he lost close to a hundred\nI think a hundred and ten or something like that pounds um and uh he's like I you know there's all these things now that I remember I used to do and now I Want to go back and do them again because I have all the time on my hands um said either you know these are really ... it was really an inspiring day it was really a great day but\nGoing back to actually thought of I'm a female patient who just finished up she did um\nI don't know you might know this um eat her name is eat us I'm not sure if she did sixty days or she did a two rounds of forty days um I I think she was at the sixty day mark and um she's down over fifty pounds so she is on our website are hard to foreign actors are on our website they are so I'm\nAt just almost a ... it's a it's like a great person over fifty pounds you know one of my kids I think he's fifty six pounds so it's really a these types of numbers are really staggering but what's really\nAmazing for me is the fact that um you know you're losing fat and losing fat is the only thing that works long term I'm you know a lot of these other things out there you know everybody's like well the first week or two you lose all water anyway well that's not true no I\n... and it's not healthy um and losing water is not going to give you any sort of long term I'm\nYou know a weight loss retention if you will um you have to lose the fat you have to hydrate the only way that you lose the fat is through the label some bags the only way that that happens is when they fill up with water and they burst\nThat is the only way you lose fat I mean I don't really care what anybody else to saying out there but that is the only way that that fat goes down and that is also by the way the only way that you will see herself shrinking and your clothes getting bigger\nYeah everybody loves to close giving\nUs the best part of the whole thing I mean we I realized\nI didn't get a chance to keep saying I keep I keep forgetting to talk about the six people hold on let me get back to whenever I keep talking about it so we did the men first they would do the sixty days or the female Laurie\nAh thirty eight pounds in six days\nPretty good run a big number thirty eight pounds in six days it's almost forty pounds for a woman that's absolutely tremendous talking about a different person that's that's great what certain what certain dress sizes [noise] forty ...\nSo for me um I did thirty I might I'm five eight so I'm I'm taller side if you look at you know uh most women I I'm five eight I lost thirty seven pounds I went from\nA twelve to six starts off and that's like we're talking like the design or like the Italian designers ... the ones that basically make everything to sizes down\nLike a normal size twelve\nIs not what they call a normal size twelve goes you know everybody outside of the United states for some reason it seems to be center than we are in this country it was a lot of reasons there is a lot of reasons but it's very frustrating writing when you have to talk yeah so that this is you know to go from a twelve to ... um is um\nIs a life changing event to me and you all of a sudden shop at a different store you know because unfortunately most stores um don't carry the higher sizes so you you you ... you actually are moving from one out of area and so another shopping experience job so\nSo you're thirty eight so she did the thirty pounds a Steve is in sixty days Steve was down ... down fifty eight pounds six years I didn't have you beat from that guy was [noise]\nThirty four I yeah I Know the Nineteen thirty four fifty nine and and and that that is amazing I mean\nYou know we typically see twenty five we see what we see twenty five to thirty five and forty days for women we typically see a thirty five to forty five plus for men and only forty days\nOr so these numbers are are fantastic they're tremendous it's great both of them uh you know are off of their blood pressure medicine as a surprise you lose you lose forty pounds and sixty pounds respectively for a female in the mail\nYou were going to be off your blood pressure Mets I mean that's not there's no there's no doubt about that are now\nUh so if you've got a five pound or ten pounds or fifty pounds or a hundred pounds\nOr we can help you uh we we uh we typically see twenty five to fifty and only forty days\nAnd that's where that shots hormones surgery there is no hunger there's no pre packaged foods are monitored every step of the way you're coming into the office you're not doing this on your own you actually get a either the ... of one of the doctors in mind one of the other doctors or one of our certified health and wellness coaches who get their information as well so we're always there to help you\nUh and so you can come into the office\nIn order to do that one of the offices in the New York area you can call one eight five five\nFive and a J diet a one eight five five five six five three for three eight and so what that does is get you a free go over in one of our locations of the program or we've got you covered all over the tri state area a couple of locations in New Jersey\nOr New York city queens Brooklyn Long Island\nAnd now opening in West Chester as well and with your calling to make an appointment please remember the folks in the phones are not they don't understand they don't they're not there to answer your questions regarding the program because they don't have the answers regarding the program is a personalized program\nUh and so the best way to do it if you want you're going to end jade diet dot com\nWhere it's normally Ninety nine dollars but as a radio listener right now twenty seven dollars for a appointment in our offices we're going to not only look at your weight explained the program to explain the personalization\nOf the program explain how we use blood work assessment how we use hair saliva and ... testing\nA to personalize supplements for each individual to help that person get into a ... a cellular level of fat burning\nA but also it slows down your metabolism because it makes your insulin more disrupted which ... which affects\nHow your body is able to uh metabolize sugar and if those triggers aren't burned for energy your body is no other choice but to turn it into fat and store it\nSo we have to take a look at that as well so all these different things that we're looking at to personalize the situation for every single person and and and and get them the results that do you need you want\nI almost forgot like what time of year it was now it it really almost um\nYou know past me that\nUm you know if you get started now you're you're going to be all set for the holiday so you know this is one of the um is one of our busiest times of the year for for many different reasons you know people start to layer of their clothes and then they realize they have to go on vacation you know your winter break and they either have to put on a bathing suit or they have to put on a ski outfit\nAnd you know here's the deal you get benefits in both sides right he\nPut her in a bathing suit you're the new you you put on a ... year then you you too because I knew what you have a lot more energy going down the slopes you feel a lot better you're breathing better and\nYou know if you start now where we would do we have forty days before the holidays we have ... we we've got four days before the holidays you know you haven't seen so many families you know this is a funny time of year for us because what starts to happen\nIs you know we've got this huge influx of patience right before the holidays and then right after the holidays what we have happening it's all of their relatives and all of their friends that saw them during the holidays I saw my cousin my aunt my uncle or whatever they lost all this weight so now I'm here so it's\nA very interesting dynamic of what happens in the next couple of months that our practice says that um\nYou see some of the you know if you will the guinea pigs coming in and his whole family follows along\nAnd you know we actually had um a very interesting as thing we had a patient come in and he is doing his second round the first time around I think he lost um thirty five pounds I think he wanted to lose another Fifteen or twenty so he's only doing a shorter period he's not doing a full forty days\nBut he said to us he said does anybody ever complain to you guys that it hurts to say when you lose all that way [noise]\nAnd so I thought it was kind of funny in flux put off his ... yeah\nYeah but that well that's the thing where you don't even think about that right when you're sitting you're sitting on you know a quite a bit of adding and whatever it is an adult size if there's some muscle there he says I didn't realize that he's like my heart's like understand what's hurting he's like\nI said to him I was I guess what as they get up and get more active and you know\nI'm you know this is actually somebody who doesn't sit a lot he's it extremely active human being but I guess he started realizing he doesn't have as much padding over there anymore but that'll do it right oh he's like down almost sixty pounds and the total not sixty he's a little bit over fifty pounds but\nYou know and the total of his weight loss he now started to feel well he should have been feeling like four years right here in his heart\nAs well yeah I mean and so his muscles are all very sad but I just thought it was such a funny thing to say like this is kind of what's interesting right when you're talking to all of our patients some of the things that are no lead there's less padding on the last ... exactly exactly\nAnd you know you see a lot of what's also I'm kind of an interesting dynamic as someone who is very set and who does work out on a regular basis and comes to us to lose that whatever twenty or thirty pounds that they need to lose\nA what's interesting is that you start to see their a muscle mass and you actually physically see their arms surely see that definition laying there under fat\nRight because we have so many of those patients that do work out on a regular basis we've actually had such a huge number of personal trainers that come in to do our program right because just like\nA you know a regular person unfortunately they come to the point where they don't understand why they're putting on weight and so once we get them into fat burning it's quite amazing because then they really start to look at it I mean you see all that muscle and all that work that they've done over the years it's still there doesn't go anywhere\nUs great and the results what's great about this is the results are so fast like I mean\nPeople don't believe you know you're you're losing twenty five to fifty pounds and forty days that's where we typically see with men and women so the results are tremendous you guys are coming in women within the first week people come in and go how fast you're going to see results are in the ... I\nSaid by the first time you're in we have people come in within like around ten days after they start the program but you tend to visit women are down anywhere from\nTo twelve pounds met her down anywhere from ten to Fifteen pounds I Want to say that to them they look at me so I was absolutely that's what we see here that's absolutely\nSee and when people are coming in they're losing fat they're not losing the water the water is improving because of the personalization of the supplements the water levels are actually increasing in the body\nAnd it's not only a matter of getting people to drink more water because a lot of times we have to people have people lower their water consumption because they're drinking so much but their minerals that are out of bounds so their body isn't absorbing it properly which ones are slowing down the metabolism\nAnd so we we we have them kind of keep it around a star number depending on where where they are and that's individualized also but that's what the thing so like Tom\nComes in this uh sixty five year old guy he comes in this week\nFifteen pounds he's down in in twelve days right it's\nGreat so he he came in you know we did the ... we did the uh the heritage alive it affects me the about what the by energetic testing we did the blood work assessment he needed is a long standing skin issues\nHim arena looted to that you were talking about that earlier about you know who the skin detoxify and that's where largest Oregon absolutely he got liver support\nThat is one of the main supplements he he had it's usually a liver toxicity when it comes out on the skin like that and so you you know skins improving already\nThis is to less than two weeks in\nFrom severe skin issues for a long period of time to the ... already improving now\nAh and down the Fifteen pounds and twelve days I mean it's it's a tremendous tremendous number and we're not talking about twenty five year old guy you're sixty five year old guy\nAnd so this is this or that these are the types of things that we really see a it's a one eight five five five and Jay diet is the number is the number to call here uh and so you know you're going to come in we're into the body composition analysis or we've got you covered all over the tri state area a couple of locations in New Jersey\nOr New York city queens Brooklyn Long Island and now opening in West Chester as well or if you call money five five\nFive hundred diet that's where I go over in the office of the program and at no charge right so you can do that at twenty five five five six five thirty four thirty eight and we can explain to how without shots hormone surgery know hunger how you're going to lose weight\nFast how you're gonna lose it where you want to lose it because that's why people store in different areas because the body's protecting those areas because the different hormonal imbalances how the program is going to balance your your your hormones\nA detox to find themselves the Oregon the tissues almost everybody in the first week says the same thing I have more energy I'm sleeping better and more energy I'm sleeping better uh\nAnd so we've got a bunch of locations in the area in Brooklyn and queens and and a New Jersey and Manhattan\nIn Long Island and now west Chester and so if you want to lose that twenty to fifty pounds and only forty days call one

all a scam and I can tell you that I've seen thousands of patients who try ... poppy seed the cream and it doesn't work\nSave your money don't get into trouble and she tried all these concoction and for three years the cancer is growing and growing and growing the cancer eight through the breast at eight through the nipple her arm is about three times a normal size as masses on the arm the\nSize of ... these are all cancerous masses her arm is growing up and she's in pain\nAnd she's suffering and they examined to Russia's mark distortion of the brash as loss of the nipple loss of substance of the brass tremendous swelling of the arm tremendous filling up the hand that fingers you got multiple masters of the arm messes up to five centimeters like big marshmallows\nAll on the arm and that's\nWhat has happened with her concoction decision and she's now here to get\nReal treatment to get this cancer under control and we do see many many women and men with advanced cancer they wish to change the course they wish to change the trajectory they wish to get better and that's why so\nMany people probably everyone comes to thirty for Broadway\nTo get better and for good reason we fight for the patient to get better and\nFor this woman we're fighting for her to get this cancer this massive cancer and the breast an arm under control this in the work that we do at thirty for Broadway\nThere was a good reason she's here don't talk about uh sixty six year old man from New Jersey has got two kids who came with his friend\nHe has a history of heart disease and cardiac ... relation of blood thinners and the director of bleeding four years ago you had Colin ... surgery three of Thirteen lift all boats were positive the cancer grew through the wall of the cancer was\nSeven senators about three inches so very big rectal cancer standard surgery and standard chemo and\nThen he refused radiation and then two years later the cancer came\nRip roaring back in the same place that he had the chemo and the surgery and now the cancers there and he's been on chemo for a couple of years and he's been hospitalized for complications from the chemo and well now he's here with pain getting worse and worse pain and as wages drop a thirty pounds from two Fifteen two hundred thirty five pounds\nIs five foot nine he smokes cigars of course we told them that would be better if you stopped smoking as medicine at a cancer stage for us or for actor eight to chemotherapy\nHis CPA is rising and he's here to try to get better to get out of pain and getting to avoid the suffering and those are all good reasons to come here and that's our intent is to get him\nOut of trouble out of misery\nAnd this is the work that we do want to fifty nine year old man who came to me he's married with four kids wonderful man came with his wife he has history he's only fifty nine to be as heart failure in cholesterol and high blood pressure and earlier this year at nose bleeds that had difficulty breathing through his nose and he went to two\nBig hospitals in New York City\nWith an emergency room to the hospital they did biopsies that caught arises knows they found a cancer\nHad a CAT scan the number I had this cancer a big mess in the nose so massive\nThat was inside the house is not a cancer the skin cancer the nasal cavity in side than those itself going all the way up to the brain and he saw surgeon said these two big hospitals and they both want to cut off his nose and he refused he didn't want to walk around the rest of his life with no nose\nAnd furthermore the cancer went up all the way to the brain so cutting off his nose really wouldn't have helped maybe would have helped a surgeon or the hospital or the operating room but it's highly doubt what would have helped the patient and then believe it or not one of the surge and said well then we'll just cut off your sapped them in your nose inside than those but the cancer\nWas from the right side of the nose to the left side of the nose all the way up to the brain cutting off the sap them\nWould make no sense maybe again that'd be good for the surgeon or the surgical department of the operating room but how could that possibly help the patient and the patient refused all of that he didn't want to forming surgery didn't want baloney a surgery and\nSo he came to me and he wanted to know about\nOther options and other options are non invasive treatment\nLike ours and he chose her treatment\nHe came to me he trusted us we treated him and just this week we got a scan of his body scan of his head scan of his brain and this cancer is gone and he actually knew it before he knew it before we did why because a big mess than those went away the swelling of his nose went away who was able to breathe\nNormally with our treatment and the bleeding stop all the terrible signs and symptoms all went away with our treatment and the scan confirms that they can tell you that he's one of the\nHappiest patients he has his nose in his life and he has remission the cancers gone thanks to pinpoint radio surgery non invasive treatment invisible beams that attack the cancer\nFrom thousands of angles have attacked his cancer\nAnd placed him intermission the cancers gone symptoms are gone the bleeding has gone that mess has gone the obstruction is gone and he is very happy and there's one other person very happy besides his wife and his family and his friends and that other person is Dr Lederman the sweetest\nPart of our day is giving good news to our patients and this was certainly a day of good news he turned him and he said Dr Lederman am I going to be your next poster child and I gave him a wink and we're working on\nThat because he's got an excellent response and should be inspiring to all of you who are being told all you have\nTo remove your nose or your arm or your breast here bladder prostate or kidney or your pancreas well that's what the surgeon can say insurgents are welcome to say whatever they want but morally we believe the surgeon should tell people all the options and they can say okay I recommend surgery but if you want non invasive treatment you want ...\nYou might want to see Dr Lederman at thirty\nFor Broadway and he does invisible beams of radio surgery non invasive treatment for new a recurrent cancers small or large primary met a static\nAny where in the body so that's what I Believe a surgeon or chemo doctors should be telling the patients they can say OK came a doctor can say came all I Believe in\nBut you should check out other options you should see Dr Lederman this man\nRefuse surgery refused to remove all of his nose refused to remove over ...\nEven though the big surgeon and the big white coat of the stuff of scope wrapped around his neck chairman of the parliament told him he had to remove his nose or else well this man walked you said I'll check it out and he came here checked it out\nTrusted us got his treatment and he is now in remission with no evidence of\nCancer doing well and we are very happy for him and grateful for him and grateful for his trust they don't talk about another man with good news is the man
