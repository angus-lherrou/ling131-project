high\nInvestigate all three credible allegations of sexual assault\nAgainst judge Brett Kavanaugh and that would be by the way I read the FBI is already looking into allegation number two which was\nThe New Yorker piece this is by Mr Ramirez and remember even the New York times couldn't go with that story they had reported that\nThey interviewed several dozen people in an attempt to corroborate her story they couldn't find one person was first hand knowledge\nAnd then they reported that Mrs Ramirez herself was contacting former your classmates asking if they were called the incident and told them pull some of them that she could not be certain Mr Kavanaugh was the one oh exposed himself and that's what they're saying\nAnd remember she admitted she quickly became a ... she had gaps in her memory foggy slurring words\nSo that's what the Democrats are said this is a credible allegation well if it was so incredible why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh when he sat in front of them last week 'cause they they they they all had the opportunity to delve into anything they want to delve into and they chose not to\nThen we've got the the third incident which is the ... case\nWhere a woman claims that\nRoutinely almost on a weekend basis and she had been ten of these parties herself personally that there was Brecht cabin on and a bunch of ... kids that were drug ...\nGirls and then lining up in the hall waiting their turn to rape innocent girls and a a whole series of allegations have looked at as as Byron York said the gold polls\nHave moved very very far away very very quickly and all the people I mean that's just going to be a week limited scope no big deal just an FBI investigate you want to clear your name right you'd want to clear your name right judge\nIt's not about clearing his name it's about giving them more time so they can come up with more allegations and it doesn't matter at the end of the day Democrats do not even want a vote on judge Kavanaugh\nAnd they want to continue the smears the slander the lies the mismanagement character assassination frankly the political blood joining of judge Kavanaugh and his family now as evidenced by now remember\nDianne Feinstein had this for six long weeks she had this back in July there was a California state or California congressman that had\nIt early July and then they went to Dianne Feinstein Dianne Feinstein on two separate occasions was meeting with judge Kavanaugh then of course we had the original hearings\nAnd not at one point that Dianne Feinstein ever mentioned professor Ford but while she was meeting with him privately she was simultaneously recommending lawyers to professor Ford and one that was eventually chosen was Deborah cats\nAnd she is a lawyer that represents professor poured but which is fine but she has a history of oh challenging Paula Jones and supporting Al Franken so in other words she's radical left political the attorney is\nAnd so anyway they were emails sent out we just found out late last week of a friend of this attorney for professor for this Deborah cats woman and she was in the hearing she was sitting to the right\nOf professor Ford or to the left on your screen of you were watching the hearings\nAnyway it goes on to say that friends emails were sent by a friend of Deborah cats the lawyer representing professor Ford recommended by Dianne Feinstein\nAnd they were soliciting women to accused judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety and this is what they were sending out last week where we just need an FBI Barry expeditious very quick very limited in scope they were they have been and continue to be on a fishing expedition\nNow the emails were obtained by the Washington Free beacon\nSeeking corroboration from classmates of cabin all about your book and trees and gang rape and one email sent\nA late last week delivered to roughly fifty alumni of stone rich school of the Sacred Heart an all girls school near Georgetown Prep\nWith the subject line corroboration needed never cats need to find people who are familiar with what the slang terms were used by ... cabin on his yearbook page meant\nAnd the devil's triangle and the F F F F F\nA warnings in there if you can speak to any of these are willing to sign an affidavit please contact us that's a fishing expedition and that is ... this is what the Democrats wanted the delay for now if it was truly limited in scope and\nWe know that in the case of professor poured that they were four people she mentioned we're at this party some don't remember ever being even her best friend don't remember ever being at a party where Brett Kavanaugh was add\nOnto the you know that when the perjury I mean ... under the penalty of a felony here so they all signed these affidavits they're all agreed that the that they didn't have any recollection\nAnd the the most difficult part of it is is professor Ford identified an eye witness to the event that I witnessed it said under penalty of a felony that it never happened what professor Ford is claiming\nAnd this is professor Ford who put mark judge in the room at the time of the alleged incident so I'm not sure what the FBI really can do in this case beyond see whether any of these people are going to admit that they committed\nPerjury and gave false statements\n... there's nothing else really left for them to do please use your voice you will not get a second chance this letter goes on to say I mean well this point you're you're pretty much just soliciting\nYou know randomly anybody took ... please please come forward and then the hope is that there will be delayed again and again and again and\nYou know on top of that than we've got you know what was supposed to be limited in scope what was supposed to be done expeditiously in a week\nNow is turning into because they can't get anything else at least not that we know of yet who knows what Dianne Feinstein knows then the only thing they've got is well did he commit perjury about the amount of alcohol that he drank you know did he really black how would anybody know if he blacked out\nThat's the only he would be able to tell you if he blacked out\nNow he admitted to drinking to liking beer liking bureau lot still liking beer drinking too much beer you know being intoxicated he admitted to all of that\nWhen he was in high school and college which not all that uncommon let's be honest about it\nAnd so they're trying to say well he didn't he do we know we had to uh blacked out as an I worked as a bartender for a number of years I Know a lot about alcohol\nI watched it up close and personal you know everybody's got a number for some people the numbers to and after two they lose that\nFor some people I there were people that every single night I work could sit there from six PM till four thirty when I close the doors and as a throw him out and they'd be walking straight having been drinking all night I mean the tolerance level from individuals individual is just it's an enormous\nYou know you'd see some people that go beyond their numbers they become aggressive or flirtation I saw it all I learned a life lesson and it wasn't good if you go beyond what ever your individual number is it's never going to be good for you or or anybody else for that matter\nUm anyway so he got that and so it's not about limited in scope\nThere's a lot of news or no time any uh was I don't know where the clock is I'm Mark Penn and wrote an interesting piece which I I found today and he said that he's a pollster was\nThe Clintons pollster and he noted today that in the immediate aftermath of last Thursday's testimony by professor Ford and Brett Kavanaugh slim majority of those surveyed sided with her but\nThey found he found is the support for professor Ford collapsed when voters were told that none of the three ... a witness to she cited to corroborate her allegation have any idea\nAs to what she's talking about and that fact was barely mentioned during Thursday's questioning and it was only mentioned if you remember at the end of the questioning uh one of the things that were saying that we see a new poll out by ... to research group because the election is thirty six days away\nI Want you to think about thirty six days from now when you turn on your TV on election night and do you want to hear the words Nancy Pelosi has just been elected speaker of the house and Chuck Schumer is the new majority leader of the United States Senate because that's what the Democrats want now if this doesn't\nIf this does not show you this is not a party that wants to make America better that has a plan to help the working men and women forgotten men and women of America\nAs a matter of fact with every bit of success the president has it it it diminishes any chance they have and getting back their power and after two years of trying to destroy the president\nYou know they want to Christian do their way back into power just forgetting the eight years of Obama which would disastrous\nAnyway so we've got this election you're going to tune in at night and you're going to flip the channels are going to be watching news channels and you're either going to be seeing happy anchors all over the country or you're gonna once again shocked the world and you're going to defy the

you were seats to the matinee with Michael go to seven to W.\nAnd I could go to a whole list of okay look at Diane Feinstein you're telling me about time Dianne Feinstein knew about this two months earlier if she wanted a a really thorough investigation where all the time in the world she didn't have to wait until after the hearing was closed\nEssentially she shares that listen I have a problem I have this report I'd like the FBI to look at it while we're doing the hearings\nWe had two months now she didn't do that she waited until we were closed and then she probably leaked it but you know who am I to say go ahead\nPlease Mr President you said that it's incorrect to say you're limiting the skill of the FBI investigation\nWhat is it has to do is say I don't mind answering the question but you know I'd like to do the ... the other headline in the cabinet and I know how that talking about trade and then we'll get to that will do that a little bit late anybody ever had a great deal of hats\nOr Congress there are I think so but you know if it doesn't we have lots of other alternatives but I Do think so I think if they're fair which is a big question but if it's fair on both sides are Republicans love it\nIndustrial opposite our country loves it\nOr if it's fair it will pass I think it'll pass easily\nRight our to Sean Hannity show as we're back in the swamp were back in D.C a lot of breaking news eight hundred nine four\nOne showing has a toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program well what was supposed to be last week a limited in scope and done very quickly is now evolved into Democratic senators\nOh the FBI must investigate all three credible allegations of sexual assault against\nJudge Brett Kavanaugh by the way why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh when they had the opportunity last week if they want to expand the scope now the interesting thing about this email is well they are now putting out a list of we've got to interview this one and this one and this one and this one and this one including\nThat anonymous person in this anonymous person that they're literally trying to tell the FBI\nHad to do their job and we found out this weekend emails were sent late last week by a friend of the left wing attorney that's representing professor forward that's the one that didn't believe Paula Jones and\nSupported Al Franken anyway but a friend of hers last week a you remembered Dianne Feinstein recommended this attorney cats Deborah cats for professor Ford\nAnd of course while she was meeting Dianne Feinstein with Brett Kavanaugh anyway it turns out that they are now soliciting members of the Georgetown Prep community for information and searching for additional women who accused\nSupreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety this is what you would call a witch hunt this is now a we don't have enough so let's see let's let's go out and solicit people\nAnd see if we can find people that are willing to say something horrible about Brett Kavanaugh because maybe that's the way we'll be able to stop the nomination we've got to delay like we wanted now we've got to be able to get everything that we want Newt Gingrich has said great question is there even one Democrat decent enough or disgusted enough to end this cabinet travesty\nAnd he joins us now sir how are you welcome back to the program\nI'm doing well but I was very struck this morning by Byron ... column in which he points out that the Democrats having decided that sex may not work are now looking at whether or not Kevin all might have been an accurate in describing how much he drank so there are spreading a wider and frankly in an age when\nJustice Ginsburg was very political\nAnd some attacks on President Trump Democrats are trotting out judicial temperament of this whole thing is this character assassination it is I think tremendously bad for the country uh and it is\nIt tells us who they are I mean I think the key the election this fall is which America do you want to be\nDo you really want to be an America where somebody could live a decent life for thirty five years have two lovely daughter is a good marriage\nAnd then get smeared on ending lady was totally uncorroborated assaults does that sound really the America we want to become\nYou know the judge was honest as could be said I like beer I drink beer I drink beer then sometimes I drink too much fear\nHe denied ever blacking out I mean the accusation that somebody could observe some well he had the blackout that night um I was a bartender when I was Seventeen and Eighteen years old and I've seen a lot of drunk people in my life\nAnd I couldn't tell you whether or not they remembered the incident the next day and it wouldn't be me in the position of saying that but what they're doing is they're moving the bar this is what you're saying the goalposts now are being literally moved every second every hour of every day and now that we have people working on behalf of the Dianne Feinstein\nRecommend the lord lawyer Deborah cats and sending out letters saying uh where we need more people um it sounds like they never want this to end and I don't think there is going to be a Democrat to answer your question that's going to be decent enough or disgusted enough to end it\nWell let me try to be very clear from it because I'm I'm frankly very disappointed in the judiciary Republicans up just denying reality the fact is\nThis is nothing to do with\nTraditional government this has nothing to do with the Senate this has nothing to do frankly with judge town this is about a militant left wing group willing to lie assassin age meaner cheat I mean when you when you have\nWhen you have a mob that goes into a restaurant to harass Sen Cruz when you have to women who break into a an elevator to harass or senator over and over and over again which you have on the left his willingness to break the rules\nTo get what they want\nAnd I think that is a very serious problem\nYou know it does raise a lot of questions because at this point I don't think we're going to go back to high school years\nKnow when people talk and I watched a lot of there's this weekend you know two commentators actually saying this is Sean Hannity could have given the speech\nAnd I'm thinking okay um how is one supposed to act when they're falsely accused of literally drugging women and boys lined up halls all over the costs of course of many weekends\nAs the boys can then take their chance that gang raping women and being a participant in that I don't know what the significant or normal reaction would be for me if you're innocent it would be righteous anger and indignation that that to me would be the normal human response if you're innocent\nRight well let me let me let me play historian from it because I spent the weekend thinking about what we're living through\nWhen you know Cory Booker says the your complicit with evil if

was an amazing show and it's time\nYeah so I can empathize with I'm Brett Kavanaugh was one of those middle school nerds that you know it was probably watching those types of shows them the during the things that people want to mock now but um [noise] in any event I think there's a silver lining potentially till the FBI investigation\nA number one for so where conservatives we have a moral compass if we if we do detect but there's something wrong then he should be thrown overboard that's number one it without being said but I don't that's not going to be found that being said\nIt's an opportunity for the Republicans to investigate further in turn the lens on the Democrat they're dirty tricks and use the power not that anybody should be abusing that power but the FBI should use the power\nTo investigate everything that's going on here and potentially witnesses being coaxed July people being put forward to sign false affidavits there's obviously a lot of that funny business going

New York times piece that he came out with the ... it to me it's absolutely stunning\nAnd the things that he's saying because you know all the guys back in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was running an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her\nUm but then he goes on to trash the president at length\nAnd then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are and interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other accounts and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but at the age is no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange um\nAnd then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day uh I don't think that's a political in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized by could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not\nUm once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says\nIs one thing to have your lawyers submitted statement on your habits are very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions\nOf course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them then there's what he says refusal to do so is its own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because\nMy FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never\nEver talk to the FBI endless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why am somebody who loves the FBI don't love the upper brass on the call me and the cave and struck and page but the FBI is is ... ... people I Know the salt of the earth people\nAnd I sort of course I'd want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was lying to them and it's just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say because it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said\nSomething in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the irony that says if you look in his company's coming ammo right now is just to try to destroy Trump with everything he can and this is just another another section in that play book but the irony is the exact same federal law provision\nThat says it's a crime to to lie the FBI is the one that says it's a crime to lie to the Senate as their ... with a investigator it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not they've been kind of pretending they're ... that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies\nOf what the FBI guys to say that they somehow it's going to be a separate different thing
