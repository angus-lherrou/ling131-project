almost every broadcast especially we have been covering it heavily\nI haven't been warning almost daily repeatedly someone is gonna get hurt or worse if these mobs don't stop what they're doing\nNow and the moms in the case as I was talking about you know let's through the prism of what we know today suspicious packages pipe bombs\nThat had been sent to Obama and the Clintons apparently and and CNN and\nOthers um how many times yesterday on this program there was a story about George Soros apparently some divisive but putting his mailbox and\nI listen what did I say about George Soros yesterday my seven on tape let me see what I said yesterday when it broke when the storm story broke apparently an explosive device was found near at George Soros says home and his mailbox the New York times reported\nIn a billionaire left is called the list of George Soros doesn't like Sean Hannity any funds a lot of groups that will love this show to go away\nI Want to be clear with everybody this crap has got to stop this\nCrap has got to stop this is you know we we have an election and Thirteen Days\nAnd on almost I you can see this building and building and building and building Rand Paul was very outspoken somebody is going to get killed\nI was the person saying during the Kavanaugh hearings hey we we've got to clear the halls this ... one of the senators is going to end up getting assaulted or worse\nYou got to clear the halls you can't let these activists you know getting in the faces spinning it Lindsey Graham holding up elevators screaming at Sanders ... when you can't let this continue because it's obvious what's gonna happen to somebody\nAnd and I haven't heard any of my colleagues on the left warning that this is a bad thing I didn't hear a lot of people on the left all that upset that Sarah Sanders and her children\nWere run out of a restaurant and then they go to another restaurant and they were followed over there for crying out loud\nOr the video of secretary Nielsen ... sitting and eating a meal\nAnd these left wing lunatics screaming at secretary Nielsen till she asked to get up and walk out of the restaurant we have the video of Pam Bondi who's going to a movie for crying out loud and what she had to go through with a left wing mob\nAnd then of course Senator Ted Cruz and his his wife\nHeidi they go to sit down at a restaurant there run out right and they get right in your grill right in your face\nYou know it's an amazing thing that they keep doing this to women or guys that are with their wives it culminated this weekend is now the fourth time that Senator McConnell has now had to deal with this he's just sitting in a restaurant with his wife Elaine Chao there just eating that's all they're doing\nHe's not working is on his off time some guy comes literally right up to the table to bang on the table\nAnd then ... rips off some of the food from the table opens the restaurant door which is adjacent to the scene where Mitch McConnell is and throws the guy's food out in the street\nAnd then start screaming at the top of his lungs\nAnd then of course Kevin McCarthy's office gets it with a Boulder busting his office window\nAnd I didn't hear anybody condemning any of this certainly during the Kavanaugh hearings nobody on the left said a word about their leftist activist they love the pressure that they were putting on Jeff Flake and and other people there they didn't say paying Feinstein wasn't speaking out\nLindsey Graham getting spit on nobody speaking out these incidents that have happened to these conservative women's I don't see the coverage hour by hour second by second\nYou know but if Donald Trump calls the news media fake news and they do give you fake news there is some truth to fake news\nAnd they just hate Trump twenty four seven you should have seen the yesterday the graphics because he said I'm not a global list I'm an American first nationalist well does that mean that he's are racist ... you know is he a white nationalist no he said he's a national list\nAnd his policies are the irony is all of the failure and the disproportionate failure under Obama's policies towards African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans and women in the workplace they wouldn't just disproportionately impacted by the horrific\nPolicies are bronco bombing sat there for eight years did nothing to curb the violence even at his own home city where people are dying\nNow you have a few famous people that have had these suspicious packages that have been sent and let me be very clear you know\nLeading up to this I had been saying this is not going to end well somebody's gonna get hurt\nI don't want anybody hurt I don't want any Democrat hurt I don't want any Republican hurt I don't want any American her I don't want anyone in a caravan hurt it ought not be crisis precipitated at the border because Mexico allows people to march\nOh three thousand miles up to the United states you want to avoid confrontations like this if you can so we had a pipe bomb suspicious\nPackages sent to the Clintons home and ... similar package to Obama's home one to CNN New York headquarters ... and apparently the one yesterday George Soros his home in Westchester New York suspicious package center Debbie Wasserman Schultz who's officer investigating one that might have gone to Maxine\nWaters office you know with all the rhetoric from Spartacus get in their face older kick them they go low we kick them\nHillary Clinton we can't be civil with them unless of course we win\nYou know Maxine what did she say get a crowd if you see them you get a crowd you follow them in a restaurant sing department stores and gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore\nAnd watching it happened to all these Republicans as any of this you know we don't know what the intentions are a lot of people are speculating what the intentions are um you know let me be very clear I Know I Know firsthand what all of\nThis is like my thoughts and prayers go out to anybody that has to deal with this today\nI've had similar incidences of security in my life you know Linda ... you know somebody that we both care for very very dearly a girl that worked for us for years she's been on the radio occasionally you know remember when we had the white powder scent the Fox news\nAnd she literally had to spend an entire eight nine hours in isolation because we thought at the time it was anthrax that was sent I don't get packages anymore and my life\nUh and and far worse in terms of threats it's sad but if you're in the public eye this happens more than I Will disclose here it's not about me today\nBut I Know many other conservatives that have had the same thing happened it'd be go back just three weeks ago maybe people born is alarms at\nThe news from the minute the news broke this morning the media's on Wall to wall with reports suspicious packages and you know that were sent to the Clintons Obama recall there was another one and you know I think it's a huge story I Do it's a scary story\nBut if you go back just three weeks ago how many ... do you even know that race in letters deadly rice and letters\nWere actually sent to President Trump's defense secretary James Mattis or FBI Director Christopher Wray our CIA director Gina Haspel and other top officials in fact\nThat story got so little coverage that I barely remembered it until I saw a report on one of the Web sites earlier today that it was only three weeks ago that that it happened here\nAnd then of course we can take it back to the ... the shooting\nWhen Steve ... nearly lost his life and to this day he struggles and has had so many operations that barely were able to save this guy's life that day\nBut for the heroin ... heroism of to brave Capitol police officers that took on a guy with a rifle that well had cover and walked in the middle of a baseball field it's almost a suicide mission to defend people\nI I never saw such heroism it was amazing\nBut you think of the rhetoric that we've been hearing in the buildup to all of this and everyone else has been silent this isn't about left or right when when we found out that the that skill leases shooter happen to be a Bernie Sanders supporter\nSean Hannity didn't go on the air and say I blame Bernie I just I did the opposite I don't know I Can't hold Bernie Sanders responsible\nFor the actions of of one of his ... supporters he's not responsible for that\nBut the media today and their their reaction to this is so over the top so outrageous so disgusting lead partisan\nIt just they're so quick to blame President Trump Fox News talk radio you got this NBC reporter saying that these packages shouldn't be written off as the work of an extreme as fringe but rather mainstream Republican media outlets like Fox News and talk radio\nYou can leave you with unexpected higher mortgage payments at Quicken Loans we've

back that I'd been consistent and I'm also going to prove what you're hearing today from liberal politicians about civility is they're just words because their silence in the last month over\nThe most

including Newt tape that has been a shot undercover that really exposes Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota\nLiterally the ... she's quote she'll be a super liberal every elected [noise] that's what they've caught saying on tape\nYou know she's she'd be bolder if she's reelected and everything I'm just like Brett ascent in Tennessee just like Claire McCaskill in Missouri I only got Heidi Heitkamp acting one way before an election and trying to bamboozled the people\nIn the states I'm you know it's a and one of the things that I Am I I'm not surprised that but it 'cause it's all too predictable and that is this rush to judgment now that we have these\nThe what looks like suspicious packages some powder maybe pipe bombs all of this is going to be vetted out in the days to come the president has reacted very strongly today let off an opioid bill signing event at the White House\nAnd uh he was with the vice president he retweeted the vice president's comments on the emergency and condemning the bomb like incidents and online statements as media outlets left wing politicians you know around the country we've got to protect our politicians\nThey getting suspicious packages in the mail um\nKnow that is this happened to Donald Trump's family we know recently happened uh done junior and his family we know that it has happened just rice and letters were sent to Trump in Madison ray and Haspel just three weeks ago and I frankly don't really remember any of the coverage in that particular case\nUm there is an assumption here because it is CNN and it is\nIt ... Obama and holder and Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the Clintons the assumption is that this is political which by the way is\nProbably you know some fringe person out there somewhere\nOr it could very well be in and obviously the temperatures been hot\nAs we've been hearing Democrats say they can't be civil and kick 'em and we watch mobs confronting Republicans all over the country every day and not one Democrat that I Know is spoken out and said stop attacking Sarah Sanders secretary Nielsen\nStop confronting people like Pam Bondi stop confronting Henry Kissinger stop throwing boulders through the office of Kevin McCarthy\nThey've been watching this on a regular basis\nYou know it's a very scary thing for anybody to have to live through\nUm what's amazing again is to watch the professionalism of our law enforcement\nI mean I've known people on the bomb squad and on the NYPD they have their absolute finest in the country as they did their work today and and we've had no incident so far at all we don't know if they're alive we'll get updates on shore throughout the day\nThe president says we cannot tolerate these cowardly act so strongly condemn all of those who choose violence first ladies said as much as well\nThe president said the safety of the American people as my highest that absolute priority so the full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation\nThose responsible for these despicable act the justice we'll spare no resources or expense in this effort\nAnd I just want to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together and we have to send one very clear a strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the u._s._a.\nAnd he concluded by touting his statement condemning the egregious threats that cetera et cetera and and mores coming but that's not what you got the media writer almost instantaneously almost instantaneously some NBC News reporter named Ben Collins\nSoros Obama and the Clintons have been viewed as the root of all evil on TALK radio and Fox News for over a decade\nWhen he just said Fox News and talk radio did it I mean this this rush to Joe we don't know who did it\nWe have no nobody has a clue who did this\nWhat I can tell you it's no sane rational conservative or Republican that I Would ever want to be friends with or any conservative I Know would want to be friends with\nBut I feel sorry for the people over a CNN Today I've lived through this\nAnd I and Linda on a scale of one to ten the anthrax incident being a one how many tens of we had in the course of my career that you know about I mean you know we got ten death threats today via letter yeah\nBut I mean and it's just a horrible thing there was one particular person at another network I won't say who\nWas going through a very bad time and going through a lot of threats and picked up the phone don't agree with this person at all and I explained everything that I've been through and tried to get my best advice\nI mean this person was upset had to leave their house they had young kids this person you know how to family and you know it's it's hard\nIt's unfortunately part of the environment we live in and that's why I don't understand why there's been so much silence about chasing people at restaurants\nAnd attacking people in restaurants you know somebody bangs on your table\nIn a restaurant that's an assault that guy should have been arrested\nOr shows up at your house or spit on you or threaten to you or follows you I have had all the above\nAnd it's just very very very difficult and how many times if I said keep Obama said when he was president we got to keep our for our politicians have whoever did this is not a conservative in the sense that maybe they think they are but they're not anybody I Want anything to do with her any conservative once anything to do it\nBut this rush to judgment we don't know what thing yet who's responsible I immediately that trying to exploit it for political gain when it is a serious significant threat they lose it while the president says fake news\nOh they are fake news you know truth is you know words are very different than actions\nJust like Bernie Sanders says incendiary things to that that was incendiary to me I just but you know he's not responsible because not that supports him\nSo unbelievable they apocryphal see how many of you know how many reported that three weeks ago rice and letters were sent to the president\nAnd secretary of defense Mattis indoor FBI Director ray and to our CIA director Gina Haspel anybody even hear about that\nI didn't hear a lot of concern from people on the left when Don junior when he had gone through that and by the way that's nothing compared to the threats people getting these\nThis is happening every day this is a very very dangerous political environment\nEverybody needs to take a deep breath you don't like you

what\nDo they want to be like\nYou know the amazing\nThis is now number three British send the phony fake phony fraud wire hypocrite from Tennessee you got Claire McCaskill the pony lying hypocrite manipulate trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal\nBut she's not going to tell you that until after the election anyway project very toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are you\nA showing great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the sameness Heidi Heitkamp director\nHer Washington DC campaign office uh speaking candidly about when she gets elected she is going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in these battleground states to get elected\nWhat's so amazing is the consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff one thing they're saying things privately that they'll never say publicly\nIn the hopes that they came basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of brothers and even calling the people of Tennessee ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for that state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video\nA there's a video in Missouri we did where were they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's views and the staffer says Obama and McCaskill have the same using everything but quote people just can't know that well in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nIn and Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office\nAnd we and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those uh Obama looks like the messiah on the wall this big poster\nBut then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take your mom poster down and the staffer says well because the presses here and and we take it down when the press calms is what Heidi Heitkamp staff saying\nSo it's more it's basically the same thing in each of these red states\nThey have to mislead they have to do the moderate voters and play the progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's going to be similar but once you get selected that her staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again so because this is what Jesse Overton says in the studio quote she doesn't want to run again social just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people of their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know because Maxine Waters told us that are parties told or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five\n... well that's it yeah but\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicion is that well that's what we do it very costly confirms suspicions\nAnd we've always known to be true but my point is just have integrity does it it's not really left or right thing I was at the first time in conference with all these big hon chosen media who were ... you know very cheering and and\nHearing it may I suggest have integrity this\nIs about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie to the moderates they have to work with the moderates and that and they can only make one choice once\nBut he did not have a choice it's lying is is a a purposeful misinformation propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they said they're going to do they have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda\nAnd so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there's an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that Phil Bredesen hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state Penn well they\nDo it so hateful Sean that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I'd never met Josh I yeah I don't I don't it doesn't work for me I never talk to anybody in his staff but McCaskill ask to be a special prosecutor to investigate project Vera tossed\nTo investigate hair on camera speaking her own words or are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri\nAbout so many people know I Know and it it it it to the ...\nIn general asking for me to be investigated is like someone telling you not to go on the radio and talk it's it's it's\nIt's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do in Missouri they're just Pennsylvania I Can't do it Illinois I Can't do it\nBut thirty eight states I can record people as long as I'm In the room with them and I'm reporting
