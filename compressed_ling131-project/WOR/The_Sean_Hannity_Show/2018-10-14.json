{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "Worked with and and your your good physician does work with that and and and you know if you've been to a physician and you walk out I don't care if they save your lives the surgery but they're rude and mean then you don't really feel real great and you might go home still depressed or whatever it is more depressed or more the\nMore fearful that yeah that's frequent and more fear that drives me crazy when when we're taught and medicine to use fear to get people to do it we want no bounds of nature we use education jobs here means teacher so so that people can make that choice not fear I don't believe in fear factor\nAnd the health triad is also just magical and ... ... one wonderful thing as a health costs when you're working with people\nAnd sometimes there's decided they helped try ad that people can't face you know they're just they've been working on it long enough and they're done they're like I'm given up on the physical and I can't lose weight or I can do whatever I'm done I'm not going to work on that anymore and so\n... the health coaches that\nIf you just work on two sides of the triangle the third one comes up naturally on its own so we just say okay let's set that aside for now and let's look at the other two ... and ... it improves and then as things improve then they get more\nWilling to look at that site that so difficult for them so\nYou have a health coach that takes the customers through the various ways in which the fruits and veggies interact perhaps with other medications or how much you should take what time you should take them what are some of the different roles that health coach fails when they start taking balance of nature\nWell the main goal of a health coach is\nBecause we are results based company is to make sure that our customers are getting results or well you know we all there's always results with balance of nature all you have to do is take it and and we teach our health coaches that because that is absolutely true we've done the research we know that we know the results that you're getting\nOn the human cell if you just to swallow them but you don't always feel it\nExactly whether you fill it or not the result is there and you know I I Hope this person doesn't mind that I use the example not use names anyways but just just yesterday I had a wonderful experience speaking with a man and I'm an in\nRelation to what you're talking about what do we talk about with our health coaches his it's based upon the try out of help and that's what I built after five six years of practice and I started to realize and see this that\nEverybody's help is based on three factors and and a lot of people then go I've heard this before but not this model of it\nBecause we're based upon a chemical aspect of health that's nutrition that the air we breathe the drugs everything in our body it's a chemical we are a chemical laboratory so everything is based upon the raw materials of new of of chemistry\nAnd then then there's good and there's bad okay and then there's the physical side of help and that's an aspect we have to we have to address always and then there's the at the mental spiritual emotional side of that is all one that's not three different things\nThat one side of your health tryout and so we work on goals on all three of those sides to help people really see the greatest benefit and for example I was with somebody yesterday and ah\nAs I was talking with him he's a good man and so one of his goals you know they'd written down be good to people do kind things for people and those are all important but I just looked at him and I said [noise]\nYou do all those things you are that person you could just see it in him and fill it from him infinite looked at him I mean you know what you're what you're dealing with is fear\nBecause fear and face cannot coexist you can't have them in the same space one chases the other out and so\nWith tears he finally said you're right\nI don't trust I Need to change the trust in my life and he left with a new resolve to trust to trust in the process of his body to trust in the process of things to trust in people\nAnd he he will have a whole change in his life because now we're working all three sides we had some other goals of walking and being active and and and obviously was with nutrition we had several several goals but 'til we found that one he wasn't a change person\nHe will see results now\nWe're going to take a short break and we'll be right back with more from Dr Douglas Howard and Susan Howard don't go away\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule\nReally does work I've had a great expense and not not getting seasonal allergy colds and stuff in the spring and the whole tribute it to that\nBecause I shut down or I actually stopped my vitamins that I Would take you know taking a regiment of vitamins and I think sickly stopped all of them and then went on this end of the things that he beneficial for me\nThat made me feel better I mean you have to know at my age if I can keep up with all the animals something has to work\nIt just helped me

and use discount code W. or\nWelcome back to the balance of nature show I'm your host Laura Smith and we are talking about why whole foods or the answer to many health problems versus taking supplements that have vitamins\nI'm with the founder and formulate or a balance of nature Dr Douglas Howard and his wife Susan Howard Dr Howard is a medical doctor I wrote practical Dr researcher and specialist in spite of nutrients\nDr Howard what is new that you can tell us with balance of nature and and truly what do you I Know you do research continually you're one of those perpetual scientists\nTell us what you're learning ... even more and more as the results come into the company about what the wonderful people who are taking this product what it's doing for them\nYou know what is beautiful the balance of nature is it's not new is the oldest form of nutrition on the earth that is exactly what it was made for us you know yes I'm always researching and finding and driving of how and why does it work\nBut the beauty of it is we don't have to reinvent it every couple of years and make it special a new\nBecause the formula for balance of nature has been here for thousands of years on the earth it's one hundred percent pure fruits and vegetables\nThere's nothing at it and nothing taken away from it except for the water it's pure produce\nIt took years of which fruit and which vegetable and and how they would interact with each other and studying that through and then doing studies with with the electron microscopy to different universities so they could study by electron microscopes\nHow it was affecting the DNA the very best and then some of the studies we were doing was how it would affect the immune system the most you remember the game pacman of course okay well you've got white blood cells in there that run around like pacman going you know to to eat the the bad things\nAnd that's what those white blood cells are out there to do so we tested how many of those white blood cells could be out there to eat up the things that shouldn't be in your blood\nAnd how quickly they could respond those immune studies those DNA studies and studies about how the red blood cell could receive the nutrition and receive oxygen so get out where it needed and also even studies about the vis costs to do the blood or in other words\nThe thickness of the blood how it flows through the veins and can get to the smallest possible vessels\nAll of that put together then I studied which fruits and vegetables and combining those until we had sixteen different fruits and Fifteen different vegetables\nThat made the greatest impact on those things and in the DNA for example how could protected the most and how quickly the DNA could repair itself wind damage to those are all things that help prevent aging diseases\nIt's always such a great pleasure to speak with you Dr Howard and Susan Howard from balance of nature what I find remarkable is how easy balance of nature has made it for me to get more than ten real whole servings of fruits and vegetables every day it really is remarkable beautiful benefits of the fruits and veggies and the ... the whole health system\nAnd just so much about what good nutrition means and what it can mean for everyone's life no matter what age it's a real pleasure thanks for being on today\nThank you it's great to be here

uterus that's where the babies grow and so on the other ... comes off every month and the woman's menstrual period so this woman at age sixty one knew that something was wrong she was losing blood from The Vagina losing blood is always a worrisome sign that may not be a worrisome result but it's a worrisome sign\nAnd she had a little by of civil another uterus and she was found to have ended up being show cancer\nSo she's a hundred and Seventy eight pounds she's on thyroid medications came with her friend I examined her shed low back pain so we checked out\nTo make sure that that and the metro cancer did not travel to her back\nWe check her out everything was okay and now she's getting treatment for and the meat trio cancer and most probably she will be a case that would take about a man who is fifty four years old born in Greece and he comes with his girlfriend he's a girlfriend has\nBeen with him for Fifteen Years and he had surgery on a brain tumor he was fine until he got dizzy this year and he had some strange sensation in the right side of his visual field that means where he would look in both the right or left by all the right\nSide of the right or left by a vision was normal had some dizziness difficulty with speech and balance and he had a seizure\nAnd they ended up having a seizure while I was driving and was taken to the hospital and he had surgery and he had this tumor found a glioblastoma which is aggressive cancer of the brain\nAnd he had surgery and now he's here he's from upstate New York by the way for a couple of hours away and you came here because you heard about our\nExcellent work and the fact that we've been the leader and focus the radiation of the brain for\nAbout Thirty years first to New York parade radio surgery\nSo he's done

hospital one of the biggest hospitals had an ultrasound the ultrasound showed gallstones who went to a second hospital there he was found out gall bladder\nCancer at that time has see a Ninety nine cancer markers we often talk about cancer markers cancer markers or proteins in the blood his cancer marker when he was first diagnosed which was three months ago was thirty three now it's two hundred and Seventy three and then these three months he had a CAT scan PET scan MRI\nHe started chemotherapy everything was delayed being in many many of these hospitals are so slow and caring for the patient who was diagnosed three months ago it took two and a half months started chemotherapy\nWhich time has cancer marker had gone up nine hundred percent so he was seen by surgeons asserting sold them they wanted to operate even though the cancer is growing to the liver and growing into lymph nodes he's lost weight he went from two hundred and Ninety pounds to two hundred and sixty pounds is six feet tall is decreased hearing in his ear for many\nYears he never smoked they examined him and his abdomen is soft has managed to cancer rising cancer markers eight hundred percent of the sky

she'll be reassured that\nSide of cancer and live a normal life so either way whether it's not cancer and she lives in our life is cancer she gets treated the lives of normal life her prognosis is\nExcellent in either case and that's the work that we do here in New York had surgery for Broadway for women with nah does Nebraska abnormal mammograms breast cancer either in their breast or

are back I Want to talk about an eighty year old woman really dramatic story this ... year old woman she's a retired construction worker she's with all the three children and shut the mass in her arm so in her armpit was a mass she had a biopsy wishing by came all doctors\nAnd the chemo doctors want to give her chemo for a mass it's called a solitary\nPlasma ... plasma cell cancer it's the only side of disease she said cat scans work ups and it came to the doctor told her she had the chemo she went to one of the biggest Kimball doctors in New York or one of the biggest hospitals and told her that she has to have chemo for this\nCancer but it seems like this doctor doesn't know all the information and that's a big plus of coming to a doctor who's triple board certified as trained in medicine medical oncology radiation and if this came all Dr only knew for a solitary plasma\nSide coma that focused beam radiation was highly successful this doctor would have said but you're right you don't have to have came oh you should go to Dr Lederman and have\nFocused beam radiation and most likely will be successfully treated with no chemo and no side effects and with pinpoint treatment only to your armpit area where the cancer is the solitary\nPlasma site tell them up and this woman has been saved months and months of chemotherapy we know the chemotherapy on average is ten thousand dollars plus months or talking about a huge\nBill we're talking about all the side effects of chemo and her body and we're talking about better treatment she doesn't need the chemo she was right the only thing that was sad is that the chemo doctor doesn't know the data that for a solitary plows beside poma particular\nCancer that this woman could have and should have focused beam radiation here

can also call Dr lead a minute to ensure killington for free informative booklet and DVD pay Dr Lederman whereby\nWe are back I'll tell you about the man who sixty years old is a religious man who are religious family and he has a sarcoma when he was going to get into one of those big hospitals and he was getting chemo and surgery for a certain comas well number one circle Missouri cancers of the connective tissue like\nThe muscles and the fat tendons and the bones or you had a cancer sarcoma and\nHe was getting surgery and came up with the cable never worked a cancer was growing up was growing up in multiple spots in his body yet a big mess on his lip like the size of a big grape on his upper lip and there were cut off his lip yeah you heard right there were cut off his lip and how\nWould eat and function and how would he have a social life when they cut off his lip and he came here he was fed up with\nSurgeries cutting and chemo cutting chemo and more of the same and big bills who was caught up with and then he came here need to learn that came all usually does not work force are comas cutting all can be super to forming in our success rate where we attacks are comas is very high about Ninety percent with\nInvisible beams of treatment and we heard of that mass on his lip and that shrink down\nAnd now it's controlled is fine and when examined by examined him I put my hands\nOn his abdomen pelvis in this huge mass of football sticking out from his pelvis and this is a cancer that they were just ignoring they're cutting off\nParts of his skin and shoulder and back but there was a mass the size of our football in his pelvis growing and causing pain and distortion and kept on growing despite chemotherapy and we've got to scan we scanned them up and we found the cancer the coma where it wasn't his body and the offered treatment there with offered treatment to the lip\nAnd he saw what the lip because of the cancer was on the lip and you could see her treatment working without distortion without cutting without bleeding heart\nTreatment working and he gained confidence gained confidence each\nPerson who comes here needs to have confidence and we tell stories but the first hand approach is always the best and\nHis cancer shrink on his lip and then you decided yet I truly don't to write this cancer in the pelvis is causing difficulty walking it was just single walkers have distortion and pain\nAnd we treated it it's been growing for years all his cancer's been growing growing growing because the ... not working\nAnd he came here and every area of the sarcoma\nWe've created has worked we just finished reading the mess in the pelvis shrunken down and he can they can feel that also it's like a big mess sticking out the side of his body and now we just finished shooting a tumor in his legs so the answer is so many people ask your doctor Lederman my doctor told me I had stage ... cancer they\nCame over for the rest of my life as a true no it's not true and no it doesn't usually work and maybe it works for first few months but after that usually cancer outsmarts cancer then mutates cancer is is that this man had\nExtensive hundreds of thousands of dollars of surgery and chemo doesn't work and the cancer grew back India is bills were enormous uh we know that\nLess expensive treatment and that means less bills to you and your insurance company into society is available\nHere with better results most ...\nI'm a ... where we ended up being with high success rates where we attack the cancer patient no ... no bleeding

story\nThirty six year old man he came with his wife and while he was fine until last summer and last summer he was biking in Martha's Vineyard one of the islands off of Massachusetts and he and his wife used to love the bike and he was biking hiking that age thirty five\nAnd he couldn't bike he was so short of breath and do you went to the doctors there knew how to be in the make it seem a globe and the measurement of how much red blood cells are near system normally is about sixteen and his hemoglobin was six which means she lost almost two thirds of his blood get a CAT scan showed her cancer and the colon\nHuge transferred his care back to New York where he lived as a big financial guy on Wall street he transferred his care to this big hospital and they had a cold ... pay they held the seat co cancer so cancer of the sea come to an already traveled to the liver Soviet stage\nFor cancer when I was diagnosed it was diagnosed because he was bleeding short of breath and that was the initial symptoms and then he started chemotherapy at a super duper big place of a man\nAnd his CPA well cancer marker\nWas two thousand when it started and then it went down the road again and then he had surgery about six months ago they operated on him for the call on my ass they stuck pump into give chemotherapy and deliver and the other another scan back four months ago showing all their chemo and all their surgery the\nWork that pumping the liver doesn't work the chemo and the vein to the work of surgery doesn't work and then they transferred to another doctor and got more and more chemo more and more chemo for three months and now\nThe cancer marker was going down but the cancer was getting worse so that's a big teaching point and that is when the cancers growing and the cancer

degrees and fair at four o'clock good afternoon I'm Christine marked that Senator Chuck Schumer is calling on the NTSB to improve its investigations into limousine crash dance following that wrapped up state lap twenty people that want\nOr the body water so important the body what it's supposed to be around sixty percent people don't realize that sixty percent of your body should be water if people are coming in\nWith forty percent thirty five percent forty five percent\nA particularly it affects really are obese people but certainly ... women obese women in general uh if you're if you're a body water is low and you're walking around with a bunch of water and you're walking around with a book with drinking water all the time and meanwhile your water's low a year\nAnd if that's going to affect how your body's metabolism is going to work it's going to affect ah your muscle is like the engine of your metabolism and so if that's not happening um because your body isn't absorbing water properly maybe one of the reasons you can't lose any weight so we put you on that machine will be able to see if that's the situation there so\nI just said Andrew dice dot com it's only twenty seven dollars and you can schedule appointment come in\nAnd we'll get you're going on the road to health and on the road to possibly shopping and different parties\nYeah so I got you beat on that one what what what was your number your number would want to phase\nAnd Bruce was sixty days fifty six pounds and succeed\nI got you beat on that one I got I'm yeah I'm a I'm ashamed to say well I'm not ashamed to say I don't really know his first name because he's in Brooklyn office moment and and so and I I Believe that his pictures has the foreign actors actually on our website already a sixty four pounds and sixty days\nOh yeah I Know you're talking about sixty four pounds and sixty days yeah and he took a great profile picture of himself this gentleman is wearing a white shirt and tie and so the profound pictures fantastic so if you guys get a chance definitely go to and J died dot com and take a look at that profile picture sixty four pounds and sixty days and very impressive\nMan and woman it doesn't matter how old you are I mean it really is that um [noise]\nIt's an ... an astronomical number in my opinion officer Amos I I think something to this effect again I don't know the patient personally because I don't go to the Brooklyn office but ah you know this is just a staggering number and really just the health or that if you're the bass officer\nHe's chasing criminals around it but you can do it much easier sixty\nFour comes down I Would think so I definitely I think that's probably a better situation for them especially in this heat that we've got going on so so\nSo we improved we've we improved the safety of our city just yes that's correct if you can chased on criminal yeah ... yeah ... ... yeah when I went wow ups yeah when when\nOne at a time right so but you know that the pounds a great but I think that um a lot of what we see in our office is really the health benefits of what happens and um\n[noise] you know just losing ten twelve or Fifteen pounds can make such a huge difference in how you feel and\nUm what you are a blood tests are and where your numbers are so we're fan who are just um was in and he's on day thirty three of the program he went from two Seventy one to two forty four\nOut which is a twenty seven pounds and thirty three days which by the way is not a tremendous number for a man typically you know for a man that um has a lot of weight to lose you know in thirty three days we'll see anywhere probably anywhere between thirty six to forty pounds however and all over town however his\nA health uh results or hit overall uh health um benefits have been ridiculous so his blood pressure is now one oh four over sixty four\nWhich I Would say probably a little low [laughter] if I write his cholesterol ah when I'm Down to one oh nine\nFrom from two twenty eight wow so his HDL is at forty six and his LDL is at forty two down from Ninety seven his triglycerides are now a hundred and seven down from\nTwo fifty a this is day thirty three of the ... well\nI mean I I I Would think well that's basically what his doctor actually said too because I guess he had a doctor's appointment like\nThirty three day and to the program which we usually tell people you know wait until you're done with the program and then go to your primary care physician and kind of do a blood work and all that other stuff but his appointment was already scheduled so he figured he'd go why not write so his primary care I fell off the chair absolutely\nJust blown away he asked him what he was doing he was like I don't understand he's like you were a couple of months ago you know your your numbers were a disaster basically you know and his case I can understand I have so much energy I'm doing this I'm doing that it feels so good\nAt you know but that that's really what's cool I think right thirty three days in and\nLiterally um he's basically almost off all of his medications trauma or it's tremendous tremendous um so I think that those are the coolest results right and we talk about that in the office and find\nThose to health part of it is the best part and I and we're able to do that because of the personalization of the of the of the system and\nPeople come in with his hair and saliva or we use blood work analysis we use DNA Analysis as well and from saliva and uh we were able to look at you know blood work in a functional level and and then to\nSee what supplements with support people need and and it's so everybody gains weight and different areas for a reason\nThe body is generally trying to protect those areas because if there's hormone\nA disruption and so you've got the different body types who got to be with the floppy overhanging belly fat or could be a neutrino issue protruding hard belly fat deliver 'em the day that that ... issue with the apple shape apple shaped generally thyroid imbalances\nOr the pear shape reproductive imbalances doesn't really matter\nOr it could be a Ninety number of things are and so we're able to use the buyer energetic scans that we use from parents water use blood work assessment tool or to see when a functional level to keep to keep a ... to keep the body functioning better not so much diagnosing disease\nAnd so then personalize the system personalize the supplements for each individual to help get that one person or into fat burning and unable to\nBasically get people into the secular state of fat burning and then the body starts bouncing self out body starts detox of flying itself\nThe hype and found this which is the uh the main hormone controller and the main thermostat of the body starts resetting itself so when people are done they're not going to put the weight back on because the thermostat as basically re set at a new number just like a house thermostat punching somebody to say that somebody too\nSo that's what we were able to do to the problem is that the reason a lot of times people can't lose any weight\nIs their thermostat is set a two fifty and no matter what they do they're going to stay to fifty\nSo then we get them their bodies bouncing get 'em down to let's say two ten and then re set the thermostat a two time you're going to say to tech\nAnd then we give everybody tools going forward as well so if you're going to you know if you if you will give you ten different ways to eat if you're waiting pops up by two or three pounds would tell you how to what to eat that day drops the weight back down so you should never really be above two or three pounds over a year you know day forty or sixty earned a program weight\nSo it you know to the system it's personally from the beginning of ... at the end at the end we also use DNA\nTools or we do a DNA test\nAnd so the DNA shows a different eating a types or exercise for each individual a central the need for central vitamins and minerals\nOr ... different or metabolic factors are assessed so we're looking at over forty different genetic factors to help people not only help keep a blues the weight but also how to keep it off going forward so\nIt's basically all encompassing from beginning to end its personalized to each individual because everybody's going to be a little different camping one\nUh can't be a one or what one thing that fits everybody so it's got to be a little bit different thought one size fits all sir able to switch these things up and get the people get people work and get their bodies work in the right way and then when you lose the weight and your body's bouncing than health problems start to go away as well so\nIt's really uh it's all it's all about getting that weight off it's all about getting healthier\nAnd so the number to call for that is one eight five five\nFive and J died twenty five five five six five thirty four thirty eight and that's the schedule of free go over the system in one of our local five locations and in New York tri state area\nUh the best way to do it I think is to go on line you go to and jade diet dot com and that's normally Ninety nine dollars for only for only twenty seven dollars right now you can come in will do a body company an appointment with us a body composition analysis we are going to look at not just wait\nYou know plus or reading on the program so losing one pound to lose ... pounds thirty five hundred calories we routinely see people losing a pound a day plus or eat it so we are talking about the body burning anywhere from four thousand\nAround four thousand calories a day minimally\nUh to to to lose the weight uh so you're not you we re route where your body's basically using for fuel your body's just using your own toxic fat for fuel so to\nTo get that done it said five five five and Jay diet won eight five five five six five thirty four thirty eight or that's good to schedule an appointment a\nFor a free go over one of our officers now when you're calling and you're talking to the folks at the at the call center there they're just an appointment they're set appointments right so they don't have all the answers to your questions I can guarantee that ah that's why we were moving all the ... just come in and get a check up get a get a check up and all that\nUh and so just don't get mad at those people were people yelling at the time all the time or and so just come in and and and\nUh in the U.S are there and but you can also go on line A N J died dot com and that's for only twenty seven dollars normally signing nine dollars only twenty seven dollars\nOr you can um come into the office will do an appointment with one of ... with one of us uh you'll also will do a body composition analysis\nWill take a look at your weight will take a look your body fat percentage of body what percentage of visceral fat writing your metabolic cage or basic metabolic rate daily caloric intake we're looking at a bunch of different things a body of water so important that should be closer to sixty percent\nOr if you're in the forties you can't lose weight and you're wondering why and you're walking around with a bottle of water all the time you're drinking a hundred ounces of water and you still can't lose weight\nI guarantee your body isn't absorbing it the right way you have a mineral or electric light imbalance we see these imbalances with things like yo yo dieting you'll see it with digestive issues uh you'll see it with certain medications like directs that are used to control blood pressure\nOr because you're overweight or you'll see it with a with a enacted medications a lot of times you'll see it a lot of times with the antidepressant medications it's one of the reasons they cause weight gain or and so\nYou know that might be one of the reasons you're having a problem so we take a look at that and then we can personalize the program for you and you could still lose that twenty to forty pounds more than likely you are not going to need the blood pressure medications and some of the other medications as well so we see this all the time we've seen people come off of all types of different things so there's no limit\nTo what the body can do when you get it working helpfully ... body is a is a wonderful healing organism sometimes it's just has some a lot of barriers that it can't overcome on its own it just needs a little bit of push it needs to a few dominoes to be kind of tilted in knocked down and then the body will do everything on its own after that so\nUh starts and end with the customers ... and the personalization of the of the program the bio energetic scans\nOr the hair and saliva sample for that or blood work functional ... assessment a DNA testing or that shows us over forty different metabolic factors that we assessed ah to help you use the tools going like a blueprint going forward on how to not only keep laid off but also had a stays healthy as possible so\nReally easy and J died dot com or when a five five five A N J diet or I wanted to tell you about\nA Sondra are we talking about sleep I guess sleep with some some started a lot of people coming in with will sleeping issues and I wonder why people are walking around with trouble to triple ... lattes well sleep it off he's from God Knows where\nHe just sleep deprivation causes sleep deprivation and having like a to take our stomach I Know I Know and that was uncomfortable and one of the most awful thing you can ...\nYeah but like so people are coming in I guess they ... they're sleeping and you know they don't tell them necessarily some sleeping issues it when they come in but uh you know when they come when they're done with the price what's cool about the program like people come in and they're very they're they're very very skeptical but they're even going to lose weight and then they stop focusing on the waiting to start thinking about how their health is improving\nA center came in a thirty nine year old female uh she lost ... severe sleeping issues she was she was a having a lot of getting up trouble falling asleep trouble staying asleep waking up early tossing and turning just having a ton of issues sleeping\nA and a lot of times it's a neutrino adrenal issue with cortisol levels and and things like that and you know the courts fellows so important uh they're supposed to you know they're supposed to quarter solves as grades it's a it's produced by the adrenal glands and and so\nIt's supposed to during the day help you burn fat and the night help you sleep and if your adrenal exhaustion issues a lot of times you'll see the opposite you can't lose you can't burn fat and you can't sleep\nOr and so she came and she lost a twenty four pounds in forty days so you know ... you know great usually see twenty five to to thirty five with women so she was just a little bit on to that but what's great about it is that she ... she says that after the first seven to ten days at a program she's basically been sleeping like a rock\nFalling asleep eleven o'clock she goes to bed will on weight syrup at seven she says she doesn't even realize she's asleep anymore she's just kind of goes to bed wakes up boom rich already started day\nRested feeling great no crashes in the three o'clock in the in the afternoon and much less need for coffee in the afternoon which is great which is going to help her sleep say see when you get this thing going in one direction it's going to stay going in one direction [noise] I'm\nTwenty four pounds sleep in like a rock she came in we did ... saliva sample or a bio energetic scans blood work functional assessment we gave her a hormone support type of family support we also gave her dream will support um got they got the body work in the right way and uh now we've got the results that we say\nIt's not surprising either right around that age right around the age of thirty nine forty I hear more and more of that ad right between the ages of like thirty nine and forty one\nI'm a lot of things change in the women's um body yeah ... and cycle right and so it's really\nIt's interesting that every ten years right it's kind of way ... so I think that it's interesting that um you know you brought that up a speaking of at the health benefits so we've had this happen a bunch of times in our office but this just recently happened again\nUh Michelle I'm whom I Believe she's in her mid thirties and she lost eighty pounds she did to round yeah I mean really very a lot of weight eighty ... eighty pounds well what happened was and she had some trouble getting pregnant with her first child and so get a lot of\nYou know um hormone therapy type staff and ... and ... and\nAt ... and all these other things and all of these drugs are really am known for and they'll put on weight I'll put that tell us a ton of weight on yam white them and really just create all sorts of floating in the body and um all sorts of very unpleasant things but you know she got a baby out of it which is really a great positive because of that\nAnd she had gained not only a bunch of weight before she got pregnant but also while she was pregnant and then\nAfterwards really hard hard time taking it off so then she tried to get pregnant again and again more hormones and more and you know are these procedures and unfortunately her second time\nIt was not as successful as her first but she was about eighty pounds heavier than she had started out before so she came to us she did to\nA forty days around which basically means she went pound for pound them both of them um and that's very um you know it it's common because this was not her regular weight right this is wait put on with your mind right so that's why she went pound for pound 'cause her body really needed it really needed to get rid of all it's cracked\nSo pound for pound a pound a day for a man is impressive pound for pound for pound a day for a woman is job search\nWe've had a number of women are like ... ... so anyway\nSo she comes and she comes and um and she says she goes you guys wouldn't believe she came in for ... saliva test I'm just one after the program and she says you wouldn't believe what I have to tell you she says I'm pregnant oh no hormones great now at\n... no ... no nothing on she says\nI guess my body got rid of all the tax in of all the extra hormones I dropped all this way\nShe says and now I'm pregnant [laughter] it's a really great story but you know we've had this happen at you know I don't know at times I Would say yeah half a dozen two dozen times where um you know but she by the way completely didn't expect that I mean her her her and her husband\nFully like just you know we're settled with one child and happy and the baby healthy and so\nNow she's about to have a second one and she said I Can't believe I'm gonna have to lose weight again but you know what I think it's going to happen\nTo be honest with you is ... now they're not exactly regulator bodies more regularly or probably gain she'll probably ... has not\nGained a ton of layer already and she even said that with that with the first baby she had gained so much during the first couple of weeks and kept gaining and she said with this one she feels completely different she feels so much healthier and really\nFeels good not as much knowledge I during the ... really she says it's just a whole different experience for her she feels that car south and it's really great and congratulations to her and I you know looking forward to meeting that healthy baby\nYeah that's that's awesome we had a chill off so I had to somebody came in and was telling me the same thing a chill came in and she's thirty two years old she hasn't had a a regular cycle in years she says it was she would come and go heavy bleeding\nFor days on end and it wouldn't then uh it would go for weeks than it would stop for months and completely inconsistent ah and she came in and I'm similar situation you know she said that to attend the type of cycle totally stopped\nThat's true I'm Shauna came in and she was down so shot at it or to the program she kind of did it in a weird way she looked at it for thirty days then she had a two week vacation\nSo she did the program for thirty days stop the program two weeks short before a vacation to get a little ... to get the reset couple of days and then she came back in and then she did another twenty days of the program she was just a total of Fifteen days are and what should the cool\nThing is she was away so she stopped the program she's thirty days or lost a bunch of weight\nLoss of twenty five or thirty pounds or something like that in ... in the thirty days went away on vacation for for ten to fourteen days and days and put any of the weight back on all while on vacation which is awesome and then\nShe came back and did another Twenty one days of the program so basically she had fifty days of the program and lost so fifty six pounds total in the fifty days\nThat are pretty impressed yeah that's great vacation and\n... and in the middle said you must you must have customize that one for her\nBut yeah we have to have it a little bit but it's fun so she had a she says you know she had a vacation plan she hadn't been away and look and then I can tell somebody not to go on vacation so we just customized before we played with it a little bit did it the right way\nUm and what's great is she ... no more thyroid meds\nAre no more no more sugar medications a siren levels in normal so she doesn't need that generally the Farid medications anymore or and when she came in we we were able to do we did the parents live up by energetic scans\nGave her a hormone support gave her thyroid support she needed bankers support also and she lost she lost that way or the DNA we're going to do the DNA is going to be used to also to help keep the weight off to keep her ... to keep her as\nAs healthy as possible or ... you know when your thyroid ... you know it's really important when you're talking about people that are coming in\nA lot of times with mineral imbalances and and things like that\nThat affects the thyroid a lot the thyroid really that I dines gotta get bind with sodium to get into the cells of the thyroid a teach for aid to even work so that's why you know people have a sluggish thyroid a lot of times you'll see weight gain and the problem might not even be with a thyroid problem might be but the fact that your body's not is has a mineral imbalance and the and the um\nThe the the iodine may not be with you get into the cello the thyroid gland so\nYou know that conversion the tea forty three ah is really get that that that sort of the the gas pedal to the metabolism so to speak and if that's not happened the right way so if you're if you're having a hard time losing weight you have a mineral imbalance unlock trade imbalance\nA meeting your body isn't absorbing water properly before because of that you'll be affected on the weight loss ... end of it and now if you're if let's say the thyroid if you've got fired issues\nAnd you're not be able to lose way a lot of times we'll see the thyroid not being able to get to even the chemicals the minerals into the thyroid to get the the whole process going so that'll slow it down also so it's so important in your body is just\nThe ... an amazing amazing mechanism but unfortunately here and there will see a few issues\nCome up a few imbalances come up and that's all it takes really is a few imbalances in getting it going the wrong way and you're going to stay going the right or wrong way and then\nConversely speaking you get it moving the right way it's just the body heal so great on its own that once you get a deal in the right way you're going to be able to keep it going that way and and and get on the road to health and stay on the road health so\nReally the one eight five five five and Jay diet a one eight five five five six five thirty four three thirty eight that the schedule a free go over and one of our offices and the New York tri state area or the easiest way I think is an J died dot com\n[noise] a Ninety nine dollars normally but now the ... it's only twenty seven dollars right now it's a radio listener you go on make an appointment\nCommand will go over everything with you explain to how the personalization works with the blood work and the how the DNA part of it works and how the hair and saliva and the buyer Jenike scans are used as well we'll explain everything to you will do a body composition analysis only twenty seven dollars\nAnd uh you'll be able to get going in and and get on the right to get a get going in the right way towards your health a we've got you covered all over the tri state area a couple of locations in New Jersey\nOr New York city queens Brooklyn Long Island are now opening in West Chester as well\nEverybody knows how much I Love numbers right I'm I'm In a number of ... today\nSo we had John who came in he's\nA younger guy in his early thirties um you know he ... he was having some issues you know he had that typical like a belly fat going on a he was\nOn um he was put on a med foreman already a unfortunately hold up early thirties um and so the\nSugar yet I buy the sugar yeah for the sugar exactly and he was not diabetic get you know it was just like a\n... pre diabetic ... diabetic I'm so twenty three days twenty points six pounds down alright everybody ready body fat percentage down in twenty three days from thirty percent or twenty six grade muscle mass went from twenty percent to thirty percent cool water\nWent from fifty six percent to fifty nine percent which the ideal numbers at sixty and his blood sugar used to be a hundred and Seventy in the mornings which is why his doctor put him on met foreman clearly\nThe empty stopped his medications because now he's at Ninety two every morning correct those are pretty cool numbers right early thirties this guy is I cannot imagine and about what the body to coming up the body fat went from thirty percent or twenty six percent\nTremendous tremendous writers were twenty three days or a script right so you're he basically replace ... percent about what was right body fat he replaced it with two percent body mass and a muscle mass excuse me and a two percent or more than two percent water so really that's exactly how those numbers are supposed\nTo work that's exactly what it is now to muscle weighs more than fat that also has more water in it uh and so when you get rid of the fat race are you taking the fat out replacing it with water and those are numbers are exactly which was really great what ... what was what was his weight loss and how much\nA twenty points six pounds and twenty three days in tough yeah and you know it's interesting he really um ... you look at him he he does not look like\nA big guy he's not a big guy but he had that like belly hanging there when you means that

has three children she was fine until four years ago she had a cancer the esophagus there's other people to swallow shut standard chemo and radiation did okay then they checked her stomach and she had cancer in the stomach\nCalled Adam ... carcinoma and she went to one of those super super big hospitals at that time they offered her a local surgery to remove that cancer of the stomach locally through the esophagus and she did that well what they didn't tower the super super big hospital\nIs that they left cancer behind that they went into cut it out but they left cancer behind the cut through the cancer lung cancer behind and they never\nTold her I spoke to her I spoke to her family they never told her they left cancer behind well they should have told or because if you leave cancer behind what his cancer do well cancer grows\nSo they told her all the surgery was gray that she did gray they beat around the Bush but they never told her the super super super famous place they never told or they cut through the cancer and the left the cancer behind\nWhile they left the cancer behind and what happens Eighteen months later I guess what happens the cancer cell growing that's how the surprise there was a surprise to her because of the tower they left cancer behind some surprise to me because I went over the documents show the family\nAs positive margin of cancer behind it was shocking to her because no one told or it was shocking was not shocking to me we see cancer left behind by surgeons even at the most super duper famous place she thought she went to the most super duper famous\nPlace everything good what happened to her and nothing bad well something terribly bad\nHappen to her the cancer came rip roaring back right where they left the cancer they that was our job to cause the cancer they didn't do it they left cancer behind and now they're seeing her again and\nThey want to cut out her whole stomach and now she's refusing that try to trust them anymore and she's had no staging there's another case the surgeons wanted to their surgery but no one does look to see where that cancer is why does it happen\nAll the time it almost seems like the surgeons who are like caught more than they wanted to gather information about the patient well at radio sort of New York city for Broadway were accept most insurance is Medicare Medicaid we sit down with a patient like a boutique a private center made for you that first thousand\nPeople walking around wondering what\nWho was going to take care of what's gonna happen to them here\nWe know you and you know us it's a boutique and we explain things to you and we show things to you and we show this woman that they did the surgery they'll have cancer behind they'd never stayed syrup they want to cut other stomach\nBut what good is it just cut the stomach of the cancers travel they haven't even looked wow and this is all that and believe me there's plenty of super duper fancy places this is at a super duper fancy place they didn't look where the cancerous traveled that doesn't remove all the cancer of the the surgery and now this\nWoman is stuck not wanting to go now through a third treatment well that's why she came to us you came to us for not invasive treatment and to get the answers and that's we provided that will give you answers\nTo Brooklyn to cause if you want an appointment or a booklet cause it to one to two four six forty two thirty seven to one to two four six four to three seven to one to two four six forty two thirty seven they'll send you a book with David did do charge or make an appointment the hotel about fifty nine year old man which is probably one of the most happy\nPeople in New York City they be America he's fifty nine years old he's married he has four children came with his wife has a history of heart disease and cholesterol and high blood pressure and that the beginning of this year he started having nose bleed she was unable to\nBreathe through his nose and his nose started bleeding and he was seen by doctors at two of the biggest hospitals in New York City and not for us that tried to call it arises first tried kayaking and then eventually they found a huge cancer and his nose and\nIt's not easy to miss because this cancer was inside the those growing out so big that his nose became massive his nose became twice the size because the cancer was inside pushing pushing pushing and it was only about a breed and he kept on bleeding and then the surgeon\nSide of the cancer of the inside of the nose and they wanted to cut off his nose and this cancer well we staged um up this cancer was all the way up to the brain has started an inside part of the nose that went up up up to the\nTop of the brain wait if they cut off his nose that would have never got to the top of his brain where the cancer traveled and he refused he refused to have that surgery did not want to be de formed like that and then they said okay we'll just cut out the sap them of your nose well\nCutting out the ... that's in the southern part of the most would not have done\nAny good to this man is a huge cancer blocking his entire nose going up to the brain surgeons who want to do surgery and you can understand why they maybe they want to\nSometimes the doctor should do what's good for the patient and that was good for the doctor and cutting off this man's knows wasn't very good for the patient and the patient refused\nAnd then cutting off the sap the which would not be a cancer surgery with his cancer surgery cancer surgery means to cut the whole\nCancer out without touching the cancer well it seems like they just wanted to do some ... without removing the entire cancer and even when they were proposing removing his nose he doesn't want to do that and he just walked away bleeding and unable to breathe that this massive cancer nose and then a listener someone like you\nWho listens everyday told them why don't you call Dr Lederman a two one two choices and check them out there today for Broadway and he did and I saw him and put together a plan so we were able to treat\nIs cancer in a good way and well he's just finishing his treatment but I can tell you about the last three weeks\nHe has been about the happiest Matt around why because that mass is gone the obstruction his nose\nIt's gone the distortion of his nose is gone the bleeding\nIn the nose is gone is symptom free doing well finishing up his treatment as they say is one of the happiest men around as a knows he's breathing there's no bleeding and there's no visible cancer so he is doing\nGreat is in remission things to do is trust in the U.S\nAnd our ability or team that works together to treat with radio surgery visible beams from thousands of NGOs a nine\nBrain tumors and cancers cancers of the body like this man who just a few months ago was being told that the surgery removing his nose and part of his face will be the only chance and he didn't believe it and he walked away from the surgeons and he said he considered and get a fresh secular opinion came to us\nAnd now thanks to our recommendations in his trusted us he is
