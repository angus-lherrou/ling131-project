on their mobile network all the time he gets got the swag you have this stuff\nThey just put me on air I don't get anything they don't give me a gift pack and work like that now I have to start with the Oscar that out and start talking to some producer there you go\nHow 'bout uh this weekend we obviously had the the good bye to David Ryder a couple of nights ago at this point now what sticks with you about that sense it stuck at the moment and it sticks out\nWith a couple of days of hindsight but when they played a song the dramatic Captain America song as he made that slow walk off the field and the ovation lasted so long that the song ended and everybody was still clapping and they played some other random song that's what sticks out to me as a three minute three minute plus ovation\nTo me David Wright has always been a he's he's different than other players and he's done this so many times throughout the course of his career but after everything on Saturday after the press conference after he has done so many ... media things forever\nHe's still buys locker and lean against Islamic rather than you were there to him and he just\nTalked and unanswered questions like like you and I are talking right now\nFor I don't know Fifteen twenty minutes extra and he would have kept going all night he was it was like you know it'd be after party after party of a wedding sitting at a hotel lobby and just just chatting and\nYou know he's done that from time to time over his career after the world series after they lost he stated his locker for maybe forty five fifty minutes until no one had anything left to ask and just\nJust talking in pouring it's hard on telling what's on his mind than\nThat to me it was really cool it was a really cool moment it's something that you don't really see all that much anymore from players who come up and\nThey're so media trained from a young age and they're so afraid to to we'll let go any aspect of their personality and really what you see who they are David Wright was never that way and and uh that will definitely yeah you're talking about leadership ... that's the type of thing that from a media ... perspective what we met and I think\nThat it's also something that he enjoyed he embraced that part of the job and that's why he was so good as a leader of that club house and the team that I think over the weekend like you said Anthony\n... still because he appreciated it so much that this was probably going to be one of the last opportunities he ever had to stand in front of his locker as the captain of the New York Mets and to be able to speak to the media I don't ever use weren't as uniform or not still afterwards but you know you don't want to take that thing off when it's your last game because you're not going to be able to put that thing on and go out there\nAnd do you do play like you ordinarily would for how many decades of his wife so I think some of that finality probably hit him to a certain\nDegree well and also he you know talk about going out on on your own terms and this obviously was not the terms that he would have dictated but it was in the sense that\nShe could go into his last game knowing it was his last game\nAnd when you're able to ... things in that way\nYou can step back and soak it in and and and think about all the things thinking about your last this in your last that which you know if you're not sure you're not able to do so he was very cognizant of all that he was very cognizant that as he was making memories he was making memories and he was making the things that he's going to think about for the next five ten twenty thirty forty years and\nThat was cool to kind of watch him soak it all in and be in the moment but also be removed from the moment and see it from thirty thousand feet\nBut what is going to change for this franchise without David Wright being a part of it now Tim and the answer might be not much I suppose\nWell I'll be New York city and we alluded to earlier but who who steps up as a leader as a clubhouse voice during good times and bad in in a less\nA meaningful way who gets his locker he's got a sweet spot in the corner double ... writing like I said forget storage yet it's actually it actually is more meaningful than if they didn't know their app sadly humble this close to the clubhouse locker assignments are very and I wouldn't shocked me to see it maybe you're going used for a season\nI can see that I think that would be a big thing for them to give both of them away at\nThe same point it is it's not necessarily an ideal location right if you were scouting out of the player where he wanted to be is is that the spot you'd pick it's pretty good it's kind of where everyone's going in and out right ...\nWell you can make a quick get away for lego avoid both right on the way out the door so I I think anything by door whether it's by the door that David writes lockers is kind of by the door that leads to the batting cage and to the clubhouse tunnel in the dugout so either that one of the one that goes ... next to the back room with the weight room in the kitchen and all the areas where players can hide those are those are the prime real estate [laughter]\nQuite tend to get to lockers it's a good deal real quick Tam I got like ten seconds can they seem to be competitive next year and compete for a division title yes if they make the right moves tone\nYes if they make the right move [laughter]\nThat is that they have to spend that sort of have to get like I said to really resented catcher and I think there will be competitive there'll be enough then absolutely Tampa Bay in Oakland look what they did this year he can't tell me the Mets can't do it if those small markets did\nNow in in Philly Atlanta they're going to be top we'll see what happens in Washington what Bryce Harper but even if he leaves Juan Soto a leaves them in a\nA pretty strong position but uh hey I thank you so much guys

W O R\nYour small businesses do Fox feels rated number one\nSeven ten W O R voice of New York\nSake let me give me one you've heard of ... to him he's the professor who was with a Brett Kavanaugh\nYeah all these now North Carolina state he put out a whole statements saying yeah he was drunk I saw a staggering from alcohol he got drunk was often belligerent an aggressive or\nAre you where are you going to read the statement from Kavanaugh's teenager who said that that's not true that he never saw cabinet ... are you gonna read that theory they know that was buried in the New York times story in case you know she didn't get that but you didn't read the jump no they put they put the conflicting testimony on a thirty seven but\nThe point is maybe it's entirely possible that he did blackout you know what I'll let them all reach the conclusions and ... and and it's fun my big concern and the more I thought about the more I got upset and so I don't think this guy has the temperament to be a Supreme\nCourt TV I this is this the other trope that that ... that is not like the mentally deny the allegations that are put out there to destroy him because he was angry about it now the Democrats BLM temperament ... been comical they say well we don't want someone who also bloodless on the court he can win no matter what he does lead we're not the rule\nYou people I came on the next morning and I've always my concern we even brought along with one of our ABC legal experts for a guy to come out and say this is all a democratic which on and it's the Clintons falls this guy's going to be an unbiased sober judge I don't I don't mean to bait\nIsrael democratic way on the bench in the Democratic which has ended and and the Democrats are trying to get pay back their both Clinton and Merrick Garland did you hear him go off the deep end\nMe tell you that I'm gonna start in eleven\nMature about pain [laughter]\nOh that was a man named Matt same added added on Saturday Night live right that was fairly funny but I'm ... I'm a serious note I have my reservations for him to to challenge the ... and other ... and other senators I I Do have my doubts about him but\nWe'll we'll stop him from getting on the bench I don't think so I think this time next week or he's going to be voted on the Supreme Court but\nI think that will always hangovers had whatever his name comes up Brett Kavanaugh you're going to think of a guy who claimed this was old Democrat and any decision he makes is going to be viewed through that prism of wait a second he's anti Democrat he's anti Clinton's and I and that's a big\nDeal big deal when you think I'm Claire Clarence Thomas you think of people carrying the coke can\nWrite great Republicans there Michael to be proud of wires and without a baseball player is Thomas is a ... is a terrific Supreme Court justice is absolutely no how come in just asking me questions why because he's thoughtful uh taking it all in before he makes five station fired\nHere's another thing that bothers me you know you're on about ... what is this guy these guys came out and they said yeah he blacked out\nOr in college you really don't have to say like that but he said he said he staggering around drunk blackouts now do you really think if this were true and we don't know if it is it's one guy saying that another person came out and contradicts them if there's a true now do you really think\nThat the way you behave in high school and college and you're drinking in high school in ... college shouldn't be held against you for the rest of your life if that is the case\nFolks if you're listening and you've got a kid you've got a teenager kitten college and they had a little trouble with alcohol tell them right now they have no career ahead of them tell them right now they're enemies will use that to destroy them and take your kid aside and say you have no future because you're screwed up in college that's the precedent that's being said here you've done yes okay by the time being okay\nUm I think as I said last week uh no I don't think behavior in high school was disqualify I Do believe that lying about it it's never the crime is the cover up you heard a Jeff Flake last night on sixty minutes he was asked\nIf judge Kavanaugh is shown to have lied to the committee some nations over the U.S [noise] type of thing\nSo it's not the crime is cover how are you going to prove this well you got one person who set it and you've got other people say we never thought they had that way you're just going to believe the people you know I Believe you know I'm just last\nWhat happens to politics anyway but if if he made the big case that no it's totally impossible I blacked out never happened and others like this uh ... you know wait a second or I think he did but what about the ones that\nCome forward and say we never saw him behave that way well what do you believe you can believe whoever you want a did you miss the show\nYeah [laughter] [laughter] oh here we go you're going to pile on go ahead Joe I figured let me put on\nMy shoulder pads alright go ... the whole thing is despicable as far as I'm concerned and you know what Lynn if if we looked into your life as closely as they looked in the capital you'd be a horrible person\nNo lens too boring for that none of them I thought I thought Kavanaugh was boring but if you look deep enough I mean do you go into like a ...

I'm Jeff Flake in the elevator being graded by a couple of women and then I couldn't tell what was going on with all the audio on in the studio\nAnd then later in the day it came out that there was going to be a week to lay the the uh what was your reaction while all this was going down you were there\nThe way it was a real dramatic or and guys and so I you know sitting in the room and it just there was this feeling like something's happening here we don't know what's going on but clearly I had been looking at like for two days to just absolutely miserable he was listening to forty this sustain a cabinet it looked like just\nJust torture on his face and a and so\nHe we saw him get up I saw him motion chickens and it was like\nYou you you know you're not quite clear what's going on but clearly stumped things going on and so they stay out of the room they're gone for quite a long time we know they didn't exit out the back and said this we eventually they're and they're they're in this anti room for about an hour and a half and then they even tell the story of\nYou know there were so many people back there from the committee at one point they even the two men like shove themselves into an old phone booth on but in that answer your phone so to talk further by themselves\nBut they contact interestingly they um they contacted a Rosenstein and ah and Chris Wray director or the FBI and the deputy attorney general and they you know that just like to to try to learn more about you know what\nWhat could happen in a week with an FBI investigation and I think flake was just there was so much overwhelming pressure and so many open questions that he thought\nFrom his reasonable friend Chris Coons who was basically begging for a week when he gave his speech you know look I'll just give you a week I Will agree to this um it's the right thing to do\nAnd here's the thing though that makes me cynical about the Democrats move so\nThey got what they wanted which is an FBI investigation but now what is the very first thing they say well the scope is wide enough it's being restricted ... what they want is just to find that anything any dirt on Kavanaugh because the ultimate goal on their part is to destroy him and prevent him from going to the court\nYeah it's interesting because I think two things can be true at once I think that you know that people who actually you know want an investigation on like a Chris Coons 'cause he's really not a hyper partisan at all you know this is what he is looking for in somebody like Jeff Flake and Susan Collins a moderate but you're right\nYou're absolutely right Democrats want to scuttle this nomination now\nYou know they are your questions about is about his truthfulness on that are coming out this is what Republicans feared you know a drip drip drip that could kill this nomination no matter what the FBI does so you know I think that absolutely you're right on this\nThis absolutely plays into Democrats wanting to scuttle this nomination we're so close to the mid term I mean that is you know they they're ... they're hoping that they take over both chambers of Congress and and then you know they won't really be dealing with a a SCOTUS nomination you know it's very important ...\nFrom President Trump at all they will have the ability to stop\nYeah so what do you think it's time to lose your Trish\nI think every eight I'm Talking to 'em says ah you know when we say well the I get the week there and they will tell you quickly up to a week up to ... they want it they want it shorter\nUm and so I think the only thing that could change that calculus I'm is if for some reason senators flake Collins Murkowski\nIf they are told in some fashion by the FBI that that the FBI as you know find a following leads they need a little more time that's about the only thing but then Republicans are going to have to figure out what do they do politically I'm ... and I hate hate saying that 'cause it's like\nThere are human beings involved in this um you know that aren't thinking about politics we'd like to think but but that happens so you know it is what it is and uh they have to figure out if it's if it\nIf they if they just tell the White House pull this nomination um this we can't do this or is this is truly a motivating turnout factor for their base because the base has been really a depressed\n... so if if you're going into the midterms and you're fighting for a nominee that might be a reason for people to turn out who might not have otherwise done so absolutely you know but you know they've got some seats they could actually flip in red states where Democrats are like Joe Manchin of West Virginia and he's he there's a lot of pressure on him to vote for Kavanaugh yeah\nYeah hey Trish or one of the more incendiary charges against Kavanaugh was made by Michael ... representing ... sweating it that he participated in gang rapes and spike punch is behind the scenes are the senators really taking ... and the sweating to charges that seriously\nOh boy if they could shows because it's so odd that stormy Daniels' lawyer like brings these charges they get the number of Iraqis I got from Democrats like good alert 'cause it's really the true oh really\nOh sure I mean if you could if you can imagine the worst person you know in terms of you know just ... you know bear substance of it all you do to bring forward ... allegations to be somebody like Michael ... I mean he just he loves we know he's going to run and\nTwenty twenty you know are we believe he is going to yes such political aspirations now he's a real bare knuckles drawl or and you know it just it takes a lot of the heat up but I'll tell you I think um you know Republicans are going to take these allegations seriously they're not um I\nI I thought in a really extraordinary move the Republican conference led by Mitch McConnell the majority leader they set out basically opposition research I'm under their own banner of Julie sweating ...\nSaying there's ... there's all these things that she's done where you know that make her less credible I was surprised at first before we run almost nearly as he could be confirmed\nI think over we would be starting into the process over the weekend it'll probably it'll look really similar to what it did last time so you know like will be will be voting on a you know maybe a procedural motions over next weekend and maybe he's confirmed by the early part of next week if they get their\nAlright truth Turner NBC News hour Kavanaugh correspondent I'm sure we'll be talking to you later in the week ... banks rush that way they are ... what a what a great place to pitch a tent and do drugs Michael Oh your back yard I guess\nWe're going to walk rated number\nOne seven and W.

elevator of course you can't have the audio up on the TV sets\nA and it turned out that he was being rated by these two women over the whole Kavanaugh deal and then later in the day they decided they have the one week FBI investigation now I saw somewhere\nAnd I forget what report that the FBI could really wrap it up today I mean it doesn't have to take a whole week it could take just a couple of days of just interviewing\nPeople they're not going to draw conclusions they will just present what they found out from interviewing witnesses to the Senate committee even though the Senate has already interview Kavanaugh and professor Ford\nWell uh everyone has something to say starting with the president in wheeling West Virginia I Will\nYou he has suffered meanness the anger\nTalking about Kavanaugh's you see the meanness\nThey don't care who they are [noise]\nWho\nWell and then there's this whole argument is come about over a first NBC reported it and then the the president denied it that the investigation was going to be limited in scope I'm not sure that's really happened I I I don't think so\nI don't the Democrats said the Democrats are going to criticize this investigation no matter what because they want it to be open ended they wanted to get it passed the midterms so that they think they can take back the Senate and then Trump will never be able to put
