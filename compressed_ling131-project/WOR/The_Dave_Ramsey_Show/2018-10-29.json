Pittsburgh Jewish Federation was in attendance at tonight's vigil the second and as many days\nOf cancer right where the surgeon operated\nAnd it's very likely that the surgeons spread the cancer right by the incision by them called Vic side while worry operative there is no cancer floating all over the place number one number to dismantle already had chemo he had chemotherapy two years ago they had chemotherapy two years ago the cancer Cambridge preparing back\nSo what sets aside I remember this man had\nColon cancer with parents who was missed the year before and ... he was found again that he had surgery then he had chemo and now they're cancers back well the point of that surgery and the chemo two years ago was to get rid of the cancer once and for all I mean that's the treatment that's the reason the cancer was localized get surgery had chemo\nPointed that treatment two years ago was to get rid of the cancer now their cancers come back\nAnd the chemo doctor wants to a more chemo and just for a member of the chemo did not work the last time because the goal that chemo was to cure the man and he's not cured the cancer came back and now with a recurrent cancer\nThis cancer is already seen that chemotherapy this cancer most likely already knows how to outsmart the chemo and cancer is alive dynamic process it's not something\nThat in the water like a brick or a hawk or a piece of steel it's changing the more chemotherapy give the cancer either it's cured quickly or the cancer\nMutates to resist the chemotherapy and most probably this ...\nTherapies and I couldn't work it's going to work less well than the first time and it didn't work very well the first time and then the the chemo doctor says well if he has a good response than what's on the surgeon and to cut it out that's exactly what they did last time a lot of work\nAnd then they came to the doctor said the cancers floating over the body but where where's this proof of that there's no proof of that there's only one\nSpot of cancer and that is next to where the surge and operated very likely spreading the cancer I examined the man is in great shape I looked at low as Kansas records of reporters blood test to answer those questions this is a perfect\nPatient for radio surgery it's why I brought radio surgery to America body radio surgery more than Twenty years ago because people are fed up and getting the same old treatment that's not working and this man came\nBecause he understands his life is at risk chemo doctor giving the same treatment as last time more chemo and more surgery most likely won't work\nAnd also surgery is harder to the second time because there's scarring and the Asians and the irritation that\nPresident after the first surgery and now the surgeon has to fight the same area where he was before chemo that was already given before with the cancer already knowing the chemo and most likely the cancers getting more and more aggressive\nAs you give more and more chemotherapy so to me radio surges an excellent option for this man it's noninvasive what is radio surgery\nWorlds pinpoint treatment that allows us to sending beams from thousands of angles invisible teams to attack the cancer this is the work we do this or that exactly why we brought body radio surgery here for you\nFor this man and I can tell you our success rate is Ninety percent it's very high certainly higher than the surgery which failed in this man certainly higher than the chemotherapy which\nFailed and this man archery but it's just a few treatments each treatment takes ten minutes we send an invisible beams how do we do we make a mold of the body we computerize the body\nFind the cancer refined the healthy tissues and then from thousands of angles like Star Wars we send in beams to attack the cancer and patient\nAnd his wife left I spoke to them I answered all the questions I never pushed anybody they can have the treatment I said if you go to a thousand doctors all most all the chemo doctors are gay became old probably for the rest of your life from today until the day you probably can't even walk in the door\nThat's what's often the case for stage for recurrent cancer people often get chemo for the rest of your life and plenty of people don't want that that on came up for the rest of their life or they know it came out does after month after month ... as long as they can take it and remember the cancer starts\nMutating resisting it and the cancer grows becomes more aggressive\nAnd then the worst possible thing happens which you know what that is so for this man we talk about all the options we spoke about surgery and radio surgery and radiation and chemo and no treatment and now he's decided I needed to Saudi over the weekend what he wants to do and\nHe's a very logical person his wife is very logical person and they hurt at all and whatever they decide at least they're fully informed and that's how we like\nOur patients to be fully

patient often comes back\nTo the patient dies and some cancers are more slow growing cancers are always growing because that's where the cancer does cancers Dotson around cancer grows and so Gleason made a scale of the scale is one to five in two separate areas so one is the best\nSlows cancer five was the worst in two separate areas so the two separate areas one plus one equals to is the best you can have and five plus five because ten the worst you can have the more aggressive cancers are more than six\nAnd to spend an aide said aggressive cancer by biopsy aggressive cancer by blood

number they were getting blood tests including cancer markers and then we'll give the patient all the information and give him all the choices about how to get\nBetter memory of the surgery the clause somebody's not work and he's on chemo and he's losing weight and it seems like with severe pain losing weight\nMost likely that came old slot work and you expect that usually chemo even if it works even if it works really works for a short time in general and then the cancer starts outsmarting the chemo and that's\nMost likely what's happening here so we're checking them out staging I'm I'm\nSeeing where the cancer is getting\nCancer markers and getting this last me fixed once and for all everybody went to the hospital where he works\nThan it was left like this really sad that we're talking about Seventy two year old man from Cuba is married with three kids they came with his granddaughter is added no carcinoma from the stomach so started in the stomach itself and spread all over

to one of those super duper big hospitals he's got a big ... him and his abdomen I examined him is gastric cancers stage for and we talked about non invasive treatment for him because the chemo was not working as a key most toxic and he's losing lots of ways and that's why we\nHave the most experience with radio surgery because there's so many people who are not getting good results with

cruel from\nOne point four to two point nine even though it's considered low his PSATs doubled he had a biopsy nine years ago he doesn't remember where it was ... so I saw him as a way to increase from two hundred and ten pounds turn thirty pounds I examined him he had a a\nSlightly allowed to cross state and the purpose of evaluating\nThis man is to see if he has prostate cancer so sometimes we see men with the essay that the law like this two point nine but you could still prostate cancer\nWith a PSA two or three or four there's no guarantee it's just that the rates the chance of cancers less Europeans say to you got about a Fifteen Percent chance he has saved three about twenty percent chance which is one in five it was five men\nWith the essays of three one of those men well prostate cancer and this man\nNumber one he's black and we know that one in six black men will get prostate cancer one and twenty three\nBlack men will die of prostate cancer Fannie as as PSA that's

Lieberman at two one two choices that to one to two four six four to three seven that to one to\nTwo four six four to three that\nProceeding was a paid program W allies airing of this program constitutes neither an endorsement of the products offered boy the ideas expressed several you are but you ask you a teacher in New York\nNew York state feels rated number one seven ten W O R voice of New York had\nIt is fifty one degrees at ten o'clock that evening on two thousand for the second night in a row of digital withheld and Pittsburgh to more than us off by a gunman who killed eleven people and left six others heard in a synagogue shooting\nIt doesn't seem like she's going to win\nBut the theory of many is why not stop it when it starts at the beginning because if you look at even though the school shootings and all the other acts of terror that had been going on the land though situation with the ... nightclub correct are\nYou there is a history of these rants on social media tied to these people went for five and six people very close to a state Senate candidate\nA in Queens or all posting such ... hate towards Jews and Israel damage something to be said for that not one since August has this woman ... even apologized about this or try to distance herself from these people I haven't\nSeen her called out by any of the mainstream media either so it's not something that is\nSo it it it's kind of a closed as powerful as it is social media platforms don't typically get a announcements or pronouncements on the traditional broadcast media\nBecause she that she is really not um\nShe's not supposed to be winning based on the latest polls John Lewis a bus or take the seeds very easily\nSo it's not really news that they want to pay attention to but now with everything going on we have to pay attention at the beginning stages and not let it go uh go on and on and drag until something happens like what happened this week\nOne eight hundred three two one zero seven ten or one eight hundred three two one zero seven ten pleased way and ah regarding any of these horrific events over the course of the week uh we have been talking about of course the shooting\nAt the synagogue outside of Pittsburgh and the uh male bombings the mail bombs that were sent\nA two fourteen high profile Democrats\nThis is I'm probably the worst news or in the shortest period of time that we've reported in quite a while [noise] generally speaking or you know we've had a whole proliferation of bad news over the last\nTwo years that have been quite frankly blamed on the\nNontraditional a president who's now sitting in the White House uh she tends to be sarcastic he tends to speak openly off the cuff he's certainly not a measured in some of the things he says a lot of times people who are\nFirst to take him down and use that as the reason they take 'em down while his ... his proponents point to his\nHis his he's a man of action he gets things done the ... economic great news the lower unemployment among blacks Hispanics women all of these things are great things that seem to somehow sometimes get lost in the you know in the in the\nIn the shuffle of all of this other stuff\nBut this other stuff is really from the grass roots of people that nobody knows first of all the a bomb or of the male bomber was an anti Trump us and he certainly was you know and you can't blame Trump for this and the other thing\nAnd he drove around in a band that announced it correct it was it was basically if you saw this man before the uh the FBI covered it all up it was full of you know basically you know is um you know all of his uh propaganda\nAnd it was openly driving around Florida there and no one else seemed to you know to to kind of give it a second glance until something like this happen\nThe person who played him ... knew of all of this and it's going all over a TV interviews talking about it but he was a good worker people it's time to wake up and it's time\nTo uh put these people in their place in and contact the authorities at the very beginning stages and it's also time for the major sell some media outlets to really cooperate with the government's on all levels local state and federal and I think\nThat you know we have seen the social media giants professed that they are free speech platforms we absolutely embrace them as free speech platforms we had many a debate on this very show about the fact\nThat we are not a proponent of government intervention and regulations of free speech however that's not to say that responsible people are in society using the platforms cannot\nBasically um engage in good citizenry ... that's what I Would call it responsible citizenry observing citizenry people who are aware of their surroundings if you see something\nDon't let political correctness or fear of uh of being branded this that or the other stop you from reporting what is obviously in any other a date in time in circumstance would have been something suspicious\nNow you see people looking the other way for fear of being called something\nWell listen to the situation that's a whole other topic that maybe when I come back next time you could talk about what the whistle blower is a lot of people don't want to be whistle blowers and a lot of areas because they end up getting a lot of retaliation especially in jobs that it's a tie to the government [noise]\nAnd then again we have we have you know those who are more than happy to use this as a reason to fuel the the the animal is in our society there are those who don't mind throwing\nGas on the fire so to speak\nI mean at this time I think that whether it's Maxine Waters whether it's Cory Booker whether it's um any of these very high profile leaders who have called for really um resistance and obstruction to tone it down\nWell I think everybody's in agreement with that\nI just want to go say one thing that came a correct\nIf you ask a lot of social media people like Pamela Geller what diamond in silk oil out of the other conservative I'm outspoken activists had that treated they're treated quite differently on social media and the more liberal or progressive uh activists\nWell they shut down if they are not found out and it's only reversed after they've been found out\nThrough the you know obviously the because they've gotten the attention of maybe Fox who's who's made diamond in silk really a a force to be reckoned with simply by having them appear on some of their regular programming otherwise no one would know that they had been shut down\nIt really you know there are those who who are advocating for them but that's some of the more high profile examples to what you're saying is some of the people with lower lower or profiles you would never know if they've been shut down you\nWill they write it they make a post but I see constantly and I know many of my friends including myself when someone didn't write and yet I've had a situation where people have called me all kinds of things that is so absurd and\nI too you know it's very very hot today with social media but if we learn anything from this week\nWebsites like a gab have to be shut down and people who keep following and spreading it have to be called that and punished also our education system has to be reevaluated everybody keeps talking about what's going on on college campuses\nStudents on adoption aided in elementary schools\nAnd people are getting to the point we're gonna have to start doing something in regards to parent accountability parents have to be responsible for their kids and know what's going on with them because many of these still up people that are bombers and an attackers\nHave a history and their parents know it and they don't do anything about it\nThat's a very good point a lot of parents these days because of their busy because they've um basically I'm\nAllowed the school systems to be to take charge of the upbringing of their kids have not even\nA\nThey haven't even are asked their kids how or what is going or being taught in school these days they take them\nOr they don't even ask the question was how did school out of school today I mean it used to be a time when that was a very typical question at the dinner table\nWell I recommend to every parent goatee school districts get every textbook\nGuardian schools you're paying the tax dollars whether or not you're the progressive or the conservative you're paying for that and ... private schools using the same textbooks is he getting them from your districts and your teachers are being trained in the same class\nIs learn what's going on in your students schools learned Baptist staff lab at the administration find out where they're taking students on trips and who were the guest speaker is\nIt's very important to see who's influencing because studies have shown that brain is set by students age in second grade and it takes them on the path so by the time they're on college campuses they're selling ... they lost\nPresident Trump having the foresight to maybe go after those\nYou know those Wisconsin nights and those Michigan Michigan ... and the Pennsylvania to really uh are the backbone of that constituents\nAnd turning those states blew speak to your point and because what you have to say is so important I'd asked that I Know you're I I think you're on the cell phone connection we keep we gave me a little bit of interference so when we got you into good\nUm when you're in a good place to stay right\nThere Mr Scaramucci cause was getting you were getting you in and out OK okay can you hear me better now right then would be perfect to stay in place like okay the that it will stay right where we are already well perfect\nYou I I actually did get a copy of the book and I have to tell everybody it's one of the easiest read it's funny\nAnd it really is ... ... if he ... he's a successful guy he could walk around like anybody he wants to be and yet he relates to everyone\nAnd that's what makes the book ... and that's what makes him so he wants he doesn't want to be ... is friends with everybody\nAll tour very nicely I tried to write it with a little bit of a set of voted to lobby it's self deprecating were you when you blow up like that you know there's a lot of stuff there's a lot of material they play off of yourself trust me but\nBut you know listen I talked about getting started as a kid like we're getting ... correct about building businesses I talked about a anxiety or going through the financial crisis somebody that will get Wall Street and then there I was accidentally source of the political situation and I\nTry to explain to people that unfortunately people that are in politics they think very differently\nAbout human relationships thing is people do you know they'd be viewed as a zero sum game so I wasn't a hundred\nPercent ready for that and uh eleven day PHD and these guys out there right now that's pretty well fortified it uh\nThat's the truth now you know one of the things I have tremendous respect um why I admire the writing style and the ... your approach to politics or Anthony is that you seem to be one of those people who\nCan tell it like it is even if it means sometimes casting a friend or a co worker in you know\nWho you you you basically have been among the first to not only support the president but call him out when you think\nHe digress is from what is best for him he's a newcomer to politics and I think that was one of the reasons he want people were looking for something different but as a newcomer to politics he doesn't always say the most politically correct thing\nI appreciate that but not\nEverybody always does you seem to be one of those people who can basically telling the truth and still be among his friends and I think that's an admirable diplomatic a strength of yours\nWhy you know I ... I I I I said in ... to my staff that set the fancy flat or in the whole either is really about selfish and self preservation you know if you\nWant to be loyal and you really want to help somebody that you really care about you have to tell them the truth oil cheated on his own way closer ... tickets in the and loyalty and so for me\nUm I Know the president feels that uh I have is that a huge ardent supporter but at the same time I'm going to sit there and everything that he's doing is perfect because how do you get better\nAs I pointed out of my book I have a ... myself so I didn't need me who are loyal to be to be honest with me as well so that I can make sure that I'm doing better than\nThe one that I hadn't really thought ... hidden is already ah because I was on the bill Maher show on a friday night the president caught it on many at the White House after all mean we connected in this morning and we were laughing about how trust\nThat show is being like a Yankee and ... and you're taking tremendous in accounting and then when you're making a point at least talk they interrupt you so he was like\nYou need to call me a ... puppy or this morning\nI ... the only President Trump can throw one yeah\nYeah you say that I mean the puppy so having to go on that show and it takes [noise] laughing about it so so but it but it was in that in a context\nOr ought to be there for a lot of support them on an ... also want to see if we can get the best pet to pull it off put myself for my friends is always a constructive piece of advice from somebody doesn't really cares\n\nYou know we keep talking about you with us from but they're also you are you in something in common with ... that we don't discuss much about it not just such a successful businessman and in the bucket he goes the way the stages in school you both Ivy League a college trained and educated and\nI mean you're brilliant at sky bridge and ... going around the world discussing business really isn't you know focused in enough to everybody wants to keep stories but you really could offer a lot through this and it kind of ... in a fun way off when the book\nWhy I appreciate I really tried to chronicle to trade history for the U.S I Want people to have an understanding of why we have this imbalance in trade why it's so important to pursue and executed agenda how that will each have rising living standards for people that we should care about because\nWe can fix the bottom part of the society fifty or the middle class or to the society or then the entire futures ours and so I I I think it's important that we explain that to people because sometimes the mainstream media tries to position the latest really accurate so I think it's important to all of us as well\nI've actually recommended the book to a lot of college graduates and a lot of people looking to change careers because he was somebody who knows how to take a negative and make a positive\nAnd which you know years to make something happen faster when you know better than most people anybody knows [laughter]\nI I I appreciate that immigrants are chapter unethical 'cause you know all the oil which is a metaphorical chapter it's a chapter about well I got all out after a learned is how do you handle yourself how do you deal with\nThe twelfth day and so for me I'm ... pretty good people some perspective and I and I tried to tell people that you're at your desk or your resilient and persistent that whole fault you're at your worst or whining and complaining the full weight of your personal victim but\nIt looks to me I Am very happy that it was able to do that\nI'm going to use that word victim who to segue into a conversation that I'm sure that\nYou know you ... weighed in on as we come into the midterms we've had two years pretty much of winding up from the left on who won the presidency and you know now it's come to an incredible had with tragedy or by way of these uh these pipe bombs being male to these high profile Democrats and of course\nThe earth against it in ... that are claimed eleven lives at the Pittsburgh\nA tree of life synagogue in\nRetrospect I'm Anthony do you think that this will be the turning point by which both sides who ratcheted down a bit I Know that we are always going to have the rhetoric\nBut the heightened rhetoric that has predated this upcoming midterm is really just off the charts do you think this is the time when both sides will take it down a notch\n[noise] unfortunately no I I actually don't think so I think that the uh you know there were five or six other horrific and viscerally tragic incident including the Parkland shooting a that well why would a fall on that and so you know this tragic or the\nThe anti Semitic can order of this I find to be even worse because at the end of the day you know if we don't protect the\nMinorities in our civilization I mean you think of it all the concepts of western liberty a lack of protection for minorities ... is the biggest travesty that we have in our in our nation is still so for me uh the the stuff is horrific\nUm but it's like it's got to get worse before it gets actually better and I don't understand what\nYou know why this particular episode\nWould necessarily be the one that would create the tipping point where people would say okay I mean they shot Steve ... says several other people are in the summer of two thousand seven day they Italy almost killed these elected officials who either are playing softball\nAnd no no problem let's take it up a notch all we've got five or six or a mass shootings going on in different areas of the country or in shopping malls or eight schools\nOkay maybe we can take it down a notch no and so you know maybe this will be the one where you have to explain to me why this fall when the war on 'em because unfortunately the footprint as existed over the last um three to four years\nYeah and I only ask you I guess ... you know\nAs aware observers really really down on the media and I think that you've actually um I don't think that I think that he's going to fare very well in the aftermath of all of this because people are smart\nWell today on Howard Kurtz this morning Fox News he says fancy Scaramucci this is number four oh five Oh yes from life every day and he loves to lie I mean why do you talk that way it's hurting Trump but besides that I Love your\nWhere here wrap it up though 'cause we've got another caller on the line that\nDon't want him to be negative and we've seen it four or five times now about the anti Semitism is despicable there's no Republican fighting back about ... of what happened in Pittsburgh\nGeorge so that's saying a Trump aide too because George Soros George Soros Hungarian born Jewish hate Israel his best friend is Linda sauce or American Muslim that once Israel destroyed she's running Alexandria Cortez\nCampaign ad a Andrew Gillum another\nAnti Semite the entire Democratic Party as anti Semitic\nOr on the record Nancy but I got to take the next caller\nCould contact me at my a Gmail account and we will follow this up because I write about this three to four times a week in multiple outlets so you're exactly the type of person that to be contacted me and we should be working together\nThey're calling let's go to Julie Kilian who is running as the lieutenant governor a second the second woman\nTo a governor mon Cherie or governor to be perhaps how are you doing I'm I'm great welcome to the show\nThank you very much for the first time\nWell thank you for joining us I Know Julie

them with the audience please\n[noise] out the people in New York are ready for change and\nYou know I didn't try to stay for five months and what what I see on the ground it's just not at all what every day and the newspaper and you know there's tremendous momentum and the state for change or it certainly is a lot of the national that that has you know maybe after the fact\nA ... in New York and then you've got to stay with it but at the fate\nA disc earlier this week with a ... a kind of opened up a flood gate for us we've been getting\nDozens and dozens of calls from people of all shapes and sizes are wanting to jump on or whether it's donors or people here people are really they're tired of our governor\nAnd they're ready for reform they just they kept on one thing that gets on they they don't they're tired of the nasty rhetoric and and you know people were so hard work so hard to take their tax dollars and then\nWhen they get wasted on it and people are just that\nPeople are just set up and lately I have a lot of momentum I'm very excited but if you are ... eight eight eight and nine days left a\nIt was very obvious and the debate above shell folly and ... who won\nDuring the ... mile an hour debate I ... I had um Governor Cuomo to Tim Kaine and the vice presidential debate he was angry he with tight yet he was fuss traded and he refused to let a mock even speak he kept\nHunting him off [noise]\nWell I think you know one thing I've seen when I've gone around the state has a lot of state workers that are really unhappy with and people that work for him and when you when you watch them and that you can see why because he just he thinks he knows everything see he he's arrogant that the tone of voice and and I've been saying for a long time that\nUh you know we need to change\nThe tone at the top and it\nAnd that if we can do that we can get change in just a different a different\nTone where we\nAre and three people in New York and break all the people that work for me or you know the lead in a good ... about the people there were a lot of politicians are president whether it's over and Connolly fly around the country and we have so many\nIssues here at home and you know I live outside of New York city in the issue um you know we're talking\nAbout some of the New York metro area is what people focus on how close it off of the problems in Iraq I matched by the kitty\nWell we'd love to talk about is loud we'd love to talk about this more with\nThe lines of ... so we've got to go to our next caller a you know Julie are I think that uh for the first time in many years this is not a this is going to be a horse race to the very end and uh you know I think that you're in large for our reason why so keep us posted and next week we're going to have a very special\nShow a pre a mid term show so I'm you know there's going to be in the headlines for the next two weeks at the very least tonight thank you for your call\nThank you Julie we're going to Bill Bill welcome to the show\nAnd thanks for taking my call I liked the preference it a God rest his soul to those poor people that were gunned down you know two quick things if I may all or religious institutions theater church or temple mosque whatever should have at least one number who has a concealed weapons permit\nAnd who was taking an active shooter course you\nKnow a lot of people would disagree with you I'm not one of them I think it's great um I think the local communities in which the synagogues and churches are are part of um should consider it a but they were just who disagree\nI'm Sorry this is considered in many synagogues and ... Jewish state schools so this happened to be a fluke and I think this is something that has to also remain private within each institution it doesn't have to be plot publicized everywhere\nAbsolutely that's another thing that we probably don't want to tell everybody to end that someone in every synagogues and churches aren't right\nRight definitely and one other thing if you noticed is that it's very Christine being an hot Florida sun for God Knows how long does know where on those details on a red flag it's gone by that is you know what I'm saying\nOh no I absolutely you're you're right on point but um continue you want to elaborate on that\nIt was in an isolated area a it looks like they're just getting out of the showroom uh it doesn't smell right and knowing what the FBI has gone to a good old polish\nWhy go to for an eye on the side of the FBI the higher ups because we know what they've been doing\nWell that goes without saying there is a major major distrust among the upper echelon in the agencies of the federal government and they did it of their own making\nAnd that's certainly a something that uh all of us can appreciate\n... we have that this as a whole discussion for when I come back in November eleventh\n[noise] so yeah you may want to call back and Bill thanks for your call we appreciate it well talk talk about people are fired up people fired up because of

eleven o'clock that evening I'm Suzanne leaders from around the country you're standing in solidarity with the victims of the deadly mass shootings at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh New York city Mayor Bill de Blasio uniting New Yorkers as the Jewish community mourns the tragic loss eleven people were killed in a synagogue\nYou know but if you start to learn how to treat like the banks do then it's amazing that all of a sudden you can start learning a skill that can make your money and not have to sit there and think about a second job or to get into a little bit later\nBut one of the ways I look at this and I get this analogy all the time when people are just simply trading one direction or they're waiting for the markets always go up it's like a car imagine that you were told you can get in a car tomorrow and you can drive somewhere but you can't put the car and reverse\nYou're going to go in a lot of circles eventually going to get there but you gonna wait 'til a lot of time energy and money getting to the same place if you simply had all the tools to get you there faster so a lot of what I'm seeing our students learning the first time is it they're becoming\nDirection ... they don't care if it goes up down or sideways as long as the markets are moving they can\nLearn how to make money and what a lot of them are seeing right now is they could create more freedom for themselves because they're able to make money no matter what the markets go\nYeah absolutely and I love I Love the analogy of the car there's so many so many other analogy that we could pull into this that in in I always say in real life outside of the are investing life in our normal everyday life\nThere's no way we buy a car that didn't go on a verse right but so many times we find ourselves in investments that only have one direction or one avenue where they can profit\nYou know this the same thing you go back to our you know go back to high school education and where was your stock picking class where it was how to balance a checkbook class right the law to check it out right I just dated myself victory over there but it is it's true though I mean we we really didn't have\nThat stuff and so we're left to to rely on the quote unquote professionals really guide us through this process\nWhere unfortunately they make a commission off of these transactions and I say unfortunately kind of tongue in cheek there because that's okay with me that they make a commission that's that's what they do for a living you know real estate brokers make a commission when they sell real estate so stockbrokers should naturally make a commission when they sell stocks but\nWhen we buy a home it is up to it was up to the individual to make sure that they are buying the right home for them in the right market place in the right area that the right payment the right everything it's up to the person to do it\nThe broker just completes the transaction and unfortunately it's up to the person to also make sure that they're making the appropriate decision when it comes to their investing but when it really boils down to about Ninety nine percent of the world hasn't ... they spend more time analyzing the menu when they go out to dinner than they do analyzing what investments to to select\nIt it just puts his behind the eight ball and it's something that I think if we did a quick give away with a few more of these passes we could probably make a dent in and help people start making better investment decision I think it's a great idea let's do it All right well right now I've got a

markets are going sideways we need to be generating income whether it's income for today or income for tomorrow in this segment we're going to spend a little bit more time talking about the income side of things but whether you're just tuning in\nMaybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come\nAnd learn a lot of our listeners like we're talking about are are are looking to replace their income with trading investing some are looking to upgrade their lifestyles with a little additional income\nAnd and you can even call it maybe that's that supplemental side that you were talking about a few minutes ago and and some are looking for this to go beyond that supplemental and be their primary source of income\nAnd I've even heard people say that they're number one goal is to be able to fire their boss now now whether they're going to or not you know being in that position where you can make that call you know that starts to be that primary source of income but what are some of the key things that you guys work with students who are looking to supplement or they're looking to even build this is a primary source of income that's a great\nQuestion right you know what I find with a lot of our students they first come into the academy thinking they want to make a lot of money when reality what they're looking for is freedom we've been doing this for over Twenty years we have over ... fifty thousand students now in the academy and what we find over and over again especially coming to this class\nIs that they are really looking for freedom as I mentioned that could be they want to leave a job they don't like they want to spend more time with their families\nThey really are looking to take a vacation make people now are so nervous about going on vacation because they'd lose their jobs if they even took a day or two officers were living in this constant stream of stress right now and what I'm finding is a lot of our students who come in thinking they want to make a lot of money\nIt's really about that freedom and it's funny I got him Adam was one of my students\nAnd he actually did just what you said he wanted to come in here he was miserable at work\nAnd he finally got to a point we could trade and actually go into his Boston say I have enough and I had enough think about that to be comfortable enough so if all this did right now is bring you one really profitable trade when it'll be worth just coming in and exploring the opportunities here\nAbsolutely just kind of chicken things out and seeing what it can do for you and that whenever we talk about the half day classes whenever we talk about anything even at the half the class we always talk about risk versus reward\nAnd really specifically when you ... back to the half day class you know that the classes are three hours long and see if you end up winning a a set of tickets to one of these you really investing three hours worth of your time and what if\nWhat if that three hours worth of your time was able to show you how you really could replace your income or how maybe you could raise your income by ... percentage so that you could have that financial freedom that Larry it was just talking about that's really\nKind of the key to all this and you know what you were touching on was was\nThe freedom side and and really those conversations go go fairly deep with ... with individuals one on one where you say you know what are you looking to accomplish as I go I Want to make an extra thousand bucks a month and that's a pretty quick conversation but then you say why\n... why do you want to make an extra thousand bucks and now that financial freedom conversation starts where you know you ... it's a it's a nice detailed process of well you know what my kids do this or I Want to do that and there's all these goals that they want to start accomplishing\nAnd part of what you need usually to accomplish those is a little more time one of the ways that helps you have a little more time is to have income coming from somewhere else having that supplemental\nSide of income you know where there's lots of different ways where we can build out the supplemental income it can be through a passive channel it could be through an active channel it can be through commodities it could be dropped as it could be their stocks\nBut one of the things about it is is we ... is one of these you always talk about I guess I should say there is is how multiple streams of income are are really kind of crucial throughout this whole process and you know the the average millionaire I think has has five or greater\nStreams of income and so when you think about like that\nThat is that those those pieces supplementing each other if one goes away it's really no big deal you just get strategic and you build out another one now it's also one of the reasons why the the word job Jay obese stands for just over broke because if we just have one stream of income and it goes away well we're we're in her city right\nWe're in stress city we're we're we're scrambling hopefully we got a little bit of savings to buy us little time but it ended up being that kind of that that that downward spiral or even just stuck in that rat race so to speak of well if we lose our job hopefully we have some savings we use our savings while we find another job and then we just getting another job and doesn't the cycle probably just continue\nWho are really out there trading they do have their retirement accounts and and when I talk to our students I'm hearing a lot of people say you know number one they either don't have enough money to retire on you know our number to those that do they're not quite sure really how to continue the growth\nAnd to protect the downside right and that's really that point you were getting at a before he took the break and so I'd love to give you kind of giving you the floor here to take that back over voter some of the things you and your instructor team are doing with investors to help make sure they have income for retirement\nRight and the number one mistake that most people may cause they think they can do this on their own then they wind up coming back and realizing they need the education so we start talking to our students about is how they can start\nCreating a strategy for success when it comes to the retirement right now you know it's funny when the market started to go down this week a lot of my friends call me and they started going what does this mean they started getting all nervous now one student\nEmailed me and said Larry do you see this is a bad thing in fact\nMost people who know what they're doing they're elated that this is starting to happen most people waiting ten years\nFor another market correction why because statistically the markets always tend to correct about every ten years or so last major when we had was obviously in two thousand eight here we are in two thousand Eighteen so what's now becoming more important than ever\nIs it took people about six years to recover from the last correction\nPeople out there listening if you don't have six years right now or you're planning to retire\nYou don't have anything saved right now you need to figure out how to create a plan\nTo help protect you and a lot of our students come in the door really nervous about I don't have enough money to start well you know what they're doing right it's pretty fascinating they're starting to learn how to trade other asset types like futures in St Louis and they're saving that money from trading and they're starting to fund their retirement accounts\nSo again a lot of people first thing they always say is like the mortgage I got the kids' college ...\nTheir retirement always comes last\nSo we start to teach her students read out the gate\nThat they can come up with a plan they understand most importantly what you are in need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement\nYou can't just do this you first have to figure out what your needs are learning how to manage that need most importantly how to learn some really important risk management and how to protect that money\nAnd then at the end of the day you'll have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else who's telling you what you need\nYeah and you're talking about the kind of the cycles that the markets go through the big ups and the big downs and we do generally have a crash about every and we call them crashes but we do generally have a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years\nAnd one of the things about that is if you go back and look at um how often they're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so kind of that average uh that we can expect is about fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight and you kind of measure that you got about a fifty percent drum Becky fifty eight percent about fifty eight percent you go back into their early to thousands fifty say the same thing\nAnd so if we come to here and we say OK here's here that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal\nThat the thing that I went through with my father about ah we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight\nOr you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about dropping accounts and and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account\nAnd they lost fifty thousand and they lost fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value is that fifty thousand that happened in one year\nHere that drop happened I think it was fourteen months total rights that happened in pretty much just a year it went down when they take the average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous and let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web that ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty\nTo take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires they one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we were talking about was how long does it take the average person to really even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan that don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and say to yourself fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nAlbert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again it's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves\nInstead of taking this big roller coaster ride and think about it Ryan going back to two thousand and eight if you knew when to get out of the market and locked in profit\nAnd then in two thousand nine you were sitting in cash it could have been one of the greatest time of your life right now so we had a three hundred percent increase since two thousand nine yet most people had no money because they lost it all in the correction\nYup absolutely one of the things we can do to help a few people really start to identify where to get in and where to get out where to protect where to grow as you get 'em out to one of the half day classes you ready for a little give away let's do it right now we've got a half the class coming up in your area and a half the cost of ... going to see exactly that how to generate more income how to keep that retirement account growing\nHow do I identify these turning points up down or sideways\nSo you'll know when to buy and you could know when to sell you could you could go back to the old know when to hold them know when to fold 'em type of the conversation on just a second you have a chance to win a set of passes or one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving\nRight now is a great time to pull over included with your passes is going to be our professional insiders kit that is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nThe professional insider kitten makes it so you get started right now ... through twenty we need you to call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up\nColors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nNow Larry I always I always said everybody when and I tried to say it on the show as much as I can have two dollars or two million dollars adapted classes where you really get to see exactly what it takes to really get that money working for you and you're talking about it earlier as far as having our money working smarter for us and that's just doing the right things with our money\nYou know we've always also been talking about the market's being at all time highs and the risks that we have in there and then my dentist office I bring this\nOf a lot on the show but it just it's so true inside of the financial markets that my Dennis off as a kid shout out to Dr are buckle there's a plaque on the wall and every examination room where it says\nFor don't worry about your teeth and they'll go away you know being that same situation here that unfortunately has been proven true time after time it's don't worry about your money don't worry about your retirement account and they'll go away\nYou know well let's just think about what people are doing right now in this moment we've been told that every two weeks is supposed to be investing in an Ira or some type of retirement plan which is great and then nothing against that\nBut what people are not paying attention to is where they're investing that money and for the last two years people investing all time highs and so think about it you're in an all time high\nWeek after week that's investing your money and all of a sudden the market corrects well that correction is going to impact the first amount of money or the last amount of money that you basically have invested into\nSo now you've put majority or money in the market the last two or three years when it's been higher and higher and it takes a tremendous fall and this is why we said it earlier the market falls three times fast and then it goes up\nAnd as a result people see that fifty percent evaporation of wealth and that immediate sea of seeing that freaks out now let's take it a step further\nWhen the market goes down that dramatically like it did in two thousand eight what's next the loss of jobs the four pictures and housing dividend cuts vivid and cut so all these things\nHave a greater impact than most people believe and yet there are people out there that continue every single day to roll the dice and take a chance and say this won't happen to me\nYeah there's a huge risk out there and that is a huge need for multiple streams of income and not just today but multiple streams of income throughout our life throughout every stage of our life\nTo create that stability and one of the things we can do to really help people get kind of jumped started ended his multiple streams of income lifestyle is to get them out to one of the half day classes we still got a few passes here we can give away let's do it right now we've got to have to class going up in your area they have their classes where you'll see exactly what it takes really keep that retirement account growing\nMake sure we have income for today income for tomorrow and really generating and focusing on building out those multiple streams of income when the second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes doing these half their classes switch phones ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pull over\nIncluding with your passes is going to be a professional insiders kitten other kids packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation ... capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now\nThe ... century twenty we need you to call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ...
