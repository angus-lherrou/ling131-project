{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "Really look too was too good either that or a second round pick was Christian accurate this past year and Seventeen the jeopardy caught the third and fourth round pick in that draft\nAnd I are various during the ... so these guys the jets drafted it or to fill those backup roles developmental project they just haven't and out and and so when you look at these issues that you see guys go down there to build the old I really as a testament to the airport dropping these last few years\nNow to those poor drafted they hurt and uh they certainly did this past Sunday is we chat with kind of use of the athletic\nUh one thing I Love the end the jets win against the Colts last week was how they're able to put up some points right before the half and they did allow Sam Donald to throw the ball down the field this past week or gets better soda and the time out usage and it was it was a mess right before that happened that spot Connor\n[noise] yeah and then it's kind of just become the norm of of ... is Ron here as coach I think the hot all the decent coach I Do I think he's he's very\nAverage I I think maybe but I mean we're we're here because you'll see I mean look his players love them he puts together game plans every now and then that that really ... factories opponent and any and you know the jets will pull away and dominate the game but in close games and games that are decided by a theories or two or three possession door play here or there\nWhich to some extent the Vikings game was because that was up at you know a ten point game up until late in the third quarter the fourth quarter ... it just seems like Todd makes a mistake or two here or there that really costs the team but yeah the time out\nOr not using the time out there at the end of the first asked is an example of that the uh the other example would be you're not challenging Robbie Anderson's reception and the first quarter or not challenging the decision that the weather the jets had a state court cousins or a couple of other one mixed in there as well and and again that Todd has reasons for why he did this if you talk to him\nHe can justify why he thought the way he did what you know it's somewhat positive because if you're not just outwardly making mistakes not\nKnowing what he's doing is basically doing these things but when you really analyze these decisions he's making whether he hasn't raised in it or not there the wrong calls and and at this point in ... tenure you kinda gotta wonder if you'd ever going to figure it out because it isn't your to your three to sit down here for you supposed to have the fact\nYou know and it was a ... not used at a time out before the end of the ...\nThey try to justify that one\nUh his his justification other we we heard it again on on a conference call this afternoon was that\nHe felt the jets was fined was forty two seconds and free time out when I pressed him on and then I said well Todd isn't a minute and twenty seconds better than forty seconds and he said you know we are happy with our decision so look I guess that he is stuck in his ways and he thinks he made the right call in fact he can't see it was the wrong one is a is alarming\nNow a timeout can only say forty seconds so uh I don't see why wouldn't they utilize it in that spot a\nNow we're talking about counter use of the athletic right now or another issue for the jets or has been it's been so long and his inability to snap it understands play with a dislocated finger\nBut uh ... what's the balance like the jets here as I Am sure they want to have some experience on the line but he has a number of problems that came off of that yesterday\n[noise] well it's it's it's kind of you know the the thing that Todd ... right now and the jets often that you're ... you're on the corner and toppled obviously the head coach gone and got to figure out right because you know I think what what isn't getting talked about enough is how important Spencer Long is to the ... point of view\nYou know send Arnold is a rookie they've kinda easy forget that I'm proudest but he has a Twenty one year old kid now only six seven stars enjoyed that it's all career so\n... what you had any to realize that there are things he has not being there are mistakes he's going to make their their all those kinds of of incidences of situations in issues\nAnd sometimes he needs a shoulder to lean on on the field and that Spencer Long a veterans that are a guy who has the things that I can help them make protection adjustment the guy who could point things out on the backside supply and helping diagnosed with the help to diagnose scheme and when you fall Spencer right now is dealing with the poor snaps because the finger\nIf you remove him and you put Jonathan Harris on the field or their backup center yeah you might be able to fix some of those low snaps you and the two or three high or low staff what you're going to miss the cerebral aspect it's been so long brings to the table so you know there are ... away right now is it's a lot of questions a lot of concern just going to have to go over in their mind because\nLike I said you know there really is no easy solution it away it's kind of a lose lose situation\nNow especially real good pass rushing to him to Chicago Bears on the schedule next week or for these New York jets we talked a little bit earlier about the the jets and eating a wide receiver being one of those spots mark Cooper gets moved today I wouldn't take the jets would pay up the price that the cowboys dead but\nUh what was he on their their radar at all is there any kind of trade that you could see that the jets looking into and these next few weeks\nThe jets made a call I mean they they called the raiders about 'em because they call every single player that's on the trailer Patrick Peters is on the trade lock ... by the government's going to call the cardinals and he's just going to say what would it cost ... Patrick Peterson\nCardinals are going to give them an answer and then he'll write it down in his little notebook and say okay Patrick Peterson cause an extra ... then he goes I eat that's why ... I'm telling you man he called every single team about every single player that on the tray block just if you can have his book keeping up to date and accurate\nUm but when you look across the thing that gets really aren't in too much of a position to make all of a legitimate realistic run or any of these guys because of the fact that they really don't\nHave the draft capital to move in and make one of these moves happen you know they they they only have a first round pick of this year's draft no second in that two thirds the theoretically they could steal one of those third but you know you're not going to get a guy like Marty Cooper Patrick Peterson no or to Marius Thomas for one of those third round picture gonna have to pay up a little bit more and for a jet skiing the bill\nAre not really a playoff contenders this year but a team that still rebuilding growing those draft assets are much more valuable to getting a player that's going to help them this year but also take a kind of a bite out of their their ability to improving the future\nAnd that makes sense and uh finally counter now is there is a ban yesterday I could not believe how many Vikings fans were there ...\nYeah I mean look that team's travel well and and right now you know it it's kind of a an interesting situation with a joke because yeah they have their quarterback but I'm not sure\nThat fans are totally bought in on this team being contender again I think they've got to do a little bit more get a little more exciting score a little more points than and start winning some more games where they really start regularly selling out that house you know they they did it against the the dolphins I mean that that place seats eighty five thousand I think and I was talking to one steady worker who said they were expected\nOr they were told to expect eighty two thousand so\nUh you know they they've gotten close to selling and now they're just not doing it consistently and I think a part of that has it with a factor right now they're just not winning regularly because once they do a they'll they'll be setting will be fun\nNot Connor used the athletic guy gets up kind of ... time tonight ... write a\nCounter use a covers the jets for the athletic and\nA given you a perspective on what happened there yesterday and you know takes the jets just aren't up to you know those are all ... teams around the league or that you know that this is the limitations that the jets do have where they could knock off the gold and the Broncos but\nUh you do see some of the issues that they still have and certainly the personnel they got to go out and get in some spots in order to\nUh be able to compete with the upper echelon but\nI on the positive side overall the season or they do you guys have confidence what Sam Donald is done when you consider his age he's lack of experience even in college uh you sound like it was a four year start or like a you know or Baker may feel started a ton of games in college seemed Arnold\nIt's been about a year and a half as a starter at USC so and he's got to get some wraps and and make some mistakes and I think you've seen\nImprovement from Darnell last year to this year\nOr in terms of reading defense is making the right throws and he still he throws a double covered sometimes get picked him one of those spots yesterday three interceptions overall in yesterday's last couple of those tests and drops by receivers\nUh but you know there are some things that Donald could certainly do better no doubt about things that he had gotten better at a when you look back on the tape and what he did at us see a ... I think yeah I feel good with Donald has done considering how young he is he's been a competent NFL quarterback to this point\nAre and what I Would like to see some more\nOf those glimpses of wall you know those kinds of moments and then a whole lot of wild moments yet with Sam Darnell down understand you know he's not a he's not necessarily Aaron Rodgers but\nI Want to see some those while throws while Reid's he had the one touched down driving the first half of the jets he had three perfect balls in a row perfect breeds and you want to see a lot more that\nAre going forward with a with Sam ... they are just glimpses but um you know he's certainly it looks like it'll be a solid NFL quarterback at the very least and\nCertainly with the ability to be a little bit more than just that uh tomorrow or remember we will have the world series fear on seven ten W O R coverage beginning at seven o'clock sports zone\n'em before them starting up at six o five but thanks to pat Leonard the New York daily news Scott Miller bleacher reporting con or use of the athletic\nUh for joining us today ...

I think we witness protection program\nSo far as I was ... debris listed nobody knows where she lives with her background Joe you're the news but what's your background\nNo clue [laughter] I've got a great Facebook message over the weekend you're wondering what I did I was really by a a social media ... they had a great name for you for me yeah they said how do you like working with that Michael weasel oh that that was a funny that clever\nReally quite hot that person than like you all areas you know why I Can't imagine why [laughter]\nI'll do a lot like I Know I don't know why it just didn't insults me in the morning I Want to tell you about the people who have you on my face so that was a funny that they didn't you know no one's never culture that before oh really oh I thought was funny I'm going to call you by ... nicknamed ... bourbon and Michael ... not for\nThe nickname people always uses for me is the retailer that's what they call me or regular the ... they called me the reason why I don't know that's what the editor and see the New York post you to call me the ... or so everybody at the post cause me to read blur what's the real are doing\nWell I think we use those much better ... exactly what are we going to do about the Saudis that is an excellent question land yeah uh I still believe we can't just be jettisoned\nOur alliance with the Saudis but uh I'm beginning to think\nThat the M. S. B. the crown prince Mohammed no I'm beginning to think he's got to go really really screwed this one up\nI'll tell you what really bothers me and you guys are going to disagree with this\nBut when the president comes out and says we have to protect the arms sales and all the money really\nSo money is going to count more than morality hundred billion dollars Oh absolutely I'm changing my whole too and on this or ... morality come if you don't stand for morality what the hell do you got a dog yeah let's pay into the almighty buck okay will suck up to the Saudis because we can sell them whether you're gonna catch so really that's really taking the moral high ground you're going to camp\nHundred billion dollar contract for one journalist\nPlease here's the other thing to learn a lot of people are drawing comparisons to the U.S pulling a support for the shah of Iran now because they didn't like what he was doing and look what happened\nGot toppled ... we look what happened exactly I don't like doing the uh quibbling see here of well we have to save the money so we're we're we're gonna kowtow did these people that's just morally wrong and I think we should be a much better nation and that so I think we should take money out of the equation and then decide where we can do about these people well Joe makes\nAn excellent point Lindsey if you can grasp it All right probably so [laughter] so in Saudi Arabia you have a very hard core is la make\nA group of people there who would like to get control of Saudi Arabia and turn it into a hotbed of jihadi radicalism in the Saudi family that has kept the that damper on that movement in their country in\nBensalem too I mean he's kind of liberalized sounded a little bit Mm me\nHope is you're ready to do what do you miss the show as well as our women to drive and they can go to the movies other than that he has ... did you see the list the is crackdown and all kinds of someone got what a thousand lashes for ... some of the\nPeople he cracked down on our current members of his own family who were who were looting the country now I'm not so sure he's not losing the country but I think he's really screwed up with this journalist here and I think the Saudis could repair the damage\nAnd move on with their alliance with the United states if that family tells the crown prince you got to step aside I think that's the only uh\nThat is the only way the question is should know who is the successor\n... thousand ... they've got other basic I Want to live with us as as a [laughter] I mean it was all of it what do you have a shortage of finding somebody to run the country\nNow than I Am so but I Do I Do think we have to do something you can't cancel a hundred billion dollar contract you can't just send the alliance but I Do think that the M. S. B. has got to go because\nI'm just going to be a repeat myself anyway 'cause that's what I Do better [laughter] I I think if you're going to take the moral high ground as a country you can't have the money as the motivating issue for a while you want to cancel that deal ... you're not listening to me Joe loose and you have\nTo take the moral high ground I think you have to take money out of the equation and then decide where you're going to take money out of the way how to do what are you guys were better than that as a country I mean I just do your mighty block right is that all the couch with you and one journalist what if you were the journalist\nWhat do you mean you can cancel a hundred billion over one journalist that's not just one journalist it's absolutely slaughtering an innocent because he dared to speak out against the kingdom that dead wrong is not what we stand for as\nA country I'm say you're going to cancel the contract that your position now cancelled that I'm not saying Chinese can move in and out the arms I didn't say that I'm saying I'm saying take it out of the equation let's not make our decisions based on a contract let's make our deserve based on what's right\nAnd I was writing is these people are bad people and we and we can't just ... to support them and prompt him up I'm Sorry it's not our job and it said to prop up the whole country and any bad actors\nIf you don't stop talking I'm gonna take a contract down on you All right yeah well you want to blow up your car park at at the met like stadium to watch a lot you're not going to

fend on seven than the wor\nMorning everybody sort of the worst weekend a land and I are trying to figure out what the heck are we going to do with the Saudis\nSo they admitted on friday that take a show either journalists yes did die and was killed at their embassy in ... bought the ruling family\nNBS no knowledge had nothing to do with it it was a rogue operation they've arrested Eighteen people Eighteen people sacked five others are trying to protect the crown prince trying to isolate him\nFrom this terrible killing of the journalists but unfortunately a lot of the guys who are arrested Len are part of his inner circle so there's just not credible to think that the crown prince had no clue what was going on inside the embassy\nOf Saudi foreign minister went on television he was ... bread bearer on Fox and he said you know it's just a tremendous mistake\nThat it was just a mistake that's right we have Fifteen guys show up at the country with ... ... just you know he fought back yes he's sick of fought back and he's like man this mistake like an action hero you know it had to lay there and the you know it's a you know makes it all OK though is because the king and the crown prince of called\nA ... son to apologize so they're sorry right okay now nothing to be nothing but ... where's the body just great mistake where he'll a guy by accident hoops he's dead what are we ... where's the by what what's\nTheories are we hearing about the by I saw a report where the body pieces of the body smuggled out of the embassy and given to a collaborator\nMight be disposed of body could be in the bottom of the Bosphorus right now but it was cut to pieces about why they had the ... ... when I was so that was all about they chop his fingers off and then decapitated according to the Turks embassy bugs so they heard it\nYou want to hear from the Saudi foreign minister Adele out Jubeir is his name and he was on with a bread Baron Fox\nWas an operation that was this was an operation we ended up leaving the reason was they had made a mistake when they kill you they tried to cover up for it\nYeah well what what their responsibilities this ... why would they they're exactly he's aligned well they want to kidnap him and bring it back to the kingdom but of course we're going to do with them once you come on health things a farce totally here's a little bit more of this uh this guy's spin in a way like a top\nDiscovered that he was killed in the conflict we don't know the terms of detail how we don't know where the money is the public prosecutors and a foot soldiers to detain Eighteen individual questioning and possibly facing trial\nYeah but ... video shows those Eighteen or what whatever Fifteen individuals' however they just showed up at a country by coincidence that day and left that day really in a private plane come a private plane that's not a robot now you know ... on the Turkish president vows to tell all tomorrow oh so this is going to be very interesting\nI must say the Turks have played this very crudely they took I hate to say I hate to sound but they took a story that when it first when it first came out we were sort of like some guy I've never heard of gotten murdered by the side as we know the Saudis are bad do do they do this stuff\nWho really cares about the way the Turks have leaked out the information with one more grisly details like the other caught the attention of the world media and we've been talking about this now for going on two weeks\nI Wonder fertile one actually has video or audio there's going to release tomorrow he vows to tell all tomorrow so I'm\n... I suspect he's got the audio because I'm sure they had the or Saudi Arabia embassy bugged\nNow buddy Peter came to Long Island congressman was on ABC's This week and a Peter had a lot to say\nThere's no way that one person basically an overweight civilian has to be killed is facing up to twelve or Fifteen professionals they could have brought him down and about ... seconds without causing any physical harm at all so obviously there was a Ted I Believe to kill them\nWell of course you know there's it's all be asked what he fought back really I don't ... I mean come on really\nTo provide very effective themselves as they are a a a bulwark against Iraq\nAnd they're having to working closely with Israel\nAll right so the painting the case for why we have to ah you know we want to come down too hard on these guys because of all the good that they do but come on and you got to do if I got to take strong measures you just ... you got to this is just unacceptable Michael\nWell you can't you can't up and the alliance alright and Saudi Arabia is the bulk work against a dangerous aggressive predatory Iran and that those are real and what a shame so we can't we just can't do away with the alliance but I'm beginning to think\nThat NBS if you can prove that he had direct knowledge of this which I suspect he did that the Saudi families got to push 'em aside install some other cousin in there\nWell I'm just to make it look good exactly it doesn't make it doesn't make the king them any less Savage no less you know a repressive of human rights but at least you know it makes it look good yes that they've done something lake when my moving aside the crown prince\nOr was not that simple but again what happened here was ... or we can go along with the cover story\nWell yeah absolutely but I'd love to know and then you know we had Peter King onto the ... grade on known as so what do you do what can you possibly do\nHave an opportunity now to show us what they have is important enough so this this is just beyond the fight between ... and the crown prince\nThere's something about ... turkey has to show is\nFacing civilizations coming together to find out what happened\nWell supposedly or to one's going to make is a big presentation tomorrow but\nUh uh I don't know Michael this is a this is obviously very funny I just don't want to see it all become mommy I don't want I don't want that to be determining factor wow we saw um arms so uh you know you\nKnow we should take the moral values I Want that I Wonder how your position on this do you think that Trump should cancelled the hundred billion dollar arms contract with Saudi Arabia because of his\nWhat if what if he suspended him what if he suspended until they get rid of the the crown prince or became some kind of stand\nUp not going to make much difference because the Saudis alternative the Russians and the Chinese and they'll get their weapons there and it was not going to have any impact on any impact on Saudi Arabia ... sure\nThat those other countries manufacture the weapons we do and not and I'm not sure they just want to buy in from the other countries\nArticle in the morning we'll be back with a new show tomorrow from then on seven ten W ho\nMorning and everyone stay warm I get a job with newscasts was thirty ... did you ride a bicycle worked\nFor them I did my little bicycle you're white ... what do you think it's ... and my five well yes I did ride my bike to work and it wasn't a little cold it was a Chris oh we're ... morning or good to know our big\nThree stories today the Saudis\nHave a brand new yarn Patel about what happened to the murder journalist is anyone buying it\nIn a few moments we're going to go live ... ... a fine of ABC News foreign correspondent Molly hunter yeah she'll give us the latest on what's going on there also in the big three the caravan\nContinues to Mexico toward the U.S maybe seven thousand strong we're gonna have a ... report from Mexico and later this morning as well Michael and rounding up the big three\nWell who's chicken now who's the ... New York state are going to have the latest poultry inventory on this one coming up uh later on as well hey I how much money we went over the weekend madly uh\nWe we all shipped in from ... the previous Tommy one fourteen bucks I'm now these are on the phone with the ... so I Can't get the get the cat\nI figured we'd want we would have heard over the weekend do you I think so well you know can you believe it's one point six billion dollars for a mega tomorrow night is obscene amount of money or what so nobody won\nNobody we won nothing I Believe zero yeah I watch the other day I I Know do I have to give you another ten bucks to are we keep entering into somebody wins in not us yeah well you might be out of it you don't have\nThose putting a gun all jumps if you keep pony up for this thing you've got no shot you're already going don't drawing so you're going to ... yes ... Rabbani out to add read\nYes Michael you have an opportunity when when one point six billion dollars and you won't don't we don't want you will because how far people have been a five\nWay say looks was fine but it was ten last week and then the other week is another ten and I got to put up another ten and then you have a ... going on to revive guy around here if something's going on around here that I don't understand\n[laughter] the lottery winner at one point ... billion for the Americans are on me and it's six hundred and forty billion for power boy is\nThey want to try to turn me and don't Ambler trying to get me engaged there's a lot of pressure on doing more\nThan what I'm really enjoying what if we all one and and you didn't\nKnow what happened it'd be very lowly here's this [laughter]\nMaybe only one left the latest Molly hunter Red Bull Molly good morning and the story\nIs just the no one's buying it on this side of the pond and the Turks are going to come out and give the real story tomorrow is that the word\nThat's the word the other word if I Want and on the office pool guys still\nWants to abolish got to be here by close of business to borrow taken Michael ... Michael spot\nYeah act that our\nI think right but that's just great this Saturday keep change your guys they're on their third version as far as we can tell so as you remember three weeks ago they told that yeah he walked out on his own and then over the weekend we got an official statement from the government and they said because show he died and if it's fake eyes the word that they actually use was brawl\nWhich suggests kind of obviously cue parties going at it I doubt that the official told ABC News that uh it wasn't a fist fight it was actually a physical alteration and then when Jamal custody tried to leave and men because he was trying to leave we put them in a chokehold and now with kill them\nSo Molly how is uh arrogant going to roll out this big announcement tomorrow\n[noise] well I think we have to see I mean I was so curious to what he says whether it's going to be like straight political or whether it's going to be kind of\nAccumulation and kind of a more if that kind of Turkish leaks that we have seen over the last three weeks because as we've talked about the Turks have leaked like crazy to the Turkish outlets and ... it is and to international outlets for the last twenty days and every little trip trip bit of information has\nSupported their claim that ... was lord and are brutally\nKilled a that his body was December and that the whole thing was premeditated and the fact that the Saudis\nAre saying basically it was an accident um air to one's gonna feel pressured to vote back up with his ... basically I think the last three weeks I'm but also clearly there's a reason they haven't\nJust come out with the hard evidence they haven't given us the good and so we'll see how anyone then whether he's going to go kind of a ... electric political tone or whether he's absolutely\nGoing to come out he's so frustrated with the Saudis that they had that stuff and he's going to come out and just read the riot act in a really interesting\nDo you think he's going to come out with audio and video tomorrow\n[noise] I mean it's been interesting watching the level and the taste of the week that the Turks have typically leaked clearly when they're getting frustrated me investigation when the days before secretary of state on ... visited Riyadh visited a Ankara we actually saw a slowing and leaks that are kind of arms right now it's as if that was that\nUh the Turks were getting what they want it or at least we're allowing the Saturday\nAnd to kind of got the end talking as closed door meetings that we know are going on at this point though it sounds like the Turks are really frustrated there hasn't been a deal behind closed doors clearly even at the truck about leverage\nAnd so my sense is that President aired on is is pretty unhappy we also know that aired on and Trump spoke last night uh and we'll see if that kind of sad impacts whatever one's going to say tomorrow\nOn the phone with ABC News correspondent Molly hunter in Istanbul now the crown prince and I guess his uh and and the king of Saudi Arabia they called to show your son to apologize to have any more details on those phone calls my\nShow it specifically from the ... we have to take a huge hit kick out of the huge grain of salt if the Saudis announced overnight that NBS and his father came to mind um cult sign and that they actually said you guys that the sun thanked them for the condolences\nBut twenty days later really you're just calling for condolences and then the fact that there was that even any kind of thank you from Jamal ... signed\nIs pretty unbelievable and we haven't heard yet though from a democracy ... center from the family whether that phone call actually happened in the eighties scene is can't concern whether that actually uh went to\nIt's the ...\n... am only CNN was trotting out some for this this morning they claim that there was a body double ... view that they were parading through the streets after the so called the incident or argument inside the consulate the are you aware of this a video of his body double\nThat so that's right so CNN added\nTurkish they have a cut out there that they say is exclusive a surveillance given to them by Turkish officials that shows just how premeditated this was the the way that the report goes an ABC News does not have the city I have not in the studio um and we can't confirm it\nBut the recording is that they actually had one of the hit squad\nDress in Jamal ... clothing\nLeaves the conflict by the back door and then they have surveillance video of him at the blue mosque which is one of the biggest tourist attractions here in Istanbul they have video of him at a restaurant and then they have video of him finally ditching ... quit now if if\nIf this is true and if this is real surveillance video at it would mean two things one Turks are really frustrated with the ... that are kind of even releasing this and kill that it would be pretty darn hard for that that is just say\nWe didn't plan to kill him because they even brought a guy who looks like him said that they could fake the fact that he walked out\nSo as this story becomes more and more unbelievable from the Saudis is there any pressure internally in Saudi Arabia how Mali for NBS to step aside\n[noise] [noise] [noise] well there's certainly been a lot of international pressure we've seen a number of US Congressman he got about ... as well um and we actually thought last week we were waiting to see what this study is that because there was a lot of discussion about\nMaybe that may be NDSU just gone too far maybe you know rounding up businessmen jailing female driving active it kidnapping and sitting prime minister was all fine but maybe killing a studies\nThat have been on

G. L. E. right not chilly yes so that's the one of the five things you should know about her is that the thing is I've never seen someone who doesn't have a ... some of the other five things you should\nDo about her but um\nWell one is the the fifth figure she faces an uphill battle [laughter]\nLess than ... than that but we can ... and she doesn't have a chance that the shell Farley ...\nNo us if you really want to know apparently a she's a finance is just financial experience because she was named finance chair for New York city\nBy the state Republican Party so very ago she uh she worked at UPS Capital and Goldman Sachs after graduating from Stanford with to engineering degrees take that\n... and ... degrees financial chairman for the Republican Party in New York in New York City wonder how much money she's race for that party\nNot a lot I was saying but anyway ... agreed to debate chele Farley but she's going to do with Thursday on WABC channel seven but only for thirty minutes a big thirty minute debate huh what would you really want to see a debate longer between these two it's going to be boring\nSo long to get their response to be you have thirty five seconds go round introduced them they walk out\n... seconds we're closing argument with\nYour outta here anyway Joe brand is annoying though and she she thinks she can be president are you kidding lose another one I see that's why the Democrats are hurting because you can take you can take her and you can take call mo he thinks he can be prone to lose you could take lives with Warren and as they don't have\nOne they don't you know now I was their best bet right now I agree and right now he's their best shot at it the Biden is in\nCase I have a cast for our audience from um please make a ... page for her forget went up for her by the end of the show I'm looking and she looks a little bit like Michael Jackson\nHole if you've ever heard of that she does it seem like Michael Jackson after the surge as well right now if anyone's ever heard of her give us a call ... organizers renting or even\nWith our ... morning show for a brand new my mom and my career in the morning tomorrow from six and seven Ben wor\nSomebody to me I Know the power of prostate cancer my uncle died of prostate cancer my step father died of prostate cancer prostate cancer can be devastating that's why I went to the doctor leaving\nFor ten years my chance was gone my sex life works my year in every life works I was able to avoid radical surgery and all the complications with Dr Lieberman's treatments my prognosis is great I'm happy that I went to the doctor lead them to be changed my life\nDo catch just for a brand new one burning Michael Riddle in the morning tomorrow from six to fend on seven then a couple of you or\nSeven thirty nine good morning a silly morning here in the big city we ask them for the commercial I mean whenever you're shell Farley give us a call and many calls we got zero zip oh that was\nEver and ever she's running for senator in the state of New Yorker I let's head to top ... Mexico that's we're Mac Gutman is embedded with the migrants were heading north he's ABC News chief national correspondent Matt Good morning what is the latest this morning\nOr late now you know from the Mexican federal police it they're still trying to decide and they haven't yet received orders about what to do with the thousands of migrants so Wade here in\nTown center of this town is dropping ... which is about twenty miles from the border with ... a barrel just waking up here I guess okay for the day and Mexican authorities still haven't decided whether they're going to a lot of progress forward\nAnd try to detain them and maybe send that to a detention migration cancer or\nTo let them just keep walking or what they are trying to do is avoid a physical class which on friday where are those police and like your point of tear gas and used the Taj and some people jumping off this bridge between Guatemala and Mexico into the river so they want to bet\nBut they still haven't made a decision about what to do these people\nWell ... what is the reason for their coming this way I mean surely they know they're not going to just be led into the United states\nAnd they probably do but I think I've learned is is that\nThey are willing to end your a tremendous amount of suffering I mean just yesterday and they've been doing this for a week or have watched five hundred miles but just yesterday they were twenty miles Harris schooling their kids like carrying them on their shoulders everything they have within their carrying on their backs including\nTheir children is um we were twenty miles\nIn the heat and the people were collapsing from it so whatever's behind them in doors has got to be a heck of a lot worse than what they're doing right now and what they face in the future so they're willing to try anything to try to get in the United states or maybe I think some of them will be content with just\nStaying in Mexico and getting some sort of a silent\nThe mainland we have found someone who knows\nWho's heard chele Farley and that is Joel in flushing should know yours at\nTel the owners the shell Farley is running for senator right against here's the Gillibrand just so you know and there was this is going to be some kind of a debate this week that's going to less than an entire half hour that primary and we said has anybody ever heard of show Farley and well Joel asked their good morning Joe\nI'm wanting to yes I certainly heard of shelf Farley and I I'm Laurie supportive of her I'm an Orthodox Jew\nAnd yet I'm sensitive to all Jewish issues but national issues of course as well and I tell you if you ask the audience please anybody naming accomplishment the Jew or Christian ... rent please call and you're guaranteed to get the same result zilch\nWhat do you like about ...\nShe's a what we call them manage a good person could sense of values she's articulate she wants to she wants to accomplish and do what's right and it's it's unfortunate you know we we live in a very blue state so she gets extremely low coverage as as the one who's a ... what's his name competing against\nMario Cuomo aren't narrow Joel you on her campaign you know her first of all I Do\nKnow I Know I've come to know her personally I'm not ... I'm not a politician very far from it but I made it my business to be active with her campaign because I'm happy to unseat Jill a brand and we have to put this very fine woman\nRight ... thanks show there's one as one she's got one going to be a hundred percent but the Paul I'm going to vote for it 'cause I Can't vote and then I usually vote Republican parents to to Joel myself where the\nOr the campaign committee to elect shell partly due of out of luck with that hey did you see this video I found this one over the weekend land this plane in Europe and counter is really high when so the pilot landed sideways wow\nOn the runway find words he float sit down and put the brakes on any mosque off the runway no well he ... he floats down sideways and then as soon as he comes the runway he then straight into the plane and it goes nose first to the end of the runway but it's\nA remarkable landing we have the video on our website seven ten W. O. R. dot com slash Lenin Michael so you check check out this a really impressive well a flying\nWe have another one there because uh a friday morning the California highway patrol uh and and and and uh this this plane is small plane lands on the freeway so you see it coming down right over the cars ... gone to the same direction\nLands on the freeway the cars kind of the spurs and the plane comes to a safe landing right on the freeway amongst all these cars it's the damn this piece of video it's right there with your other plane landing so we got doubled planes coming your way and our website just some crazy video you want to check out I had a friend who was in a plane crash and she slept through it\nThat's not possible she may have been out by drugs or what I don't know she was saying she says she was really tired fell asleep the plane took off she fell asleep she woke up\nShe looked out the window and a cow I was walking by the plane they made an emergency landing in a in a field in the mid west and\nThrough the plane crash well here's a story\nIn three media types never do how come Obama's ratings at this point in the uh with the midterms were forty five percent of approval rating right from says forty seven oh Romney's is bigger than Obama and you people in the mainstream media refused to point that out\nAnd it's a mainstream media pole and NBC News Wall Street journal wipe a poll putting up forty seven percent now the question is what does it need need for that a rising blue wave that Iran's talking about I think in many respects\nThat probably helps the Republicans I think this is a many ways a referendum on Trump to them in terms of not only is if his numbers are going up now you have to ... I I guess that's all economy driven mhm I Can't imagine I don't know\nI yes I'm sure it is yeah it's All right but boy the Democrats are going to be sorely disappointed if they don't want to have the house yeah Senate looks like an out of their reach but uh if they don't get the house I don't know what they're going to do they're going to go my my friends on the left are going to go absolutely in St because they want to impeach Trump going to be interesting\nOh so the mood was on at these Scaramucci mhm was on meet the press with Chuck Todd and he uh he suggesting that a a chief of staff John Kelly does not like the president very much really\nJust a civilian based job and I think he's tried to apply military like management style to go for civilians and so that doesn't necessarily work for the president even have a chief of staff given the way he likes to work [noise]\nI think he needs the cheapest stab but he needs and she was David really likes him and gets his personality you don't think John Kelly likes the president's team [laughter]\nI don't know well I don't I ... you may have an axe to grind to a little bit like Kelly pushed them out he got fired or exactly talked about Kelly's or is he fits on meet the press\nTo hurt the morale inside the place and he's he's hurt the president and he has his he fits you know he he left last week after the\nReport that he had with a ...\nGoing to have this big supposedly right a big shouting match sanity laced ... over towards the White House over border security wise moods just doesn't like Kelly for obvious reasons so he went after him\nI think that's probably true very quickly where do you stand on the New York times story about the Trump Administration getting rid of or you can be your own gender\nOh well I talked to transgender people I'm sure they're not in favor of it there and I gather you stand I stand with my translator\nThreats are friends okay when we come back we'll hash out the political stuff with ABC News political analyst Steve Roberts\nIs a really wanting to today's Len Burman and Michael lead all in the morning catch them live tomorrow from six built in on seven ten wor\nBerman and Michael real in the morning we'll be back with a new show tomorrow from things than I Am ... W ho\nPay good morning everybody started the work week I Hope it will be a productive\nWeek for you I Know a lend is all fired up and ready to go with all these exciting news stories we've got\nToday great stuff there's so much going on it's just amazing you think the news cycle there's ups and downs is only ups absolutely amazing\nWell leading off the big three the Saudis have admitted that they killed that poor journalists than ... bought their story is not really holding water because they say it was the result of a brawl now let me get this straight is a middle aged\nPortly journalist was able to bash back at Fifteen guys one with a bone saw to do and then I it sounds like Daniel Craig to me in a James Bond movie there you go and we're all her body and we actually use the body the body parts sadly also in the big three the caravan is headed our way seven thousand Guatemalans\nAll this talk about a blue wave was premature um it it's still possible that Democrats will squeak by and win a majority in\nThe house a particularly as I say because of the female vote in suburban districts that Wall Street journal poll does show or a nine point margin for Democrats over Republicans that's a nationwide a number of but there's no doubt that it's closer than it was just a few weeks ago\nThere's no doubt that Trump is succeeded in energizing a Republican base that was pretty lethargic\nAnd there's no doubt that Democrats are much more worried you look at in the wall Street Journal this morning Fred yanks a democratic pollster who conducted at all and he said instead of a blue wave is a rip tide of uncertainty ... uh and uh you will not hearing that from Democrats just a few weeks ago\nSteve let's say that Trump oppose this off and the Republicans control the house keep control the house but the Democrats than have to begin to assess where they are and maybe pulled back from going as far left as some of their candidates have been doing\n[noise] [noise] well there's going to be a lot of a second guessing a gnashing of teeth their um\n[noise] you know that there really is\nI think the story has been misreported there are very visible examples including right there in New York City including in Boston [noise]\nOf a a far less candidates upsetting establishment Democrats\nTo sitting house members but that's not the story and many other places the Democrats have nominated some very moderate mainstream candidates a number of them are have military background um they nominated of a lot of women in ... in in key races\nBut I don't think this party is lurking to the left but there are some very visible and active voices whether they're Bernie Sanders whether there'll is as far as um who are talking about a\nMoving the party for far to the left but there's no doubt\nThat that debate would become much more heated or there would be a lot of recriminations but this party has been full of recriminations for two years since the defeat of Hillary Clinton and um this will only get worse um\nIf they don't the if they'd only if they do not take the house of representatives I think the odds still favor them but boy they're much more nervous today than they were\nAll right jump ahead to twenty twenty as it stands today who's your democratic nominee who\nOpposed Donald Trump none of the above I think you're right [laughter]\nYou know the fact is that not a single one of those Democrats has emerged yet now at this stage of the race leading up to a to Z hasn't sixteen no one knew Hooper rock Hussein Obama was so um it it's not as if that this is unusual situation but there are so many Democrats out there including of course\nSenator Gillibrand's from New York who and Governor Cuomo both who dream and you know in their odd hours of of being the nominee of all the polls of course shows that the leading number the possibilities Joe Biden but Joe Biden that's almost entirely based on name recognition [noise] um and\nA history shows that that's the ...\nBasically that's the last kind of nominees you want to a ... like that you need to find a\nThis year's version of Bill Clinton or Barack Obama but certainly that has not that nobody has stepped forward yet\nAll right Steve Roberts ABC News political analyst he joined us every Monday at this time thanks a lot Steve\nSure anytime guys okay take our when we come back speaking of the looney laflin everywhere they're attacking more Republicans at dinner will tell you who they went after this time\n[noise] glad you're spending your evening with our replaying this morning show catches for a brand new Len Burman and Michael read all in the morning tomorrow from six to ten I'm seven ten W ...\nEnjoying this re winds up today is Len Burman and Michael real in the morning we'll be back with a new show tomorrow from six to ban on seven then wor seriously what is wrong with you I've never heard somebody is so exciting if they're having for dinner that oh I'm having a

get my stuff from and she makes delicious quiche and I bought a jalapeno key and I'm just looking forward to having a jalapeno quiche tonight with a green salad and um you know a ...\nAnd you wonder why people come and yell at others who are reading I mean I Would come by your house to start yelling why I don't know it's just one with\nThe one who goes around bragging if they're having really I felt Nineteen Seventy really real any you know my mom used to make the short haired girl friends used to come over for cards ... it's a key should still wish is\nIt's a delicious meal very satisfying I agree I liked he said it is it is a complete meal and apply it straight I it's I\nOften think about what I'm going to have for dinner and I was just musing out loud land when you're like tea sets the gas voter\nYou ever it's when you when you eat good food and the what's the other thing you know little about ... meet the ... the oil you know talking\nAbout Seventy five do once you have to do with your keys and have a nice bottle of ... to say or balloon done not meant to say it's only through all of its ma too sick to seventies All right so so you're of course you teases the looney left yeah is it why do you why so that was the looney left why isn't ever the crock pot conservatives\nBecause the crackpot conservatives are not disrupting Democrats dinners the way the looney laugh is disrupting Republicans dinners Mitch McConnell who's entitled to have dinner with his charming wife Elaine Chao our transportation secretary which I'm sure you did not know they were um\nI Know I was too busy eating by key show\nThey were having some rice and beans that Havana Roomba and Louisville who knew they had a Cuban restaurant\nLouis human rights and gay nearby that would be great food have ... if I was going to have Cuban food I go out to yeah\nThey were enjoying private time together when the cookie crazy left wing nut jobs out there came up to their table and said why don't you get out of here well I don't have the entire country a male yelled\nBy the\nWay I hate to admit this but I totally agree with you I mean is absolute nonsense stuff like when they were yelling Sarah Sanders at the red and blue hand or whatever it was in Virginia that's not right I mean it really isn't right\nWhere the security guards that can take they take those people down\nI don't know you you would think that would have its own security maybe doesn't travel within Louisville I don't know ... he looks like Kobe the turtle from and what was his well that's that's maybe that that deserves to be ... not because he's just happy right back into\n... so if you're on the looney left and you're listening to us looney left leave those Republicans alone don't go up to a poor old um shell Farley
