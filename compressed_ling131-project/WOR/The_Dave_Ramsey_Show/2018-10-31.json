{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "This is particularly true in baseball [noise]\nWe have a lot of work to do in the coming days and weeks to build a championship roster and to put a good process in place for good decision making [noise]\nBut I Want to assure all met fans that every person this organization will be fearless and relentless pursuit of greatness\nEveryone we working together in this effort\nThat will include players scouts coaches and the front office\nWe'll start with our major league roster where we already have some of the most talented players and the game we wouldn't phew new talent to the roster to supplement what is already in place and the foundation that we have\nWe will be creative as Jeff said we'll be collaborative and we will be proactive\n[noise]\nWe will invest in our scouting department will invest in our player development\nOur health and wellness and our analytics\nNone of these investments will be mutually exclusive from the other\nAll will be priorities [noise]\nThroughout my career I've come to understand that character and make a\nCritical keys to success\nI intend to make character the backdrop of this organization\nWe will identify it [noise]\nWe will develop it and we will build around [noise]\nThem before I turn it over you I think there's probably a few people I Want to ask me questions\nI Want to leave leave you with one simple but important mission statement that I have\nWe will win now as Jeff said we will win in the future\nWe're going to develop a winning culture and winning mindset and we will deliver the city and its fan base the team that can be proud of\nThank you thank you Brody at this time ah will open it up for a Q A session again for our audience at home please or when you raise your hand identify your name and your affiliation uh prior to your question with that will open it up Steve\nSteve jobes us in why a ... I'm just curious how long has this been a goal of yours have you thought about becoming a general manager for a while now or is it an idea that the Jeff infrared brought to you and you started to dig in and and feel like it was the right path\nWell like like many people I grew up playing baseball and the dream of working in baseball was was clearly a something that that was exciting in in something that you didn't know if it could become a ... reality um when my plane days finished I set out on a career in professional sports\nReally with one goal is to try to make a positive impact on it and so my ambition has been that ever since I entered the baseball world um and the opportunity to do it for players for for the last Eighteen years has been something I've taken a tremendous amount of pride in\nBut uh I think that it's a it's an exciting time to now be able to impact the game\nIn a different way and now be in a position where I'm trying to win China when for for players and trying to win for an organization where where you get judged by your wins and losses\nBritish in the middle [noise] Brody\nProspect W NBC TV you said in July the ... to either treat ... or give them a contract now that you are the Mets how will you handled the grounds contract situation sure\nDidn't expect that question today [noise]\nSo so Jacob decorum clearly has established himself as the best pitcher in baseball now hopefully in in a couple of weeks he'll be awarded with the with that trophy or you know as I said earlier I think that uh you want to try to identify the best players and you want to keep them for as long as possible\nAnd if our vision direction does not intend to include day long sustainable winning team then you have to consider moving players but make no mistake I Believe Jacob dramas is an incredible talent and I hope to keep them for a long time\n[noise] volley on the left\n... from uh New York daily news I'm back on the ... did you discuss your um your possibility of coming over here with ... and the garden and so what was their reaction to it\nAnd yes they did and in some of the other clients clients as well um I think to a man not only with their Mets clients but but also to clients around around the game there was a tremendous amount of enthusiasm a tremendous amount of support and and I think a a belief that I may be able to bring some fresh perspectives to the to the teams that\nPart and quick follow up to that I'm considering the nature of your relationship especially with those two players and the fact they haven't had their big free agent contracts yet do you think you might have to recuse yourself when it comes time to negotiate those\n... what what let me answer that because I I had conversations with commissioners commissioner's office L O R D and Tony Clark directly and we have provisions in Brody contract to to deal with any conflicts of interest a bridge between are used to be on radio trading\nDeadline and one of the meetings are going to be in a much different position than you were as a major you'll be making those calls in trying to get people to make trades and signed contracts brings all you're on the other end of it does that give you an actual advantage in being in those times over\nJournal management weren't on the other side of it\nI wouldn't want to ah want to say I have an advantage over over people that have more experience than I Do but but I think I've insights I think I understand a clearly what players motivations are and what agents are trying to accomplish um and I certainly have insight into how all of the other teams offering um I think what I've\nHad the benefit of is I I've helped tried to help a number of teams accomplish their goals and I have a pretty good understanding of what they want to accomplish on a on a year by year basis is they're constructing the rosters so I I Do think that I have a unique perspective that I Hope to bring to\nBring up the conversation came in the middle [noise] Tim from Newsday [noise] just curious what your understanding of ownership ... degree of involvement is in baseball operations for shipping general or this ownership is ownership and this in your new situation\nWell as as Jeff indicated before I I certainly hope that there is a collaborative approach um every good organization that I've worked for has had a culture of collaboration that's one that I that I value um I mentioned that to both Fred and Jeff when we were going through this process that I Want them to be involved and and the truth of the matter is if they are not as bad ownership\nJames [noise]\nCame to New York times uh Bertie just the idea that you're on you for all those years you're on that side of the ocean table and um you know might have a rivalry with say other agents and say other GM's and that way but now that you're on this side like how will you manage those relationships and how you deal with them\nFor sure well I think on a ten thousand foot level I've always believed that players in teams need foreign partnerships and if they do then you find a recipe for success\nUm I also know that agents have certain reputations and maybe rightfully so uh but\nThe goal should be to put players in a position to succeed uh and I think if agents take that approach you know we as now say we we as it as teams want to try to find the right fit the right to the right formula for success and I think that uh and the agents will embrace the fact that we may be an opportunity and landing spot for great players\nDave on the left a dateline in Newsday I guess this goes to both you guys\n... you talked to a lot of a lot of investments you know for this team you know whether it's players whether it's scouting resources whether it's analytical for votes you guys this signal kind of a new investment in a new kind of beefing up for the Mets with new front office personnel and and a lot of new personnel to help and those departments as well as investing in players to\nI'll let you answer on a new or not but uh we certainly have money put aside we heard it from all of the candidates are that they wanted the beef up certain areas and what they heard some of it was writing someone was wrong from what the media is put out there but we do have money put aside to to make sure we have a the race\nOf course was there for investments in the front office and shouting development as well as a analytics\nAnd ... and they made that clear to me through the process of not only are there resources but I think there's real capabilities that exists in this organization already and my goal is to bolster and on top of it might also on the left [noise]\nMike's Patrick Associated Press just cause for Jeff I'm One of the things with raised eyebrows about this higher was that\nThere are a front offices all over the major leagues with you know seemingly very qualified experienced people to come into a role like this why go for you guys why go in this direction something so different what ... what about it as attracted you to it\nI I think what Brody brought and I'm not saying that anybody else lost but a Brody was the front runner for us because of what he talked about in terms of cooperation has excitement his feeling of what he could do with this organization where we are now and going forward\nUm and we had\nForty some on candidates that we've talked about and went through and going through the entire process of this was what we would be best for your organization going forward I realize is out of the box and I said we're going to be out of the box the start and this this was true we where we thought we could\nYou know but and the money's in your name remember that we just wrote on the outside of the file mission trip it's your money so there's going to help him do whatever but I sort of more than enough in there we'll just do some of the house you can monitor it as you go along and not let it get out of control if it's a little short you can add to it\nIf it's a little over you can uh skim off of it throw it at the house throw it at the house throwing up the house\nBut you're just ear marking it you're just giving it a name or unintentional name and that way that you don't have this vague\nMutual funds sitting up there and you forgot what it is she just right across the top of it but that's what it's for Alexander is with us in Philadelphia Hi Alexander how are you\nA Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nA question for you so my wife and I have one child and for their profits were actively trying to have another and then next year wonderful yeah thank you so the plan would be one baby is born my wife would stay home for a year or two not work mhm\nAnd then potentially go back to work after that mhm [noise] so in terms of the day we have left we just pay off our car yesterday great which is which is a great thing yeah so we're debt free up their house and our student loans [laughter] we have forty nine thousand in student loans\nAnd between the two of us right now we're pulling in a pretty good income or we're at a hundred and Seventy six annually what she may she makes one of five\nBoat okay so that's going to be ahead but that morning it but I get well I mean this uh can you live on your income if she comes home up there was no student loan\nOr yes okay let's get rid of the student loan and get rid of her to come home and live on your income\nAnd we shouldn't should we hold back more of a reserve no in terms of no 'cause we're gonna live on your income does get down to live on it yeah\nAnd you know first they get student loan to understood next things get to stay with your baby steps get your emergency fund on [noise] and um you know but if you can't live on your income and you're going to burn through savings as a result of her coming home we got to rethink how we're doing this\nRight right I don't want to build up of savings that I plan to subsidize my lifestyle with right I Want my lifestyle down to fit my game plan\nUnderstood better than the good and say the good news is once you start thinking about that why start living on your income now and then where he's up all of her income to accomplish a whole bunch of goals before by becomes right\nLike knock that student loan debt out finished emergency fund

Noreen by asked that but that's that's my view on it um and of course my opinion is always worth what you pay for it but ah it just seems to me if you had a\nBusiness reason for being that was different than your personal reasons for being\nOr was not somehow connected it would be income grew it really does that make sense absolutely I mean it would be at cross purposes with each other if they weren't somehow running can ruin or parallel or subset or something but ... the way I visualize what the easiest for me a subset\nThat make sense it does thank you very much thanks for stopping

two years ago my family was there and you're lobby and we did a debt free screen and a and then I feel like we've really been able to you know a clear outfit opened up for our income has doubled in and out of really positive spiritual or you know direction sort of opened up to us\nUm and those are you know that those things but we really thought it was sort of a recovered opening up because we are starting to do things right and really what I see now is that he was preparing to throw it was what was about to come which is that we have a we have three boys the youngest is ten months [noise]\nAnd ah our youngest has Down syndrome and so uh right now we're actually coordinating the legacy journey class at our church and we're just getting to the post\nUm ending up with a you know six thousand square foot home owing only four twenty happy and and also the valley of the home at that time what would be somewhere in the upper nine hundred to a million dollars\nOr what is the ah typical home so for ... and within a two or three block area of your house\nAbout the typical home and there's not really a typical home in our area it's all over the place because the tourist proper either\n[noise] you know Fifteen hundred square foot home and then there's also three million dollar homes across the street so outcome from my home is about four four pan for twenty\nYeah that one when I was asking I was trying to determine if you're trying to over build the neighborhood it doesn't sound like a no causes scenario not an area that's got this wide diverse\nA price range\nAnd that doesn't mean it goes I don't want you get building nine hundred thousand dollar home on a six hundred thousand dollar street\nRight yeah and I couldn't get out and we do have a to point three million dollar home just right around the corner and then there's an eight hundred and Seventy catty corner to where I Am at you know when does the baby ... baby will do in the end of January\nOkay well sure when it started before then\n[laughter] no no we're or have you go I'm playing\nHave you got some plans for our own yet\n[laughter] yeah I I've been working on that with an architect um were were you know running around or or we want to do but or just um you know I've never spoken with any expert about this and I'm not sure if this\nWas a building you know I mean there's two or three factors one is um you don't want to rebuild the neighborhood we address that too is you want to seek in your family handle you know construction noise\nFor a whatever time it takes you to put this thing up shouldn't be Ninety day project may be so two or three months can they put up with that well they ought to be able to ... that's what we're going to do 'cause moving is more disruptive\nThan that\nBy and this project that we are considering doing just because of the the industry that I man or thinking of you know it's more like a fix one project so I mean we're we're considering adding almost four thousand square feet to the home\nOh wow you're just almost rebuilding another home\nWe had to basically tripling the size of the home now you know\nUh so you're going to end up mortgage when you're done then\nWhy a bigger mortgage or maybe I think we're gonna end up somewhere and the four twenty four thirty\nAnd what's your house I am\nHousehold income my my wife makes about ... about fifty\nFive to six grand a month and I'm self employed so very that can go from ... last year last year we were I was somewhere in the two twenty area\nOkay what are you going to worry about her income and you can afford a mortgage on a Fifteen year fixed when you're done but basically what you're going to be doing here is getting a construction\nLoan and then you're going to um reset the construction alone in a permanent mortgage just almost like you're building a house correct and\nYou can email you when you're done you need a fully you need a regular\nFifteen year fixed rate mortgage where the payment is no more than a fourth of your take home pay and if that's where you're going to end up and you've got a process to get there then yes I Would do that um I don't see any problem with it it's just a massive project on your living next door to it um yeah that probably is going to take six months um\nMost of the time when I think of an addition I don't think about four thousand ... four thousand square foot addition to a Nineteen hundred square foot house to gender is with us in tech\nAna Hi ginger how are you I'm doing All right good how can I help you\nDon't want to know in my husband and I we have work constantly are quite a while ... and we finally paid off our market here on our cars everything everything we own high are great you know we have so much I'm\nStill working that we are we have been trying I thought OK charity ... are a ... a year and me I'm a ... year next mhm and I think now we have them play well now last night we had been saying all that\nAnd it died last night she can I get hit by we had been putting our income that we weren't at\nInfighting living off of the security okay my question to you and when are we trying it or I ...

Want to read it at our cars though I don't know if we take a train you\nOwe shallow wanting to get a loan from the bank [noise] bother car right ... ...\n[noise]\nWell I mean there's two there's two things that poll heroin one is she's grown person and you know we don't tell her grown kids what to do with merely try to influence them but the other the other thing that's a pool is is what I'd do something\nTo what I participate in an activity was one of my children that I thought was bringing them harm even if they're grown and the answer to that would be no\nAnd you are working to get out of your son is working to get out of that you\nGuys are made the decision that being in debt on cars on the other thing is is a bad idea it's not good for your finances and to turn around put her in debt or participate in activity\nIs on an act of love and so um I appreciate her sentiment that she's standing on her own and she can do whatever she wants she's right but as your mom if I'm Ninety and you're eighty five\nAnd you're and you're Seventy or whatever I I'm Still going to love you and I'm Still not going to participate in an activity that's bringing your arm\nMhm I Love you too much to do that and ah and if you don't understand that I you know you have the right\nTo be mad or you have the right to think that I'm outlined but I'm just cannot in good conscience participate in an activity that's not good for you I Love you\nKnow I wouldn't sell it to her okay\nIf I were in power in your shoes I'm just thinking through how I Would I've got grown kids and one of them came to me and said you know I Want to do this thing and you're going to participate in those things that that that I don't agree with and that I don't think is good without good for them that I'm not going to do it they should buy or five thousand dollar carpet cash for it\nYou know how much debt do you have not counting your home\nI mean we have a hundred dollars and then what is your house or one eighty\nAnd casual how quickly are you going to have a hundred thousand paid to using\n[noise] or looking at two years notch\nBad as long as there should be ... fifty a year making one eighties not exactly the beat deeply sacrificing I'm now given all of those numbers four thousand dollars doesn't matter much\nYou could just show or the car for four or five thousand okay and not\nYou know but no I won't sell it to you where you go into debt I'm not going to participate in that activity okay\nBut if you want to sell it to ... and just help her um because the four thousand dollars doesn't move the needle much an out of a hundred you follow me or what moves in a lot of a hundred is you're getting really emotional about deeply sacrificing and using the huge income you have declared this debt really really fast\nSo given those numbers I might give up you know some of my value in the car or you got to scrape together five hundred and you pay me cash five thousand you're going to have the car I might do that but hunting I Am not going to participate you going into bad\nYou're going to have if you're gonna do that you're going to do it somewhere else 'cause I Love you too much to participate in something that brings harm to you\nAnd that's even if my kids are grown and that's not me interfering in their life and that's not me being a control freak\nI'm not going to participate in anything that I don't think is good for you that brings you harm because I care about you and if they can't get that statement than they are option that little rebellious ...\nSeriously I mean that's just I mean if they can't hear love coming from you that way then there's something wrong but I in your case what the numbers on my if you don't want to show to him cheap that's okay too but he didn't want is fine with me but no going into debt is not an option Amy is with us from Spokane, Washington Hi Amy how are you\nGood Hi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] well I've been listening to you for a couple of weeks and all but then I started filling out college applications with my daughter my son's already in college and\nRight now I'm just like how did we get him in so much debt already he's in two years\nThat he started his second year of school and um my daughter was like I said in the fall but he already has um like ten thousand dollars and a and school loans and then we have fourteen thousand an apparent pie phone [noise]\nAnd so I'm just struggling and know how do I get through this thing how do I get them through college\nWhere is he in school\nAh Washington state university\nAnd cutting your motives the tuition\n[noise] ah about well the first year it twenty seven year old ... it is um [noise] around [noise] I Can't even think\nTwelve eight and ... twelve thousand okay tough that probably pretty close ...\nBut it should be about there in state tuition at school something like that the national average is about ten but I think Washington's a little bit higher okay and so um that's the tuition only and he's living away from home on campus you\nKnow he's not living on campus you know the thing in the house trade paying very minimal for rent\n[noise] okay that's good news okay working\nYeah he works about twenty five hours per week right now but it does make about fourteen dollars an hour\nThat's decent okay good good okay and we got to get him on a really really tight budget immunity to be applying for scholarships left and right yeah you guys helped him sit down and figure out what you can contribute\nTo the equation she'll between his hard work between the scholarships and you can your contribution and the fact that he's in a reasonably inexpensive school\nUm we just sit down and really iron the wrinkles out of this and figure out how we can pull it all together and make it happen with no more debt and all that any more debt\n[noise] okay so then my question is we had the third we have a car loan where\nWe have a car loan for Thirteen thousand five hundred dollars and then I got he's got that ... PLUS Loan now do I start hammering on the parent PLUS Loan or do a camera and the car loan Carla\nA car loan and then the parent plus on yes\nOkay because I didn't know if that 'cause you you know when you go down your um [noise] yeah and I didn't know invest for kids with\nThis number five but we're not investing for kids now trying to cash flow with them yeah helping them get through with no more new debt you're you're not you're past the point of saving for college or trying to get through college now\nAnd then my daughter starting in the fall she is selling out scholarship she does have we do have some money you know not much but a little bit of money saved sure I'm\nGood just work like an animal and she has only out like ten scholarship applications a day\nAnd again she chooses an inexpensive school the least expensive option possible because you guys are broke and you're trying to foolish together as a family and get these two kids through school it can be done but it's going to require a lot of work a lot or scholarships and choosing the inexpensive school option and there's no shame in that game\nAnd some people do it every day people go a hundred dollars\nThat puts us
