R. dot com slash should listen to their lives you could get it up as I said oh no that's not my band okay I just wonder do it here\nGod it let's get onto the measles oh this is ... silver exciting [noise]\nWhat do you do what they read right out of Israel right yes the six children have gotten measles in Brooklyn in an orthodox Jewish community and they think it'll come from a\nFrom Israel you'd think they'd have vaccines and Israel against the measles but apparently there's an outbreak of measles in Israel and the kids who were family that was in Israel they've come back in those six children in Brooklyn had been diagnosed with measles got measles seems like such an ... you never hear people getting well\nYeah I was gonna say the problem is a lot of people like you said it seems so old fashioned that it doesn't happen anymore some people have stopped giving their children back a little while then that whole crazy ... and there are some religious reasons why they don't want to get vaccines so\nThey feel like they're protected because they don't think it's around anymore that do you do need it because it's not around but the person in from another country and you can see how fast to get to\nListen to what the county health commissioner Dr Patricia Rupert had to say\nThis is a high risk situation these very communicable Ninety percent of people who are Sosa nice I'll get it and that seems relevant [noise]\nOh wow you still get spots when you get measles the pictures I saw yesterday on the news are crazy I mean it was their entire back I didn't even know what the measles that look like\nNow but it's not it's not it's not a fatal thing right this is you know I can be can be handed\nMe oh my God I had the mumps when I was a kid member the mumps and the I hate that yeah I had to yeah yeah mumps measles yeah right chicken pox you don't get a box I probably had all those yeah I think I did I don't know who can remember I had my tonsils out now you got out [laughter]\nI Will get humor that is [laughter]\nAll right I\nMean this is this the disease section yes it is that what we're doing here that far I allowed or on the city's section or do you ever hear of acute flashing my light you probably have this plastic though a cute flats in my line is is that like when you're ... it's a rare condition\nIt's it's causing weakness in the arms and legs sometimes Raul says it's been confirmed in sixty two kids around the country and here's the scary part Natalie was telling me she lives in New Jersey of course there were three confirmed cases in New Jersey and three unconfirmed\nYeah I mean I I heard through somebody in my community they know of a child who\nMight be why the unconfirmed cases and it started off with paralysis of the waist down wow they have that temporary I don't want to get that\nA lot of times it is yes a lot of times if you get the symptoms early and you get treated early that you can work out of it but it's a mystery for sure because I'm not sure exactly how you get it they don't ... they have no real treatment that they have therapy and\nWhat's really interesting is that the are seeing and every other year cycle for it for whatever reason so every other year\nThere seems to be an outbreak and the topics are getting larger each\nTime it was a doctor or a ... mouth Hoekstra at the Robert Wood Johnson a hospital\nOr any of the cases I ... for\nThe average age around for years\nYeah or listen to this\nCould be very mild where\nThe ... to ... they can't move\nAnd they say one child has passed away from it so that this is this a crazy now I don't know who this must be a a mother perhaps\nIt's very frightening to think that something like that could strike a trial\nYet is absolutely and it's only children who are getting it justice at ... at rice under Eighteen ... ...\nIt's called it's called a acute lasted my light as uh the average age of the children's around for\nI'm Michael ... says yes the the New York post has um dressed up in a very lovely chicken outfit while he won't debate his opponent mark melon Arnold will mark mall and I was going to join us this morning live at eight forty we'll hear what he has to say about them apples and rounding out the big three well\nI guess we're going to be lining up but the the lotto store a mega is going to be nine hundred million dollars tomorrow night and there was no Powerball winner last night and I asked for a hundred and thirty so my math is correct\nYou got a grand total of a billion three hundred and thirty million wow and what are you going to do with that money if you when you could buy Trump Tower maybe I don't know you could\nSpeaking of that I think uh uh on the west side has Upper West side the wrong name is coming off a building\nOf another building in fact we have Alice Stockton rosy any on the case we'll hear from her in about an hour but another building they've had several before they're taking off the Trump name\nAnd I wonder um how the residents feel now I think they did have them vote the majority wanted it off but I have a feeling that many of the people bought the property because it had the Trump Trump didn't build these buildings you know they he leases out his name and they slap his name up on the building but there are various Trump businesses that have been struggling a because of the president's ... so\nThe ... right I bet there are a lot of Saudis with apartments and some from towers around the world while he says Trump has said that oh well that's what the Saudis do they have all this money they get it out of their country and they park it in real estate around the world so Trump\nHas said I don't have any business in Saudi Arabia but then everyone tried it out the soundbites where they buy apartments from me for forty five\nMillion dollars so well All right so a big deal it was in the real estate business he's allowed to sell apartments to Newt alleys none of us know say no I'm not saying the implication of no ... you know he's got business dealings\nWith others in there is an implication I mean you hear in his will absolutely yeah I guess\nYeah [laughter]\nSo I have a New York post not only will Andrew Cuomo not debate his challenger mark mowing arrow\nYou won't even talk about the ...\nThat just seems cheap king ... remember I'm telling ya that's just a cheap thing to do what are you afraid of governor\nYeah exactly remember ... ... the run up to the primaries when he wouldn't to put out the schedule where he was going to be to the press remember that oh that's right this guy's behaving like that was something\nHe didn't want to address is ... oh you didn't want to address the issue of some of his closest associates going down yeah in a bribery case right\nRight he's ... he's like the crown prince of Albany he behaves as they were the crown prince of Albany Cuomo what a thug can't stand the man now mirror that\nSmall narrow spoke with his bill O'Riley can be vet Bill O'Reilly [laughter] I don't think it says his his spokesman said Andrew Cuomo as a political coward erodes away it carefully orchestrated media appearances but towers when it comes to debating his record\nAgainst an actual challenger\nYeah he's absolutely right you're absolutely right but you know again once again we live in this blue deep deep deep blue state there was no accountability for the governor\nAnd the people who support the governor they love the fact that he's always out there pounding away at Trump's bashing Trump doesn't do anything in Albany terrible government are arrogant unaccountable undemocratic but as long as he bashes Trump gets the votes of the Democrats in the state\nFrom a political standpoint it makes sense I mean he is way ahead in the polls why would he even risk saying something stupid\nIt just shows the weakness of the Republican Party in New York it's nonexistent pretty much and really what are you all out\nWhat's the latest is there any poll on this race I was like killing ... people probably don't even know who minor narrow is no no\nWe couldn't even pronounce his name on a show for a while you didn't know him for what we call them ... as we said [laughter] and and criminals got millions and millions and ... um cash ... got two hundred thousand how's it going to win this thing but I you know it tell me this was Cuomo's tactics that he's a\nTrump I think the Democrats have a big problem if that's all they've got if they're going to go either to the mid term or to twenty twenty and all they got us criticizing Trump I don't think that's enough you gotta you gotta stand for\nSomething you can't stand against something they they got what what's the Democratic platform I think I think you know that's a mistake if every college tuition oh you're going to go see it every day or health care do what's right tax the rich\n... immigrants into the country act we abolish ice yeah ... ... well I didn't have a platform that I should say we just told you what the ... that's a bad life working so where are you politically where am I I'm sitting here of try to get through the day like anybody else\nThat actually tells me the Sienna college poll has Cuomo up by twenty two that doesn't mean that that's not a landslide I mean it's a big number it is I think the what was the mix number what's\nWas much more than that wasn't in the forties the advantage over Cynthia Nixon yeah yeah I Know that she somehow got under his skin yes German Jersey what's what's going on with a ... you can have this whole thing and the\nTook out an ad against Menendez thing right up being about under aged kids well he accused him of having sex with under age prostitutes right right and uh apparently he got that because the FBI did investigate the allegations right for them to charge whatever broad\nBut you know in politics he was accused of above that's factual statements yup you can say that yeah here's what Bob you've now has that was that pulled them and that this is still up a little different points semi I the last one was about a few them that's not a huge no no I think you can take 'em down you can you can can take off a yeah\nHe's I think he's gotten a little momentum going here as well here's a huge you'd have to say about this or add\nAnd now we have an FBI sworn affidavit that outlines of very detailed allegations with\nWith with substantial corroboration to it\nBut the people who truly deserve to hear about is\nThat true as their FBI corroboration of that under racing or was it was just an investigation well there there was an investigation obviously and I I mean that that's been a long standing allegation yeah I don't know I I think we're All right well the part of the problem is was another happened in another country so right\nWhat country did happen I mean they're going to get your ... yeah he went to use much of the ... yeah we went to the Caribbean with his doctor and I had a little uh you know ... where I'm at end is fighting back I mean when you use words\nLike slime ball man you're slugging it\nI Love the middle of the ... attack ad tells you everything you need to know about Republican Bob you but he's a slime ball he's in the ... and he's a liar\n... well you want to hear some of the ad that the idea was the ad that has them all Boston and New Jersey\nWhen will we as a society begin to believe what\nThe under aged girls who were courting to the FBI whoa\nThat is rare that is down and dirty or New Jersey that's a good politics right there ... all well and then does said even if they go low which stamp solo\nWhether it's bogus lies that it might as well have been directed by Donald Trump himself\nA job I got a sheep card to play such a pretty accurate though huh here's a here's ... says the\nOnly women who were ever identified by the FBI unequivocally and categorically refute it statements for recanted and admitted to law enforcement that they were paid\nTo lie about well paid so well that sounds like a Republican charge whenever you know Democrats rally they're paid the protests that now that you know the person that I get the sense there's dirt sticking them and then does yeah I think so\nYeah he he didn't really ... his trial ended in the midst trial exactly just going to come to a verdict so that was not and that he was exonerated exactly\nElsewhere and the politics ... segment Joe Biden admits that age would be an issue in a presidential how old is he now a Seventy five and a Trump is now Seventy two so he's three years older\nHe says uh Biden said he gave a speech in Michigan and he said it's totally appropriate for people look at me and say if I were to run for office again well God darned your old\nSomebody said God darned your old guy but he's got out that you're talking about strong language in politics gab darn it I think he's going to run\nOr at least Seventy five Bernie Sanders Seventy seven Michael Bloomberg Seventy six ...\nThere was a party leader party for the ages of my party for the aged ... gotten it's partly crowd there folks I think he's gonna run to and I think he has an excellent chance I mean I think he's a likeable guy you know they're going to bring up this plagiarism obviously always bring up something\nBut uh he likeable he was a ... you know what you know his campaign slogans going to be here we go make America great again [laughter]\n\nAnd I ... I use it on the show a couple of weeks ago that a lot of these shows and sort of\nMahler reportedly close to delivering his findings so that will know guys I keep saying whale is over it's almost going to be over grace either by that is going to be such a fizzle you're not going to believe you are going to be so crushed\nComing up next water crazy ball game last night in Houston controversial riddles going to weigh in on how controversial it really was what a terrible call\nThis is a really wanting to today's Len Burman and Michael Louis ... catch them alive tomorrow from six built in on seven ten W a law\nOr some of this is talk station feels rated number one seven\nTen W O o voice of New York and\nForty seven and clear at ten o'clock in the evening I'm Olga breed a student is in custody after a BB gun sparked a scare out of Manhattan high school and a local college today\nW.

I kept to the ... delusional aspect of it so you're delusional I Am I'm well yes I can be delusional about certain things but about Andrew Cuomo's arrogance I Am not delusional I just hope that people of New York wake up and say get rid of crown prince Cuomo well we\nDo have his opponent mark mall and arrows coming on with us live at eight forty this morning as you know if you saw the front page of the post this morning they're calling Mario ... uh marry or they're calling Andrew Cuomo chicken they have him dressed up as he won't get sued\nYou went debate debate them hey this is an interesting story I was rifling through the sports page morning and uh you know what the richest contract in sports history is now\nI bet you know who I bet you ... what was what was the richest contract Idaho's has been replaced was a Floyd Mayweather no no no no no no no it's a baseball player\nA baseball player Arabs no he's currently playing right now really particular neighborhoods for a team that's not going all the way huh Yankees hello oh Stan yes three hundred and twenty five million dollar contract\nI've thought a you know erodes was more than that but anyway well All right but that has just been superseded yes by a boxer just signed a contract with a streaming platform da's the end with the ... they're going to pay him was what was the box I'm going to say that but this where they're gonna pay him a minimum minimum\nOf three hundred and sixty five million dollars and the boxer is\nCan know canal oh Alvarez have you heard of canal I have not Albert I admit\nIt right up front I I I used to do boxing mhm I did boxing for the pay per view arm of TV KO right on the are the arm of HBO and I did that famous so George Foreman of Andrew Holyfield fight but you know that's that's Seventeen years ago over\nAnd well canal alber as he's getting three hundred and sixty five million dollars for an eleven fight contract guessing get a new month guard\nI guess you know or several gold plated enough so I made you watched that highlights from last night's game so the red Sox now in the game was heard right here on seven ten W O or\nUm the red Sox have taken a commanding three games to ... to one lead over the defending champions Houston Astros and uh Boston jumped out two to nothing lead and it looked like Houston came right back and tied it when I'm a Jose out to be at a high fly ball to right\nField I thought\nWell what happened was ... best which is in right field that's a joke is typically on on the red Sox radio network the outfielder went up to catch it\nReached into the stands and ... try to catch it right and for some that so that's a home run yeah if if the ball clears the fence and the field there has to reach back into the stands\nThat's a home run it wasn't a fence it was a ledge you call it the ledge it cleared the ledge was allegedly a fence a so empire Joe West as a character they call them cowboy jokers you actually records country and western music anyway Joe West goes back he rules that interference automatic out\nLittle few rule it out then the replay it goes to once a replay they challenged the call or home runs reviewed anyway and they ruled there wasn't enough evidence to overturn that but I so do the video yeah the first thing I said was over the legit\nIt counts as a home run out all over the gate to gate itself fence All right all this\nOffensive so wall alright hide your pathetic but we're not that the would the player it looked like he was about to catch it when the fan interfered yeah but the fan did not reach over

W ho\nComing up on a twenty four remind her eight forty we will have Republican gubernatorial candidate mark ... is our special\nGuest live ah if you saw the front page of the New York post Michael ... paper they call out the Governor Cuomo for being chicken they have a picture of him in a chicken outfit for refusing to debate mowing their oh well we will give ... time in\nSide of the star you're going to debate him oh why not give them a chance to speak all asking questions we don't want to be the Cuomo stand in oh not at all or earlier we were talking about Louis Farrakhan is wonderful little state but he put on Twitter when they talk\nAbout ... Khan [noise]\nTo\nCome in and see semi [noise]\n[noise] oh man do turn my [noise]\nHilarious while you're way out of comedian our favorite the Congressman Peter king from Long Island tweeted time for every American to denounce Louis Farrakhan for his disgraceful anti Semitism and I respond absolutely uh oh yesterday I ... bridge that our listeners asking what happened to your event yesterday you were talking about on the air\nOh yeah our listeners won a competition to see the band's visit which is a wonderful musical one ten Tony Awards\nAnd they went to the matinee yesterday and then afterwards I interviewed the leads from the show Katrina length who is wonderful and says son Gabby and Israeli actor who's now in the show I interviewed him onstage after the show and uh we had a very good time and all the listeners\nWho won the tickets they love the show when we all agreed that so refreshing in a Broadway that's dominated by all these brand name shows and chose\nBased on big famous movies or show is based on cartoons or kiddy shows it's nice to have something like the band's visit an intimate\nAdult lovely show how many of our listeners were there ten and big fans of the show I loved it yeah they can serve our show oh the friends of mine [laughter] where are they are really yeah okay so I Know there were other very complimentary of how I've just elevated the show and brought\nA lot of ... I have no way in dispute is going to bake the sub I'd be blowed out of your [laughter] whatever that actually one couple they said that the way you and I are in the morning reminds them of how they bicker\nAt the breakfast table because uh the husband's a Republican and the wife has left really yes is that what we're doing we're bickering yes you know I'm the husband on the right you're the wife on the left and I'm always right [laughter] hey what's this uh you you mentioned before the break Harvard and Asians oh there's a big lawsuit going on\nYeah this is interesting so the um uh testimony in the trial began yesterday a group of Asians are suing harbor because they say Harvard in the admissions discriminates\nAgainst Asians and so Harvard has had to come clean with some statistics and er here you go this is interesting All right so here's if you're an African American Hispanic or Native American you have to have scored around eleven hundred on the SATs to get a recruitment\nLetter from Harvard eleven hundred eleven which is not that's not that that's not a new ...\nSixteen hundred so if you're if you score eleven hundred African American Hispanic Native American students you get a recruitment letter you know what you have to score if you're an Asian American what Fifteen hundred Thirteen eighty for men Thirteen fifty\nFour women you don't even you won't even get a letter from them if you're an Asian American unless you're in the Thirteen eighty two fourteen hundred now what's their explanation for skewing as well they say they diversity they want to have a diverse student body but it's also emerged that when they interview Asian students they put things like well\nQuiet shy\nWhat they don't want is because Asians consistently score higher on the SATs and everybody else they don't want to just have to admit people on merit base because they have a lot more Asians up there will be quiet and shy and maybe boring or to studious they don't want that on the campus\nAlso interesting here's with some of the people who've said hey this is out of the post this morning a Michael I'm of the lawyer for the students for fair admissions say that's race discrimination plain and simple\nThe dean says it is not you said the school targeted certain groups in order to quote break the cycle and try to convince students to apply to Harvard who normally wouldn't\nBut I'm Sorry I didn't mind is not a Harvard SAT score ways eleven hundred is like an average ... medley put on your kids application that they're already\nShe says maybe one last night for you could have named Pocahontas if Elizabeth Warren can do it surely your kids can do it I don't think we're getting any letters from Harvard by kids and do well in school but no I don't think\nSo the truth of the matter is if they lead in every qualified Asian they could fill their entire class it's much like it used to be with for example University of Pennsylvania if they live at every qualified Jewish person from Long Island they go to fill their class so there is something we would be said for trying to mix it up\nOn the other hand there's no getting around the point that you're discriminating against the Asian Americans\nWell that's what the law suits all about sir\n[noise] glad you're spending your evening with our replay of this morning show catches for a brand new Len Burman and Michael real in the morning tomorrow from six to ten on seven ten W. O. R.\nRated number one seven and W. all our voice of New York Hi\nSo so keep in mind the entire system is is rate and it's great to protect a statewide incumbent and that's it so they're real taxpayers and voters\nWho boy whose voices are silenced and if you're listening and you're a Democrat don't think that you're better off because of Andrew Cuomo because he just has shown silence you if it meant Cape staying in office\n[laughter] you know it really really bothers me about Cuomo mark is I just find his arrogance is so off on the ground principle Albany because he doesn't behave as an elected official he behaves as if the word the Saudi crown prince and you can do what he wants to do\nThe smallest of things uh you know he had the department of transportation employees handing out campaign literature at a parade in New York City to the most the most obscene seven hundred and fifty million dollars of taxpayer money\nTo go to to a business that didn't create the jobs in exchange for political contributions and his aid goes to jail and understand it yes this is a lawless state government it is a tax payers and voters should know it\nIt is a ... system and and it's why there are there are kids living in in support housing with with lead painting and tainted water it's why the trains don't run on time it's why are ... are are caving in and and and eroding\n... understand that that the entire system is rigged to benefit one incumbent governor and that should be something that we're very afraid of\nRome with mark ... who's the duchess county executive who's the gubernatorial candidate for New York state governor against the Andrew Cuomo so uh the corruption that surrounded the\nCuomo has not stuck remember his comment a couple of months back when he said well America was never that great I mean none of us none of this has really gotten much traction who's ... system or what\nIt is it is because the media can break through I mean let's let's face it to the media resources are are fewer and fewer you've got an you've got an ethics commission that's holding to the governor so it doesn't enforce the laws you have an attorney general that worked for the governor she's not enforcing the rules and and coming after him you have district attorneys that have been silenced assignments and in in in Manhattan\nSilenced by the governor and now he's under FBI investigation for shutting down investigations and and you know ... ... you know this right the governor shut down an investigation into the investigation of Harvey Weinstein in exchange for political contributions it is\nIt so I get why the public doesn't necessarily by and understand all of it because it just seems like politicians are this way but the state government under this governor is corrupted and it is bankrupt and it is stealing from taxpayers and Republicans and Democrats across the state or stand up and say enough is enough\nLike I said it's all the time if I when I get one chance at doing this right so so we're going to invest all of our time energy and trying to fix the broken system because I suspect if I get a chance I get for years and that's it\nMarks and now he's more yeah mark you know quickly I are you getting a fair shake from the mainstream media like the New York times 'cause he was flabbergasted to me to see the times endorsement Oklahoma they listed all of the things he has done wrong all of the ethical problems and yet they still go out to endorse him because he's a Democrat in the hold their positions\nI ... you know [laughter] it's your answer is no [laughter] but yeah you're right they they list all the reasons why he's wrong and\nRather than call to me she told me that I mean why didn't healing got fast enough and I was the only\nPerson she can turn to she said that he needed that pain pills to get back to work 'cause you guys were running out of money going to try to put this off on me to get their pills she cook them die you Gilbert has stopped me just sending other stash in the freezer that just more\nOn the cob I only have to tell you there were very funny scene John Goodman and Laurie Metcalf or some amazing actors you know I really enjoyed watching them and that was just John Goodman and dramatic moment I thought he was very effective very\nInto um what's the deal a it was funny despite all that yeah they were they were definitely funny line and was there a lot of politics or not no not a lot of social issues are there are you want some politics well that's what they're talking about on the TV morning shows yeah Joe Biden on the other morning even after Trump and we'll hear the highlights coming up\nThis is a really wanting to today's Len Burman and Michael read all in the morning catch them live tomorrow from six built in on seven ten W O law [noise]\nThis is a really wanting to today's Len Burman and Michael read all in the morning and get them live tomorrow from six built in on seven ten W O law\nWarning everyone we have a big hole final hour to go on this Thursday October the\nTeam lost to discuss our big three stories of course leading the way the Saudis story ah I mean what's going on as the U.S is Saudi Arabia they are getting together hey what story can we get together on and that's gonna make any sense that people are going to buy is that what\nThey're getting a little a head of yourself lumping in with the Americans here there's no evidence of that yet I'm sure the Saudis are trying to cook up a story that can get their crown prince out of the hot water he's in but you just see him doing it with Trump already well no evidence for that it'd be a little\nBit stronger he was of of the United states a or a resident and not a citizen and he was a journalist I'd like to see us take a little bit stronger stance but let's see how it plays out we sent the secretary of state in the last show them hey it also in the big three uh the chicken man\nSo that's what the New York post as on the front page will go with that one as well Cuomo refuses\nTo debate mark mowing narrow we just had mowing their lawn is our guest Cuomo will give them the time of day we did you know it's a kind of show we are well I\nAnd she had to mark that ah we saw him at the Columbus Day parade he actually went over to the governor to shake his hand and say hello and the governor brush them away like a piece of land and mark said he tried to introduce his wife to the governor the governor had no interest in me and my wife that in light of arrogant\nI did a good job but I mean he outlined a lot of points against Cuomo and that's probably why Cuomo doesn't want to debate you don't want that out there that is true he doesn't want all the people that have been indicted around here was a good interviewer wasn't a joke yeah we'll we'll replay parts of it the newscasts and the next couple of hours but I'm telling you I'm I I\nGot to get some traction asking about TV\nHe says the well the last fourteen days so I got away that's coming up that's what they've got away I don't mind it all adds but he's got to get some television go it is buying it upstate where it's cheaper than\nWhat he said outside of New York and he really has a lot of bottom value or any way for a Republican pointless rounding out of our big three well if you want to spend a lot of money as a politician maybe should win one of the lottery is going on would you believe mega\nIs going to be worth nine hundred million dollars tomorrow night and Powerball there was no winner last night\nSo Saturday Michel read

entire adult life what\nAre we are going to we just play power are we going to play ... do you play both what are we gonna do\nWell let's just stick with the one that's nine hundred nine million well who won you want to change as go for them on a daily and\nWe want ... billion alright I'm In the yell at me some well here's a question who's coming to work the next day we actually with the death a political Saturday So well All right I Will have a weekend to figure it out and then the outcome Monday said my goodbyes and\nAll that shit because we're having so much fun we don't care we would do it for free right we'd all but did you say land that when people when they say oh I'm going to buy a house yeah they say ridiculous I Would want somebody that's got to ... my wife\n[laughter] that that that is true that is why wouldn't you say you wind up I have to buy a new house yeah but yeah the houses that can cause I mean I've done a lot of free money more than a firehouse really okay fine how are\nYou what would you do then\nI Would try to set up trust so it all goes to the kids and grandkids and try to figure\nIt out those trust be similar to the Donald Trump's set out to avoid some flat\nLand\nLegal ... says try families set up by ... by the book oh yeah right ah right in the morning shows well uncle Joe Biden\nWas on CBS and uh he had a certainly had a lot to say a he was asked uh do you believe the mall or report she'll be issue before the midterms\nI think it'd be issued when they finished investigation\nYou wait to the investigations finished\nYou don't put an arbitrary end to it\nYou wait till is finished and let's see what has to say I probably\nShouldn't be released this shouldn't influence unlike Coney who influenced the election with the Hillary yes and no business I I think there should wait slept in the terms\nYeah I think so I think ... more or by the book then a call me was and he will wait till after the midterms when he issued a report that basically says nothing\nWe shall see see that's why you do an investigation to figure it out he's been very close lived as well he should have been the no leaks from his office mystery leaks have come from the white\nI don't think by needs to remind us he's been around a long time\nThat is true he's been around a while what'd you say that he was once accused of plagiarism and what's his campaign going to be\nYeah Biden was famously accused and he admitted to it at plagiarism and I said his campaign slogans going to be make America great again\nThere you go so uh he was asked on CBS this morning why does it seem that the president is so easy on dictators I don't want to\nSpeculate on my worst fears but I'm either he doesn't know what he's doing\nFor he has absolutely ... notion\nAllows American lead the world\nAll right there's a there's a presidential candidate for you know he's not afraid to mix roll up his sleeves and mix things up basically he wants to come out and said that Trump is a fascist well what he wants to say it will be shy or so he was asked about should there be Saudi consequences\nOver over the obvious murder of this American resident ... who um uh what's the journalist\nAbsolutely positively this was a permanent American\nWe this administration seems to feel the need the coddle\nAutocrats in dictators from today Kim Jong on to\n... I mean I I don't understand\nWhy you coddle them at the way you coddled Iran to get them to have a peace treaty with you Mr Biden president ... Obama so the or\nOn Fox is when he ... he is the Republican senatorial candidate who is challenging Bob Menendez so one of the Bob's is going to win over their Bob's early an observation I that's why I got to watch her out of your the Bob ... a a human has this attack ad going against me then does\nWhen will we as a society begin to believe what\nUnderage girls who were courting the FBI\nWell that's the whole issue that he was accused of something was under raise the FBI investigate it I don't think they found anything they gave them and then this is called Cuban a slime ball among other things for running this ad so he was on Fox and friends this morning and he was talking about the a tight race here\nThey're desperate they they see the momentum and our campaign people in the Jersey no they can do better they deserve better they've been so poorly service so many different ways\nAnd how about these allegations against him and then there's\nThe Senate Ethics committee how much bipartisanship is earners in in Washington right to the Senate Ethics committee bipartisan Lee says unequivocal Washington as best lawyers violated federal law abused the power of his office disgrace the Senate and so the people in Jersey deserve to know the whole story and that's what we're telling them\nWell ... the last poll was about seven points which doesn't seem like a whole lot I Wonder if this is truly a horse race or not\nAn either or could it could well be and uh you know men does he wasn't a exonerated you know they had a ... at the tour they couldn't come to a a a verdict the jury right so it was not exonerated and there's a lot of dirt that sticks to ... and I'll\nTell you that uh you know the Democrats are hopeful they can get the Senate\nBut if ... is on the fancy to Heidi Heidi Heidi Heitkamp shit out out of North Dakota she's got problems she's down in the polls so I'm not sure the Democrats can make hay in the Senate All right Eric Trump uh the presidential son was on Fox and friends and he urged Republicans they get out there and vote", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018", "city": "New York", "day": "19"}
