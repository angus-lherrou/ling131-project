{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "And they came in and they they wanted to invest in to us and so they sit down and they said so what's your exit strategy how we can make money on this and I said\nMy exit strategy is is the epitaph on my on my tombstone is says made a difference in this world and changed lives and quality that literally that is my answer to that sure we just couldn't ever get it together and there's and Lex got the experience of seeing many times for example I'm just going to put it out there but that\nPeople wanted us to go multi level time after time in companies that wanted us to and then we would sit down 'cause yeah I mean we needed to make money and we need to be right through the bad times\nAs as a business you started this as a way to help your patients so that business side of it was something you had to get a learning curve on and grow and kind of shepherd from day one this is not something I never thought I'd be doing right I Love practice I Love\nPeople and so so as we started doing this do people started you know coming out of the woodwork and it's interesting that people then we would say no there's some there's a ... a major\nThere's a major health food chain that wanted to do something was but when they\nThey wanted us to change it everyone every single time they want us to change it\nEvery single time they wanted us to to cheapen it because it had to be cheaper\nAnyway there was this one multi level that they were doing something and then in some third world countries and helping people and they said you know if they get to these it's better than having to to capsules is is better than nothing and they started to convince me to some things like that and so we started talking with them came down to the line\nWhen they were they had already a multi level business they were doing they just wanted to replace it with a plug in play yeah and so we found out they were paying how much how much like was it that they were paying per bottle for those vitamins a dime a dime and they were selling them for sixty dollars ...\nAnd and and so when and that was from the manufacture of manufacturing without making money to that is right that was their prize they weren't even making themselves\nAnd they were then they they just had a good story they were telling these people that they would become into financially independent and blah blah blah when it came down to it they found out that over half of our costs are actually in the product [laughter] they were like well what we can't do that where you got to do this or that and that's when they came you know how about two and a captain\n... obviously we could never make it work one of these guys that that was doing this one finally just wanted to make something work\nAnd we've and flew we had flown out with our attorney because we thought something was going to work with this and everything and\nAnd and it just and then it got down okay so how are we going to make it cheaper and I was like I won't change the product I won't change what we do\nWe won't do that these are the studies I have this is why it works is how it works I won't change it we're about changing lives\nAnd if if you could sit in fact I invite you Kevin come and sit in on one of our our staff meetings and just to hear it on the phone is one thing that you should come and sit and see the tears that are shared by some of our our help coaches when they tell the stories of who they help to this week\nThat is what our staff meetings are about Mm they talked about their successes\nAnd we share them and we and that's what we are and so any ways that we actually produce our own product we've tried we have tried to to get it out because we we thought it'd be easier working with government entities and things that that it would be easier to do that way\nTheir quality could not pass our standard right we wouldn't send it out we literally would not send it out I said you know give me those bottles I'll take them home and eat them but I'm not going to send those out to\nPeople the the fact that there's such a high standard in the a product that's in your capsule and the\nContent of what's in every bottle or is really unparalleled and so it's one of those things friends where when you get ... and Dr Howard says this and the commercials on a regular basis\nBut when you when you when you pop open the plastic lit up the bottle and then you pull the the sealed\nFoil seal off [noise] if you don't get a whiff when you open the fruits of very strong fruit and it just it just walked right up to your house and the same with the with the veggies or if you don't ... then you're not you're not taking balance of nature if you don't get that\nSmell if you don't think that there didn't take one of the capsules over an open it up and taste it yeah I I challenge that with anything else out there and you won't get it we don't use and we don't fill it with things like like alfalfa well and the\nThing is you've picked thirty one fruits and vegetables as the combination of this all base going back to our previous discussion on the chemistry of what those specific fruits and vegetables mind\nYou take the three and three and they work in combination how they work in combination and you take those three and three every day\nYou're going to be taking the equivalent of ten servings of a salad made of those thirty one fruits and vegetables now I don't know how much salad you're currently a ingesting but if you're not eating ten plate fools of it\nWith these thirty one specific fruits and vegetables in it you're gonna miss the nutrition that isn't the compact form of these caps with nothing but whole food and when you say whole food it's skin it's\nIt's see it's it's all the stuff that that that's in that food when feasible yet writer example is the whole apple\nCivil pineapple now we take the skin off of some things right 'cause that's not necessarily yeah double portion right [noise] but yeah every edible part is there and it's very important and we're the only ones who do that we have to have that made special for\nA while

number many people come into our office at thirty four brought her to get the booklet refer to it now page for figure for if this\nMan or any of you went to the most famous surgeon in America for prostate cancer surgery which I'm not advocating\nBut I'm just saying this man side of the surge into the super duper hospital and\nThey told him a great the results would be well what are the great results if you have a PSA ten to twenty if you have surgery which I'm not advocating it's thirty percent success rate meaning Seventy percent failure rate so what's the big spiel about racing to get a surgery it's going to change\nThis life and most likely the cancers gonna grow back anyway I Would say there's no reason to go and number two we know from the data from Boston from a famous medical school there that Ninety seven percent of men who have\nOpen surgery which is having a man or a woman's hands and your body robotic surgery for prostate cancer gives them all the success rate for sexual keeping sexual function is less than three percent which means Ninety seven percent of men have harm to the sex life and this is not me saying it\nAlthough I can tell you I've seen thousands of men and I've never seen a man who's had surgery who's been successfully treated with sex life for them to your life intact so I\nBelieve the data the data is that Ninety seven percent of men have damage to their sex life even with robotic are open surgery and urinary damage that we know what that is your problems means leaking\nLeaking urine wedding your pants is\nEighty percent of men have a wedding of their pants urinary problems after\nSurgery for prostate cancer and with robotic it's even worse it's I Know they say robotic surgery is supposed to be better and safer but\nThat's out today that shows the data shows that are from Harvard Medical school about eighty six point eight percent of men who have robotic surgery for prostate cancer have urinary problems\nWhich means the PPP and even with open it's eighty percent so for this gentleman who served our community was in the fire department ... stood hinder stood\nBecause three years he's been listening to this radio show and when he heard what they were planning to do he understood what they are planning to do they're planning to build up their services give 'em as one of these services like cattle knowing that the services most likely going to fail\nThat one services are going to probably need another service and even the surgeon introduced him to the radiation doctor and the radiation doctor then said well we recommend surgery well why would a radiation doctor recommends surgery or if he knew the facts of the facts are the most likely surgery will fail most likely surgery will take away a sex life

radio surgery you can also call Dr lead a minute to ensure killington for a free informative and DVD hey Dr Lederman whereby\nWe are back I Would take about Seventy well he's now by the Seventy five year old doctor these a doctor who's married has three children is diabetes and ... relation\nAnd he came to me two years ago almost exactly\nTwo years ago with a base so cell cancer on the nose he had Mose remember mo surgery MOH as most surveys when the doctor the skin doctor surgeon starts cutting your skin off like a ... they say they're going to get to last cancer so will this man had\nMose surgery on his nose and as such a big hole on his nose that they had to put a big flap of skin in from another part of his body so you could imagine back then he was a Seventy three year old doctor who had this tomatoes and the editor flap and then I saw him and I saw him\nHe'd been seeing the dermatologist every six months and when I saw him I found the mass of cancer\nOn the flab right where the doctors cut off part of his nose and stuck it out of their skin and there was a mess it looked like we're current cancer I suggested a biopsy I told him I Believe you have cancer well this is a doctor and the paradox\nOf it is that he's a doctor that does reconstruction of noses for patients so when other doctors cut off the nose for skin cancers he's involved in the\nCare of recreating a knows well\nThis week he came back to see me with a very extensive cancer of his nose and he didn't get treatment\nTwo years ago when he had a small area about a quarter of an inch\nBuddy waited and waited and waited promote because she was in denial and now he came back to me two years later I haven't seen them in two years I gave him my card two years ago we gave them information like we'd give you a few cause because the two and two choices will give you the information will mail to uh do charge we gave it to him\nThan two years later he comes in with a very extensive cancer over his nose now they want to remove his nose that what does it Dr do who\nEncourages patients to lose their nose when he himself has cancer who knows what do you think about that question\nWell the answer is he does not have his nose cut or he comes to the doctor Lederman because he does not want to have his nose cut off and he said to me after they cut off someone's nose and he tries to repair it he relies\nOn patients growing a thick mustache and big eye glasses to cover up the results so that's already telling your number one he is a doctor is supposed to be doing repair our noses after their cut off for skin cancers\nAnd when he has himself he doesn't do it on himself\nAnd that's the same story I can tell you it's the same story with doctors whose who have our whose wives or breast cancer they remove the breast on the patient but when the\nDay the doctor or their wife comes in with a breast cancer they come to the doctor Lederman to save the breast and the same story is true for bladder cancer or kidney cancer and prostate cancer as so many other cancers that's why so many doctors come to us because they do not\nWant to have radical surgery this doctor that does repairs on those doesn't want his own work\nHe doesn't practice what they preach he preaches cut off your nose to you but then when he gets the cancer the nose\nBecomes running to third unity for Broadway to have\nHis nose saved and that's what we intend to do is to fight for him and fight for every patient who comes\nTo us for treatment that is what we do have an excellent track record over many decades treating skating cancers medic skin cancers from head literally to toes\nAnd I could tell you the truth is getting cancers for most every part of the body you can imagine you tell me apart and I'll tell you where we've printed the cancer from the top of the head and so many people get sun exposure to recently a man who came in with\nCancer on six of his toes you went to one of the super poop or hospitals and the doctors are wanting to remove six toes and then he came here\nHad treatment and had successful treatment with a cancer of his toes six for six successfully saved because he came here to radio ushered in New York for the doctor with the cancer of the knows we most likely are going to be successful and\nActing his nose as well don't take about a woman she came from Poland she's forty nine years old she had a colon cancer and this is a woman who had multiple nodules and\nAnd the cancer is totally gone all the cancer the nasal faring in the bone up into the brain is totally gone he said no adverse\nEffects of the treatment is fully intact the ball in this field\nThere is no pain there is no double vision the masses gone the cancers gone the imaging shows that they can tell you that he\nAnd his daughter and his family are so happy and meet to grill to treat him when many other hospitals either offer treatment tried treatment or he just decline treatment he had she been here for a mass of cancer and nasal faring space of skull brain all treated successfully treated\nCancer free and that's the way we like it here at radio surgery New York\nThat we're talking about a man who is fifty two years old he's married he's born in Jamaica and we see many men and women with cancer from the Caribbean there's lots of cancer seems like it's the at the center of cancer I been met with him best are so many chipmaker in other countries\nAnd they told me that they have the highest cancer rates prostate cancer rates poses a man\nWho had a sarcoma sarcoma as a cancer of the connective tissue is cancers can occur of almost every part of the body and\nThis man had a sarcoma stomach he went to a super super big hospital something super famous and they had surgery and then just a few months later the cancer traveled to his heart\nValve and he had a reception he went to another super big hospital where they cut the cancer off the heart of and then he went to Jamaica to recover\nAnd well then he was followed by on a college just and he was doing OK and why did he come here we came here because he never ever wants to have treatment in that super duper big\nHospital or the second hospital or any hospital he has a sarcoma had a massive surgery on his stomach on his heart and now he knows\nThat radio surgery our treatment has a high success rate with no ... no bleeding though hospital stay and that's the way he likes it and that's why you came to us and that's what he's doing\nAnd we think about uh fifty eight year old woman she was born in New York City she works on the computer from home shame with her boyfriend she is single she has no kids she was seen by her doctor she was found that blood in the year and they looked inside the bladder and that was negative but a CAT scan over abdomen showed lymph\nNodes enlarged lymph nodes what's called the retro parents and the ... the other teaching point number Ninety to Ninety nine\nThe retro parents in retro means behind and perhaps the him as the cavity the abdominal cavity so there were lymph nodes behind the abdominal cavity this is a woman who never smoked a way it was a hundred and twenty eight pounds two years ago or a way it was a hundred and forty five so she's lost almost twenty pounds in two years she's five foot four\nWe often see many cancer patients losing weight why because most commonly the cancers just eating up the calories so she came to us with that information and we arranged for her to have a biopsy for her to know exactly what\nType of tumor is affecting the lymph nodes we arrange that and now she wants to come to us\nFor non invasive treatment and that's the work that we do and one of the most common questions I get is Dr Lederman can you treat cancer and my lymph nodes and the answer is yes and the other question Dr Lederman do treat stage for cancer and the answer is yes\nDr Lederman country cancers even if chemo or radiation or surgery didn't work or isn't wanted or isn't tolerated\nAnd the answer is yes this is the work that we\nDo other question Dr Lederman do take my insurance should take Medicare Medicaid and the answer is most commonly yes that deliver them and how can I get to you well\nThat's why we build her office at thirtieth and Broadway recalls to fourteen subway stations the one two three four five six ac and Q. R B the FM seven and has caused the train stations metro north at Grand central Long Island railroad the Jersey transit path train's at\nPenn Station and then we're close also within minutes to Port Authority where all the buses come into New York city so this is the work that we do\nEvery day I Want to manage sixty nine he came in by himself as for current colon cancer stage for he had chemotherapy is out of no car some of the coal and he's married he came with his wife colonoscopy a couple of years ago they found a sequel cancer he had had calling us could be two years before which\nWas negative no most likely\nIt's very likely that cost can be two years earlier missed the cancer in ... can miss the cancer it's very important to have a deliberate\nSlow ... studies have shown the longer the doctor takes to look at your colon\nThe more accurate obey the town of a sequel cancer the ... the other teaching corners where the large power those small ball come together get at surgery his CEO of the cancer marker was four and then recently started rising that's why cancer marker so you saw a lot of patience I say I ask him\nThen these are people that I've had cancer for months or years is that what's your cancer Margaret they've never heard about it there Dr never told them about it another teaching point the cancer marker helps you and helps your loved ones\nNo if the cancers gone are coming back or what it's doing in this case the cancer marker was going up\nAnd he had a PET scan a PET scan showed a mess in the pelvis he started chemotherapy started immunotherapy he's had diarrhea for two years since that surgery had terrible him rise because he has diarrhea up to ten times a day that's what happens in their move so much of his colon these taking medicine for that he's lost\nWeight has gone from one Ninety down to one eighties five foot six\nHe's also it a little bit of kidney failure\nMaybe from the diabetes maybe from the chemo any other PET scan showing this right pelvic mass was hot it was right by the ... bone and it was ... and there's an added no carcinoma pets a cancer\nThe same kind of cancer that he had removed from the sea come now he's been getting chemotherapy for more than a year he and his wife came to me and I examined by the way and talk to him and his Kamal doctor told him\nBecause of the patients that I'm going to go see Dr Lederman about ready to certainty that became a doctor said dont say doctor later and mind your cancers floating all over the place you need chemotherapy for the rest of your life well I examined the patient and examined the records and there was only one spot of cancer and this man\nThis the chemo guy was just afraid of losing a case but the doctor shouldn't be\nTo lose in the case that doctors should be fighting for the patient that's what we do we fight for the patient we're not supposed to be selling chemotherapy or selling radiation or selling surgery was supposed to fight for the patient now the doctor said this patient had cancer floating all over his body well here they had a CAT scan of at a pet\nScan the other physical exam and none of those things showed cancer flooding over the body so why did the chemo doctor tell the patient this cancer floating over the body it's wrong information\nThere's no documentation of that there's one mass of cancer the massive cancers right where the surgeon operated and very likely the surgeon could've spread those cancer cells when he was operating that's the only side\nThere's not cancer floating over his body so\nYou got the picture one spot of cancer the surgeon probably spread it the chemo doctors telling the patients came up for the rest of his life and the patient doesn't want came on the patient as working has got this beautiful\nLoving really understanding why they do not want chemo for the rest of their life and they understand though and I showed them the documents I showed them the report says only one spot of cancer that we can easily trade five treatments ten minutes each\nAnd most likely eradicate that cancer without life long chemotherapy lifelong chemotherapies like a\nPrison sentence you start getting chemo and then having the side effects of chemo and then recover from the chemo and the next wave day or week you get more chemo was endless and chemo was under record is a form of toxicity that goes from head to toe so this friend came\nFor for a second opinion like you or your loved ones you might want to or to the mother educational point to come and get a second opinion makes you understand things in a different way and finally this man understands things in a different way that he doesn't have cancer floating over his body and even if he did that as I mean he has to\nTake chemo ... one option became only usually works for a short period of time but then the cancer resist the cancer mutates the cancer reacts to it and often\nThe cancer even becomes more aggressive from the chemotherapy so for this man you know understands you gotta localized cancer even though it's spread from the original site that we can treat five treatments and there's a Ninety percent chance we can obliterate this cancer for the rest of his life\nWhere we attack the cancer sort of giving them options and chances are not just false hope and not just baloney but real information that he can use and his wife could decide how he\nReally wants to get treatment and that's the work that we do here at Radio City of New York giving people options straight information copies of your records explaining\nRecords soon go away learning more about yourself\nAnd I speak to so many patients I can tell you so many patients actually don't know their own diagnosis or where the cancer is or or what the options truly are so few wishing car office two and two choices to get the book but to get the DVD you can even make an appointment we accept most insurance is Medicare Medicaid\nAnd then recently the cancer traveled to the liver the brain and\nShe was at one of the big hospitals of New York area they did not tell her what her cancer markers are and I can tell you the other big difference between us and the other guys but I Do I get cancer markers which are blood tests to tell you how the cancers respond to the treatment or not responding to treatment forgiving copies of them so you know what's going on you have\nA piece of paper in your hand showing you get a better or worse so not hiding something from you and her last CAT scan showed the cancer was growing and the brain MRI showed new tumor in the brain so for her she is suffering she lost\nTwenty pounds she has cancer it's traveling that there are treatments that working and she came to us for a fresh second opinion for cancers growing in the liver and the brain and just not doing well on chemotherapy or alternative therapies that were talking about a woman whose\nSeventy eight with Iraq do cancer she came in with her for kids providing ... cancer she was fine until two months ago she was too weak abdominal pain\nOr hemoglobin was five do normal hemoglobin as about Fifteen so she's lost

from a hundred and sixty pounds down to Ninety pounds she is five foot two she's lost Seventy pounds recently\nShe had a PET scan and one of the outlying suburbs you had a biopsy showing out of no carcinoma and she came to us and this is the work that we do even if she's frail would've because of circumstances are slow diagnosis or whatever she suffered\nThe purpose of treatment is to try to

Lederman we're back\nWe're back and You're welcome to our office for information to one two choices about sixty eight year old man born in New York City's a instructor she's married he had some smoking exposure secondhand you never smoked\nHimself and that's important because he has to tumors to cancers are both often smoking related bladder cancer and kidney cancer often smoking related cancer so he didn't smoke but he got smoke a lot in his life from\nSecond hand so he had a bladder cancer superficial\nNot invasive it it was treated superficially successfully and then recently had a CAT scan and the CAT scan shows a mess and the kidney he had a biopsy he's had blood in the year and that was the blood and urine precipitated the homework up if another teaching point number level no for if you have blood\nThat's not supposed to be somewhere\nTo better give us a call two and two choices he had blood in the year and and the CAT scan chose a mass and the kidney is lost weight has gone from a hundred and eighty pounds two hundred and Seventy pounds is second hand smoking by the way his father smoked and he lived in the home with the father for many many years so\nEven though the father I'm sure didn't try to harm his child\nSmoking in his home\nHarms the other people who breathe the air he is five feet\nTen he had the super cancer of the bladder I examined him we talked about all the options though often urologist go in there and remove the kidney or if they remove the kidney is going to lose lose half his kidney function many patients who come to us do not want to have radical surgery that I don't want to have\nTheir kidney laws they don't want to lose half their function and memories had\nThe smoke exposure if you remove one kidney what's he going to do it a year or two if you as a cancer and the other kidney so by losing his kidney\nMakes it more and more difficult to do things in life compromises him for the rest of his life and most probably he does

I'm sure they were it was either find people because they already had been interviewed by the Senate Judiciary committee look the the the goalpost are moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult to ... to believe that any of these people um it it can take themselves seriously they said it's\nGoing to be here for days for just me a week and now they're going to have an artificial that time you know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial\nThere you know she said that every Democrat that that now they're going up but Trump is evil puppet master control in the FBI they're actually gonna be it's horrible part is an organization\nYou know it it it it is and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's\nLifelong reputation here on the line\n[noise] take your mind that are doing two weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever you know re Donovan famously one said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well in this case\nI I don't think Brett Kavanaugh ever gets back in many many ways I mean Clarence Thomas will forever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYeah it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some um it you know someone who clerked for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there's certain ... ... people who are going to just simply use that as their excuse is counted but anyway this couch them because they disagree with them anyway [noise]\nUm and he is someone who does ... incredible amount of perspective on the bench judge\nKavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit as a lower court judge the Supreme Court said it saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times they fought to fourteen different times they found out they vindicated his opinion and they had a huge amount of respect for him I don't think that's going to change I think\nUm they are not going to be watching this with the same knee jerk or part is in response as I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of these people a hat but but it\nAfter the parents' reputation now\nIf you read James ... New York times piece that he came out with the ... to me it's absolutely stunning\nAnd the things that he's saying because you know while the FBI's pack in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was running an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her\nUm but then he goes on to trash the president at length\nAnd then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are and interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other accounts and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but at the ages no time has little to do with memory\nUm which I found a little strange um and then ... you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day uh I don't think that's a political in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized by could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not\nUm once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says\nIs one thing to have your lawyer submitted statement on your behalf it's very different thing to sit across from ... special agents and answer their relentless questions of course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them it was what he says refusal to do so\nIs its own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because my FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever\nTalk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why I'm somebody who loves the FBI I don't love the upper brass under Khomeini and the cave and struck and page but the FBI is is the FBI people I Know what the salt of the people\nAnd I sort of course I'd want to help him he goes no and then they say look what happened to General Flynn\nGeneral Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was lying to them\nAnd you just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say\nBecause it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said something in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the the irony that says if you look it hit companies coming MO right now is just to try to destroy Trump with everything he can and it's just another another section in that play book but the irony is the exact same federal law provision that says it's a crime to to lie the FBI is the one that says it's a crime\nTo lie to the Senate as their ... with their investigative it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not they've been kind of pretending there's that that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies\nOf what the FBI guys to say that this is somehow it's going to be a separate different thing what they're really doing here is there going down the same list to people\nSenate Judiciary committee has already talks to they're getting the same statements in some cases they might get exactly the same thing because the FBI can't ... can't force them to talk to them\nEspecially if all you know as I don't remember that I wasn't there they they could be dealing with taking the same exact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individuals could that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because the nature of this old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything new to hear that there there's my prediction\nTurned it around the IRA and that they don't have any other thing\nThey've already moved on against the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know that's the one we're even the New York times that said they attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a link a one to corroborate a story and then saying the mist Ramirez\nContacted a former yo classmates asking them if they were called the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr Kavanaugh was the one who exposed themselves which at that point tells me you know what are they investigating\nHere if she's asking other ... she's telling other people she doesn't know what are they investigated\nThe more shocking thing is even right and it's you know right before\nThis whole um ... most recent face exploded I think it was the morning on of the vote she actually her lawyer with telling people she's not even still share it with him she said why did he was in the room\n[laughter] I'm positive he adjusted his hands whatever that means that so but I but I Can't say for certain it hit it and so it's even after talking to her lawyers for six days to kind of work up\nA her memory that she didn't have when she initially talked to the to the New York New York or could they also said she couldn't say for sure he was there when they initially talked to her I I I'm I'm impressed there even county decided to cut about ... you know what go for the FBI could talk to her\nUm they'll they'll get their statement and I think if you look at the people out there\nThan I really don't make any kind of holding hands and they don't make any recommendations they'll just going to give very hand over the information\nThat's it the the three ... and and maybe we'll get those thrilled to we've been waiting for thrilled to forever as it relates to Bruce or and and Christopher Steele and and what was said and those conversations are Carrie Severino is where those chief counsel policy director\nJudicial Crisis network thank you for being with us carry we appreciate your time

standard between a victim's from Clinton President Clinton and then how Hillary accused ridiculed all her all the\nAll the people that she abused and then you got a few thousand up where there's plenty of evidence and accusations against him well there was no best occasion but\nIt's basically the double standards\nIf they hear you're raising a great point if they cared about the issue they would be demanding FBI investigations we can go back now to Juanita ... and we can certainly go back to Keith Ellison where there's Dr reports and\nText messages and audiotape maybe even a videotape of him\nYou know being emotionally abusive physically abusive towards his ex girlfriend so yeah I think that would be a consistent opposition for them to take but they never ever going to do that are they\nPretty much it promotes the Democrat agenda\nWell that's it I mean that's what it all comes down to politics alright Christian good call we appreciate it All right let's go to Don is an Iowa Don

giving me this microphone\n[laughter] I'm basically all I wanted to say is is the obvious\nThis of this whole case is that um Ford is perfectly willing to do a judge Kavanaugh\nWhat she has accused him of doing it to her assaulting him on a daily basis with this fall state in the first and and just so much fake uh evidence everywhere\nListen she she identified and there's a there's a part of me that really sympathizes with this is such a serious issue in and I don't think we give the Republicans enough credit for how they've handled this including the president they handled it with the proper seriousness the topic deserves\nShe gave the names of four people and none of the pork in corroborate her story including the guy that was supposed to be an eye witness to it\nAt that point they were really you can't go any further with it and he adamantly denies it so it's um it's a matter of just simple okay if somebody corroborated ... we'd be in a very different position today I got

[laughter]\nAnd now for you Democrats\nAnd I guess I'm including you to the media right I consider you what part of the Democratic party\nBut for you for the Democrats to be\nTalking about we want more time to the FBI if you wanted more time for the FBI why didn't Dianne Feinstein bring this up I I really believe that he was very strong on the fact that he\nAnd so I don't know where they'd be big discrepancy yes go ahead please can you found you know what really ... and I said hey where you've had enough\nAlready twenty five now to the top of the hour we're in our nation's capital the sewer the swamp Washington DC toll free our telephone number is eight hundred nine four one showing if you want to be a part of the program a obviously a lot happening here this week thirty six days until the all important midterm elections\nAre my friend and colleague from the Fox news channel is with us Tucker Carlson got a brand new book out by the way it's called ship of fools how was selfish ruling class is bringing America to the brink of revolution\nUm are we really getting to the brink of a revolution and in this sense I mean look it's only happened three times in the last hundred years where a party wins the White House power in the White House and they don't have losses in the next midterm election year the last time was right after nine eleven two thousand and one George Bush was president\nUm but I got to imagine people are pretty pissed off at the at is what's you know it was two weeks ago yesterday and nobody had heard one bad thing about Brecht capital\nUntil two weeks ago yesterday and look where we are getting Tucker will go to the show\nThanks Sean well yeah I mean look\nCap now is being destroyed not because if anything he did or didn't do that because he's in the way of the Democrats retaining power it's not personal it's just the party wants what he's about to get and so they're crushing him and his family in order to get it\nAre we moving to a revolution while I don't look at the people in charge look at the Congress look at our media they're pushing conflict in division on us they're pushing racial division endlessly\nThey're pushing gender division they're claiming that the cap not soccer is the reason that women should have men and vice versa yeah I mean they're pushing this unity because this unified country it's easier for them to control\nThat divide and conquer it's the older strategy there it\nWell you don't look I I've I've chronicled this historically over the course of my career and that is it's pretty predictable every two and four years every election cycle Republicans racist sexist I won't give the whole list but is that they want to throw granting over the cliff\nAnd now with Supreme Court justices or if they have an opening there seems to be no\nThere it's there there's nothing they won't say or do now I mean you have friends of the attorney for professor cats\nYou know Dianne Feinstein recommended who herself is pretty radical left\nNow soliciting people from the Georgetown Prep community whatever that is and asking if if they have information or they want to come forward their soliciting people\nAnd the FBI now is being told by Democrats well it's got to be white in scope and it's got to go on for as long as need be which is the opposite of the so called agreement\nBetween a senator Coons in the center of ... like last week\nExactly I mean Republicans bless their hearts are so literal that they fall for this stuff every single time and they feel that they have to\nDebate the details of this or that taste one actually has nothing to do with the details with justice itself this is a tactic designed to hold onto power when\nRon centrists and Andrew Gillum got the nomination for governor in Florida My very first thought was the census is going to be erased watch this has to be they're going to paint him as one within twenty four hours they\nFlip around some use some harmless phrase next thing you know the lead of every show Ron to San Francisco racist you mean it was going to happen because it had to happen\nBut we bring new facts for why\nEvery night and I see our drop water everywhere kind of explain what this new to really confusing time it's I wrote a book about it that's what the book is how do we get here why did this happen why did Trump got elected ... who didn't get a black to grow up what actually happened and what actually happened was\nThe people in charge made a series of incredibly dumb decisions\nAbout our culture our economy our foreign policy they never said sorry and they never learn anything and so voters got mad at punish them are good for them and why would\nSo that's I that's what I think my job is to explain workers me and I think you know maybe a disagreement but I think that's a valuable thing to do right now\nNo I think the other thing is I'm a believer in strong opinion but at least for honest about it I totally like for instance there'll be days on his radio show we're all we're doing is reporting news same on TV there'll be other days we're doing investigative reporting there were days I'm just giving opinions and taking calls from people that have opinions\nAnd that's what it's all under the umbrella of being a talk show host you know people say well Hannity you even said you're not a journalist no but I Do journalism it's part of what I Do but we don't just do that [noise] um anyway talk\nA little bit weird that all the attention that we get there is like nine people in the media who disagree with the prevailing story line and they need to be crushed her silence\nWhy don't necessarily know what I mean there are less than nine Tucker there is a yeah I Know a handful of us Tucker there's not that many and by the way it is a\nOrchestrated effort in millions of dollars being spent to shut down any anybody that dares\nTo not hold that prevailing left wing view but anyway we're putting it up on Hannity or on the website ... dot com\nThe ship a fool's how selfish ruling class is bringing America to the brink of revolution Tucker Carlson is with us his show every night week nights eight PM ah preceding Hannity on Fox News channel and you're going to be a guest to know one of our pedals tonight we look forward to have a new\nI Can't wait thank you Sean\nRight Tucker thank you Hannity dot

FBI investigation they don't want\nAny of these things because it's not the issue with politics the greatest evidence that his politics [noise] anyway appreciate the call of the latest on Brett Kavanaugh it's going to spend\nA lot of time taking your calls final hour the program news roundup information overload our as we continue from Washington Hannity tonight we've got a very important show nine eastern on the Fox news channel quick break right back we'll continue [noise]\nThis is the best of the Sean Hannity show don't forget stay tuned for more right after the latest news right here on this radio station [noise]\n\nI'm Jay foreigners CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender today's fluctuating interest rates can leave you with unexpected higher mortgage payments Quicken Loans we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates so you can buy a home with certainty\nIt's called ... and here's how it works with Rachel you can lock

mortgage origin nation and for the fifth year in a row they've also ranked is highest in the nation for mortgage servicing reached shield another way we can save your money\nI mean that viral moment of Lindsey Graham literally just shook the entire hearing as it relates to judge Kavanaugh and Senator Graham of South Carolina joins us right now he's on the Senate Judiciary committee\nA senator good to talk to you thank you for joining us there's a lot going on Mitch McConnell just earlier said that the FBI report will be finished and we will have a vote on Kavanaugh and uh I assume it's going to happen at some point this week do we have any any timetable idea\nI don't know yet but uh I think that's correct so here with the agreement or with our colleagues and Chris Coons was never part of the agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware Chris but he was never part of the third grade meant what compromise has been reached for Chris Coons he is voting no\nHe's asking for the investigation to continue our around whether or not and he's been honest about it as drinking habits so Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and mystery Maris and the fall and incredibly incredible lead within a week I think the FBI's about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and safe is changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalposts Geoff oh did you sing committee\nWith the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopeful and get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited in scope and now it is an expanded out further we now see the ... ah your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii who wants men by the way to sit down and shut up\nYeah which was pretty outrageous statement but anyway a senator Hirono now is saying she wants to nip FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report yeah\nYeah that's where we are so my dad owns a bar\nAnd so a throwing ISIS like a good day in a bar so the bottom line is this whole bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that said the goal was to delay\nA the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace a Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was the three witnesses that Dr Ford named mess for ... isn't there any\nA credible leads within that world of FBI will follow 'em and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay well let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped\nA huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake going to end up voting in this I have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do or they are your colleagues maybe you up some more insight than I Am but\nTo me they're the ones that met privately with Joe Manchin and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but we're going to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but\nIt'd be a fall one vote short you came up with a pretty\nInteresting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh do we legitimize\nThe way he was treated at the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kavanaugh the traditional way of doing business is if they fail one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man it's been abused I'm not given up on him less have an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact most Democrats will know no matter who Donald\nTrump ... they've already against score six\nYeah All right so now what is going to happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and\nWell a smart question Martha\n... is a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee\nI don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are ... force planes are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're warning death vi to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking me a hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party\nThat we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota wants a Heidi Heitkamp the vote no\nI don't agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country and November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to the red state ... state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any oh\nI'm doing it right now uh so you mean you're you're communicating Hannah I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers are beyond that\nI doubt if they're lifting I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary\nThe states couldn't be higher this about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know it's about who would come forward after this debacle is about setting the tone and the standard that will destroy the ...\nAnd eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well and then we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system\nGet off the hook that if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box in about thirty something days thirty five we\nCan find yeah find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee a I have a light salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of the states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is I'm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination is far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota\nThey shouldn't condition sequel housing winter licensing off at the state Senate wants them or thirty thirty initial conditions are solutions may play missiles ... kills it has taken lives destroyed families and ruin childhoods we need to take action immediately the missile field a patient registry active twenty Seventeen we create a patient registry for researchers\nCancer and a or less have a missile researchers needed to we need to find a cure for this devastating disease for more information on this\nBipartisan bill visit I save team dot org that's ice save team dot org they shot at a new show\nOn W O\nMore of the best of the Sean Hannity show coming up\nYour own editor use broadcasting now on over five on radio stations around the world to know shown nasty\n... says she became aware of the effort spike has an a and his friend mark judge spike pine shed parties in our interview she said she saw them near the punch but did not specifically say she saw either man's spike in Beijing\nThe Brett Kavanaugh [noise] you know fighting a punch putting Brian Hi fi I saw him getting rent fellow cops clashing girls during that time frame I saw him around the punch bowl or the bunch campaigner is\nI don't know why he in fact I saw him by by their financial remember the party's Taylor remember how I think everybody in the county remembers that\nAnd we have we haven't heard from us friends so I'm asking is are there people alive today I had a party so yeah there are people that you know that they have\nThis morning sweating it provided for names of ... she says went to the parties with her one of them said teachers not recall Julie sweat Nick another friend she named is deceased we've reached out to the other two it hasn't turned back\nRight twenty five now till the top of the hour there's NBC News going forward with\nNothing at all this was was absolute how does this passport news story when on top of everything they even admit there's massive inconsistencies from the statement she released just a week ago you would think she can stay consistent in a week\nAnd the people that she says what corroborate remember she's charging here\nThat there was a ... a systemic\nParty culture where almost every weekend that women girls young girls\nWere being drugged where it's quite ... and and ... forced to be an ... and young boys would then lined up outside the rule waiting to gang rape\nWomen and girls and that does happen thirty six years ago and nobody ever ever ever told a parent told a teacher told law enforcement\nAnd she gives the names just like in the case of professor Ford of individuals that would quote corroborate this story and it's not corroborated just the opposite well this guy is dead and on top of that than we've got oh this one doesn't even know who you are\nHow does this how do you where is the news standard in any capacity here to put this on the air\nByron York is joining us he's been running a lot of columns about there is not the least of which is how high the bar has risen in the goalposts we've come a long way from oh it's going to be very limited in terms of the FBI investigation it's only going to be maximum a week and they'll get the job done and will move forward with a vote\nNow you see that a Camille Harris she's now coming out with another allegation just today\nMyron hey Sean listen on this on this going to be the thing I think everybody's got to be in two minds about it\nA war on on the basis of the lack of governance and\nUh there's no way the story should ever had been reported publicly just shouldn't have bought it was given in part a but due to the news networks um Kramer about Michael I have an anti her lawyer\nSo once it was all out there the fact that if you see that was recorded this problem or a good corrective or at least where you can see what I think where it was a parent to a lot of people are there just was not going to this story\nUm and when she offered a witnesses to corroborate the stories you just played a one had no idea who she was another was deceased and good answer the phone so I'm the story is already out there and has already gone to damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know fledged investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work\nBut if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed that these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that supposedly was an eye witness\nTo the alleged abuse in her case\nWas mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen and then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey
